This is an award under the Research Planning Grant program for women scientists
and engineers. It is a project to study the role of the domestic economy in
economic development in fifteenth-century Tuscany, Italy. Theories of
development raise the question whether family-based agricultural production can
support economic growth, and this study examines the hypothesis that a shift to
sharecropping (agricultural production based on the domestic economy) was
responsible for subsequent economic decline in Tuscany. Only historical research
can allow us to see the long-term consequences of major socio-economic
decisions, and many areas of the developing world today face choices like those
faced earlier by Tuscany. %%% In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved
by the research, this award will materially assist a promising ymung researcher
to prepare for a larger project, thereby contributing to the strengthening of
the national resource of women scientists and engineers.
