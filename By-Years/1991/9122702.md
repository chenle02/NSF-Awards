This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Haverford College, an undergraduate institution,
acquire a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in research investigations
in the following areas of chemistry: 1. the synthesis of complex organic
molecules 2. the structural environment of metals in proteins 3. solar energy
conversion assemblies that mimic plant photosynthesis Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such
as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
