Abstract 9505823 Rosenberg The University of Maryland will continue their
studies of the high magnetic latitude ionosphere and magnetosphere using
galactic radio noise absorption techniques (riometry). Several years ago, they
developed a new imaging riometer which allows the study of auroral morphology
during daylight and through clouds. These imaging riometers are now being
operated at Iqiluit, Canada; Sondestromfjord, Greenland; and South Pole,
Antarctica. Additionally, they are operating broad beam riometers at Iqaluit,
McMurdo and South Pole as well as auroral photometers at McMurdo and South Pole.
In the next few years they will provide part of the hardware necessary to build
imaging riometers at the British Halley Bay and the Australian Davis stations,
both in Antarctica, thus considerably extending coverage. The riometers work
synergistically with a number of other instruments which are operated at these
sites by other investigators. A major focus of investigations over the next few
years will be the characterization of drifting polar auroral patches and their
relationship to polar cap convection. ***
