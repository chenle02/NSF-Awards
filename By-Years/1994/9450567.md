Abstract 567 Armstrong Idaho Native American Outreach Education This NSF-Idaho
EPSCoR Experimental Systemic Improvement (ESI) initiative targets members of one
of Idaho's educationally disadvantaged minorities--the Native American (NA).
This is a twelve-month science/mathematics/engineering/technology (SMET)
education partnership involving the University of Idaho (UI), the Nez Perce and
Coeur d'Alene tribes, the school and community organizations affiliated with
each tribe, the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), and
North Idaho College (NIC). The project focuses on four basic, systemic changes
to the manner in which SMET instruction is presented, supported and accepted in
small rural communities. Under this initiative, scholastically qualified NA high
school students, plus high science/mathematics teachers, a parent of each
student, and two NA student teachers will participate in an active hands-on
summer of environmental research, education and university experiences at UI.
The environment is a topic of extreme interest to NA tribes in Idaho. NA school
and community professionals will assist in selection of the participants and
will provide team support and mentoring. The summer experience will have a
positive scholastic career influence on the student, provide the teacher with a
research experience and additional classroom skills, encourage supportive
parental participation in the student education process, and provide
extraordinary pre-service experience for the student teacher. The summer
laboratory and instructional period will be followed by SMET-related educational
activities throughout the next academic year. The post-summer team activities,
coordinated by the UI Project Director and supported by the school districts,
AISES and NIC, will include assessments, scholastic guidance/counseling and
professional group activities. Pre-, mid-, and post-summer support and mentoring
will be provided to the teacher-student-parent te am by respected members of
established NA community and professional groups.
