This project will upgrade the General Psychology Laboratory by phasing out the
use of animals and replacing obsolete equipment with a computer- based
laboratory. Thirty-six Apple IIe computers and a Corvus Omninet will be used to
develop an instructional lab to teach 500 students each semester. The purpose of
the lab is to provide hands-on experience with contemporary research projects in
psychology. Psychology majors will be exposed to research projects from a
variety of areas in psychology and will acquire laboratory skills necessary for
more advanced courses. Freshmen who use General Psychology to fulfill their
university science requirement will become acquainted with research projects
using up-to- date methodology and thus obtain a much more adequate introduction
to science and scientific methodologies.
