The College of Engineering and Technology, and the College of Sciences are
jointly developing Bio-Micro/ Nano-Fluidics and Bio-Micro/ Nano-Electro-
Mechanical Systems (MEMS/NEMS) lecture and laboratory courses to educate the
future generation of biologists and engineers together. These course designs
bridge educational gaps between engineers and biologists by integrating both
faculty and students from the two disciplines through comprehensive lecture
courses and intensive hands-on learning experiences. In these courses, students
first learn biology problems and conventional methods of solving them, and then
learn the fundamentals of micro/ nano-fluidics and MEMS/NEMS technologies.
Student teams subsequently implement micro/ nano-fluidics and MEMS/NEMS
techniques in the laboratory to address specific real-world biology problems.
