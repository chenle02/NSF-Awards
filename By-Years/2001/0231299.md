The objective of the project is to design and fabricate a low-speed internal
combustion engine and associated measurement systems for real time visualization
of thermodynamic processes. The prototype engine addresses a significant need in
teaching fundamental thermodynamic processes. It provides means to demonstrate
typically non-intuitive or abstract processes, i.e. the processes associated
with an internal combustion engine. The system is designed to provide maximum
control of input variables with both display and computerized acquisition of all
parameters. This standalone tabletop system provides real-time class
demonstrations to courses such as thermodynamics, and captures the primary
input/output information that characterizes the system. The physical
demonstration system is used by instructors in high school, technical or
university settings.
