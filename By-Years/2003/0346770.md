The Alaska EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Project (Phase II)
will&lt;br/&gt;build capability and capacity in the research areas of
engineering, integrative&lt;br/&gt;physiology, population genetics, and arctic
social sciences. A bioinformatics core&lt;br/&gt;will refine computational tools
associated with the physiology and genetics&lt;br/&gt;research
areas.&lt;br/&gt;Engineering design issues are barriers to development in the
state.&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure and systems for cold regions will involve
research activities with&lt;br/&gt;heat transfer in permafrost soils that
underlie roads, building, and other&lt;br/&gt;structures and are subject to
seasonal melting.&lt;br/&gt;Integrative aspects of environmental physiology will
focus on collaborative&lt;br/&gt;research applying molecular technologies to
physiological problems.&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will study hibernating ground
squirrels and black bears which offer&lt;br/&gt;unique opportunities to explore
the modulation of gene expression to endure&lt;br/&gt;stress
.&lt;br/&gt;Researchers in population genetics of adaptation to arctic and
alpine&lt;br/&gt;environments will use technologies already developed with
EPSCoR assistance&lt;br/&gt;to mine organisms for genes that allow existence in
cold regions.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to faculty hiring and acquisition of
equipment in the research areas, a&lt;br/&gt;number of education and outreach
activities for K-12, undergraduates,&lt;br/&gt;graduates, and faculty will also
be supported in Phase II, including the Alaska&lt;br/&gt;Rural Systemic
Initiative, the GLOBE program for K-12 student and teachers,&lt;br/&gt;Phase 0
SBIR assistance, and Young First Investigator Awards for
faculty.&lt;br/&gt;Institutions participating include the University of Alaska-
Fairbanks (UAF),&lt;br/&gt;University of Alaska-Anchorage (UM), University of
Alaska-Southern (UAS) as&lt;br/&gt;well as K-12 schools.&lt;br/&gt;
