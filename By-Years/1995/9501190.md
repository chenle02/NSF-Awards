9501190 Becker In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project,
Tactilics will refine the concept of the paperless Braille technology tested in
Phase I by preparing hardware, software, and manufacturing designs of single
moving line and multiline machines carefully informed by the input of a focus
group of blind computer users and professionals at various developmental stages,
including the fabrication of engineering models and the preparation of a number
of handmade preproduction units for focus group interactive beta testing. This
Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will enable the blind to
have direct cost effective access to databases, bulletin boards, CD-ROMs, and
other sources of indormation; and it will eliminate the Braille/letterpress
"barriers." Thus the technology has the potential to make an important impact on
computer use by blind people.
