Wave formations are observed in a variety of media ranging from the atmosphere
and the hydrosphere to optical fibers and chains of molecules. Despite the
physical differences in these media, waves tend to generate identifiable
patterns and structures that share common characteristics. Examples of such
formations include wave trains exhibiting rapid oscillations, bump-shaped beams
propagating persistently over long periods of time, and so-called rogue waves,
which are large disturbances of a background state that appear out of nowhere
and disappear just as suddenly. These and other wave phenomena can be modeled by
certain nonlinear differential equations for which detailed analysis is
feasible. This project will develop, extend, and apply mathematical techniques
to study wave formation and propagation in different physical contexts to
extract accurate information about the dynamics of waves, with applications to
fields including hydrodynamics, atmospheric sciences, and optical
telecommunications. Outcomes of such analysis will, for example, further
understanding of the wave patterns surrounding rogue waves. Parts of the project
will serve as vehicles for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers.

This project aims to develop and apply analytical and computational methods from
the theory of integrable systems to study nonlinear wave propagation. These
methods combine tools from complex, asymptotic, and numerical analysis. Part of
the project will investigate new asymptotic regimes in which universal phenomena
in nonlinear wave formation may occur. The research activity includes describing
and classifying the wave patterns generated by a new type of mechanism that
forms large-amplitude rogue waves, applicable to various models, including the
nonlinear Schr√∂dinger (NLS) and the sine-Gordon equations. Other topics
addressed include the time-evolution of initial data that gives rise to spectral
singularities in the NLS equation and the formation of dispersive shockwaves and
their interactions with other structures in the Korteweg-de Vries equation. The
research will contribute to the fields of integrable systems, nonlinear waves,
and special functions.
