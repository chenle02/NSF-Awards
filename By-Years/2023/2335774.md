This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to understand
the key challenges in building a robust, open-source ecosystem for generative
AI. The technological systems that underlie generative AI differ from other
open-source systems and present a unique set of issues. This workshop serves a
niche that is not being fulfilled in either the open-source or academic machine
learning community alone, and will connect researchers and open-source
developers to specifically target core shared challenges. The outcomes of the
workshop will serve as a roadmap to foster open-source AI that is safe and
equitable and can be deployed to increase American economic growth and worker
productivity. Open-source software development contributes to enormous growth in
diverse industries across the world. The goal of this workshop proposal is to
study how to foster a robust open-source ecosystem for generative AI that is
comparable to the general open-source software ecosystem. The technological
systems underlying generative AI present novel and complex issues that make it
non-trivial to adapt current open-source best practices. Successes of generative
AI are also not primarily due to code; they are the product of several factors,
including: carefully coordinated data curation, strategically coordinated
training runs, tuning with large-amounts of human feedback, and rigorous
evaluation on realistic use-cases. The workshop will focus on the following four
themes to define and address the core challenges of open-source generative AI:
model adaptation for a broader range of users; open ecosystems for human
feedback; evaluation of ethical, safe, and accurate systems; and supporting
decentralized AI development. The workshop will strive to identify the
challenges and opportunities in open-source models for AI development that will
serve as a roadmap for the coming years.
