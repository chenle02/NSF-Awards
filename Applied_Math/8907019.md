This project involves the study of computational techniques for the
approximation and control of systems governed by functional integro-differential
equations of neutral type. Such systems arise in the modeling of certain
aeroelastic control problems and include many singular integro-differential
equations. The approach here is based upon a state-space formulation and makes
use of approximation results in functional analytic semigroup theory to analyze
the convergence of particular numerical schemes. The main objectives of this
project are: (1) Select an "appropriate" state-space for singular neutral
functional differential equations (SNFDE) and study the properties of the
infinitesimal generator of the solution semigroup associated with the
homogeneous SNFDE; (2) Develop a general approximation framework for SNFDEs on
the state-space and analyze the convergence properties of semi- discretized
(i.e., averaging projections and various spline schemes) and fully-discretized
numerical schemes for the approximate solutions to the SNFDE; (3) Develop the
duality theory for SNFDEs and discuss control and observation problems. **//
