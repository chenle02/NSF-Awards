This proposed aircraft landing system uses the Global Positioning System (GPS)
in conjunction with special purpose ground equipment to provide a highly
accurate, fully autonomous, portable precision approach and landing system. The
aircraft receiver can also be used to support en-route navigation and non-
precision approaches when out of range of the ground station. Under Phase I, the
GPS precision approach and landing system will be designed to operate in the
extreme Antarctic environment. The proposed precision approach and landing
system will significantly improve safety at NSF facilities in Antarctica. GPS
provides the capability of an "all-weather" landing system that can function
equally well at fixed installations, filed sites, and can even operate on moving
landing sites such as ice drifts without any degradation in performance.
