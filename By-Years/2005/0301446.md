0301446 Jaron Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in regulation of blood
flow and metabolism, however, its transport properties and mechanisms of action
in the microcirculation are not well understood. The general goal of the
proposed research is to use an integrated engineering approach combining
mathematical modeling and in vitro and in vivo experiments to improve our
understanding of the interacting mechanisms between NO, oxygen, carbon dioxide,
hemoglobin, calcium, oxygen free radicals, and thiols in blood and tissue. A
comprehensive state-of-the-art computational model coupled with appropriate
experiments will be used to evaluate and quantify hypothesized mechanisms of NO
transport, evaluate interactions between mechanisms, and to assess the relative
contributions of each. The mathematical model will utilize dynamic mass
transport and fluid mechanics calculations in conjunction with multiple chemical
reactions to simulate production, transport, scavenging, feedback regulation,
and other mechanisms of action of NO and associated chemical species in the
microcirculation and tissue. Experimental studies have been designed to provide
key parameters for mathematical modeling and will be used to test model
validity. Quantitative data obtained from the validated model will be used to
predict parameters that cannot be measured in vivo, analyze the hypotheses and
further the understanding of NO production and transport mechanisms, and shape
future studies.
