9412812 Naaman The main goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for
discussion, primarily among specialist, as to the latest developments, to
identify research needs, and to suggest directions to follow. The following
issues are included in the scope of the workshop: 1) Constitutive modeling of
composite mechanical and fracture properties, 2) aspects of modeling at the
macro, meso, and micro levels, 3) incorporation of the bond stress vs. slip
relationship in analytical models, 4) analysis of cyclic and reversed cyclic
response, 5) improved manufacturing and production processes compatible with
high performance, 6) rational testing and meaningful test standards, 7) the use
in combination with reinforcing bars and prestressing tendons, and 8) the
interrelationships of causes and effects between tailored composite properties
and required performance in structural and non- structural applications.
