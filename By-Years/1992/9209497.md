This study is designed to determine whether interactions between different
types of neurons direct or influence the structural and functional
reorganization that takes place in the nervous system during postembryonic
development. In both vertebrates and invertebrates motor circuits undergo
structural and functional changes after birth or hatching. Cell-cell
interactions, as well as humoral signals, such as steriod hormones, have been
implicated in influencing these postembryonic changes, but the respective
contributions of hormonal signals and cell-cell interactions to neuronal
differentiations in hormonally-sensitive systems have not been well-defined.
This study will utilize an insect in order to examine the influence of cell-cell
interactions at the level of individual neurons during hormonally-controlled
metamorphosis. The study will be centered around a previously identified motor
neuron that is present at both larval and adult stages but undergoes extensive
remodeling of its dendritic processes during memtamorphosis. Dr. Kent's
objectives are to identify the interactions that differentially affect the motor
neuron in specific regions of its dendritic arbor. Surgical manipulations and
the use of mutant phenotypes will help identify the specific classes of neurons
that shape or regulate dendritic growth. Electrophysiological and anatomical
methods will be employed to identify and characterize individual neurons that
influence dendritic morphology of the identified motor neuron. Information
gained by these studies will not only increase our understanding of the relative
contributions of cell-cell interactions and hormonal siganls to dendritic
changes in a hormonally-sensitive system, but will contribute in a broader sense
to an understanding of basic developmental mechanisms.
