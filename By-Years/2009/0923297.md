X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a popular approach that reveals internal
structures of an object based on its shadows from an x-ray source. Filling in
the performance gap between light and electron microscopies, x-ray nano-CT
depicts details as tiny as 50nm ("resolution") and has emerged as a powerful
tool in various applications. However, a major barrier to realizing its full
potential is the inaccuracy encountered when an internal region of interest
(ROI) inside a large object is imaged only with x-rays through that region ("the
interior problem"). Also, nano-CT demands an intensive x-ray beam that may
damage biological samples. To overcome these challenges, contemporary
mathematical and engineering methods will be used in this project to develop the
next-generation nano-CT system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nano-CT system will
accelerate progress in medicine, biology, nanotechnology, materials, and energy.
When combined with our existing micro-CT scanners of 0.5-20Ã¬m resolution, the
resulting multiscale CT facility will quickly become a regional center serving
many users. As the only 50nm resolution CT scanner on the East Coast and the
only CT system with narrow beam targeting and accurate interior reconstruction
capabilities in the world, this instrument will be invaluable to both
institutions and industries in the US. Furthermore, this project will facilitate
nanotechnology teaching and training at Virginia Tech and Wake Forest
University, benefiting undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented
and diverse groups. Finally, this system will be commercialized in collaboration
with the leading nano-CT company Xradia to create job opportunities and maintain
US leadership in this area.
