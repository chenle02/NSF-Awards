This symposium/workshop conference brings together investigators studying
various aspects of spinal cord development and reorganization in vertebrates.
The major focus of workshop is on normal development, but attempts will be made
to relate normal development to events following spinal cord injury in both
adult and developing animals. In recent years significant progress has been made
in our understanding of spinal cord neurons and differentiation, pathway
formation, synaptogenesis and the ontogeny of spinal cord neurons and glia have
all been the subjects of recent investigation. By assembling a group of
investigators who work on different problems in different species and who use a
variety of classical and modern biological approaches, we hope to further our
understanding of normal development and to identify directions for future
research that may lead to recovery of function following spinal cord injury in
humans.
