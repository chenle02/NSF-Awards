The behavior of a normal matrix (e.g., a real symmetric matrix or a complex
Hermitian matrix) is governed by its eigenvalues; that is, the 2-norm of any
analytic function of a normal matrix is just the maximum absolute value of that
function on the spectrum of the matrix. The same holds for normal linear
operators, except that now the spectrum may include more than just the
eigenvalues. This statement does not hold for nonnormal matrices and linear
operators, and there is considerable interest in identifying sets in the complex
plane that can be associated with nonnormal operators to provide the sort of
information that the spectrum provides in the normal case. The goal of this
project is to identify such sets and determine their geometrical properties, to
find efficient ways to compute or approximate these sets, and to apply them to
some interesting problems in applied mathematics.

Eigenvalues explain the asymptotic behavior of many different systems: from
hydrodynamic stability to the behavior of finite difference chemes and iterative
linear system solvers to the Markov chain modeling of probabilistic events.
Eigenvalues do not explain the transient behavior of these systems, however, and
it is this transient behavior that is often most important. In this work we
attempt to provide the tools necessary to understand and predict this transient
behavior. This will lead to better understanding of such diverse phenomena as
transition to turbulence, controllability of mechanical or biological systems,
and cutoff behavior in Markov chains modeling everything from card shuffling to
statistical mechanics.
