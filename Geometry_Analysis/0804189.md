In 1972, Robin Milner created a proof-checking program at Stanford University
called LCF (Logic for Computable Functions). The proof-checking program LCF and
subsequent systems have been under continual development by a dedicated group of
researchers over the past 35 years. These programs have finally reached the
level of maturity that they are capable of checking every logical inference of
complex proofs such as the Four-color theorem by G. Gonthier, the Jordan curve
theorem by the PI, and the Prime number theorem by J. Avigad.

The Kepler Conjecture asserts that the density of a packing of congruent spheres
in three dimensions is never greater than pi/18^1/2, or approximately 0.74048.
This is the oldest problem in discrete geometry and is an important part of
Hilbert's 18th problem. The problem remained unsolved for nearly 400 years until
it was finally cracked in 1998 by S. Ferguson and the PI.

The purpose of the Flyspeck project is to produce a formal proof of the Kepler
conjecture. The research of this proposal will complete the formal proof of the
key parts of the Flyspeck Project. This proposal intends to follow the same
general strategy that was pursued by G. Gonthier in the formalization of the
Four-Color theorem, that is, "to turn almost every mathematical concept into a
data structure or a program." This proposal provides detail about how the
published text of the proof of the Kepler conjecture is to be converted to data
structures or program. Specifically, many intricate proofs can be represented in
terms of a collection of labeled rooted trees. Another part of the proposal
gives details about how to automate the proofs of a collection of problems in
geometry. The Flyspeck project has become a high-profile project in math and
computer science. It has already been the subject of many invited presentations
at international conferences in math, computer science, and philosophy. A number
of graduate students (internationally) have become involved in the project. This
broad participation will continue. The PI's Flyspeck proposal has been described
in a large number of publications with wide circulation, including the Economist
(2005), Science (2005), Nature (2003), and the New York Times. This proposal has
the potential to reshape the way mathematicians approach large-scale computer-
assisted proofs. Formal verification methods in general have the potential to
unprecedented levels of reliability to long and complex mathematical proofs.
This proposal explores novel methods to formalize a highly complex proof.
