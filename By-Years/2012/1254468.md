Objective: The objective of this proposal is to study the nonequilibrium hot
carrier dynamics in graphene, and to explore novel graphene heterostructure
devices for hot carrier optoelectronic applications. The approach is based on
the integration of scanning photocurrent technique with femtosecond time-delay
measurement technique. The proposal also aims to demonstrate a new type of
graphene heterostructure based ultra-broadband infrared photodetector with high
responsivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is
the pioneering of graphene based hot carrier optoelectronics. The femtosecond
scanning photocurrent measurement technique can be applied to other
optoelectronic devices, and the investigation of hot carrier dynamics in
graphene should improve the fundamental understanding of optoelectronic physics
in low dimension. The hot carrier tunneling mediated photoresponse in graphene
heterostructure transistors will also lead to new photodetection mechanism ideal
for mid-far infrared applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
proposed research is highly transformative and will generate a new type of room
temperature broadband infrared detector with unparalleled sensitivity. The
proposal?s strong emphasis on basic science, nanoscale material, and device
physics will enhance science and engineering education at both undergraduate and
graduate level. The proposed outreach activities will also promote the awareness
and interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology for K-12 and undergraduate
students. This program will place emphasis on recruiting students from
underrepresented groups. Knowledge and technologies gain from this research will
be incorporated into undergraduate course revision and the development of a new
graduate course focusing on carbon nanomaterials.
