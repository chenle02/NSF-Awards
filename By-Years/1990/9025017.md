Three topics in constant testability (or C-testability) for homogeneous
structures of combinational and sequential circuits is being investigated.
C-testability methods are being extended into new areas including systems. The
first topic is cell decomposition where an unrestricted, component level fault
model is being analyzed. Questions of dividing a cell into components that can
be tested, and of devising a hierarchal organization for the testing process are
being investigated. Second is C-testability of sequential arrays using checking
and touring methods. Procedures for testing sequential arrays using unique
input-output sequences are being examined. Third is concurrent C-testability for
Built- in-Self-Test (BIST). Structures amenable to array implementation in
combinational and sequential cells are being explored to assess latency time and
hardware overhead.
