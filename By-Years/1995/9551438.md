The department is providing undergraduate chemistry majors with a Scanning
Tunneling Microscope (STM). Students are gaining hands-on experience with a
cutting-edge device capable of picturing surfaces at the atomic level, yet in an
inexpensive package designed for convenience. Senior level chemistry students
are experiencing tangible laboratory illustrations of atomic surfaces, enforcing
ideas of polymeric and metallic bonding, quantum mechanical tunneling, unit
cells and active sites. Such experience prepares students better for careers
requiring knowledge of modern surface science, an area that has received an
explosion of interest over the last ten years. The STM also exposes students to
modern computer-interfaced instrumentation and image processing.
