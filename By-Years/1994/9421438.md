9421438 Schacher During the process of development in the neuromuscular system,
elaborate connections are made that, as maturation proceeds, are decreased in
number and refined. The mechanisms that control the elimination of some
connections, while maintaining others, are only poorly understood. In this
research, a novel method of investigating these mechanisms will be performed.
Cells from both the developing nervous and muscular systems of an invertebrate
will be grown in culture and the levels of a cellular adhesion molecule, thought
to be involved in the elimination of connections, will be modulated. If a
decrease in level of the molecule affects the stability of connections between
neurons and muscle cells, that will provide direct evidence of its involvement
in this process and, further, provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms
that control neuromuscular development.
