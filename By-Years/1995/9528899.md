Kirshner, Robert 95-28899 Dr. Kirshner will continue his program to study
supernovae -- to gather observations of the brightness, color and spectra of
supernovae. The goals are to understand how stars explode, to assess the
supernova contribution to the heavy element abundance of galaxies and to use
supernova explosions as tools for measuring the size and the age of the
universe. ***
