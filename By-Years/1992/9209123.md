The research supported by this proposal will establish a scientific framework
which gives insight into the design of nonlinear actuators. This will be
accomplished through the expansion of nonlinear system theory and the proper
formulation of nonlinear models for electromagnetic actuators, allowing for
their deterministic optimal design. Additional contributions are expected in the
fields of nonlinear system theory and electromechanical interactions. This work
will develop the necessary expansions to nonlinear system theory so that a
linearization and decoupling between performance measures and design parameters
may be achieved for electromagnetic actuators. The design parameters could
include the number of stator and rotor poles, the stator and rotor pole arcs,
the active radius, the axial length, etc. The performance measures could include
the average torque as a function of speed, the torque-ripple, inertia, etc. The
running example to be used throughout this work is the design of the variable-
reluctance motor. This motor has already has nonlinear control techniques
applied to it, and it is a difficult motor to design because of its spatial and
magnetic nonlinearities. The work proposed here is significantly different from
applying linearizing control laws. In this project, the system theory would be
exploited to yield a closed form optimal design. This is a natural extension of
previous modeling work and will directly address important design issues. In
addition, the incorporation of nonlinear system theory represents a departure
from all documented design work and if successful, could completely reorient the
way the design problem is viewed. Further, the design process would benefit from
the discipline the system theory approach would impose on it.
