This grant is being made to cover round trip air fare to Moscow, USSR for six
American Scientists for attending an international workshop on cloud chemistry
organized by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Dr. Rumen Bojkov,
Chief, Environment Division of WMO is convening the workshop with the help of
Dr. Peter Summers. The workshop is co-chaired by V. Mohnen and Professor
Chernikov. All expenses in Moscow will be paid for from funds secured by Prof.
Chernikov. The workshop will be held from September 30 - October 4, 1991. As a
result of these cloud induced processes, the tropospheric oxidation efficiency
and trace gas budgets for many sulfur nitrogen and carbon containing species ar
significantly altered. The workshop will first review the current status of
knowledge of cloud chemistry in order to assess the role clouds play i global
chemical cycling in the atmosphere, in the study of global change and related
concerns and finally to identify future research needs in support of these
programs. A document will be prepared and published detailing the results of our
assessment and outlining future research needs.
