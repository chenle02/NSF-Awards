A combined experimental and numerical study will be carried out to explore the
interaction of dispersed solid particles with gas-phase turbulence in fully
developed channel flow. Particles will be dispersed uniformly at an upstream
location, and quantitative measurements will be with a single component LDA
system. These will be complemented by sheet-illuminated flow visualization. The
computation will be by direct numerical simulation (DNS). Following an earlier
investigation of mixing layers, a particular focus will be on the elucidation of
preferred organized structures both in the fluid phase and the particulate
phase, and the relation between these structures. Such information is essential
for the ultimate construction of models to predict reliably the characteristics
of two-phase flows.
