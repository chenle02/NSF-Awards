With NSF support, Drs. Drake and Curtis have established a Berkeley
Geochronology Center (BGC) at the Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley,
California. The BGC focuses on K-Ar (potassium - argon) dating and can now
produce about 250 conventional 40K Ar39 dates per year and 3000 single-crystal
laser microprobe dates which equal about 500 sample dates a year (several
subsamples from the same sample are routinely dated). Their microprobe is fully
automated and, furthermore, provides the ability to date sub-milligram single
volcanic crystals. This permits discrete age populations in multi-age component
samples to be identified. More than half the laboratories research is focused on
geochronology pertaining to hominid-hominoid (human- great ape) evolution and
associated archaeology and paleontology. With three years of additional support,
the laboratory will work to improve this dating technique to permit more precise
and accurate dates. They will also continue their collaboration with
paleoanthropologists and address a wide range of anthropologically significant
site specific problems. The potassium argon technique, which allows absolute
ages to be derived from volcanic materials has revolutionized the field of human
origins studies because many important sites in Africa, which were previously
undatable, contain multiple volcanic horizons. Fossils can only be correctly
interpreted if put into a chronological framework, and many specimens which were
difficult to use have taken on new importance. Dr. Drake and his colleagues have
been leaders in the development and application of this technique. It is thus
important to support both their laboratory and the specific research goals they
are pursuing.
