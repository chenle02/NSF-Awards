Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a non-degradative technique
used to determine the positions and mutual interactions of atoms in molecules.
Chemistry departments depend on NMR instrumentation for the enhancement of
front-line research in a number of areas of chemistry. This award from the
Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry of
Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis to acquire a 200 MHz NMR
spectrometer. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by this
acquisition include the following: 1) NMR conformational analysis of partially
unsaturated six- membered rings and related hydroaromatic compounds 2) NMR
conformational and structural analysis of diaryl anions 3) Synthesis of
structurally diversified alpha-amino acids 4) Organic synthesis utilizing
multiple-phase media 5) Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies of the
relationships between the molecular structure and electrochemical reactivity of
transition metal complexes
