This research is devoted to aggregation of estimators in nonparametric
regression models. The motivation is twofold. One is the existence of many
different methods of estimation, leading to possibly competing estimators. In
this case one may want to combine the estimators, rather than to select them.
The second one arises in meta-analysis type problems, in which one wishes to
aggregate estimators obtained from different samples. This research proposes a
readily implementable method that addresses these questions, using tools from
the theories of empirical processes, minimax adaptive estimation and
optimization. The proposed procedure yields, via an oracle inequality, minimax
optimal aggregation bounds for the risk of the estimators.

This proposal has immediate applications in seismology and clinical psychology
and, more widely, to any data set that is comprised of curves. The methods
proposed here are used to develop signature curves for events of interest.
Having a signature for a seismic wave allows quick discrimination between
earthquakes and waves produced by man induced explosions. An EEG based signature
for depression will improve accuracy in diagnosing the disease and will permit
nuanced classification of further patients, according to the severity of the
illness. The software that allows these analyzes will be made freely available
on the world wide web, along with a step by step description that will
facilitate its use by researchers from other disciplines.
