9310364 Wakeham Because of the monsoon-driven seasonality of primary production
in the Arabian Sea, the Arabian Sea Process Study affords an opportunity to
follow a variety of biomarker compounds from their point of origin in the photic
zone to their eventual burial and preservation in seafloor sediments. In this
project, the principal investigators will sample and characterize some 100
different particulate biochemical compounds -- lipids, pigments, amino acids,
and carbohydrates -- at their point of origin in the surface ocean, through
transformation in deeper water as they settle in deeper water as they settle in
particulate form to the seafloor, and in surficial and subsurface sediments.
Analysis of data collected during and between monsoon events will permit the
investigators to characterize the reactivity and transformations of these
organic substances and to assess their potential for sedimentary preservation as
marine paleoenvironmental indicators. ***
