The primary objective of this research is to gather DNA sequence information
from modern and ancient Hawaiians that will help anthropologists model the
growth of Hawaiian populations, calculate lineage extinction rates, and
understand migration, dispersal, and replacement in a well-documented cultural
context. Genealogies for modern donors reconstructed from mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) will be compared for accuracy to those constructed with vital statistics
and census information stored in the Cancer Center registry for the State of
Hawaii. Data from modern and ancient samples will be combined to produce a
mitochondrial tree for Hawaiian maternal lineages, and mtDNA sequences from
Hawaiians will then be compared with those obtained from other areas of the
world. This information will complement data on population relacement in the
Pacific gathered by linguists, physical anthropologists, archaeologists,
historians, epidemiologists, and previous geneticists limited to indirect
studies of the genome using protein polymorphisms. The proposal represents an
effort to integrate information about modern and ancient Hawaiian populations
within the context of an historical experiment that resulted in the near
extinction of one complete culture on contact with a dominant economic and
technological force.
