This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the computational studies
of Professor Bachrach at Northern Illinois University. The studies focus on (a)
the pericyclic chemistry of thiones and thioaldehydes and (b) nucleophilic
substitutions at phosphor and sulfur. The calculations will concentrate on the
phospha- and thia-Claisen rearrangements, Diels-Alder reactions involving the CS
double bond, the dimerization of thiaketenes, and the addition-elimination
mechanism of the nucleophilic substitution at sulfur. Ab initio quantum
mechanical methods at high theoretical levels will be employed to determine
reaction energies, structures, and electron densities. In this computational
project Dr. Bachrach will extend the theory of reaction mechanism from carbon to
the heteroatoms phosphor and sulfur by an examination of pericyclic and
nucleophilic substitutions. The various components of these fundamental studies
will be valuable compliments to gas phase and solution work and thereby are of
interest to a broad chemical audience.
