This grant provides funding for a planning visit to initiate a new international
collaboration with geotechnical engineering researchers at the University of
Canterbury and the University of Auckland in New Zealand. This collaboration
will focus on the integration of remote sensing measurements of liquefaction
deformation and available geotechnical field data from the 2010/2011 New Zealand
earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning visit will involve interactions
with Professors Misko Cubrinovski and Brendon Bradley at the University of
Canterbury, and Professor Michael Pender and Dr. Liam Wotherspoon at the
University of Auckland.
