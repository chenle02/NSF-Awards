The goal of the proposal is to investigate various problems in Geometric
Analysis with the theory of Sobolev spaces as a main tool. As the theory of
Sobolev spaces has an impressive range of applications, the proposal does not
focus on a narrow problematics but rather, it addresses a number of problems
from a broader range of areas in Geometric Analysis. That includes study of: (1)
boundedness of maximal functions in Sobolev spaces; (2) Sobolev extension
domains; (3) interplay between isoperimetric inequality, Sobolev inequality and
the truncation method in the vectorial case related to Korn's inequality and the
Sobolev inequality of Strauss; (4) geometric properties of Sobolev mappings
between domains in the Euclidean space (this research is related to problems in
nonlinear elasticity); (5) bi-Lipschitz embeddings of metric spaces; (6)
Lipschitz approximation of Sobolev mappings between manifolds, polyhedra and
metric spaces with connections to the topology of spaces. (7) degree theory of
mappings in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces in the case in which the target space is a
rational homology sphere; (8) the Hardy space regularity of Jacobians of
mappings between manifolds with applications to the regularity questions in the
calculus of variations.

Theory of Sobolev spaces was one of the greatest discoveries in the XXth century
mathematics. This theory is the most important single tool in studying nonlinear
partial differential equations, both in its theoretical aspects and numerical
implementation. Although the theory of Sobolev spaces has been created in the
late thirties,in recent years, there have been major breakthroughs in the
theory, by expanding the applications to new areas of pure mathematics like
analysis on metric spaces, geometric group theory or algebraic topology as well
as to areas in applied mathematics, like for example to non-convex calculus of
variations. The aim of the proposal is to continue this investigation in its
various aspects. The PI has intention to advise PhD students on problems closely
related to the proposal.
