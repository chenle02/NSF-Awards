The project will develop a bank of mathematics and science assessment items and
related tools aligned with state and national content standards that will be
available to test developers, curriculum developers, researchers, teachers,
teacher educators, parents and students. Building on the work of a previous
grant that developed a process for analyzing assessment items related to
national standards, this work will develop items that are not aligned to any
particular materials development project, but focus instead on major ideas and
themes in the standards' documents. Specific tools will include a bank of about
300 test items, 16 assessment maps (10 in science, 6 in mathematics) and the
inclusion of materials that target students with English as a second language.
