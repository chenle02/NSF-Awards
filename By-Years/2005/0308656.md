EAR-0308656&lt;br/&gt;Ruiz&lt;br/&gt;The Witwatersrand Archean basin has been at
the center of Earth-system debates ranging from the oxygen content of the
Archean atmosphere to the flux of gold from the mantle. At the heart of these
debates is the question of whether sulfide, gold and uranium minerals were
introduced into the basin as detrital grains of sedimentary origin or
precipitates from hydrothermal fluids. Our recent Re-Os dating study produced
convincing isochrons indicating a ca. 3.01 Ga old age. This age requires a
detrital origin since the grains are older than the basin, and may support a
very reduced--oxygen poor--atmosphere during the Archean. The work, however, is
considered controversial due to the limited number of samples studied. This
award will expand the set of analyses to more completely characterize gold and
sulfide mineralization and answer questions such as the relationship of gold
extraction to consolidation of the Kaapvaal craton and the mantle gold flux.
Broader impacts include education of a graduate student and international
collaboration with the private sector. Placer Dome and Anglogold corporations
will provide access, logistic, and some scientific support.
