This Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) grant provides funding for the development
of a computational platform that will enable the synthesis of heterogeneous
hierarchical nanomaterials in a prescribed and efficient manner. Such materials
will be formed using block copolymer self-assembly on graphoepitaxial templates,
a process known as templated self-assembly. The developed numerical tool will
solve the inverse problem for the self-assembly process in which the input is
the final nanoscale pattern (the target), and the output is the optimal template
configuration that will yield such pattern given a set of constraints. The
developed inverse self-assembly algorithm will be implemented in advanced
parallel computational architectures such as graphic processing units. The
algorithm will be tested in three different cases: periodic patterns with non-
trivial symmetries, precise arrangement of nanoparticles in block copolymer
matrices, and the interconnection of patterns with different symmetries.
Experiments for each of the aforementioned cases will be performed to validate
the computational results. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research
will lead to novel algorithms in solving the inverse self-assembly problem that
in turn will lead to advances in the manufacturing of heterogeneous nanoscale
materials. The primary goal of this project is to develop a toolkit that will
determine the optimal templates for a given target pattern. Solving such problem
on the computer in a directed and optimal fashion will reduce the costs and time
to empirically construct the templates used in templated self-assembly. This has
the potential to reduce the overall costs of nanomanufacturing by accelerating
the processes and increasing the fidelity of the patterns for lithographic
applications such as those needed in the semiconductor industry.
