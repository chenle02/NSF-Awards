In order to add new experiments across the upper-division Physical Chemistry
laboratory curriculum, the university is purchasing thermal analysis and size-
exclusion chromatography instrumentation. This equipment has a wide range of
instructional uses, both as a cornerstone to a series of characterization
experiments in the newly developed Introduction to Polymer Science course and as
a part of the Biophysical and Physical Chemistry laboratories. Several
experiments that use differential scanning calorimetry and size-exclusion
chromatography as primary tools are being used to integrate the equipment into
the upper-division undergraduate laboratories. These experiments include an
examination of the thermal behavior in polyethylene, two high-performance
composite materials (polyetheretherketone and a polyester of similar chemical
nature), agarose gel, and the binary napthalene-diphenylamine systems, as well
as an analysis of molecular weight concepts in the polystyrene,
polymethylmethacrylate, and cellulose polymers. Adding these experiments can
improve the university's undergraduate laboratory curriculum in terms of
modernization and interdisciplinary focus.
