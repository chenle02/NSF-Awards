9604629 Comer Most movements are oriented toward or away from specific objects
in the environment. This project investigates how cells in the nervous system
transform sensory signals entering the brain into coded commands that direct an
organism's goal directed movements. The project accomplishes this by mapping the
neural circuits connecting sensory systems to the command neurons controlling
limb movement, by recording the responses of these command neurons to different
types of sensory stimulation, and by selectively stimulating or blocking the
activity of command neurons in the circuitry controlling movement. The results
of these experiments provide information important to understanding how the
nervous system controls goal-directed movement and should also implications for
the design of robotic controllers and human prosthetic devices.
