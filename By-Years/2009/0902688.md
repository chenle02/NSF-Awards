This collaborative project seeks to understand the role of the tropical Pacific
climate in the dynamics of glacial-interglacial cycles. Observationally, the
tropics show significant climate fluctuations related to these cycles, and the
dynamical understanding demands that they play a role in global climate change.
The PIs will undertake a numerical modeling study using a coupled model designed
for the tropical ocean-atmosphere that will address two broad questions: 1) how
does the tropical Pacific climate respond to glacial climate forcings, and 2)
what is the resulting impact of these changes on glacial climate? This work will
enhance understanding of tropical dynamics as a critical factor in understanding
regional climate under changing boundary conditions. Funding will support a PhD
student at UC Berkeley.
