The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Marcelo I. Guzman
at the University of Kentucky to investigate important photoinduced and thermal
aging processes of aqueous alpha-ketocarboxylic acids (alpha-KA, e.g., pyruvic,
glyoxylic, and oxomalonic acids) as a mechanism of formation of Humic-like
matter (HULIS). Cyclic thermal and photochemical processing will be used to
mimic nighttime and daytime cycles of HULIS aging that will be monitored with
different instruments in the presence of important electrolytes (e.g., Na+, HN4
+, Cl-, [SO4]2-) and surfactants. He will develop new fundamental understanding
of chemical reaction mechanisms, as outline in a research plan based on direct,
solid experimental evidence. The project will also study the production of
reactive halogen species at the air-water interface. Solutions containing
halides found in sea spray aerosol will be aerosolized and exposed to ozone gas
to simulate the possible reactions of ozone destruction in the lower atmosphere.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is undertaken because of the major
role that marine aerosol plays in climate, visibility and air quality, and it is
essential to understand the chemical reactions occurring in these airborne
particles. This project will advance the scientific community's understanding of
the mechanisms that deplete atmospheric ozone, and produce HULIS with
implications to air quality, climate, and health. The principal investigator
will develop the first atmospheric chemistry research and education program in
the state and involve underrepresented graduate, undergraduate, and K-12
students. Graduate students will gain interdisciplinary knowledge and skills,
and disseminate findings at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed
publications. Professor Guzman will continue his current research and mentoring
relationships with the local Lafayette High School Pre-Engineering Program. The
outreach activities are specifically oriented to training underrepresented
graduate students, and mentoring minority undergraduates pursuing careers in
science. Finally, through collaboration with the Appalachian Center at the
University of Kentucky, the researcher will participate in educational forums
requested by the public that will be videotaped and made available on the
Internet.
