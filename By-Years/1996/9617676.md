&gt;A DETAILED CHEMICAL AND ISOTOPIC INVESTIGATION OF &gt;MESOZOIC ATLANTIC MORB
(NSF OCE96-17676) &gt; &gt; This is a proposal to conduct a detailed chemical
and Sr, Nd and Pb &gt;isotopic investigation of Mesozoic MORB from the central
and North &gt;Atlantic. Basalts from most of these drill sites have not been
investigated in &gt;detail before, and samples from only two drill sites have
any isotopic &gt;data. The objective of the project is to expand our current
investigation &gt;of the effects of global mid-Cretaceous plume magmatism on the
composition &gt;of the oceanic upper mantle. Data for Mesozoic Pacific MORB
suggest that &gt;the Pacific upper mantle underwent rapid and widespread
enrichment in &gt;highly incompatible elements and radiogenic Sr soon after the
initiation of &gt;effusive plateau- and seamount-building volcanism in the mid-
Cretaceous &gt;around 120 Ma. We wish to constrain the magnitude and geographic
extent of &gt;this upper mantle enrichment "pulse", as it will provide critical
&gt;information on the nature of the widespread Cretaceous intraplate
&gt;volcanism, and will allow us to test models relating the origin of the
&gt;volcanic event to interactions at the core-lower mantle or lower &gt;mantle-
upper mantle boundaries. &gt;
