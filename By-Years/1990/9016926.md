This award will support research on the mathematics of disordered systems to be
conducted by Abel Klein of the University of California at Irvine in cooperation
with J. Fernando Perez and Henrique von Dreifus from the University of Sao
Paulo, Brazil. They will investigate phenomena in two types of disordered
systems: quantum spin systems with disorder and random Schrodinger operators.
Quantum spin systems with random parameters have been introduced to study the
effect of impurities in several physical systems. Examples of such systems are
given by quantum X - Y, Heisenberg and Ising models in the presence of a random
transverse field. These models are related to superfluidity and
superconductivity. The study of disordered quantum systems that exhibit zero-
temperature transitions is a new and exciting area of research in Mathematical
Physics. In such models, one has to treat the combined effects of randomness and
quantum fluctuations. Such combination has hardly been studied in the Physics
literature or in Mathematical Physics. Such study is a long range goal of this
research proposal.
