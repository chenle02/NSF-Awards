Conference on Asymptotic and Effective Results in Complex Geometry

Abstract

Abstract:

This conference is devoted to asymptotic and effective results in complex
geometry. Many important problems in complex and algebraic geometry concern the
construction of holomorphic objects such as holomorphic sections of line bundles
or maps between spaces. It often happens that the construction problem
simplifies as the degree of the line bundles or maps increases. A classical
example is the Kodaira embedding theorem, which says that there are enough
sections of a high power of a positive line bundle to embed a Kahler manifold
into projective space. Asymptotic results in general concern the properties of
maps or sections of very high degree, where constructions often simplify.
Effective results ask for the smallest power or degree where a desired effect
takes place, e.g. the smallest power of a line bundle so that sections embed.
Many such results will be surveyed in our conference, with techniques ranging
from partial differential equations to geometric and algebraic methods.

Our conference consists of seven days of lectures, with six to eight lectures a
day. There will be lectures surveying past results and others which present new
results. The topics include complexity of zero-finding algorithms, moduli
spaces, holomorphic maps, ground states of superconductors, and the vacuum
selection problem in string theory. The lectures will expose the field to
graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty members, as well
as to senior mathematicians. Two graduate students and at least five postdocs
are giving lectures. A significant portion of our funding will go towards paying
travel expenses of graduate students, young mathematicians and members of under-
represented groups.
