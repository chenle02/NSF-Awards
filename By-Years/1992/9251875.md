Microcomputers and software, and equipment to measure respiratory metabolism
enhance investigative, hands-on laboratory experiments in undergraduate
physiology laboratories. Digital recording of physiological responses of human
subjects and animal preparations captured on the computer enable students to
visualize, analyze, and interpret data. Experiments using an open-flow
metabolism system extends student understanding of animal and human energetics
and respiratory metabolism.
