For the past two decades, Stanford has conducted a highly successful summer
workshop that has served as a gathering place for extended research interactions
among economic theorists. The intellectual and physical environment, extended
program format, experienced staff, and support from the University and the
Hoover Institution have combined to make the Stanford program uniquely
successful over many years. The program has traditionally provided an important
forum for younger economists to present and receive comments on their work. For
the summer of 1993, a program with the following three themes is proposed:
Environmental Economics, Financial Institutions and Imperfections, and Epistemic
Foundations of Game Theory. Each topic will be centered on a workshop and will
also include a series of presentations on the same theme. For the subsequent
summers, topics to be concentrated on include: Implementation and Design of
Economic Mechanisms, Applications of Game Theory to Oligopoly, and Discontinuous
Changes Induced by Inflation.
