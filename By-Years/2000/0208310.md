EAR-0208310&lt;br/&gt;Peter E. van Keken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large
amounts of water are carried into the upper mantle by subduction. It is
generally assumed that water is released in near continuous fashion to depths of
at least 150-200 km. However, it is unknown how water is transported from the
slab to the volcanic front. Water in the mantle wedge strongly influences
rheological and seismological properties and has a major impact on subduction
zone thermal structure. The investigators propose to study the influence of
water on mantle wedge dynamics in a collaborative and multi-disciplinary
project. Recent rheological work has made it possible, for the first time, to
quantify the influence of water on creep properties of olivine. The
investigators will systematically study the rheological influence of water, with
particular interest in how the observationally inferred water distribution
influences the balance of subduction forces and the generation of the
cornerflow. The models provide predictions on subduction zone temperature and
composition that allow for critical tests using observational and experimental
constraints from seismology and mineral physics.&lt;br/&gt;
