This award supports a study of Noegene volcanism in Antarctica. The work
addresses two issues: 1) the nature of the underlying tectonic forces shaping
west Antarctica, including the Antarctic Peninsula and the Transantarctic
Mountains, and 2) the nature of subpolar mantle in relation to global mantle
heterogeneities, and the dynamics of mantle convection. The investigation
focuses on the geochemistry (major and trace elements; Strontium, Neodymium,
Lead isotopes) of selected basalts from Balleny, Scott and Peter I Islands, the
Hallett and Melbourne Volcanic Provinces, the Jones Mountains, and Deep Sea
Drilling Sites 274, 323 and 690C. The work will determine the geochemical
signatures for basalts from the various volcanic provinces in order to ascertain
regional relationships and to evaluate hot spot versus rifting scenarios for
these provinces.
