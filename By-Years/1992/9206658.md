The long term goal of this research is to determine the molecular mechanism of
muscular contraction. In this proposal we hope to provide direct evidence for
the "rotating myosin head" hypothesis of Huxley (1969), the widely accepted
working model for the contractile mechanism. Our approach is to correlate the
structural changes of the myosin head (orientation and mobility) with force
production (mechanical cycle) and the utilization of ATP (biochemical cycle). In
order to delineate physical changes taking place during different steps of the
contractile cycle, steady- state equilibria will be perturbed mechanically and
biochemically including "trapping" the cycle at certain steps. The orientation
and mobility of muscle proteins will be measured using electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy (EPR) following the labeling of these proteins with
paramagnetic probes. EPR is uniquely suited for this purpose because it is site-
specific and it is sensitive to static orientation and rotational mobility of
proteins. We have just developed a number of computational methods to extract
the myosin head orientation (rather than the spin probe orientation) from EPR
spectra. This new technology will give a detailed (3 degree resolution) picture
of myosin head reorientation during transitions between the different states in
the contractile cycle. We will be able to distinguish between pivoting and
spinning motions of the myosin head.
