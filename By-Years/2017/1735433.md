This travel grant will fund participants to attend a workshop entitled "Grand
Challenges of Traceability (GCT): The Next Ten Years. The travel support will
give priority to students, underrepresented groups, and those in need of funds
not otherwise available. The purpose of the workshop is to reflect on the past
decade of research on software traceability and to develop a research agenda for
the next decade. The meeting will take place in Kentucky in March of 2017. The
intellectual merit is to advance research and practice in software traceability,
which instruments software development processes with links between software
development artifacts, automatically computing links and empowering software
tools to assist software developers. The broader impacts are to improve the
maintainability and evolvability of software systems and to help build the
community of researchers who address these problems.
