Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to stimulate
interest in engineering and increase retention in engineering programs by
developing a web-based laboratory course that enhances the freshman engineering
experience. In this course, students complete a comprehensive, hands-on project,
in this case a robot, incorporating a broad spectrum of concepts that will be
expanded in detail in subsequent advanced courses. The courseware/laboratory
system design consists of WebLAB, which is web-based courseware with built-in
instrument controls, and the e-LAB instrumentation device, which is a computer-
controlled laboratory instrument box connected between a test circuit wired on a
protoboard and the student's computer. The web-based courseware contains all the
engineering concepts and instructions to successfully build a robot and to
understand all aspects of its operation. The modules contain background
material, tutorials, structured questions, calculations and verifications of
theory, graphing tools, laboratory report preparation through the use of
templates, report questions that require independent and collaborative research,
experiment evaluation and feedback, and integrated assessment tools for
evaluating module effectiveness. Project assessment includes content and
delivery evaluation by faculty and students at this institution and at two other
diverse institutions. Results are disseminated by publications and conference
presentations, and courseware is widely available on the internet and easily
adaptable by other engineering and technical institutions.
