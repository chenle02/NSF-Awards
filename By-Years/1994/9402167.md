This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award to investigate
how to exploit disfluencies in spoken language dialog systems and also how to
enhance the ability of computerized dialog systems to handle disfluencies. In
the first task the decision of what parts of the diffluent dialog should be
edited or retained is studied as well as its influence in anticipating the
speakers' planning problems. In the second task the investigation centers on the
systems' ability to utilize multimodal feedback adapted from conversation to
repair misinterpretations arising from disfluencies. Additionally, corpora is
analyzed with the objective of establishing a dialogic evaluation metric for
spoken language systems which incorporates the system's ability to recover from
faults.
