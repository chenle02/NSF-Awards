9623181 Sachdev The primary objective in this grant is to undertake a systematic
theoretical study of the finite temperate properties of quantum spin systems.
The project brings together a wide variety of problems from apparently diverse
systems. For example the cuprate compounds, also known as high Tc
superconductors, at low doping levels manifest complicated interplay between
antiferromagnetic fluctuations and quenched disorder. NMR in Quantum Hall effect
systems shows novel spin correlations. Apart from these principal examples,
there are properties of rare earth intermetallics where the magnetic ground
states are critically influenced by disorder or competing energy scales. Finally
there are anisotropic materials where spin exchange and conduction occur
primarily along one direction. All of this work will be carried out in the
framework of a quantum field theory, derived from a continuum description of the
spins. %%% The storm generated by the discovery of high Tc superconductivity
led, rather early, to the solution of an old problem, that of quantum
antiferromagnets. The PI was responsible for some of the major developments and
is now proposing to extend that work to a variety of other problems,
specifically involving finite temperature effects. The applications are in
lightly doped compounds (which show how magnetism is destroyed by doping) and
their temperature dependent properties. ***
