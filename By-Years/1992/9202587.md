A fundamental investigation of reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy in
conjunction with epitaxial growth will be conducted. In situ measurement of core
loss ionization and electron energy loss fine structure will be performed during
thin film growth by molecular beam epitaxy. These measurements will enable
investigation of surface dynamical phenomena during growth, such as surface
segregation and relaxation of local order in films at the monolayer level. Of
particular interest are the relation etween cation-anion flux ration, surface
composition and surface reconstruction for group III-V semiconductor surfaces,
and relaxation of local order at group IV(e.g., Si, Ge, Sn) alloy surfaces.
Development of a data-parallel ultrahigh vacuum spectrometer will enable
increases in data acquisition speed by approximatel;y 2-3 orders of magnitude.
%%% This research will investigate a new method for compositional and stuctural
analysis of thin films during the actual growth process. Potential benefits
include the ability to achieve atomic level control over thin film composition,
and semiconductor materials with novel properties and performance for use in
advanced electronic and photonic devices and integrated circuits.
