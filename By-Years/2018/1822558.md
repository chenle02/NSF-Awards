This grant provides travel support for 15-20 US-based students to attend Crypto
2018 - the annual International Cryptology Conference - sponsored by IACR
(International Association of Cryptologic Research) in cooperation with the
Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Since the first conference in 1981, Crypto has been held in Santa Barbara,
California, and has become the flagship conference in cryptology, attracting
researchers from all over the world. The scope of the work discussed and
presented at the conference ranges from the theoretical foundation of cryptology
to applications and the implementation of cryptographic schemes.

The funding will provide students who otherwise would not be able to attend the
conference with the opportunity to discuss current research topics with world-
class researchers in cryptography, and establish networks, connections, and
mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their careers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
