This research, supported by the National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will study indices of elliptic operators on non-compact manifolds. The
information is encoded in various homologies which are invariants of the large
scale structure of the manifold. Singular spaces will be studied by viewing them
as a collection of non-compact manifolds glued according to their large scale
structure. The National Science Foundation Young Investigator awardrecognizes
outstanding young faculty. This award recognizes the recipient's strong
potential for continued professional growth as a research mathematician and for
significant development as a teacher and academic leader.
