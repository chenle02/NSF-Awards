Industrial computer-aided design and manufacturing packages live in the three-
dimensional arena and it is assumed that solid objects are homogeneous and
isotropic. These underlying assumptions are becoming invalid with the recent
developments of new materials such as composite, and emerging manufacturing
technologies such as plasma spray. Moreover, engineers are starting to integrate
materials in the process of inhomogeneous structure design. A high-dimensional
paradigm in geometric design will be developed to capture, visualize and assist
in the design and manufacturing of inhomogeneous structures. Specific emphasis
will be placed on scientific foundations for high-dimensional geometric
representation and manufacturing integration.
