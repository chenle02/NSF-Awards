The award is to support a planning workshop to develop a science plan for
studies of the physical and biogeochemical interactions of Arctic Ocean shelves.
The Shelf Basin Interactions initiative to be developed by the workshop
participants will identify a research program that may be conducted to address
the question of the fate of organically derived material from the shelf that is
transported to the deep basin in response to global change. The fate of the
organic material must be determined in order to improve models for estimating
the volume of carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere during global warming.
At present, the carbon exchange from shelf to basin is largely unknown in the
Arctic Ocean and must be investigated if accurate estimates of the impact of
global change on the climatically sensitive Arctic region is to be determined.
The workshop will produce a science plan for conducting a research program.
