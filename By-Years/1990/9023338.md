The purpose of this research is to analyze decision-making by high level plant
managers and economic administrators and bureaucrats in the Soviet Union. Three
sources of information will be utilized for this analysis-- a structured survey
of 582 high-level government officials responsible for economic matters, 120 in-
depth interviews with high level administrators, and a survey of 1500 Soviet
enterprise managers. The investigator will use this survey data to study the
resource allocation practices of the Soviet economic bureaucracy, bureaucratic
procedures, and changes in these practices wrought by Soviet economic reform.
This research is extremely important for the development of empirical knowledge
about the Soviet economy. Evidence of high level Soviet managerial perceptions
of their role in the Soviet economic system and the functioning of that system
will provide a basis for evaluating existing theories and models. Moreover,
evidence of their perceptions of the changes under Perestroika will add to the
empirical base for the analysis of Perestroika.
