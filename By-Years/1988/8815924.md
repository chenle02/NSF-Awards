This research will investigate material instability and strain localization,
with emphasis on the mechanical behavior of materials that can be cold drawn.
The work will attempt to extend to viscoelastic materials a recently developed
theory of neck formation and cold drawing for elastic materials. Problems to be
considered include formulation of constitutive relations for ferromagnetic
materials showing rate-independent hysteresis and mathematical problems for
liquid crystals.
