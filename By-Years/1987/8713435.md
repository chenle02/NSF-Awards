Physical properties of soils are required in analyzing a variety of engineering
problems. Properties measured in the laboratory differ from real field
properties because samples are disturbed when removed from the ground. Testing
the soil in place in the field is expensive and time-consuming. This research is
directed toward developing a much more rapid technique, than presently exists,
for insertion of a testing device, called a pressuremeter, in the ground, thus
leading
