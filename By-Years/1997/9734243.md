This project explores the use of physically secure coprocessors and
cryptographic techniques to solve the remote execution problem. This is
exemplified by issues arising from mobile code, e.g., active network capsules
and mobile software agents that autonomously move among servers. The primary
focus of this project is on mobile agent systems. Remote execution exemplifies
mutual distrust: not only must the servers be protected from potentially
malicious agents, but agents must also be protected from potentially malicious
servers. This latter agent security problem is much harder, since without a
trusted computing base at the serve (1) the agents have no guarantee that they
will actually run at all once they arrive there, and (2) agents cannot keep any
secrets (e.g., cryptographic keys) from the server. The objective of this work
is to resolve the agent security problem and explore the security engineering
issues involved in building a mobile agent system. To achieve protection from
hostile servers, this project will explore using secure coprocessors to provide
a secure execution environment, a "sanctuary", within the server. Additionally,
cryptographic techniques such as Perfect Forward Integrity and other new schemes
will be developed to enhance the security of agents when no sanctuary servers
are available.
