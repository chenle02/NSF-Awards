9318318 Church Pilot experiments will be performed that will lead the way toward
developing polonium and its species as an important marine tracer. These
experiments include: (1) defining the volatile species of polonium in laboratory
cultures, such as those that are prolific sulfur gas producers, focusing on
potential alkylated species, and (2) describing polonium distribution and
speciation in productive coastal (salt marshes), (shelf break), and open (for
North Atlantic) surface waters, where it is known to be seasonally in excess,
and fractionated in biological systems and resulting sedimentary organic
material. These experiments will build on existing evidence gathered under a
previous NSF sulfur grant. The significance of the experiments should lead the
way to future development of polonium as a powerful tracer of carbon cycles in
the upper ocean, air-sea exchange of carbon and sulfur based biogases, and
carbon fluxes to underlying sediments.
