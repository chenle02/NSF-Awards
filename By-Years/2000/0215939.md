The goal of this proposal is to acquire the equipment needed to complete an
interdisciplinary structural dynamics test facility. The requested equipment
consists of a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, a shake table control system, a
spectrum analyzer, and various vibration transducers. This equipment will be
used in conjunction with existing major laboratory equipment which consists of
large capacity horizontal and vertical shake tables, a vibration isolation
table, multiple holographic test systems, and a tension/compression testing
machine. This facility will provide long-term research and training capabilities
to ISU and the state of Idaho by providing a sophisticated structural dynamics
laboratory that will support many areas of research. The research will have wide
application to engineering disciplines ranging from aerospace, civil,
mechanical, environmental, and electrical. Existing research projects that will
use this equipment consist of the development of noise control techniques,
development of optical based small displacement measurement techniques, material
integrity testing, vibration control of building structures and components,
building structure response due to earthquakes and/or explosives, and static and
dynamic soil testing. Other related and unrelated areas of research will be
generated, as the research facility becomes better known by researchers
throughout the state. Researchers from the Idaho National Engineering
and&lt;br/&gt;Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), local and state industry, the
Measurement and Control Engineering Research Center (MCERC), as well as
researchers from multiple colleges at ISU will use and benefit from this
equipment. Furthermore, the laboratory will be used for K-12 student tours and
undergraduate and graduate research. This facility will also significantly
enhance the experimental testing background and training that our students
currently receive in our two graduate programs in Measurement and Control
Engineering and Engineering Structures and Mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;
