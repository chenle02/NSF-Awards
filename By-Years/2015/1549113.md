The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the significant performance improvement
in hospitals, a potential to increase case load, and reduce lag time for
patients to get surgery, and a reduction of associated costs without
compromising on quality of care. This will lead to an overall reduction of
hospital costs, and thus healthcare insurance costs, contributing to the
achievement of goals set forth in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
of 2010. Hospitals have been making large investments recently in upgrading
their Information Technology systems and implementing EHR (electronic health
records) information systems, thereby leading to data collection on an
unprecedented scale. Our project will leverage this massive collection and
enable transformation of hospital processes, thereby leading to generation of
value for the large investments in EHR systems being made. Everyone will be
better off: Patients will have better care at lower costs, Insurers will lower
costs, Hospitals can see lower costs and higher revenue, and last but not the
least, it will reduce cognitive overload on the clinical and non-clinical staff
thereby leading to better patient care and greater job satisfaction.

The proposed project will research methods to improve scheduling of surgeries
in hospitals. The goals include more efficient utilization of expensive
resources such as operating rooms, surgeon and nursing staff time by reducing
operating room idleness, delays and overtime costs. The project will develop:
(i) A number of algorithms for advance scheduling, online scheduling, and real-
time scheduling; (ii) Predictors that will combine surgeon estimates and data
via online learning; (iii) A suite of algorithms for deep analytics of fine-
grained EHR data and other hospital information systems, identify bottlenecks
and provide real-time situational awareness; (iv) A visualization tool that will
enable staff to input real-time information, quickly understand schedules and
make manual changes when necessary; (v) A communication tool that will enable
real-time communication between hospital staff, and with the patient and their
families. Some progress on these objectives has already been made and our back-
testing on existing datasets from four hospitals suggests scope for significant
performance gains. A deployment of the system developed for a pilot study is
planned. We will follow up on this project by also investigating scheduling in
the radiology department, out-patient department and cancer infusion and other
clinical centers.
