The 54th Maize Genetics Conference (MGC) will be held at the Pheasant Run
Resort, St. Charles, IL on March 14-17, 2013. This conference assembles
scientists from industry and academia to discuss the latest research
developments on many areas encompassing maize genetics The 2013 conference will
have an outstanding program consisting of four plenary speakers: Michael J.
Scanlon (Cornell University), Julia Bailey-Serres (University of California,
Riverside), Jen Sheen (Harvard Medical School), and James Holland (USDA-
ARS/North Carolina State University). The core program will consist of 35
18-minute oral talks scheduled in the morning sessions and two afternoon poster
sessions with the four plenary talks held in the evening. The 2013 MGC meeting
will have a special drought workshop consisting of oral presentations by
scientists from academia and industry [Marc Cooper (Dupont Pioneer), Roberto
Tuberosa (University of Bologna) and Dan Dyer (Syngenta Seeds) followed by a
panel discussion on future strategies to enhance drought tolerance in this major
cereal crop.

The Maize Genetics Conference is not only an exciting scientific meeting but
provides outstanding opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral
scientists to interact with outstanding scientists within and outside the maize
community. The meeting actively emphasizes and supports the training of students
and postdocs in developing their communication and interpersonal skills. The
conference is unique in that it attempts to support the hotel and meal costs of
all student attendees. Detailed efforts are planned to broaden the participation
of women and members of groups under-represented in the sciences. The funding
provided by NSF will broaden participation and help defray the costs of
participation of students from the U.S. scientific community.
