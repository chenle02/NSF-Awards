9309364 Achucarro Research in theoretical astrophysics will be concerned with
the existence of large scale structures in cosmology. Such structures can be
described by certain solutions of quantum field theory, and this research will
clarify their geometrical properties. The research will be important for a
better understanding of the past and future evolution of the universe. ***
