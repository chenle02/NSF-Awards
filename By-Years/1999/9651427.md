Project funds are being used to purchase pentium-based PCs and Spartan+ for
Windows to equip a chemical computation/molecular visualization facility.
Implementation of this facility enables the university to enhance the
educational opportunities of students, add depth to course instruction, increase
faculty exposure to molecular modeling, and lower instructional costs through
increased availability of the necessary technologies. During the past 4 years
the university has incorporated chemical computation/molecular modeling into the
undergraduate lecture and laboratory curriculum. Three copies of HyperChem run
on 486-based PCs. Last year the university acquired a Silicon Graphics Indigo2
workstation and Spartan software, which completed the development of the program
at the senior/independent study level. This project enables faculty to use this
technology to enrich and enhance the chemical education of all students.
