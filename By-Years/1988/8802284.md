They propose a series of experiments and computer simulations which will help to
clarify the nature of the glass transition and help to elucidate the properties
of the glass state itself. They will use their recently developed specific heat
spectrometer to investigate the shape and temperature dependence of the
distribution of relaxation times that appear above glass transitions. The data
will be interpreted in light of the Kauzmann criterion for where the specific
heat anomaly can occur. Their computer simulations and nonlinear susceptibility
studies are aimed at finding a length scale associated with the glassy
relaxation. They also plan to study the secondary relaxations that occur in
glasses below Tg and the low temperature specific heat of the same glasses to
see if they can be related to one another by some current theories of the glassy
state. They will also measure the x-ray diffraction of Arsenic (II) Selenide to
be used in conjunction with neutron diffraction measurements to determine the
partial structure factors of this glass.
