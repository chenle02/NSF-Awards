Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to collect records of 1870S/1880s
and more limited 8180 from DSDP sites&lt;br/&gt;522 and 574 plus an on-land site
in the Italian Appenines across the late Eocene-&lt;br/&gt;Oligocene boundary to
confirm their preliminary data that show a dip and then a
dramatic&lt;br/&gt;increase in 1870S/I 880s across the boundary. This boundary
also marks the beginning of&lt;br/&gt;the deterioration (cooling) in global
climate after the long Eocene warm period. The cause of this cooling is
presently undetermined and controversial with many possible causes. This
research could help narrow the causes because the Os record will be compared
with 6180 record of ice volume at site 522. In addition, the on-land section
will be used to compare the Os record with an independent He proxy for
interplanetary dust particle (IDP) flux that is capable of lowering global ocean
1170S/I "Os. The new study will establish whether the excursion Of 1170S/1110s
is a global event or not, and will help to narrow the possibilities for its
cause. It will also develop the possible potential of Os isotopes as a proxy for
continental weathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
