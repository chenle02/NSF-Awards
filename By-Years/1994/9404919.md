In this project, an extensible and portable framework for a file system to make
high-level I/O operations feasible is developed and implemented. The project
evaluates the policies and mechanism using both analytical models and
simulations of a variety of parallel architectures. Massively parallel
computations on today's parallel computers are limited by their file systems.
The performance of the file and disk systems can be improved by clever hardware
and software support. I/O performance can be improved by making it possible for
the programmer to specify I/O request at a high level. This is similar to how
the matrix operations in many parallel languages specify the required semantics
of high level operations to compilers, such that the compilers, run-time
systems, operating system and the hardware coordinate the I/O to optimize the
number and the order of accesses to disks, usage of buffers, layout of files on
disks, and so on. These techniques of specifying at higher level can be
generalized to other forms of I/O like the network I/O.
