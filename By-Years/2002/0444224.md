This award renews support for operation of the Protistology Collection of the
American Type Culture Collection. The collection conserves and distributes a
comprehensive range of authenticated protozoa, algae and associated strain data
for use in research and education. The collection presently maintains
approximately 1886 strains of protozoa representing 231 genera and approximately
500 species and, in addition, 222 strains of algae representing 66 genera and
roughly 120 species. Over the last five years, the Collection has provided an
average of 1150 cultures each year at a modest charge to users. The intellectual
merit of this project lies in the characterization of new strains of protists so
that new, as well as existing, well-characterized protest strains are available
to users The broader impact of this project is to expand the holdings of
Protistology Collection in a targeted fashion to provide useful and
scientifically relevant living stocks of protists to qualified users.
