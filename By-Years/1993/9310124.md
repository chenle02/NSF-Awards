The dynamics of hadronic and nuclear systems will be studied, with emphasis on
the connections to the underlying quark-gluon symmetry and dynamics. The
specific areas to be investigated include the behavior of strangeness in extreme
conditions, chiral symmetry as manifested in exchange currents in nuceli, the
dynamics of nucleon-antinucleon annihilation, flavor symmetry properties of
hadron structure as revealed by external current probes, and the astrophysical
applications of neutrino-nucleus reactions.
