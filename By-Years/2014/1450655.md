This award supports travel for US PhD students attending WAFR 2014 held in
Istanbul, Turkey, from August 3 to August 5, 2014. The goal of the workshop is
to highlight the research on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from
both theoretical and practical angles. This gives an opportunity for the
students to interact with senior faculty and get feedback on their work. One of
the most important aspects of WAFR is its informal atmosphere, which allows a
frank exchange of new, previously unpublished ideas; this is a critical
component of graduate student development. In particular, WAFR has been an
occasion for graduate students to meet and interact with more senior researchers
who many times are not accessible to students at other major robotics
conferences. The WAFR 2014 organizing committee will select participants and
recipients of this travel support based on their contribution to the workshop.
This award aims to have a diverse representation of participants in terms of
gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic
location.&lt;br/&gt;
