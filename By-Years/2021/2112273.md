The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to enhance lithium-ion battery safety in electric vehicles (EV).
Battery safety is critical for EVs, and existing monitoring of temperature,
voltage, and current is insufficient. This project advances a new sensor to
improve safety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project will introduce Si CS-FET-based gas sensors as an
advanced safety monitoring modality for EV battery packs. Lithium-ion cells vent
certain gases, indicating potential problems such as overcharging and
overheating. This project will develop and optimize materials and processes for
high-volume manufacturing of Si CS-FET-based gas sensors. Key outcomes will be
Si CS-FETs with high sensitivity and selectivity, low-power operation, and
demonstrated reliability through accelerated lifetime studies. Successful
project completion will also significantly advance the field of battery
monitoring sensors and the broad field of battery
diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
