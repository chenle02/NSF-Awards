The Moab Topology Conference will be held May 30 to June 1, 2012. This will be
the second topology conference held in Moab, Utah. The focus of the conference
will be on geometric and quantum topology. In recent years, these two areas have
experienced increasing overlap, and topological quantum field theory predicts
that many invariants in quantum topology are closely related to geometric
counterparts. For example, the volume conjecture of R. Kashaev, H. Murakami, and
J. Murakami asserts that the volume of a hyperbolic knot is determined by
asymptotics of colored Jones polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference
will further advance the development of these subjects, as follows. First, it
will provide opportunities for those conducting cutting-edge research in both
fields to present their results. Second, to provide background and training,
excellent expositors in the two areas will offer introductory talks. And third,
the conference will provide a venue for discussion and collaboration among
established researchers and junior mathematicians in both fields. Participants
will include many graduate students and early career mathematicians, as well as
mathematicians from underrepresented groups. More information can be found on
