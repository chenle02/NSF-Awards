This project is an effort to use the different roles, half-lives and properties
of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and ribosomal (rRNA) to develop new indices
of recent growth and physiological status of larval Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)
and the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. The concentration of rRNA and selected
mRNAs will be determined using nucleic acid hybridization probes developed for
these species. Larval Atlantic cod (G. morhua) and C finmarchicus will be
cultured under conditions producing widely different growth and development
rates. The relations among mRNA and rRNA levels, feeding conditions, growth and
development will be determined.
