The PI will continue efforts to fabricate a new type of Modulation Doped Field
Effect Transistor (MODFET). Previous studies of MODFET's have concentrated on
layers with a single heterojunction (n-A1GaAs/i- GaAs) or with double
heterojunctions (n-A1GaAs/InGaAs/i-GaAs). In contracts, our device structures
are composed on n-A1GaAs/GaAs( 100 A)/n-A1GaAs or n-A1GaAs/InGaAs( 100
A)/n-A1GaAs double heterojunctions. We have experimentally demonstrated in our
previous effort that the maximum carrier concentration of the electrons in the
channel can be increased by including a second doped A1GaAs layer below a very
thin (100 A) channel region. This increase in electron concentration will lead
to a larger transconductance and a large saturation current density.
