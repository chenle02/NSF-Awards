Graph Neural Networks have proven to be a powerful tool for harnessing graph
data, which is widely used for representing rich relational information in
multiple areas. However, the performance of graph neural networks largely
depends on the amount of labeled data, and thus can be significantly affected by
the label scarcity caused by the expensive and time-consuming annotation
process, which is common among many high-impact applications, such as fraud
detection, agriculture, cancer diagnosis. This project focuses on building high-
performing graph neural networks in the presence of label scarcity. In
particular, the developed techniques advance state-of-the-art by systematically
leveraging weak supervision in the form of relevant source graphs and access to
a labeling oracle with a limited budget. This project generates a suite of new
models, algorithms and theories for constructing high-performing graph neural
networks with weak supervision, and for understanding the benefits of weak
supervision from a theoretical perspective. It advances state-of-the-practice
for graph neural networks by significantly reducing the need for large amount of
labeled data. This project involves students at various levels, especially those
from under-represented groups. The research outcomes from this project will be
disseminated at relevant conferences and journals in computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of two complementary
research thrusts, focusing on the pre-training stage and the fine-tuning stage
of the model construction process for graph neural networks respectively. For
the pre-training stage, given the rich information from relevant source graphs,
this project develops techniques to leverage such information via cross-graph
domain adaptation, in order to obtain effective representation of the target
graph at various granularities; for the fine-tuning stage, given a limited
budget for querying an oracle, this project develops techniques to select the
most informative nodes/edges/subgraphs based on the training dynamics of graph
neural networks, such that this additional label information can maximally
improve the model performance. Furthermore, this project establishes new
theoretical results regarding the benefits of weak supervision, such as the
impact of source graphs on the model generalization performance and the
reduction of the sample complexity due to active learning with graph neural
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
