Collision between India and Asia over the past 40 to 50 million years has
produced the Tibetan plateau, the largest and highest in the world. To the
north, the plateau ends at the southern rim of the Tarim Basin. Across the Tarim
Basin the Tian Shan mountain range also are due to the India-Asia collision, but
how the stresses were transmitted across the basin are unclear. This project
involves structural, magnetostratigraphic, thermochronologic and
sedimentological studies aimed at developing the evolutionary history of the
southern Tian Shan and northern Tibetan Plateau. Results will provide initial
constraints on fault kinematics, cooling histories and magnitude and rate of
shortening along the southern rim of the Tian Shan and the Plateau.
