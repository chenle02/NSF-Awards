The Principal Investigator (PI) will develop what he calls the very high speed
internet (VHSI) abstraction to support guaranteed levels of performance for a
variety of applications and to cope with the increasing diversity of underlying
networks with rapidly growing user population and needs. The research agenda
includes: Congram-Oriented Internet Protocol Design and specification of the
congram-oriented protocol. This protocol version will be especially designed to
allow research and experimentation with different resource management algorithms
and congram mechanisms of VHSI. Experimentation with user congrams and
"perpetual" internet congrams for a given set of congram sources. Prototype
implementation of the congram-oriented internet protocol in the Unix kernel on a
workstation. Resource Management Specification of resource management algorithms
for connection less LANs. Simulation of LAN access protocols and point-to-point
WAN protocols using a high-level simulation package. Simulation of resource
server functions to perform congram resource allocation, usage monitoring and
enforcement. Design of mechanisms to allow WAN gateways to monitor the resource
availability of information inside the subnetwork and maintain consistent
resource availability information among other gateways on the subnetwork.High-
speed Gateway Architecture High-level design of a two port ATM-FDDI gateway,
sufficient to demonstrate feasibility of ideas central to VHSI gateway
architecture.
