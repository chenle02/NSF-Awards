Old stellar populations in galaxies will be studied and used as cosmological
probes. The work falls logically into two areas: the study of old stellar
populations and integrated spectra per se and the use of old stellar
populations, specifically elliptical (E) and spherical (SO) galaxies, as tracers
of irregularities in the local Hubble expansion of the universe. In the latter
work, a project using E galaxies that has given evidence of a bulk motion at
600-700 km s-1 with respect to the cosmic restframe of a large sphere of
galaxies around us out to 6000 km s-1 in radius will be expanded. This motion of
the galaxies could provide a powerful constraint on cosmological theories and
needs to be tested and probed in every possible way. To this end, a
comprehensive analysis of N-body universe models as a means to illuminate
potential pitfalls in Hubble flow studies of this type will be carried out.
Completely new and independent estimates of the motions of nearby SO galaxies
will be obtained to compare with those of Es. In the area of old stellar
populations, a project will be continued to determine the metallicities and
element abundance ratios in E galaxies and globular clusters. An empirical
calibration of absorption-line features in G dwarf and K giant stars versus
temperature, abundance, and surface gravity will be completed. These results
will be compared to theoretical synthetic spectra, and, when a satisfactory
understanding of stellar spectra is achieved, there will be a synthesizing of
integrated spectra of galaxies. Long-slit spectra of elliptical galaxies will
also be analyzed for radial abundance gradients, and new, high-quality, high-
resolution stellar spectra will be used to explore small composition differences
among globular cluster stars.
