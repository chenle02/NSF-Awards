PI: Jarek Kwapisz, Montana State University DMS-0201600 Torus Maps and Cocyclic
Subshifts

The PI proposes research in two areas: rotation sets for maps of tori and
symbolic dynamics of cocyclic subshifts. The first is motivated by classical
questions about the flow on invariant tori in Hamiltonian systems or systems of
coupled relaxation oscillators and concentrates on maps of a two-torus that are
isotopic to the identity. The rotation set is a compact and convex subset of the
plane that roughly collects all the average winding vectors (frequencies)
exhibited by the orbits of the system. The PI's goal is to establish results on
a priori degeneracy of the rotation set to a single point and to understand the
extent to which the dynamics must then be equivalent to that of the rigid
rotation. The tools involved include the number theory of the rotation set,
hierarchies of dynamical tilings, geometric topology, quasi-conformal estimates,
and renormalization techniques. Cocyclic subshifts are a new class of
algebraically defined dynamical systems obtained as the supports of locally
constant matrix cocycles on the full shift over a finite alphabet. They
generalize sofic systems and play a role in the symbolic dynamics based on the
Conley index similar to the role of subshifts of finite type in the context of
Markov partitions. The PI will study the interplay between the algebra of the
cocycle and the dynamics of its subshift.

Nonlinear oscillatory behavior is typical of many systems encountered in
science and technology. The examples include plasma particles (in magnetic
fields of the sun or plasma containment devices), electrical currents (in
electronics or living tissue), Belousov-Zhabotinsky type chemical reactions,
convection currents (in a heated fluid), and planets of our solar system. Many
realistic models are impossible to solve analytically and may be accurately
followed on a computer only for a limited time. The theory of rotation sets
tries to remedy this problem by studying the fundamental properties of systems
of coupled oscillators in an abstract setting so that qualitative predictions of
the long time behavior can be made for broad classes of models. Symbolic
dynamics deals with infinite sequences of zeros and ones and is motivated by
problems of telecommunication, where routinely data is encoded by such sequences
and the volume is huge enough to justify the idealization to infinite sequences.
Loosely speaking, the main goal is to understand the relation between the
properties of the sequences and the design of the (mathematical or physical)
device generating them. The cocyclic subshifts arise from a new kind of device
capable of matrix multiplication. They generalize the so called subshifts of
finite type, which are generated by finite state automata and are a standard
tool in coding information for magnetic recording. Cocyclic subshifts are also
used to detect chaos in dynamical systems.
