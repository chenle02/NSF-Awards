With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program
supports Richard S. Glass of University of Arizona in a project investigating
the role of organosulfur radical cations in various biologically significant
reactions. The effect of neighboring group participation, by amide and aromatic
groups, in the formation and stabilization of these radical cations will be
studied. Factors that lower the oxidation potential, thereby stabilizing the
resulting sulfur radical cations, and the nature of the bonding in these unique
systems will be assessed. To accomplish these goals a combination of techniques,
including the use of conformationally constrained molecules, electrochemistry,
pulse radiolysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, photoelectron spectroscopy
and theoretical calculations, will be used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies
will involve undergraduate and postdoctoral students as well as collaborations
with researchers at the University of Kansas, the University of Fribourg and the
University of Notre Dame. This project is expected to contribute to an
understanding of long range electron transfer in biology, the chemical basis of
Alzheimer's disease and the mechanism of oxidation of methionine residues in
peptides and proteins.
