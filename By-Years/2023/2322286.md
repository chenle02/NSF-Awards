Field to Satellite 2322286 Crews, Kelley A; University of Texas at Austin

This project investigates the nature of human-environment interactions in semi-
arid systems. These interactions are thought to take shape differently across
changing local variations in landscapes as well as among residential groups
whose land management knowledge and practice may vary with their personal,
family, and social network experience. Lastly, these relationships may be
positively or negatively impacted by factors external to the people and their
lands, such as changes in precipitation, market changes, or political rules.
Understanding how these relationships and impacts function across scales of
observations, spheres of management, and reach of external factors is enriched
by incorporating local resident feedback from the start of the project and
through every stage in this research. Distinguished from the previous case
studies, the research informs where substantial resident/stakeholder input aids
in research and management effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency.

This work extends the theoretical framing of social-ecological systems to focus
more intensively on local to regional contexts in space and time and remote
populations in places where there is lesser infrastructure than urban centers
and where people are ultimately both heavily dependent upon and the stewards for
adjacent lands under communal, private, or protective management. Underlying
this approach are three key questions: 1) how do landscapes respond to external
variabilities among open use versus private use versus conservation management
strategies practiced by residents with varying backgrounds in land use,
extraction, and management; 2) how do family experiences and perceptions impact
their livelihood and land management decisions given those same external
variabilities, specifically, the length of time an extended family has lived in
an area and their individual and collective environmental perception; and 3) if
and how these relationships in questions 1 and 2 are systematically and
predictably related across space and time. These results inform land management
practices to maximize peopleâ€™s livelihoods and environmental management and give
insight into which local and regional factors most matter in promoting family,
food, environmental, and economic security in variable conditions.
