The computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) laboratory provides Engineering
Technology students with a sound education in areas which constitute a major
shaping factor in virtually all branches of industry and business. The equipment
required in the CIM laboratory includes a mini-CIM system, computer equipment,
and statistical process control gauging instrument. This equipment is integrated
with existing robotics facilities to produce a teaching instrument and an
integral part of several courses such as Introduction to Robotics and Computer
Integrated Manufacturing, Industrial Systems Simulation, Statistical Quality
Control, Production Planning, Plant Layout, Materials Handling, Productivity
Measurement and Improvement, and Automation &amp; Computer Integrated
Manufacturing.
