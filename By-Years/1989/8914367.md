This award provides support for production of archival quality copies of the
negatives of a portion of the Field Museum of Natural History's Botanical Type
Photograph Collection. The photographic negatives record the "type specimen" --
the individual plant representing a genus or species that most closely
exemplifies the essential characteristics that taxon. Many of these negatives
are in advanced stages of deterioration, and they need to be copied to state-of-
the-art safety film. Among them are the threatened negatives of the type plant
specimens once held in the Berlin-Dahlem Museum, which was mostly destroyed in
the Allied bombing of Berlin in World War II. The negative collection was
originated in 1929 by American scientist J. Francis Macbride, who traveled to
Europe to photograph type specimens of tropical American plants preserved in
major European herbaria. His goal was to make this information available to
American botanists unable to travel. In many cases, the Berlin negatives are the
only visual remains of the type specimens that were destroyed. These visual
records are often essential in characterizing the described taxon; they provide
information critical to the proper recognition, typification, and understanding
of species in many families. For some species, the only known specimen is
recorded among Field Museum's type photographs. The proposed restoration effort
will allow future generations of botanists to verify the identities of hundreds
of tropical plants, and to study species that have become extinct.
