Number: DMS 9803596 PI: Samad Hedayat Institution: University of Illinois at
Chicago Project: Investigation and Construction of Statistical Designs for
Multifactorial Experiments Abstract: The investigator studies statistical
problems in the area of design and analyses of scientific and industrial
experiments in which the outcomes are influenced by multiple factors and noise.
The goal will be to identify the best factor combinations while minimizing and
measuring the noise. The research effort is mainly concentrated in the
construction of designs capable of investigating location and dispersion
effects, compound orthogonal arrays with high strength, g-designs as core sub-
designs ,and orthogonal arrays of strength t plus. The success of any serious
scientific study depends on the way it is designed and the related data being
collected and analyzed. Noise is the biggest nuisance while the goal is to
relate the outcomes to the levels of the factors influencing the study. This is
true in almost all social, engineering, environmental, and medical studies. It
is costly and indeed unwise to eliminate noise entirely. Indeed in many studies
it will be enough if one knows the source and the intensity of noise. Under the
latter condition it is possible to explore how the surrounding factors are
impacting the outcomes. The investigator explores all these interconnected
topics and identifies new cost- and time-effective and improved statistical
designs capable of handling these highly complicated scientific issues.
