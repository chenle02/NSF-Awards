This project, from Georgia Tech, establishes an I-Corps Site in conjunction with
their Venture Lab. The Site targets faculty, graduate students and post-doc
researchers and collaborates with the I-Corps South Node to deliver
entrepreneurship education to faculty, students and researchers. The Site
provides catalytic funding to thirty research startup teams per year for
customer discovery and minimum viable product (MVP)
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-
funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and
support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the
marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps
Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the
National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In both the near- and long-term, the Georgia
Tech Site's actions of increasing the number of teams participating in the
national I-Corps program and increasing commercialization and the translation of
research will deliver the fundamental intent of the NSF Sites Program and
broaden the impact of commercialization in the region.
