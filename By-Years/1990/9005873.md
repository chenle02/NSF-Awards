This project is concerned with research in commutative algebra. The principal
investigator will determine conditions for an ideal to be in the linkage class
of a complete intersection and will show that certain normal ideals are set-
theoretic complete intersections. The Cohen-Macaulay property of residual
intersections will also be examined. One goal in the study of commutative rings
is to classify ideals having certain properties. Many of these results have
applications to problems in algebraic geometry. An interesting topic is whether
an ideal related by linkage to another ideal shares any of the second ideal's
interesting properties, or to what extent it does so. This latter problem is the
primary concern of this project.
