CTS-9520897 Ritter U of South Carolina Magnetic adsorbent materials will be
evaluated for selective separation of metals from aqueous solutions by applying
a magnetic field. The proposed concept of Magnetic Swing Adsorption (MSA) is
unique because the highly porous adsorbent materials not only provides a
magnetic matrix but also an adsorptive components to the systems. An exploratory
study of a bench scale two-bed MSA process will be conducted. The experimental
setup will allow for the measurement of the applied magnetic field strength as
well as feed, product and exhaust compositions and flow rates. A detailed
parametric study will be performed for the removal of chromium. The efficiency
of metal removal and the overall performance of MSA technique will be evaluated.
Successful implementation of the concept will lead to a new field-enhanced
process for the separation of soluble metal species from aqueous solutions. The
research is relevant to a variety of chemical, manufacturing and environmental
technologies.
