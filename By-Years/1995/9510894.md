The study of the role of fathers in the evolution of the primate family has
been severely hampered by our ignorance of true paternity-offspring
relationships. Crucial assumptions about male reproductive strategies could not
be tested. Using modern molecular techniques, this project will establish
paternities in an already intensively studied wild population of primates that
inhabits natural forest in Sri Lanka. The paternity data, combined with
knowledge of matrilineal kinships, will provide pedigrees for about a half of
the population of 30 social groups (more than 1,000 individuals). Earlier
research on primates point to a variety of traits (morphological and behavioral)
to influence male lifetime reproductive success. These include: social dominance
rank, age, development and growth, group residency, maternal attributes,
paternal care behavior, male transfer coalitions, and environment. The
interrelationships among these factors, and their influence on male lifetime
reproductive success, will be examined by a series of related working
hypotheses. The research results will have broad relevance to current theories
of primate social evolution, including male as well as female life-histories,
parental care and sex allocation.
