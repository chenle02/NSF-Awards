ABSTRACT DMS - 0204671.

The principal investigator plans to continue his work on global problems in
differential geometry and related areas. Special emphasis will be devoted to the
pursuit of global Riemannian geometry via additional structures. This includes
but is not limited to structures arising from the presence of symmetries, and to
structures arising from taking external or internal limits. Our efforts
concerning investigations of relations between curvature, symmetry and topology
is guided by the program set forth by the aim: ``Classify or describe the
structure of manifolds with positive or nonnegative curvature and large isometry
groups". This area is currently experiencing significant advances in various
directions. The project will also include investigations of structures arising
from the collapse of manifolds under a lower curvature bound, and of metric
invariants coming from investigations of the structure of various spaces of
finite metric spaces.

The significance of the main part of the proposal is twofold. On the one hand
there are many geometric situations where no symmetries are present from the
outset, but where symmetries emerge non-trivially from the geometry. Among such
situations are rigidity problems and collapsing problems under bounded
curvature. General results achieved through the work proposed can then be
invoked and help solve the original problem, where no symmetries were present.
This method has already been used successfully. On the other hand, the proposed
work provides a systematic approach for finding new examples of spaces with
positive or nonnegative curvature, arguably one the most central and difficult
issues facing global Riemannian geometry today.
