9320183 WEIKLE This research program will investigate methods for improving the
performance of submillimeter Schottky receivers and reducing the requirement for
high-power THz local oscillator sources through the use of planar, surface-
channel diodes and subharmonic mixing. Schottky diodes operating above 1 THz
will be integrated into quasi-optical structures that permit the use of lower-
frequency, relatively low-power local oscillators. The RF properties of
different diode geometries and integrated planar antennas will also be studied.
This program is expected to result in more reliable Schottky diode receivers
with reduced local oscillator requirements at THz frequencies. This development
will help to open up this important region of the spectrum for millimeter wave
imaging, radar, atmospheric chemistry, and monitoring of atmospheric ozone.
