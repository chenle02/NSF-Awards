Despite the growing scientific and societal impact of human genetics, laboratory
instruction on gene manipulation has not reached very far down the educational
ladder and is mainly confined to upper-level courses for biology majors. The
workshops enable participants to introduce basic DNA manipulation laboratories
in freshman survey courses and therefore stimulate broad DNA literacy and
influence students to select careers in biological science. The workshops
introduce teaching faculty to techniques of genome analysis and their
applications to human genetics. After the 10 day summer workshop, participants
will attend a two day follow-up session the following winter.
