The objectives of this program are (1) to define the requirements for a data
acquisition system to measure environmental loads and effects, and (2) to
interact with researchers and producers of Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits
(VLSI circuits) to design and construct a prototype VLSI circuit to implement
this data acquisition system. The project involves the definition of data
acquisition requirements and input device characteristics for measurement of:
ground shocks using seismic acceleromterers; wind speed and direction using
standard anemometers; as well as the response of buildings using accelerometers
or strain gauges. System requirements will be defined at a national workshop to
discuss full-scale measurement requirements for environmental loads and effects.
