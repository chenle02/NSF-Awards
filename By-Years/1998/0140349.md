&lt;br/&gt;The proposal deals with several topics in low-
dimensional&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. The PI plans to investigate the topological
dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of laminations; in particular he would like to further
develop&lt;br/&gt;the dynamics of growing trees and use it to study the
behavior&lt;br/&gt;of the vertices of the Julia set. He also wants to consider
&lt;br/&gt;classes of non-analytic plane maps for whom analogs of well-
known&lt;br/&gt;results for polynomials can be proven. Other directions of
his&lt;br/&gt;research are related to attractos for classes of rational maps
&lt;br/&gt;and to further developing the rotation theory which studies
&lt;br/&gt;coexistence of cycles depending on their characteristics
similar&lt;br/&gt;to rotation numbers for circle maps of degree one.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of dynamical systems gives tools to study
complex &lt;br/&gt;systems, for example the evolution of a complicated
deterministic&lt;br/&gt;process over time. There is a rich and distinguished
tradition &lt;br/&gt;of using these powerful tools in other sciences like
&lt;br/&gt;communication theory, statistical physics, and chemical kinetics.
