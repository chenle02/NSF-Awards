This project, by one of the leading young investigators of star formation in
early type systems, continues his efforts in that area. Studies of dust and
molecular gas and their relation to star formation will be extended to edge-on
spirals, dwarf galaxies, and M82-like systems. Investigations of dust and
molecular gas in the Milky Way will serve to relate our knowledge of local star
formation to the processes occurring in the more distant systems studied.
