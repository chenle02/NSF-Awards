This award provides funds to the Roswell Park Memorial Institute to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site. The objectives of the program are:
(1) to expose the trainees to an atmosphere of an active research environment;
(2) to continually challenge them to develop an interest in science; (3) to
allow the trainees to witness scientific creativity; and (4) to help them in
planning their academic careers in science. The students fulfill these
objectives by spending 80% of their time in an active research laboratory under
direct supervision of a senior investigator where they are assigned their own
research project to conduct under the direct supervision of their mentor. The
remaining 20% of the time is spent attending lectures and multidisciplinary
seminars in specific areas of biology, chemistry and biophysics conducted at the
Institute. The allocation of time away from the laboratory and in the classroom
is important to broaden the trainees horizons into other areas of science. A
Scientific Mini-conference is held at the conclusion of the program. Students
are required to prepare both an oral and poster presentation for this
conference. Projects will be assigned to trainees in Cellular and Molecular
Biology. The Education Department, with the senior investigators, carefully
match trainees to make sure the college students' interests and the objectives
of the program are fulfilled. A one- to-one relationship between trainee and
senior investigator is sought when the trainee is assigned to an active research
laboratory to do his project work.
