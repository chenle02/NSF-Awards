This award supports the development of practical instruments, using the
concepts of near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), and utilizes these
instruments for nanometrology applications. The project will be carried out in
three phases. In the first phase a near-field scanning optical microscope using
visible illumination will be designed, built, and tested. In the second phase an
instrument that works in the infrared region will be developed. The infrared
instrument will use most of the subsystems that have been previously tested in
the visible domain. The two devices will be characterized in the final phase and
applied to the measurement of selected engineering surfaces.
