This project incorporates modern instrumentation in cellular and molecular
biology in order to upgrade the laboratory components of courses in introductory
biology, research methods in the natural sciences, genetics, cell biology, and
microbiology, and thereby introduce undergraduate students to current research
technologies in molecular biology. This project directly supports a new
research-driven curriculum implemented in the biology department in 1994, which
focuses on hands-on and collaborative problem solving as a way of leaming.
Modernization in the laboratory instruction of the rapidly expanding area of
molecular/cell biology complements and balances recent advances in the
experimentally based study of animal systems (physiology and developmental
biology) attained by the recent implementation of new, modern equipment and
laboratory experiences in these areas. To achieve the interrelated goals of
improvement in the way students leam about molecular biology and their
understanding of concepts and proficiency in the technologies and techniques
required to conduct modern investigative projects addressing questions of gene
expression and regulation and cellular differentiation and metabolism, the
college is implementing new laboratory sessions utilizing DNA techniques
designed specifically for undergraduate laboratory instruction. The inclusion of
basic methodologies such as DNA isolation, restriction enzyme analysis, and gel
electrophoresis of DNA and protein into biology laboratory exercises beginning
with the introductory biology course, a general education requirement for all
students, significantly influences students' education and appreciation of
modern molecular technologies and their impact on society. Biology majors,
through the laboratory component of a series of advanced courses, graduate with
technical proficiency and improved conceptual understanding of recent advances
in the cellular/molecular basis of living systems. *
