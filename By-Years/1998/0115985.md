Abstract for NSF Proposal 0115985 to Dr. John La Duke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
grant has been awarded to Dr. John La Duke at the University of North Dakota to
purchase a Genetic Analyzer. The major function of this instrument is to gather
DNA data and analyze these sequences or fragments. This is a "state-of-the-art"
instrument that will position researchers very positively for the future in the
area of DNA methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four primary researchers
on this project. Their research can be divided into two main areas. Two of these
faculty, Austin and La Duke, are interested in phylogenetic/evolutionary
questions. La Duke is examining the relationships of the species in the plant
family Malvaceae. This family includes cotton and Hibiscus. Austin is interested
in the relationships and distribution patterns of Pacific Island lizards. The
other faculty, Detke and Young, are interested understanding the linkage of DNA
sequences to biochemical pathways. Detke is interested in a protein from the
parasite Leishmania that that may have implications in diseases caused by the
parasite. Young is interested in proteins associated with bacterial cell walls
and associated biosynthetic pathways. Each of the scientists has a history of
training students at all levels and is passionate about
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of this instrument will
significantly enhance the research and training capabilities of the University
of North Dakota. The impact of this instrument on the research programs of the
Principal Investigators is only a small part of the potential impact this will
have on: 1) training of students, 2) additional projects that can now be
conceived, and 3) stimulating collaboration between researchers on the campus. .
As the use and understanding of DNA data has become almost as standard as the
microscope in biology, we believe it is essential for undergraduates to have
training and exposure to the current technology in DNA data-gathering and
analysis. It is expected that graduate students and faculty from both Biology
and the Medical School will develop a closer interaction as a result of sharing
this instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
