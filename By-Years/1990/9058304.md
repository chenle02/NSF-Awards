Principal Investigator proposed to do research in the following areas: 1.
Structural dynamic analysis of pressure vessels (shells) to mechanical
overpressures and intense heat flux loadings, including computer modeling of
cumulative damage of shell walls due to cyclic pressure loadings, 2. Mechanical
and thermal stress analysis of reactor components for fission safety, 3. The
mechanical modeling of x-ray lithography masks.
