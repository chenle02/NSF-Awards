This proposal describes a workshop, "Advanced Techniques for in situ Studies of
Zooplankton abundance, Distribution, and Behavior, "that will be held at Lake
Lacawac, NE Pennsylvania, during May 23-25, 1991. The goals of the workshop are:
(1) to provide a forum for interaction among biologists who are developing new
instruments for studying zooplankton in the field; and (2) to publish a
collection of papers that describe instrument development progress to date. This
proposal describes the workshop, the people who have been invited, and the
relationship of the workshop to other research. Substantial workshop funding has
been provided by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. We request supplementary
funding from NSF to enable key scientists from overseas to attend the workshop
and share their knowledge with U.S. and Canadian scientists.
