General metric spaces, especially graphs, are used to represent networks of
communication, data organization, and computational devices. In order to
analyze, use and store them it is necessary to understand their ?Structure?, in
mathematical language this means to understand their ?Geometry?. For example
this means, to embed them into better structured spaces with a coordinate
system. Banach spaces, are the conceptual framework to accomplish that. A main
focus of this project is finding embeddings of metric spaces, used in Computer
Science, into certain Banach spaces. Examples for such metric spaces are
Lamplighter Graphs, which model the traveling salesman problem, and the
Transportation Cost Metric Space, which models the optimal distribution of
products. On the other hand, from the embeddability, or non-embeddability of
certain metric spaces into a given Banach space, one can deduce important
geometric properties of that Banach space. This award will support the principal
investigator's research on these topics and also contribute to US workforce
development through the training of graduate students.

The first part of the project is concerned with the question whether or not
certain metric spaces, like the Lamplighter space and Transportation Cost space,
can be coarsely, uniform or bi-Lipschitzly embedded in the Banach space of
integrable functions, and estimate the distortion of these embeddings. In the
second part, the investigator seeks to find metric characterizations of several
isomorphic properties of Banach spaces via the embeddabilty, or non
embeddability, of certain metric graphs. The research will concentrate on finite
asymptotic properties with the goal of establishing an asymptotic version of the
in recent years successful Ribe Program on metric characterizations of local
properties. The investigator will also continue his investigation on the metric
interpretations of reflexivity, with the hope of finding metric test spaces
which characterize reflexivity. A central part of studying Banach spaces and
their geometry is the study of (linear and bounded) operators on them. Very
recently it was discovered that for a large class of separable Banach spaces,
the cardinality of closed subideals of the space of operators is the cardinality
of the collection of subsets of the continuum. This is, by simple set theoretic
considerations, the maximal possible. The PI will investigate the closed ideals
of spaces of operators of more classes of Banach spaces.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
