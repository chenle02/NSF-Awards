This project concerns itself with the electrodynamics of waves and their
interactions in magnetized plasmas. The proposed research places emphasis on new
approaches and understanding of nonlinear plasma electrodynamics phenomena
associated with coherent versus chaotic dynamics. This encompasses three
interrelated, major studies: (1) Chaotic dynamics and diffusion; (2) Wave
induced chaos and spatial diffusion; and (3) Space-time chaos from instability.
The major objective of the theoretical work of this project is the modeling and
understanding of the above mentioned phenomena as they relate to new and
potentially significant engineering and scientific applications. These include
plasma heating, modification of transport, and control of instabilities, as for
example in energetic plasmas for coherent electromagnetic sources, in fusion
energy research, in ionospheric and space propagation studies, and in fluid
dynamic flows. Wherever possible and appropriate, relevant and ongoing
experimental work is used to test and evaluate the analytical results. The
proposed work seeks to emphasize the advance in our basic understanding of
plasma electrodynamics that may transcend current experiments and applications.
