Upgrading our Instrumentation to include a new state-of-the-art quadrupole mass
spectrometer equipped with modern electro- spray ionization will allow us to
meet the needs of these young investigators, thereby expanding our user base
while enhancing their Research productivty and training opportunties. The
capability is currently not available in the West Virginia University system,
and Its acquisition will improve the accessibility of biochemical researchers in
the region to this rapidly emerging technique for biomolecular structure
determination.
