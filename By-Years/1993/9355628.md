9355628 Epstein This project by the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)
develops a public education program on chemistry. The program: introduces
students and the general public to the science of chemistry and processes of
chemistry-related research through drop-in lab activities; provides follow-up
chemistry activities for use by elementary teachers and parents so that children
can further explore the interests they have developed in science and chemistry;
provides opportunities for internships for high-school students as lab
assistants so that they can develop greater knowledge of "everyday" chemistry,
laboratory techniques and safety, develop skills in working with others and in
teaching chemistry, and explore potential careers in teaching chemistry; and
make available the resources developed by OMSI to other interested science
museums. ***
