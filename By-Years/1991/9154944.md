The University of California @ Los Angeles (UCLA) will initiate a seven-week,
commuter, Early Alert Initiative Young Scholars project in Mathematics and
Physics which will offer science enrichment activities for 40 minority
precollege students entering grade 9. This program will emphasize research
participation in analytic and transformational geometry and applications in
physics. The project is for minority students only and includes activities in a
computer mathematics laboratory using LOGO. College advisement, dialogues with
engineering and science professionals, visitations to industry sites and
mentoring relationships will be used to promote the understanding of technical
careers. Sixteen Saturday Academies during the academic year will sustain and
reinforce these summer efforts.
