9451709 Perone The Department of Chemistry is acquiring instrumentation to
effect transformation of the traditional sophomore quantitative analysis into a
course on modern analytical science. We are developing a course where the basic
underlying theme is exposure to concepts, problems, issues, and procedures
contained in a real, operating, modem analytical laboratory. The key to
achieving this is to provide laboratory investigations which expose lower-
division students to the broad range of modern analytical technology. Among the
laboratory investigations crucial to accomplishing this is the commitment to
addressing organic, biological, and environmental studies, instead of the
traditional emphasis on inorganic samples. The types of investigations include:
separations science; multi-element and trace analysis; and combined physical &
chemical characterization. Because of its prominence in contemporary analytical
practice, separations science receives the highest priority. We emphasize HPLC
because it is most consistent with the students' laboratory experience at this
level and because of its relevance to subsequent courses. For the multi-element
and trace analysis experience we have selected two approaches: analytical
voltammetry and atomic absorption. Analytical voltammetry is selected because it
is consistent with the students' experience with solution chemistry; it provides
an inexpensive introduction to multi-element trace analysis, (stripping
voltammetry); it can be applied to both metallic and to organic/biochemical
analytes; and it establishes the technique as a detection approach for HPLC.
Atomic absorption is selected because it provides a more nearly standard
commercial laboratory technique for elemental analysis; it exemplifies
fundamental spectroscopy principles; and it provides broader applicability to
elemental analytes than voltammetry. Superimposed on students' experience with
modem technology will be laboratory conduc t based on Federal Good Laboratory
Practice guidelines.
