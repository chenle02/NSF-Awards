The scope of our continuing research is the application of image reconstruction
or tomographic techniques to a systematic and rigorous study of the Earth's
laterally-heterogenous mantle and core seismic velocity structures. In the
course of the initial funding period of this proposal, using a large-matrix,
row-action inversion method that was developed, tested and refined during the
first stages of our analysis, we have constructed spherically-symmetric, lower-
mentle P and S-wave velocity models as well as P and S-wave seismic-station
travel- time residual correction sets. We are using travel-time data from the
International Seismological Centre's (ISC) short- period, global earthquake
catalog. Nearly 2.4 million source- receiver data points from 24,423
earthquakes, representing teleseismic P and S ray paths in the 25o-105o
epicentral distance range (bottoming depths from 700 kilometers to the core-
mantle boundary) were used in the model inversions. The P results and the S
velocity model show significant variation and improvement from results obtained
by other studies and the S station correction set is possibly the first usable
set ever developed. Using these improved models of both the lower mantle's
spherically averaged structure and the upper-mantle and crustal lateral velocity
variations as starting models, we are continuing and extending our analysis in a
systematic investigation of the structure of the Earth's mantle, outer and inner
core and core-mantle boundary.
