An array-based genotyping method will be developed as a tool for Arabidopsis
researchers. The current rate-limiting step or mapping mutations in F2
populations and for creating genetic maps of recombinant inbred line populations
is that large numbers of individual plants need to be genotyped using several
hundred genetic markers. Array-based genotyping permits the simultaneous
assessment of many molecular markers, suggesting this approach as a rapid and
cost-effective genotyping method. Spotted oligonucleotide glass slide
microarrays that can be used to detect approximately 500 insertion/deletion
differences (InDel) between the Columbia and Landsberg erecta Arabidopsis
accessions will be produced. Once they have been developed, printed
oligonucleotide arrays will be made available to the Arabidopsis research
community at cost. The DNA sequences of the informative oligonucleotides, marker
data for recombinant inbred lines used to test the arrays, and information for
ordering printed arrays will be published on the project web site
(http://bti.cornell.edu/jander/mapping_array). Publicly available genotyping
arrays will promote the goals of the Arabidopsis 2010 program by facilitating
the rapid identification of genes based on mutant phenotypes. Student education
is an important aspect of this project, and well-defined array experiments will
provide excellent undergraduate research opportunities. In addition, this novel
genotyping approach can be applied to other organisms with genomes that are too
complex for efficient genotyping using currently available array-based methods.
