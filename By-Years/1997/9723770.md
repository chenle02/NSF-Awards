Thomas 9723770 Marine invertebrates often spawn eggs directly into the water
column exposing the eggs to extremes of physical stress. The proposed research
will explore how egg characteristics modulate the negative effects of physical
stress on reproduction. This research will integrate biomechanics, electron
microscopy, and a phylogenetic analyses. Three primary hypotheses will be
addressed: ( 1 ) egg properties do not affect diffusion/dilution rates of eggs;
(2) egg properties do not increase survival of eggs after spawning; (3) there is
no causal relationship between gamete properties and physical stress. This
research will examine a little examined constraint on the reproductive success
of an economically important group of invertebrates, the echinoids.
Understanding the factors that influence production of embryos, in this group,
is fundamental to developing appropriate life history models and fisheries
management plans.
