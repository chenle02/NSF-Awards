Detailed investigation of morphologically and anatomically preserved Early
Devonian plant taxa referable to trimerophytes or of problematical affinities is
proposed. Characters useful in determining their possible relationships to major
pteridophyte groups, refining taxonomic circumscriptions, and postulation
patterns of divergence of structures or lineages should result. Specific
projects include study of Psilophyton and Pertica- related plants from Canada
and Germany in order to better characterize the trimerophytes and to develop
hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships with other plant groups. Taeniocrad-
type axes will be examined to determine number of taxa represented and to
evaluate their relationships. Additional information about morphology and
affinities of remains similar to the putative gameotophyte Caliculiphyton will
be obtained. Several zosterophyll types continue to be studied for the purpose
of better evaluating generic and species relationships. A variety of techniques,
including degagement, maceration in acids, thin-sectioning, SEM observation,
whole plant reconstruction, hypotheses of homology of structures, and
phylogenetic analytical methods will be employed as appropriate. This research
will expand and improve the array of characters useful in phylogenetic and
evolutionary analyses, generate new hypotheses of relationships of some
lineages, and contribute new information about the composition and diversity of
early Devonian floras of southeastern Canada.
