9420307 Domach This project is on research to further develop a methodology for
in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study cellular
metabolism. The research focuses on three areas: (1) improving a cultivation
system to allow growth rate control and lower cell densities in order to enhance
the signal to noise ratio, and thus the NMR results; (2) enhancing the overall
system by incorporating on- line pH, optical density, fluorescent and dissolved
oxygen measurements; and (3) utilizing the system to investigate polyphosphate
metabolism in yeast. ***
