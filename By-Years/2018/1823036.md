Wireless microscale devices that navigate the body to diagnose and treat disease
are a key element of the future of medicine, addressing localized malfunction in
neurological, cardiovascular, autoimmune, cancer and other disease areas.
Precise localization and spatially addressable communication are the major
unresolved challenges. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing a
radically new technology for microscale device localization based on magnetic
resonance imaging. They will engineer miniaturized integrated circuit
transducers to locate and communicate with them in vivo. They call this
technology ATOMS - Addressable Transmitters Operated as Magnetic
Spins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will design, implement and optimize the
performance of ATOMS in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate precise localization
and targeted communication with a spatial resolution of less than 0.5 mm. They
will initially focus on two applications: 1) monitor the migration of ATOMS
through the gastrointestinal system of live mice, and 2) create a navigation
platform for high precision surgery. To develop ATOMS devices with target
operating characteristics, they will design integrated circuits capable of
sensing the magnetic field, and harvesting sufficient power from the RF output
of the MRI to drive the IC's functions, including sensing of local biological
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
