This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Maryland in the purchase of an
upgrade for an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer. This upgrade is
essential if the PI's are to make much more effective of the present equipment.
The research projects that will be enhanced by the acquisition of this equipment
include: 1) Studies of the electronic structure of organometallic 15-electron
complexes, 2) Formation and electonic structure studies of 17 electron dihydride
complexes, 3) Photochemical and electrochemical generation of arylnitrenium (Ar-
N-R+) ions, probable intermediates in chemical carcinogenesis, and the study of
their electronic structure, 4) ESR studies of organometallic and molecular-based
inorganic polymers with bulk ferromagnetism and low dimensional conductivity, 5)
ESR studies of enzyme-stablized radicals in biological processes. %%% An
electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer provides information about the
electronic structure of molecules and can detect the presence of "free radicals"
which play an important in many chemical and biological interactions.
