This award supports a two-year project to continue work developing the
techniques to make carbon monoxide (CO) measurements in ice core samples. Carbon
monoxide is an important atmospheric chemical constituent as it is a primary
sink for hydroxyl radical (OH) (and therefore influences the oxidizing capacity
of the atmosphere) and because the concentrations of three major greenhouses
gases , carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are directly tied to
the concentration of CO. In light of recent anthropogenic increases in the
emissions of CO, CO2, CH4 and NOx, it is desirable to understand this complex
chemical system and the changes in the greenhouse forcing resulting from
perturbation. Because it is difficult to test the accuracy of models for past
and future conditions for which no direct atmospheric measurements of trace gas
concentrations are available these measurements must be obtained in other ways.
Polar ice cores provide a means to make these measurements. Further work is
necessary to refine the analytical technique and additional measurements are
necessary to investigate the accuracy of these results and to establish the
nature of temporal trends in CO. It is anticipated that the CO record, combined
with existing or new data for CO2, CH4 , N2O and other paleoclimate variables,
will provide further constraints on model studies of the effect of changing
atmospheric chemistry on greenhouse forcing.
