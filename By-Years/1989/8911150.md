This is a study of the geochemistry of coral reefs. Microbial mediated anoxic
and suboxic diagenesis within the lithified carbonate framework will be
investigated by modelling and by analysis of interstitial water from wells bored
into the reef. Checker Reef, Oahu will be the main site of investigation. The
temporal and spatial distribution of the inorganic and organic diagenetic
endproducts, of the anaerobic alteration of solid phase material, and of the
outward flux of reduced compounds from the reef will be measured. The advection
of the interstitial water through the reef will be modelled. Then from the model
and the chemical measurements, rates of organic and inorganic reactions will be
calculated.
