Theoretical research will be conducted on the physical properties of strongly
correlated quantum liquids. In particular, work will be done on experimental
implications of the chiral spin states and other spin liquid states; edge states
and the topological order in the fractional quantum Hall states; and, strongly
correlated metals in quasi-one-dimensional systems and quasi-two-dimensional
systems. The theoretical approach will utilize field theoretic methods. %%%
Recent advances in condensed matter theory have emphasized the unity of strongly
interacting many-body systems in spatial dimensions less than three. Of
noteworthy importance is the study of the fractional quantum Hall effect and
high temperature superconductors using the concept of fractional statistics in
two- dimensions to describe a unique and new state of matter. This grant will
support research on the connections between various strongly interacting
condensed matter systems using the theoretical formalism developed for high
energy physics.
