Some of the most important advances in aquatic ecology in the past two decades
include the realization that carbon dynamics, particularly organic carbon, and
microbial processes contribute significantly to the production and overall
functioning of many lakes, streams, and wetlands. Furthermore, on a global
basis, the carbon cycle is profoundly influenced by emissions from aquatic
systems. This project modernizes and enhances under- graduate education in
aquatic ecology with the use of equipment that emphasizes the roles that
fixation of inorganic carbon (photosynthesis), degradation of organic carbon
(decomposition), and microbial utilization of organic carbon play in freshwater
systems. Beyond providing new laboratory experiences for stu- dents, the project
engages students in the "process of science," both within and outside the
classroom. Students can use the new equipment to ask numerous questions about
important processes involving the function and regulation of entire aquatic
systems and various freshwater organisms. As a model program, this project can
influence the direction of limnological education in the U.S.
