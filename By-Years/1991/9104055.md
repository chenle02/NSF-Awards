The objective of this symposium is to exchange knowledge gained from recent
Geotechnical Engineering research around the world involving the use of
Calibration Chambers. There have been four symposia held in europe since 1984,
but only few researchers from the U.S. has access to these symposia although
significant progress has been made in the U.S. since the first chamber was built
in University of Florida in 1970. The proposed symposium will provide an
international forum for summarizing the state-of-the-art, exchanging recent
knowledge and identifying future directions in research involving the versatile
use of calibration chambers.
