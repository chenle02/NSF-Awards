This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Plummer at Trinity University, who will synthesize cyclopentene fused polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons that are deformed from their normal planar geometries as
verified by X-ray analyses. The ground and excited state properties of these
deformed aromatic molecules will be studied experimentally and compared with
semi-empirical molecular orbital and molecular mechanics calculations. Their
photochemistry will be pursued to study the mechanism and the effect of ground
state strain energy on excited state transformations. The syntheses of
measurable temporal domain zwitterionic cation radical-anion radical species is
also targeted. The potential for selected compounds to be used in molecular
devices will be explored. %%% Non-planar aromatic hydrocarbons are recognized as
important new compounds with many intriguing chemical and physical properties.
In this project Professor Plummer and his undergraduate students will synthesize
many new compounds, determine their non-planar geometries by X-ray analyses,
investigate their photochemical properties, and provide an extensive
computational survey on their physical-organic features.
