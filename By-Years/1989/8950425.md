This award to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is made in response to a
proposal submitted to the NSF Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
Program, a program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate
instructional equipment. The award will provide one-half of the funds needed to
acquire geophysical field instruments for undergraduate instruction and
research. RPI is committed to matching the NSF contribution for this equipment.
The instrumentation will be used to enhance the undergraduate geophysics and
geology curriculum and to provide the opportunity for students to acquire and
process geophysical data.
