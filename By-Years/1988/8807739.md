This award provides support to eleven US oceanographers to participate in a
joint workshop on shelf edge exchange processes with oceanographers from Taiwan.
The objective of the workshop is to exchange ideas and information about frontal
processes, particularly particle formation and transport across fronts. Workshop
participants will also explore possibilities for cooperative oceanographic
research on the exchange between the Kuroshio and the East China Sea. This
workshop is jointly supported by NSF and by the Taiwan National Science Council.
