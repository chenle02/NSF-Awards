In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Bililign will address two important issues of physical
chemistry. The first deals with the reaction dynamics of M-H2 (M = alkali
metal). By measuring the nascent rotational state distribution of the LiH
product we will try to understand the reaction mechanism. The second deals with
the C-H activation by metal atoms. The physical and chemical quenching of
excited Li atoms by alkane and alkene hydrocarbons will be investigated by means
of cascade and time-resolved atomic fluorescence techniques. Far-wing scattering
state spectroscopy will be employed in the studies of reaction
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research deals with two important areas of
chemical reaction processes. The goal is to understand how reagent molecules
approach, collide, exchange energy, and finally separate into products. The
benefits of such knowledge include applications to the modeling of chemical
reactions in the upper atmospheric, plasma processes, chemical synthesis, and
chemical reaction process technology. This work will be conducted with students
who will thereby gain research experience in preparation for advanced studies or
entry into the scientific/technological workforce. &lt;br/&gt;
