This award provides 64% of the funds required to purchase equipment items for
the purpose of upgrading the cryogenic superconducting magnetometer operating in
the Paleomagnetism and Rock Magnetism Laboratory of the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences at the University of New Mexico. The institution is committed
to providing the remaining funds needed for this equipment upgrade. The
laboratory upgrade is needed primarily in research using measurements of
magnetism in rocks to gain a better understanding of ancient tectonism and
thermal conditions in the crust.
