This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will support research in the general area of organometallic chemistry, with
particular emphasis on reactions of carbon dioxide promoted by organometallic
compounds. The practical interest in such reactions derives from the strong
possibility that carbon dioxide will be used as a source of carbon for chemical
synthesis in the future, in for example reactions with hydrogen derived from the
decomposition of water by solar energy. The long-term goal of the project is a
clear mechanistic view of carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bond
forming processes resulting from the insertion of carbon dioxide into M-H, M-C
and M-O bonds. Reactivity studies have revealed a similarity in reaction
characteristics for carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bond forming reactions
involving anionic octahedral metal derivatives and neutral square-planar metal
complexes. It has further been shown that knowledge gained from investigating
these different processes occurring on individual metal centers is transferable
to metal centers where both reaction types are possible. The insight gained from
transition metal-carbon dioxide chemistry will be used in exploring potential
uses of carbon dioxide as a feedstock for the synthesis of organic chemicals.
Specific areas to be explored include decarboxylation mechanisms of metallo-
formates and -carbonates, alkyl-, aryl- and silyl-oxide chemistry of low-valent
metals, studies related to C-H activation and functionalization, and catalytic
processes involving carbon dioxide.
