The emerging field of p-adic dynamics has received a sizable amount of attention
from around the world, including a course at the College de France given by
J.-C. Yoccoz in 2000. The subject promises new developments in the near future
for research in number theory, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory. In this
three-day workshop scheduled for May, 2005, participants with strengths in these
three fields of mathematics will exchange ideas via lectures and discussions
concerning the work which has appeared up to now, helping to generate ideas for
future research in this subject. Even in the relatively few years of its
existence as a research area, p-adic dynamics has attracted interest from a
number of dynamicists and ergodic theorists for its parallels and contrasts with
complex dynamics, as well as from number theorists for its applications to the
study of iteration of functions over global fields. A number of fundamental
theorems and surprising pathological examples have already been discovered,
while at the same time several conjectures have emerged as key open questions in
the subject.

Ergodic theory and dynamical systems are relatively young subjects which evolved
to study the chaotic and seemingly random behavior of nonlinear systems. Their
descriptions of chaotic behavior have led to myriad applications in physics and
engineering. On the other hand, number theory is a subject which has been
studied since ancient times, but whose beauty and intricacy has kept it alive
and strong into the present day, where it has even found applications in
cryptography and coding theory. Now, p-adic dynamics provides an opportunity for
these vibrant subjects to interact in a way that ultimately has the potential to
provide further understanding of all these applications.
