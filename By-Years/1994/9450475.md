9450475 The proposed research would conduct fundamental studies to elucidate the
biochemical interactions of bacterial and mammalian cell lines with model
synthetic organic surfaces. Studies will be carried out that will allow an
investigation of the origins of biomolecular adsorption of chemical and physical
changes that lead to the attachment of cells and microbes to synthetic
materials. A facility would be established for the study and development of
materials for prosthetic, bioanalytical and biotechnological applications.
