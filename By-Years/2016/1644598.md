The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to facilitate
the continuous operation of consumer devices as well as enable uninterrupted
safety-critical applications such as elderly care, patient and structural health
monitoring. The project can potentially enhance the quality of life by
eliminating concerns of frequent charging of low-power electronic devices. By
wireless charging of small form factor sensors, the expenses and environmental
concerns associated with battery-replacements can also be mitigated. This
project will result in an extensive customer discover process, through which
high-impact sectors will be shortlisted from the sectors of healthcare,
wearables, automative industry, and smart homes/offices. It will spur
innovations across the wide spectrum of applications scenarios in context of the
emerging Internet of Things paradigm by addressing the critical energy needs of
the network

This I-Corps project defines a new network architecture that is capable of
distributed wireless RF-based charging by combining both hardware and software
platforms. The proposed technique of collaborative beamforming allows an
exponential increase in wireless charging rates due to constructive interference
and real-time adaptation of energy signals using minimal receiver feedback. This
project leverages a software-defined distributed energy beamforming plane to
ensure continuous feedback used for selecting various parameters at the energy
transmitters that give high charging rates. Finally, it assesses energy needs
over the network and is able to schedule energy broadcasts proactively. While
omni-directional and MIMO-based beamforming from a single charger have been
investigated recently, this I-Corps project attempts to explore innovative
applications of distributed and concurrent energy transfers from multiple
spatially-located energy transmitters (ETs).
