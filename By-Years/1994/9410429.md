9410429 Bryers This project is on research to develop biomaterials that prevent
the adhesion and subsequent growth of bacterial cells to these materials. The
four specific aims of this research include: (1) the preparation and
characterization of polyurethane substrata with surface coatings for the
controlled release of antibiotics and antiadhesives; (2) the preparation of an
alternate surface coating technique by plasma deposition of ethylene glycol
oligomers at the polyurethane surface; (3) a study of the kinetics of bacterial
adhesion to the newly created material surfaces; and (4) an examination of the
rates and mechanisms of bacterial attachment in the presence of blood platelets.
The results of this research could have impact on the prevention of bacterial
infections for medical implants. ***
