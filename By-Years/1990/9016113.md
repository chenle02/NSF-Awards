This project is designed to introduce Alaskan Native undergraduate students to
scientific study through marine internships. The rationale is that the coastal
Native populations of Alaska have a deep involvement with the marine
environment, and especially with its biological resources. Marine science is
therefore likely to be more attractive to them initially than other areas of
science. Students in their sophomore, or possibly freshman, year at selected
coastal institutions, as well as the University of Alaska Fairbanks campuses,
will be offered the opportunity to participate in marine science internships.
Working closely with a faculty mentor, each student will learn about research
through hands-on experience as well as individual tutoring. Students at coastal
sites will be encouraged to move to a senior campus to pursue baccalaureate
degrees in scientific areas, and those that chose to do so would receive
continued support and mentoring to encourage their success. Approximately five
student fellowships are to be offered each year of this three year project.
