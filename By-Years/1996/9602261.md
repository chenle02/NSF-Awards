This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research training program focused
on aspects of Biogeochemistry important to increased understanding of
environmental change. A group of 25 faculty drawn from eight organizational
units of Cornell, the Boyce Thmopson Institute and the Institute for Ecosystem
studies will collaborate to develop one of the first U.S. graduate programs in
Biogeochemistry. Training will include a set of 4 required courses, some newly
developed for the RTG, research rotations in faculty laboratories and field
research sites, technical workshops and seminars that will bring leading
researchers from other institutions. Besides providing students with fundamental
knowledge of both biogeochemistry and ecosystem analysis, the program will
emphasize training in the use of state-of-the-art techniques in biogeochemistry
and environmental microbiology. Areas of research to be emphasized include
studies of accelerated nitrogen movement through landscapes into rivers and
estuaries, studies of effects of humans on nutrient and water levels in forest
ecosystems, and studies of wetland microbiota active in generation of methane.
The goal of the program is to produce highly interactive, creative and
multidisciplinary-based students who will be able to contribute to understanding
global change and other environmental problems. ***
