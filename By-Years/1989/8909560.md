In the floating zone method of crystal growth the thermal gradient imposed along
the free surface causes toroidal convection cells. As the temperature gradient
is increased it has been observed experimentally that the steady convection
cells lose stability and an oscillatory pattern develops. In an effort to
discover the mechanism associated with this bifurcation to oscillatory behavior
, modern dynamical systems theory and bifurcation theory will be applied to
fluid flow in a cylindrical domain with a free surface to provide a qualitative
picture of the existence and stability of solutions in the parameter space.
Simultaneously the governing equations will be solved numerically, using a
spectral element code to generate the steady convection cells. These will serve
as the base flow for the numerical linear stability analysis. The code will also
be used to search the parameter space for the various unsteady solutions
described by the bifurcation analysis. The combined attack of analysis and
numerics will reveal the mechanism involved in the loss of stability of the
toroidal cells, and more generally, will contribute to our understanding of the
effects of thermocapillary forces in a microgravity environment.
