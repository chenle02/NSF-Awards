Project Abstract Intellectual Merit An award is made to the University of
California at Los Angeles to develop a high speed fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS) system in order to sort highly infectious and potentially
dangerous samples in a biosafety cabinet within a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3)
facility to enable for the first time high purity sorting of live BSL3
subcellular organisms. The sorter employs a tightly focused pulsed laser beam to
generate an explosive vapor bubble and transient, local, small volume fluid
perturbation near target objects to deflect their trajectories in a microchannel
into collection or waste outlets. It aims to achieve >90% high purity sort at
100,000 cells/s on a fully enclosed, disposable, microfluidic chip inside a
biosafety cabinet to ensure the highest level of biosafety. It requires only one
hour to purify 108 cells or subcellular organelles from a population of 109
cells. This project also aims to develop a novel, label free sorter utilizing
dielectrophoresis mechanism to pre-purify samples containing various unwanted
subcellular organelles and debris.

Broad Impact A BSL 3 compatible high throughput FACS platform will provide
paradigm-shifting impacts in studying infectious disease. It will have broad
applications from fundamental biological research to clinical applications.
Results and expertise developed during the course of this project will also be
incorporated into PIs? teaching activities at both the undergraduate and
graduate levels. Minority graduate and undergraduate students will participate
in these projects through independent research courses. Students involved in
this project will be exposed to an excellent multidisciplinary training
environment in UCLA Engineering School and Medical School.
