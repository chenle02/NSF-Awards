This project will examine the biologic linkages between streams and surrounding
terrestrial habitats in the tallgrass prairie biome. Emerging aquatic insects
and stranded fauna in drying channels are hypothesized to represent important
food sources for terrestrial predators (birds, spiders, and mammals) due to the
large biomass exported relative to terrestrial production and the concentration
of this biomass along riparian corridors. Spatial and temporal variation in
emergence biomass within the watershed is large because of flash flooding and
insect life cycles. The abundance of terrestrial insectivores is expected to be
positively correlated with the magnitude of emergence production at sites within
the watershed. Predators are expected to rapidly exploit stranded fauna.
Measurement of rates of transfer to terrestrial habitats will involve a
combination of experimental and descriptive procedures for community emergence,
densities of terrestrial insectivores, and exploitation of stranded fauna. The
research is expected to have significance in the examination of terrestrial-
lotic linkages in other biomes. The project will offer an opportunity for
participation by undergraduate biology students in a formal research project and
will allow the department to examine potential deficiencies in the curriculum
related to the preparation of students for post- graduate training.
