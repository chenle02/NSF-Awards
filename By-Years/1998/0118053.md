0118053&lt;br/&gt;Nayfeh&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to
develop biophotonic markers for fluorescent biosensors that are smaller,
brighter, less fragile, and more practical than existing markers. The specific
components of this research include: (1) an examination of the time dynamics of
emission, photostability, and bleaching under a variety of incident excitation
intensities, in the UV, visible, and near-infrared range of frequencies, (2) an
examination of the solubility of particles and their integrity of brightness
under diverse environmental conditions, such as those encountered in vivo, and
(3) the development of cladding methods to improve biocompatibility, (4) develop
methods to refine synthesis and scale the throughput to meet high-demand
commercial applications, and (5) examine the feasibility of modifying the
particles by attaching additional molecules to their surfaces to produce "smart"
particles that are able to seek out specific biological targets, for imaging,
targeted drug delivery, or destruction of a pathogenic invader.&lt;br/&gt;
