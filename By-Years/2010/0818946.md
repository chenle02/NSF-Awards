Intellectual Merit Nearly all cells use an internal scaffolding system known as
a cytoskeleton to control cell shape. The proteins that comprise this system
have been known and well studied in large, complex eukaryotic cells for many
decades, but were unknown in bacteria until only very recently. This project
represents the first concerted attempt to characterize the bacterial actin-based
cytoskeleton at the level of protein-protein interactions. It builds on a rich
history of cytoskeletal research on eukaryotic cells and bridges the gap between
the mature eukaryotic cytoskeleton field and the newly developing body of work
addressing the basic cell biology of bacteria. It employs novel imaging
techniques with established and new biochemical and biophysical approaches to
address the means by which the proteins that comprise the bacterial cytoskeleton
carry out their physiological roles and ultimately affect cellular behavior.

Broader Impact This project will broadly impact education and training; it will
support outreach; and will benefit society scientifically. From the perspective
of education and training, the majority of the proposed experiments will be
carried out by graduate students. Indeed students will play an integral role in
the intellectual development of all stages of the project, from developing and
testing hypotheses to publication. Traditionally, all members of the PI's
laboratory attend weekly laboratory meetings and journal clubs at which each
member presents recent results and a paper from the literature. In support of
outreach activities the PI will join a team of scientists at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison who promote the development of interest in science for
students in local K-12 schools. The PI's involvement in this Center for
Biological Education will bring hands-on biological microscopy to local K-12
students to supplement the level of instruction available at the public schools.
Students will be engaged in science modules based on optical microscopy as a
part of after school programs, Saturday morning programs at local libraries,
and/or Saturday morning programs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The
scientific benefit to society of this project is reflected in the understanding
that the existence of prokaryotic actins provides new perspectives on the
evolution of the cytoskeleton, but just as importantly provides new reagents and
the ability to test new hypotheses about the mechanisms of filament assembly and
regulation. Identified structural, functional and sequence differences between
prokaryotic and eukaryotic actins will provide insight into the limitations and
range of functions of this important molecule. Additionally, knowledge gained
toward these aims will significantly influence perspectives of the roles of
actin in eukaryotic cell motility and cell division.
