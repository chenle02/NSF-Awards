The Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island will
acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of
shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association
with the R/V ENDEAVOR, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the
university. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1991 is
in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the University to support research
and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Gyro repeater to
display ship's heading in the main scientific laboratory, -High density computer
tape drive for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities, -Rosette
sampler adapter plates to improve the existing system's ability for collecting
discrete seawater samples at specific water depths, -Niskin bottles for
collecting discrete seawater samples at various depths in the water column,
-Precision acoustic pingers for determining position of an instrument package
relative to the surface or seafloor, -Upgrade for a precision salinometer used
for the precision determination of seawater salinity, and -Temperature,
conductivity, and wind sensors to augment routine data collection capabilities,
and -Box Corer upgrade to allow collection of sediment and soil samples from the
sea floor. The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of
the University to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
