Dr. Cudworth's star cluster research at the Yerkes Observatory primarily
involves observational investigations of proper motions and photometric studies
of the members of globular and open clusters. Star clusters are important for
testing theories of stellar evolution, galactic evolution, and stellar dynamics.
Clusters also contribute to the luminosity calibration for a variety of types of
stars, as well as the distance scale of the Galaxy and the Universe. In all of
these areas a criterion for membership of stars in the cluster is needed which
is independent of theories of stellar evolution. measurements of proper motions
are used to derive cluster membership, study the internal dynamics of the
clusters, and derive the cluster space velocities. Dr. Cudworth has a reputation
for careful and accurate contributions in this area of fundamental astronomy.
