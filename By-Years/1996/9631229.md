9631229 Francisco New methods for collecting data on domestic conflict are
necessary in order to extend research beyond its current boundaries. In this
investigation the researcher will collect domestic conflict data from 1980
through 1995 on all European countries using new methods to satisfy the demands
of recent dynamic models and new research programs. Current data on domestic
conflict suffers from age, low density and questionable validity. Yet the need
for data on coercion and protest continues to grow. This project uses a set of
new organizing principles for data collection on domestic conflict and presents
a data set that will be used widely by those interested in domestic political
conflict. ***
