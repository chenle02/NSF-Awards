This award will provide for half the funding necessary to upgrade the high-
resolution and analytical transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM/AEM)
laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. The university is committed to provide
the additional funds needed for this acquisition. The present facility, which
has been heavily used, is nearly seven years old and clearly needs an upgrade.
The components to be added, which include a new Si/Li X-ray detector, a liquid
nitrogen analytical specimen holder, a new computer, a new TEM video system, and
a new ion mill, will assure that this facility will continue to generate high
quality data. This laboratory is considered to be one of the two most productive
in the country. This upgrade should make it possible to extend the highly useful
life of this facility for several years.
