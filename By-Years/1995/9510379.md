9510379 Eldering This is an award to support preliminary research on the factors
that influence the nature of aerosol particulates in air that negatively affect
its quality. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF
93-130, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Women
Scientists and Engineers. The investigator has selected the region surrounding
Pocatello, Idaho as the site for this planning study. Its objective is to
utilize results of an air quality sampling program as a step toward determining
the feasibility of formulating mathematical models that can be used in the
engineering design of pollution abatement and mitigation measures. The intensive
sampling program will be conducted in cooperation with the Southeastern Idaho
Air Pollution Control Office. An understanding of the sources of air pollutants
and conditions that affect their movement is necessary in the formulation of
mathematical models that can be used in the engineering design of abatement
procedures. This project is expected to assist in determination of the need for
and feasibility of a long-term sampling program that would reveal annual
variations in sources, chemical composition and size distribution of aerosol
particulates in regions with significant particulate air quality problems. ***
