This is a SBIR Phase I project to develop an accurate, non- intrusive, rapid-
response, exhaust gas temperature monitor which can be used in power plant and
incinerator furnaces. The device exploits an innovative concept whereby the
instrument detects the short wavelength radiation emitted from ash particles
present in the flow due to the combustion process. This is opposed to
conventional techniques which detect long-wavelength infrared radiation, with
appreciable inaccuracy. Prior thinking in this technology was that utilizing
shorter wavelengths was not a fruitful direction to pursue, however, PSI has
performed an analysis which reveals the potential of this approach and has
confirmed it with preliminary experiments. The project will design and fabricate
a sensor based on this principle, and the sensor will be characterized. These
results will be used to determine if the probe is adequate for transient furnace
control applications. The device to be developed will be of great use in furnace
control applications whereby coal-fired power plant boilers might operate at
optimum efficiency due to direct control of the combustion process during
varying loads, and incinerator furnaces could be controlled to minimize
environmental pollution.
