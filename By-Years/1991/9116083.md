The application of probabilistic methods to combinatorial enumeration has grown
into an independent area of mathematics. There has recently been a resurgence of
interest in classical combinatorial objects such as mappings, partitions, and
permutations. These objects provide a source of problems of both theoretical and
practical importance. This project will provide support for the International
Conference on Random Mappings, Partitions, and Permutations to be held January
3-6, 1992 at the University of Southern California.
