9351696 Van Engelen This project will purchase a Gas Chromatograph/Mass
Spectrometer for the Chemistry and Environmental Science Curricula. GC/MS
experiments will be included in the Intermediate and Advanced Analysis courses.
The Organic Chemistry Laboratory courses will include chromatographic and mass
spectral information early in the course so that students will be proficient
when they begin synthetic methods in the second semester. Undergraduate
researchers will use this instrumentation to monitor the fate of pesticides and
decomposition products in the environment, to study the leaching materials from
municipal landfills, and plan synthetic strategies and understand reaction
mechanisms in synthetic organic chemistry. ***
