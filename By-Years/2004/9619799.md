9619799 Gilligan The Savannah State University and Harbor Branch Oceanographic
Institution collaborate on a 9-week-long "Bridge to Research" summer program
that is designed to give minority students, at an early stage in their
undergraduate education, an entry-level exposure to research. The students are
teamed with mentors, participate in visits to marine laboratories, go to sea on
research training cruises, and complete condensed college courses in
experimental design, statistics, and technical writing. Students put these
skills to use in a group research project. Exposing students to minority role
model mentors and to a wide variety of professional situations have been key
elements of the program and will continue during this funding period.
