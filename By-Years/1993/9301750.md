Recent studies indicate that ultraviolet radiation can penetrate to
considerable depths on tropical reefs. Persistent high levels of UV penetration,
resulting from extended periods of calm sea conditions, have been shown to
induce stress leading to the loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae (i.e., bleaching)
in reef-building corals. These conditions may have contributed significantly to
the regional mass coral bleaching events observed in the Caribbean during 1987
and 1990. This project will continue monitoring penetration of UV radiation, sea
temperatures, and recovery of coral exposed to UV radiation. In addition, the
project will be expanded to evaluate the effects of UV radiation on the early
life-history stages, namely planula larvae and newly-recruited juveniles, of
predominant coral species. While increases in UV radiation are predicted to be
minimal at low latitudes, increased frequency of calm sea conditions predicted
by global warming will lead to enhanced water column clarity and high UV
penetration with subsequent negative effects on reef corals. This project, by
experimentally defining the maximum UV intensities that can be tolerated by
larval and juveniles corals, will provide insight into the role that current
intensities of UV radiation play in limiting recruitment and shaping subsequent
coral community structure.
