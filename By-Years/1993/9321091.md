Expected utility (EU) models are the cornerstone of the economic approach to
modeling decision making under uncertainty. These models perform poorly,
however, in describing decision making under a number of real-world conditions.
Non-expected utility models have been developed to address the shortcomings of
the conventional approach. Modeling and empirical use of non-EU models are
currently constrained because it is believed these models violate desirable
behavioral properties. This research will analyze the validity of those beliefs.
Non-EU models will be applied to dynamic choice situations. The investigators
will explore families of non-EU models that maintain the property of dynamic
consistency in these situations. The results are expected to broaden the
application of non-EU models to a wide range of modeling environments.
