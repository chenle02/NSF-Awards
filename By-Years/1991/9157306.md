The research objective is to provide a theoretical foundation for designing
feedback controllers for systems with uncertainty, that combines both system
identification and robust control in a consistent manner and capture their
fundamental limitations and capabilities. The research in system identification
is motivated by the following question: How much information about a plant is
needed to control it, and what is the minimum prior knowledge required for
identifiability, all within an uncertain environment? The theoretical work will
be complemented by adding experimental research that will both test and generate
new understanding of robust control systems.
