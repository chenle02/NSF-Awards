Short abstract for proposal ECS-0215810 "Equipment Acquisition to Establish an
Applied Electromagnetics and Communications Laboratory"

The purpose of this NSF MRI proposal is to acquire the basic equipment
necessary to establish a laboratory for research and research training in
applied electromagnetics and communications at the South Dakota School of Mines
and Technology (SDSM&T). Four instrument systems comprise this equipment
request: a vector network analyzer system, a sampling oscilloscope and pulse
generator system, a micro/millimeter-wave probe station and a microwave free
space measurement system. Current and planned research activities at SDSM&T that
will be impacted by this equipment acquisition include electromagnetic
propulsion and control of ultra-lightweight space sailcraft; space-based,
gossamer zone-plate antennas; engineered electromagnetic materials incorporating
active and passive circuit particles; ultra-wideband sensor webs; beam-steered,
ultra-wideband radar; high speed circuits; compact antennas; ground penetrating
radar; and electromagnetic properties of soils. There is little to no equipment
at SDSM&T (or anywhere in the region) for microwave or millimeter wave research
work or for producing and detecting fast rise time signals. While computational
electromagnetic methods and simulation are valuable components in our research,
we rely heavily on experimental measurements to provide a critical dimension in
our work. Such measurement capability is also a key element we expect will
enhance our competitiveness in future funding opportunities. The requested
equipment will also allow us to educate and train engineers in microwave and
high-speed circuits, which are critical components in wireless communications
and computer engineering. It will also complement a burgeoning regional
telecommunications industry primarily based in Rapid City, and assist us in the
recruitment of faculty, students and underrepresented groups
