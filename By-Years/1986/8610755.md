This award will provide a combination spectroflurometer and microscope system
for the use of a number of investigators in the Department of Anatomy and
Cellular Physiology. This is an excellent modern tool to aid investigation of
basic problems in cell biology and will benefit their research programs. They
will be able to follow the fate of fluorescent labelled substances in living
cells and record their observations on videotape for evaluation. The project was
co-funded by NIH and a contribution by Harvard University.
