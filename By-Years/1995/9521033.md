This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. This study compares the factors that determine whether Japanese women
will stay in or leave the labor force after marriage, with particular attention
to the role of education. It tests the applicability of human capital theory in
the Japanese context and provides new comparisons with the United States. The
study will be based on a newly-collected survey of 2,000 women in central Japan,
with respondents selected to reflect different educational experiences. %%% This
study will contribute to the sociological understanding of the relation between
women's human capital and the continuity of social stratification. It will also
add to our understanding of Japanese society generally and the ways it compares
with the United States. Policy makers should find useful information about the
conflicts between work and family. In addition to the scientific gains to be
achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes
to the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
