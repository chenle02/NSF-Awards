9306466 Carrier Vigorous activity requires increased rates of metabolism, so
for an animal to sustain vigorous locomotion, it must breathe as it runs.
Lizards are unable to do both simultaneously, because the muscles required for
ventilation are also involved in locomotion, and can not accomplish both
functions at the same time. Evidence from the fossil record suggests that the
early ancestors of birds and mammals were probably also restricted in this way.
The research of this proposal aims to increase our understanding of the
mechanical linkage between the locomorotr and ventilatory systems by
investigating the role of the axial musculo-skeletal system in locomotion. There
are three main goals. The locomotor activity of the epaxial and hypaxial muscles
in green iguanas and domestic dogs will be characterized by electromyography.
This information is not known for any tetrapod. Then the activity of the
external and internal intercosatal muscles of dogs, lizards and opposums during
locomotion will be compared to their activity during ventilation of the lungs.
Recordings of the forces exerted by their limbs on the ground will be correlated
with muscle acitivty to test hypotheses of muscle function. These stduies will
result in a better understanding of the function of these muscles, and by
looking at three different animals will aid in understanding the evolution of
the axial musculo-skeletal system. ***
