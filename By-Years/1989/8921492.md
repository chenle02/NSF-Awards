Electromagnetic (EM) fields have been used quite extensively in an attempt to
improve bone healing, but the area remains controversial. One of the reasons for
the controversy is that the basic mechanism by which EM fields affect bone cells
is not known. This proposed project is to examine whether ion cyclotron
resonance, leading to altered membrane transport of specific ions, might be the
mechanism of altered bone function. Specifically, this work will examine whether
calcium ion transport is enhanced as a result of cyclotrone resonance induced by
EM fields, and whether this effect is dependent on the magnitude of the applied
fields. This is a fundamental study that may have great significance for
eventually improving engineering methods by which EM stimulation is used to
improve bone healing.
