Modern automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices; they are pervasively
monitored and controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated via internal
vehicular networks and bridged to external networks as well. While this
transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency, safety and
convenience, it has also introduced a broad range of new potential risks. In
this effort, we are evaluating these risks by experimentally mapping the attack
surface of the modern automobile, identifying architectural security and privacy
vulnerabilities, and developing new defense methodologies that can provide
safety within the rubric of the existing automotive design ecosystem.
