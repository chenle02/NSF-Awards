There is a growing need for providing supplementary educational resources for
the students and parents to use at home. Access to high-quality content and
sequencing that content remain to be two of the main challenges. This team has
developed a technology that has the potential of becoming every teacher's
assistant and help them develop their instructional plans, collaborate with
their peers and experts, access high quality instructional/educational
resources, receive mentoring, and connect their students/parents to educational
resources that can be used at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology
"CPALMS" is a K-12 educator portal that includes 16 web-based apps for
curriculum planning, collaboration, and professional development. In particular,
a curriculum mapping (CMap) tool was developed to guide and assist districts,
schools, and teachers in developing interactive, detailed curriculum plans and
connect them with thousands of high quality and vetted instructional resources
to help them implement the curriculum standards (e.g., Common Core State
Standards). This tool provides smart recommendations for
instructional/educational resources based on the teacher's plans and timeline.
This portal was developed by an NSF grant which aimed to get four school
districts in Florida to pilot the portal.
