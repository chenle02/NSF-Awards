The goal of our project is to develop a set of collaborative laboratory projects
involving students from the physical chemistry classes of three colleges
(Wofford College, Converse College, and the University of South Carolina at
Spartanburg). Most of the projects involve computational chemistry (molecular
mechanics and semi-empirical or ab initio MO theory) giving the students
valuable experience with the applications and limitations of modern com-
putational investigations. The students are collaborating via an E-mail
listserver and a set of World Wide Web pages, so they also are being introduced
to important Internet tools. This project has a significant effect on our three
colleges, because the collaboration converts our small classes, in which there
are only a limited number of classmates with whom to interact, into a larger
learning community. The computational chemistry experiments also are giving
students experience with what are becoming important laboratory tools. The
project will have an impact beyond our departments because it is an example of
how small departments can become stronger by sharing resources. It is resulting
in several WWW pages containing hypermedia-based information on computational
chemistry aimed for undergraduates in a junior-level physical chemistry class.
It also is resulting in a set of new computational experiments that can be used
either as individual experiments or collaborative projects. *
