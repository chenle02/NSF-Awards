The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a technology that addresses the limitations of current circuit
breakers, at a competitive cost. The technology facilitates renewable energy
integration by direct current power systems and helps to accelerate the
development of the electrification industry to cope with the world-wide effort
in minimizing carbon footprints. The global circuit breaker market has been
reported as $16.04 billion in 2019 and is estimated to reach $25.85 billion in
the US by 2027. Among this market, direct current circuit breakers are estimated
to grow at an annual rate of 6.54% from 2019 to 2024. The pain points of the
current circuit breaker technology include, but are not limited to, slow
operation, low power density, low flexibility and reliability, no scalability,
and limited monitoring and controlling functions. In addition to these
drawbacks, the existing circuit breaker technology cannot respond to the urgent
needs of emerging electrified technologies, e.g., aerospace, marine, and
electric vehicle applications.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of emerging solid state circuit
breaker technologies to isolate fault in an electric system. The technology aims
to utilize state-of-the-art, wide bandgap, solid-state devices to increase
compactness, enhance efficiency, and operate faster. The solution includes both
software and hardware which can be adjusted for various applications with
different electrical power. The combinations of performance, design simplicity,
and low-price make this technology broadly accessible and manageable for various
applications. The technology provides scalability by presenting a modular
structure. This feature helps to push up power limitation of the current
technology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
