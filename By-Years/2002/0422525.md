The University of Idaho (UI) Computer Science and Math (CSM) Scholarship project
is increasing the number and diversity of well-trained computer science and
mathematics students who graduate with bachelor's degrees over the life of the
project. Each year, the project awards CSM scholarships of $3,000
($1500/semester) to 30 Computer Science and Mathematics students who demonstrate
academic merit and financial need, with specific efforts to include students
from underrepresented groups. The scholarships are a financial incentive that
contributes to increased retention and graduation rates compared to non-
scholarship recipients. Academic outcomes are improved by coordinating access to
student support services; mentoring to guide CSM Scholars in utilizing campus
resources, research opportunities, and internships; and outcome-oriented
monitoring of student progress. Recipients may retain their CSM Scholarships up
to three years, as long as they maintain eligibility. The PIs are working with
the Office of Multicultural Affairs, UI Department of Education TRIO programs on
campus, the College Assistance Migrant Program, and the Multicultural Outreach
Coordinator to identify and recruit students from underrepresented groups into
the program. The UI Office of Financial Aid is verifying eligibility of
students. CSM Scholars have mentors in their departments to provide academic
advising and to ensure that they are progressing in their degree programs. Job
and/or intern placement is facilitated through departmental industry contacts
and the UI Career Services Office. The departments also maintain student data to
track the students' progress, to meet NSF-led data collection requirements, and
to do a comparative assessment of the program's effectiveness.
