This project will carry out basic research in mathematical physics on topics in
the area of statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics with emphasis on the
effects of quenched disorder and critical phenomena. The topics to be studied
include: spectral properties of operators with extensive disorder with the aim
of providing a non- perturbative derivation of localization in higher-than-one
dimensional systems; properties of quantum spin systems using random-walk
techniques from classical spin models in the path integral representation of the
quantum propagators; proofs of universality in the critical behavior for a
variety of models.
