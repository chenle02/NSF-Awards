The Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium commemorates the mathematical legacy of Lars Ahlfors
and Lipman Bers. The core of this legacy lies in the fields of geometric
function theory, Teichmuller theory, hyperbolic manifolds, and partial
differential equations. However, their work has impacted and created
interactions with many other fields, such as algebraic geometry, mathematical
physics, dynamics, geometric group theory, number theory and topology. The last
several years have been a period of intense activity and progress in the field.
Recent progress includes the solutions of Thurston's Ending Lamination
Conjecture, the Bers-Sullivan-Thurston Density Conjecture, and Marden's Tameness
Conjecture, the determination of the spherical Bloch constant, a proof of the
conformal invariance of percolation, a proof of the quasi-isometric rigidity of
mapping class groups and the discovery of the relationship between Weil-
Petersson Geometry and the Witten-Kontsevich conjecture

The Colloquium will serve as a venue for the dissemination of these results and
the consideration of future directions in the field. Twelve plenary lectures
will be given by leaders in the field. Smaller workshops will provide an
excellent opportunity for young mathematicians to disseminate their work and to
interact with other young mathematicians, as well as the established researchers
in the field.
