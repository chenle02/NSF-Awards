The focus of this project is two-fold: 1) to provide undergraduates with
improved ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometric capabilities for experimentation
in analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and advanced laboratory courses and
research projects, including capability for conducting kinetics experiments, and
2) to provide computer hardware and software for students to gain experience
with computer interfacing for laboratory instrument control and data
acquisition. An integrated, multipurpose system consisting of a
spectrophotometer, accessories, microcomputer system, and associated software
will be used by undergraduate students in upper-level chemistry courses serving
chemistry, biology, and medical technology majors. Through this project Bethune-
Cookman College, an historically Black institution, will continue its
significant contribution to science education of minority students.
