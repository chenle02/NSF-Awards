The Design Theory and Methodology program has been in existence for one of its
primary goals is to develop a recognized discipline of design with an active
community of researchers. This workshop will provide an avenue for exchange of
ideas among this developing community, particularly among those who have
research grants from the design theory program and those who have participated
in the program through advisory and review panels. At the workshop, the current
grantees will make oral presentations that will be followed by smaller group
discussion focused on research issues in design theory and methodology. The
results of the workship will be disseminated to a wider audience by publication
of a book that contains the presentations plus summaries of the discussion.
