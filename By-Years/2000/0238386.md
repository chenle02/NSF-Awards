The goal of this research project is to develop efficient methods for
maintaining derived data in database systems. The approach combines ideas that
have been traditionally developed separately for different forms of derived data
(e.g., caches, indexes, replicas, etc.) to develop new techniques for derived
data maintenance, including (1) caching auxiliary data to improve database view
maintenance, (2) optimizing update processing using characteristics of update
streams, and (3) approximate view maintenance with bounded error. The research
has a broad range of applications such as data warehousing, wide-area
replication, and caching of dynamic data. Specifically, the results of this
project will be applied to the development of an integrated dataspace for
biomedical research and database replication tools for building scalable Web
services, and generate practical impacts beyond the database field. This has
broader impact on society in general. Further information on this project can be
found on the web site http://www.cs.duke.edu/dbgroup/ddm/. The educational
component of this project focuses on updating the database curriculum with three
new courses at graduate and undergraduate levels, incorporating current research
topics into teaching, attracting students with diverse academic and cultural
backgrounds and helping them apply database skills to their fields of research
or in their careers.
