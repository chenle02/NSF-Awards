Energy conservation is an important problem in battery powered portable
computers. The objective of this project is to investigate software system
techniques for conserving energy, using the knowledge about current workload and
application requirements. More specifically, the project will: (1) Develop a
systematic approach for evaluating energy conservation techniques whether they
are implemented in hardware or software. The evaluation will guide the energy
driven hardware and software design. (2) At the operating system level, develop
techniques to control the devices using the mechanisms provided by the hardware
to modify the behavior of common services for lower energy consumption. (3) At
the architecture level, design memory architectures to permit trade-off between
performance and energy consumption. (4) Develop file systems that exploit
information about applications' usage patterns and the availability of low-
power solid-state memory. (5) At the application level, design program
interfaces for conveying information to operating system about the usage
patterns and performance requirements. A combination of simulation and actual
implementations will be used to evaluate the techniques described above. The
educational component of this CAREER project will include the development of
laboratory-oriented operating systems courses for both undergraduate and
graduate students. In addition, undergraduate students enrolled in independent
studies will be encouraged to participate in the research and development of
software tools.
