9528555 Belfiore The overall objective of this research investigation is to
identify and characterize new combinations of polymeric ligands and transition-
metal salts that exhibit attractive macroscopic physical properties based on
molecular engineering design principles. Previous research has demonstrated that
transition-metal salts produce dramatic changes in the thermal and mechanical
properties of selected rubbery and glassy polymers. This technology represents
the "next step" in the search for strongly interacting "blends" and complexes.
Ultimately, one seeks to identify transition- metal compatibilizers for
immiscible polymer-polymer blends in an effrort to produce materials with
tailored properties. Miscibility occurs when the metal center coordinates to
ligands in the two dissimilar polymers. %%% The methodology to transform
immiscible polymer-polymer blends into compatible ternary mixtures via small
amounts of a transition-metal salt is a very promising new research area for
industrial applications where synergistic macroscopic physical properties are
desired in the final product. ***
