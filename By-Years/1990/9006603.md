A principal aim of the proposal work is to understand the evolution of
interactions between a herbivorous insect and several of its host plants.
Although it is generally accepted that insects evolve in response to selection
pressures mediated by plants, the role of insects attack as a cause of plant
evolution is controversial. The P.I.'s propose to initiate a preliminary
investigation of this role, using the butterfly Euphydryas editha, in which
geographical variation of diet is already well documented. Studies of
interpopulation variation of plant acceptability will quantify the contribution
of plant variation to the observed geographical variation of insect diet.
Correlations between attack rates and acceptability may suggest hypotheses about
the nature and extent of plant evolutionary responses to insect attack. Within a
plant population that shows variation of acceptability the investigators will
estimate the correlation between acceptability and fitness in the presence and
absence of insects. If there studies are successful, an experiment that
simulates the evolutionary effects of insect attack by applying artificial
selection to plant acceptability will be attempted.
