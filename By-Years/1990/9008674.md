The Science Career Paths for Minority Students program is a cooperative effort
administered by the University of California, Riverside Graduate Division. It is
designed to attract up to 25 students over a five year period from 15 different
academic disciplines in the sciences and social sciences. It allows them to
choose from over 64 ongoing research projects and provides encouragement to
pursue research or university careers. Support is provided from the summer of
their junior year through three years of graduate school with the promise of
continued support until the completion of a Ph.D. at UCR. Two summer programs
following a student's junior and senior years are intensive research mentorships
and preparation for graduate school. Senior year research traineeships allow
further experience and mentoring from faculty and graduate students. Upon entry
into graduate school at UCR, the student receives three years of fellowship
support, including fees and a research/travel allowance.
