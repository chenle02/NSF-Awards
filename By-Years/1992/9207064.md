The principal investigator will study a class of reaction- diffusion systems
that model reactive, transport and diffusive phenomena. Such models arise in a
variety of physical settings, including chemical processing, population biology,
semiconductor theory, contaminant transport, geological modelling, reservoir
flow, combustion theory and oncology. The investigation of the long term
behavior of solutions and the formation of stable spatial patterns through
boundary feeds is physically realistic and will lead to increased understanding
of the development of spatial patterns in chemical models.
