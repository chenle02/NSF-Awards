This proposal supports a project development visit by Dr. Paul Switzer,
Stanford University to develop a familiarity with methods and programs of the
Soviet team headed by Professor Keilis-Borok, International Institute of
Earthquake Prediction Theory and Mathematical Geophysics, Moscow, Russia. They
share a common goal of potential cooperative research in earthquake prediction
and statistical modelling and analysis. They anticipate a technical report
describing for U.S. readers the algorithm "M8" as it was used to obtain the
claimed prediction of the Loma Prieta event. This report will include a self-
contained description of the features of the seismic record used and an account
of all the parameters fitted. The understanding obtained in this effort will
provide the basis for future efforts to adapt modern statistical methods to
emperical earthquake prediction and validation. This project fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary
efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in
the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciptocity,
and mutuality of benefit.//
