Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing three
modules for first-year engineering students and creating a center where students
have evening access to tutors, tools to construct their design ideas, and an
area where they can take measurements and record data outside of class. The
modules, which deal with biomechanics, wind power, and water purification, are
focusing on the development of critical and creative thinking skills in first-
year engineering students. The modules include modeling, simulation,
prototyping, data collection, and data analysis tasks. The evaluation effort is
measuring changes in critical thinking and creativity using two established
instruments: the California Critical Thinking Skills Test and the Test for
Creative Thinking-Drawing Production. The investigators are disseminating their
modules and results through presentations at national conferences, through
publications in archived journals , and through postings on their website and on
the Merlot site. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the instructional
materials and the selection of course topics of interest to underrepresented
groups in an effort to increase their participation.
