9728752 Sze This grant supports travel of young scientists to participate in the
11th International Workshop for Plant Membrane Biology in Cambridge, England
(August 9-14, 1998). The central focus of the meeting is to discuss the latest
developments and discoveries in membrane transport including ion pumps,
cotransporters and ion channels, and in long distance transport. The control of
ion and metabolite transport across plasma membranes and organellar membranes is
a integral function of many life processes, including nutrient import and
distribution, transduction of hormonal and environmental signals in development,
and adaptation to environmental stress. Recent advances in this field have been
dramatic and remarkable. The funds will provide a rare opportunity for young
scientists to learn and interact with an international group of scientists, most
of whom have not spoken at meetings held in the United States. This is the only
meeting that brings such a large and diverse group of plant membrane biologists
together from all over the world.
