Professor Stephen Weber of the University of Pittsburgh is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study selective extraction of
natural products and impurities from liquid mixtures using fluorinated
materials. Fluorocarbon liquids display 'selective' solvating properties and
teflon membranes are robust. Novel systems possessing both advantages will be
developed. The work targets the development of fluorous extraction media
containing specific receptors coated onto porous alumina as substrate. The logic
is that a given artificial receptor for the analyte will have a much better
chance to induce a good extraction selectivity if the surrounding is a poor
solvent for that analyte. This project entails the basic work of developing
methods for the creation of stable, fluid fluorous media, synthesizing and
screening a library of potential receptor molecules, and preparing novel
modified electrode surfaces for sensing and extraction.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This impact of this work lies in materials chemistry,
chemical synthesis, separation, recognition, and sensor development. Selective
extraction is one of the most efficient methods for analyte enrichment and for
elimination of interferences in practical analysis. Selective extraction in a
dimensionally-stable, non-volatile media (e.g., membranes, and modified
surfaces) is often the key element in chemical sensors and sensing systems. If
selective extraction can be scaled up, it may gain industrial significance in
environmentally friendly recovery of natural substances and simple removal of
impurities.&lt;br/&gt;
