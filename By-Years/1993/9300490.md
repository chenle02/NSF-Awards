This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
proposal to provide research experiences for selected undergraduates in marine
sciences, with specific emphasis on studying how changes in land use within
coastal watersheds affect nutrient loading of ground water, nutrient transport
by groundwater, microbial transformations and consequences for the receiving
coastal bay ecosystem. This experience will acquaint them with the excitement
and opportunities of academic research and encourage them to pursue graduates
studies and a career in ocean sciences.
