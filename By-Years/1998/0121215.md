The Department of Mathematics at Eastern Illinois University will host a
Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences Regional Conference during the
week of June 9 through June 15, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of the
conference will be the dynamical behavior of the Newtonian N-body problem. The
N-body problem is one of the oldest and most challenging problems in the history
of mathematics requiring knowledge in dynamical systems, geometry, physics and
analysis. Donald Saari, of the University of California-Irvine, will give a
series of lectures on the history, present state and future outlook of the
N-body problem. These lectures will be published by the Conference Board of the
Mathematical Sciences.
