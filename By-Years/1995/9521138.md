Klinger 9521138 This project consists of a series of numerical experiments with
the goal of futhering the understanding of the basin- scale wind driven
circulation, thermohaline circulation, and the meridional heat transport. Three
basic models will be used, a three dimensional general circulation model, a two
dimensional meridional plane model, and an analytic model to describe the
feedback between ocean and atmosphere. The experiments will be conducted in a
rectangular mid-latitude basin with zonal grid spacing ranging from 0.5o (near
western boundary) to 3o, and meridional grid spacing of 2o everywhere. ***
