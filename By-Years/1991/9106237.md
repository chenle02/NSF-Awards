Collective phenomena in condensed matter systems associated with quenched
randomness and transport will be investigated. Phenomena to be studied include
the effects of thermal fluctuations and pinning on eqilibrium and non-
equilibrium behavior in Type-II superconductors in a magnetic field and statics
and dynamics of spin glasses, random magnets and other systems such as cross-
linked gels. All of these involve classical phase transitions in the presence of
randomness and slow dynamics which result from a distribution of barrier
heights. The statistical behavior of nonlinear collective transport phenomena
such as the nonlinear dynamics of flux lines in superconductors, sliding charge
density waves, fluids in porous media, sand piles and the motion of geologic
faults will be studied with an emphasis on their universal features. The effects
of randomness on low temperature quantum mechanical behavior of superfluids,
superconductors, metals and spin systems will also be investigated. In
particular, the nature of the zero temperature phase transitions, such as metal-
insulator transitions, will be studied. %%% The study of the collective behavior
of many-particle systems lies at the foundation of condensed matter, or solid
state, physics. However, very few, if any, of these systems are perfect. To
varying degrees all condensed matter systems have randomness associated with
their properties. The proposed research will study the effects of randomness in
a variety of specific systems of current interest, such as superconductors and
magnets, to determine its effects on the system statics, dynamics and transport.
This basic research will look for universal features which are common to these
systems and thus provide a solid physical understanding of the behavior of a
variety of condensed matter systems.
