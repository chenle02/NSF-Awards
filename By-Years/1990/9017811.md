The goal of this project is to understand the effects of high pressure on
grain-growth in fine-grained olivine and B-phase aggregates and on dislocation
recovery in olivine by the static annealing at high temperatures using the
multiple anvil high pressure apparatus. This study will yield the first data set
on the kinetics of grain-growth and dislocation recovery at very high pressure
under well-controlled chemical environments. The results have important
applications in a wide range of geological problems, including the evaluation of
annealing effects in paleopiezometers, the evaluation of the effects of
transformation superplasticity, and the creep mechanisms and the mechanisms of
dynamic recrystallization in these minerals.
