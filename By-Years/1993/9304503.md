This research is to do a broadband seismic experiment with 10- 15 portable
REFTEK/STS-2 seismograph systems to image the continental shield region of SE
Brazil. Carnegie Institution, in cooperation with the University of Sao Paulo
and other Brazilian institutions, will deploy the seismic array in SE Brazil for
a period of 18 months. The structure will be determined by means of seismic wave
travel times,wave-form inversion of boundary interaction phases, surface wave
inversion and by shear-wave splitting techniques. This shield area was formed
and stabilized in late Precambrian time during which a mosaic of heterogeneous
cratonic blocks and microplates of varying ages were amalgamated to form the
Gondwana supercontinent. The purpose of this study is to increase our
understanding of the evolution of the crust and upper mantle of this shield,
especially questions related to the thickness of the lithosphere.
