Julie Guthman University of California, Berkeley The doctoral dissertation
research will examine the genesis, development and character of the California
organic produce sector to demonstrate how a particular notion of `organic` has
been constituted politically, and how this definition influences the structure
and geography of the sector. The study builds on pre-dissertation research and
involves the collection, compilation and analysis of both historical and
contemporary survey data on the scale and structure of the sector. Qualitative
data on the organization of production will be gathered through in-depth, semi-
structured interviews and observations on site visits. In making explicit
connections between producers' agronomic practices and governance and the way
the sector is regulated, the work will advance our understanding of how public
policy and third party certification shapes the burgeoning field of sustainable
agriculture.
