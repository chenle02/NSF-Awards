Gilmer will continue studying integral topological quantum theories. With Gregor
Masbaum, he will study representations of mapping class groups that can be
defined using integral topological quantum theories. He also will study a
universal representation of the Torelli group that Masbaum has defined. Gilmer
plans to compute strong shift equivalence class invariants of knots and other
spaces, which can be defined using TQFT. He wishes to calculate further strong
shift equivalnce invariants to uncover their topological meaning. He has used
topological quantum theory invariants to find obstructions to fibered knots
being ribbon knots. He wants to see if there are further obstructions. In
general, he will try to use quantum topology as a tool in low-dimensional
topology. Together with Charles Livingston, he wishes to understand better which
non-orientable surfaces in half 4-space can have boundary a given knot in
3-space. Gilmer also plans to use 4-dimensional topology to study the topology
of real algebraic curves in the real projective
plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of intrinsic shape. It is
sometimes called "rubber sheet" geometry as frequently the objects one studies
can be twisted and stretched but not torn. Recently topology has experienced a
large influx of ideas from physics. Topological quantum field theory is one of
the most current and exciting areas of topology with intimate connections to
high energy physics, quantum computing as well as other areas of mathematics,
for instance number theory. Gilmer will use topological quantum theory as a tool
to study low dimensional topology. Low dimensional topology is important for
chemistry and biology as it has implications for the mechanism of DNA, and other
molecular configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
