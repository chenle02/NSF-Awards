The increased use of active-learning pedagogies, defined as ones that engage
students in their own learning by having them participate in activities and/or
discussions in class, presents unique challenges for some students. For example,
active learning may cause additional stress for students with anxiety. This
project will bring together experts from different fields to identify sources of
anxiety in active-learning biology classrooms, design interventions to help
lessen student anxiety, and to spur new research related to student anxiety in
this unique context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will plan to establish a
network that will bring together interdisciplinary experts in biology education
research, psychiatry, psychology, and student services. The network will use the
combined knowledge and experience of its members to help create more inclusive
active learning biology classes for students with anxiety. Specifically, the
network will identify sources of anxiety in biology courses using active-
learning pedagogies, articulate best practices and design large-scale,
sustainable interventions to lessen student anxiety, and coordinate future
research. Although the network will focus on biology, the results of its efforts
will likely be applicable in other disciplines, both in and outside of STEM.
This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences,
Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and
Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to
address the challenges posed in "Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology
Education: A Call to Action"
(http://visionandchange/finalreport).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
