Abstract Wallach

This project involves three seemingly unrelated parts of mathematics: the
representation theory of real reductive groups, the Fourier coefficients of
automorphic forms and the mathematics of entanglement in quantum computing. The
threads that hold these subjects together involve the invariant theory, finite
dimensional representation theory, combinatorics and the algebraic geometry of
group actions. The first two subjects have played an important role in the great
triumphs of mathematics in the twentieth century. The latter subject is in
preparation for computing in the second half of this century. The representation
theory to be studied involves finding new ways of constructing the most elusive
unitary representations which we call small in this proposal. The analysis of
Fourier coefficients involves the search for the "most general" multiplicity one
theorem for generalized Whittaker modules. The work on entanglement involves
finding useful measures of entanglement that can be used by experimental
physicists in their attempt to build quantum computers.

Representation theory has its roots in nineteenth century invariant theory,
early twentieth century quantum mechanics and mid-twentieth century number
theory. In this first decade of the twenty first century the theory has returned
to its roots. The nineteenth century invariant theory emphasized concrete
questions on binary forms with algorithmic solutions. These problems have
reemerged and are now being generalized to apply to quantum computation. Early
quantum mechanics studied puzzling and weird measurements involving photons,
electrons etc. These phenomena led to the Hilbert space approach to quantum
mechanics. The philosophical debates of the early quantum mechanics have
reemerged as quantum information technology. The Hilbert space approach also
gave birth to representation theory, which has as one of its main applications
in number theory. The Langlands program has established a goal for the twenty
first century to establish a non-commutative class field theory (Wile's proof of
Fermat's Last Theorem is actually proof of a special case of the Tanayama-
Shimura conjecture which is a special case of the Langlands program). This
project is in the interface of all of these exciting directions.
