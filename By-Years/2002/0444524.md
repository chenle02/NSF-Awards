The goal of this research is to achieve a quantitative description of network
processes that underlie one of the most basic tasks performed by nervous
systems: to use information from the environment to adaptively regulate
behavior. These experiments will be carried out on the siphon withdrawal reflex
(SWR) of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica, an experimental system that
allows network-level events to be directly related to behavioral outcomes. The
first major objective of this project is to achieve a quantitative description
of cellular events that underlie behavioral regulation in response to
ethologically relevant environmental change (calm to turbulent). A series of
physiological experiments will be performed to characterize sensory processing
of environmental information, as well as to measure subsequent changes in the
intrinsic and synaptic properties of network interneurons and motor neurons.
These measures will be used to construct a formal computational model of
environmental information processing that will allow us to systematically
explore how multiple network processes interact to regulate behavior. The second
major objective of this project is to further develop and apply this computer
model to aid our understanding of a simple form of learning, habituation.
Incorporated into the model will be physiological measurements obtained within
the SWR circuit in response to habituation training, and the model will be used
to achieve a quantitative description of cellular processes underlying this
basic form of learning. &lt;br/&gt; The broader impacts of this research lie in
the ubiquity of the basic synaptic and cellular processes analyzed, which are
common to all neural systems and have been shown to be important in their
regulation. The end result of this project should shed light not only on the
neural basis of a specific behavior and its regulation, but also on the
computational principles by which any network dynamically regulates its
responsiveness. This research will provide a multi-disciplinary training
environment for both graduate and undergraduate students seeking training in
behavioral, physiological and computational methods. The project involves
establishing a unique research-training pipeline with an outstanding liberal
arts undergraduate institution, Kalamazoo College, which will allow summer
research opportunities to be realized at Wayne State University.&lt;br/&gt;
