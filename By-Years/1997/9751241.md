A state-of-the-art remote-sensing laboratory for geosciences includes
comprehensive software packages and six Windows NT-networked computers and
enables students to analyze different types of remotely sensed data and apply
them to their respective disciplines. The IMAGINE software from ERDAS (Atlanta,
Georgia) is used to process multispectral raster-type data, and the IDL/ENVI
package from Research Systems (Boulder, Colorado) is used to process non-raster-
type data. A shareware called BILKO is used in introductory courses for students
to gain some fundamental knowledge in remote sensing. This laboratory is a major
expansion of the old single-user image processor that has been used for the past
10 years. Specific course exercises are planned to utilize satellite data from
GOES, Landsat, SPOT, NOM, Nimbus, TOPEX/Poseidon, Synthetic Aperture Radar data
from space shuttle missions, and digitized images of aerial photographs. Not
only can the archived data sets on magnetic tapes be used effectively in this
laboratory, but also students can, through Internet connection, access existing
and future remote-sensing data at NASA laboratories. It is anticipated that more
spaceborne sensors may be put into orbit, such as that in NASA's Mission to
Earth (Earth Observing System) project. This laboratory greatly enhances the
learning process in the regularly offered remote-sensing course for students in
meteorology, geology, oceanography, geography, and biology. Faculty of other
science courses who may not have used remote-sensing data before can also use
this laboratory after taking a workshop that is part of this project. The hands-
on experience of digital image analysis on workstations also brings a very
desirable strength to the technical background of the university's future
geoscientists. *
