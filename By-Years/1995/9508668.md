Dr. Robert T. Paine, Chemistry Department, University of New Mexico, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division for the study of phosphorus-boron cage molecules and
closely related species in which a phosphorus or boron atom is substituted by
another main group element. The basic objective of the project is to determine
if new polycyclic boron-phosphorus cage compounds can be formed from cyclic and
acyclic phosphinoborane molecules by sequential addition and elimination
chemistry. As a portion of the investigation, polycyclic B-P cage molecules
which contain a heteroatom will be prepared and the extent to which the size and
composition of the cage can be tailored will be assessed. Finally, these species
will be utilized as precursors to electronic material including quantum confined
semiconductors. While boron phosphide (BP) is a semiconductor with potentially
valuable electronic properties, it is currently only available as an impure
material, which displays low electron mobility and which is hard to process.
These features have retarded commercial development of BP. In this project
molecular cage molecules, which are composed of a three dimensional B-P
framework, will be prepared. These compounds, together with closely related
molecules that incorporate small amounts of yet a third element into the cage,
will be examined as precursors from which BP can be made more easily and
cleanly. As small fragments of BP will be preformed in the core of the
molecules, precise control of the size of the resulting BP may be possible,
leading to the possibility of obtaining very small particles of BP for use as
`quantum-confined semiconductors.`
