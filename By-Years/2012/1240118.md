Lions Roar: LMU Noyce Scholarship Program, a Phase I Noyce Proposal, is designed
to attract majors with an aptitude and passion for mathematics and science into
K-12 teaching and to provide them with the skills and support they need to
become effective teachers. The recruitment strategy centers on the creation of a
cohort of Noyce interns that serve as the major pool for Noyce scholars. This
project combines a strong internship-centered recruitment effort with sustained
university-wide support throughout the students' education, training and early
career. The support network has been designed specifically for mathematics and
science majors who are interested in teaching and will increase the number of
mathematics and science faculty who interact directly with students around
issues related to K-12 teaching. The aim is to create a high-profile community
of potential future teachers within the academic departments in order to provide
them with the support and recognition that will encourage additional talented
majors into the field. The program offers 40, $3000 summer internships and 36
scholarships in the amount of $20,000 annually to approximately 18 students
during their junior and senior year of study.
