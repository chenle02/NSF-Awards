9312621 Brown The objective of this research is the development of a more
complete understanding of the dominant characteristics of saline ice that can be
used to describe the mechanical behavior of saline ice relative to pure ice.
This research is a continuation of a previous National Science Foundation grant
which showed an order of magnitude difference in the material strength between
saline ice and nonsaline ice single crystals and smaller differences between the
moduli and flow stresses. In the continuation of this research several possible
micro structural mechanisms will be considered to explain these differences, to
be combined into a single constitutive equation for saline ice single crystals.
The importance of this work is based on the need for a better understanding of
microscopic cavities and the role they play in the deformation of solid
materials ***
