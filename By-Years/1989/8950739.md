This project develops a Digital Signal Processing Laboratory at Central
Michigan University to improve the quality of the undergraduate computer science
curriculum by providing students with hands-on laboratory experience in
developing and implementing algorithms for processing digital signals. The
project establishes a three workstation laboratory with the following equipment:
IBM-AT compatible microcomputers with analog data acquisition boards; signal
generators, pre- amplifiers, and microphones to generate analog signals for
analysis; and oscilloscopes, audio power amplifiers and speakers to display the
digitally processed signals. This award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
