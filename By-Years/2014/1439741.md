This award supports student involvement in the 2014 IEEE Conference on
Healthcare Innovations and Point-of-Care Technologies to be held in Seattle, WA,
on October 8-10, 2014. This conference is focused on potential innovative
technology solutions to challenges associated with care delivery. It includes
panel discussions, scientific and clinical presentations, and breakout sessions.
The conference will also offer students the opportunity to participate in an
IDEO design innovation workshop in which students will work with clinicians and
engineers to develop and conceptualize innovative ideas for healthcare
applications. The goal of this project is to involve students in all facets of
the conference, from meeting planning to presentations, the IDEO workshop and
session leadership to post-conference evaluation.
