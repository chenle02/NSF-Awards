This research is devoted to the analysis of systems with parameters that contain
uncertainties and vary on multiple scales, and the goal is to understand their
effects on the dynamics of the systems. Examples of such systems are ubiquitous
in nature: climate and weather developments, oceanography, and seismology, just
to name a few. Similarly, multiscale processes with built-in uncertainty are
common in many large-scale societal phenomena, from stock market behavior to
propagation of information through social media. The mathematical subject is
partial differential equations (PDE) with random and highly oscillatory
coefficients, and the project is aimed at deriving effective models that
incorporate the impacts from the randomness and the separation of scales. The
project is expected to result in connections to multi-scale algorithms, inverse
problems, imaging, and uncertainty quantification, as well as to have
applications in subjects such as climate prediction, geophysics, and materials
science.

The project involves three investigations, with a focus on questions related to
stochastic homogenization, wave in random media and stochastic PDE: (i) study
the quantitative aspects, including convergence rates and statistical
fluctuations, of stochastic homogenization and macroscopic models of wave
propagation in random media; (ii) analyze the effects of different correlation
properties of the randomness on both qualitative and quantitative aspects; and
(iii) investigate the transition from deterministic to stochastic models, and
study the convergence to stochastic PDE beyond the homogenization regime.
