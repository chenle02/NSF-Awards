Abstract Cappelli CTS-9622042 The PI proposes to purchase a molecular beam mass
spectrometer (MBMS) system for-near surface radical species detection during
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth taking place in a variety of systems
currently being investigated. These systems include films of diamond, diamond-
like carbon (DLC), cubic boron nitride and carbon nitride. The addition of this
instrumentation to the PI's laboratory would allow him to perform a
compositional and energy analysis of the impinging plasma (including ions and
radicals) in order to help develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of the
deposition process including the effects of ion interactions with the growth
surface, and the validation of gas phase radical transport models.
