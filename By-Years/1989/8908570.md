Construction estimating can benefit from the knowledge representation and
manipulation capabilities of Knowledge-Based Expert Systems technology.
Construction Estimating also represents the transition between design and
construction. Therefore, it can be enhanced by utilizing the object-oriented
data representation capabilities of Computer Aided Design technology. Horizontal
integration of Computer Aided Design and Knowledge-Based Expert Systems
technologies should result in improved Construction Estimating. Improved
Construction Estimating can only occur if Knowledge-Based Expert Systems and
Computer Aided Design technologies are adopted by a broad spectrum of users and
not just the innovators group. Therefore, technology transfer methodologies to
accelerate and foster their adoption should be developed. This basic research
has two primary objectives: 1) Investigate Knowledge-Based Expert Systems and
Computer Aided Design technologies for improved Construction Estimating; and 2)
Investigate methods for expediting the transfer of Knowledge-Based Expert
Systems and Computer Aided Design technologies to the Construction Estimating
process.
