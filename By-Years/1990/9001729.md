The project of F. Connolly covers a variety of topics related to topological
rigidity properties of crystallographic, arithmetic, and negatively curved
groups. His investigations also include related questions about Nil-K-theory of
such groups as well as the study of groups which act freely and cocompactly on
the product of real n-space and an m-sphere. This work is related to a number of
famous open problems, e.g., the Borel conjecture, the Novikov conjecture, and it
draws upon a broad range of techniques.
