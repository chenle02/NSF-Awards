MISETA (Multi-Instrumented Studies of Equatorial Thermosphere Aeronomy) is a
program to systematically study ionospheric and thermospheric properties in the
equatorial regions, particularly spread-F, ionospheric irregularities, and the
equatorial electrojet. It is a joint program involving Clemson University,
Boston College, Dartmouth College, and Boston University. The investigators will
continue to conduct coordinated measurements at Jicamarca, Ancon, and Arequipa,
Peru, using a variety of instruments, including coherent and incoherent scatter
radar, digisonde, spaced scintillation receiver, Fabry-Perot interferometer, and
all-sky imager. Most of the instruments are designed to run continuously, but
the study also requires more intensive experimental campaigns in which
additional instruments are deployed on a temporary basis. One campaign has been
conducted as part of the previous award, and one more campaign will be conducted
as part of the continuation. The Boston College role is to observe
scintillations and conduct numerical simulation studies of the F-region dynamo
and the onset of spread-F.***
