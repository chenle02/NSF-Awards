Interdisciplinary (99) Middlesex County College, the New Jersey Higher Education
Partnership for Sustainability (NJHEPS) and its member organizations provide
undergraduate students in a variety of two and four-year institutions in New
Jersey with both the breadth and depth of understanding in mathematics, science
and technology to enable them to participate as informed citizens in discussion
and decisions on critical environmental issues. Faculty from NJHEPS colleges and
universities, working in interdisciplinary teams, pilot-test and implement four
new instructional modules that can be used in a broad variety of undergraduate
courses and that incorporate instruction in science and technology within the
context of environmental sustainability. The WebQuest strategy for Internet
research is adapted as an instructional model within the modules. A three-stage
process provides faculty with the skills and knowledge to develop effective
instructional modules on environmental sustainability using real world issues
and research methodologies, particularly the WebQuest strategy for Internet
research.
