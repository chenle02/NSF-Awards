This project will make use of a radiation transfer model, previously developed
under NSF sponsorship, to perform sensitivity studies of the effect of arctic
stratus clouds and surface conditions on the radiative energy balance of the
atmosphere and ocean. The project will predict melting and freezing rates at the
surface and atmospheric changes.
