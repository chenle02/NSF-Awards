ESI 9353362 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Dr. Alan Berkowitz INSTITUTION: This two
year project called SYEFEST: Schoolyard Ecology for Elementary Science Teachers,
a teacher enhancement effort that focuses on outdoor biology instruction. It is
sponored by the New York Botanical Garden Inst and the Institute of Ecosystem
Studies The goals of the project are to develop outdoor ecological activities,
develop and pilot test a professional development system for training teachers
to use the activities, and to evaluate the activities and training system.
Fifteen teams (one teacher and one ecologist per team) from around the country
will develop activities appropriate for their setting (urban/suburban/ rural)
and climate. These teams will also serve as SYEFEST trainers for approximately
10 teachers at each site. The Ecological Society of America will disseminate the
model and manuals. Some of the materials which will be used may include
Feinsinger and review of OBIS. Some materials also may come from EcoInquiry. The
project will begin in 1994 and continue through 1995. The project matches 13% of
the support from the Foundation.
