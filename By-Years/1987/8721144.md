We request for studies of the lateral heterogeneity and anisotropy of the upper-
mantle beneath the Pacific Ocean, using a technique which inverts three-
component fundamental and higher-mode surface-wave and body-phase waveforms
directly for earth structure. We will concentrate our initial work on the
western, northern, and northwestern Pacific Ocean basin, accumulating data from
the GDSN and WWSSN networks. Our initial observations of waveforms traversing
this region show substantial evidence for upper-mantle anisotropy and
heterogeneity not easily explained by simple age-dependent models, including a
large area of anomalous fast velocities beneath the northwestern Hawaiian Swell
and the Shatsky Rise. Preliminary estimates of polarization anisotropy for
"normal" paths indicate that SH velocities are everywhere faster than SV
velocities at least to the bottom of the low-velocity zone. Experiments with
synthetic data demonstrate the ability of our technique to resolve the
distribution of anisotropy with depth and the lid/anisotropy tradeoff.
