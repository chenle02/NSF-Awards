Exploring techniques which increase the power and efficiency of object-oriented
languages is the focus of this project. The design and implementation of Cecil
(a multiple-dispatching, object-oriented programming language) will play a
central role in this research. In particular, programs which manipulate complex
data structures will be optimized.
