In this project we will continue studying the algebraic K-theory of infinite
groups G with torsion. These K-groups have important topological applications in
Wall's finiteness obstruction theory and hence in the problem of classifying
high-dimensional manifolds of a fixed homotopy type. In this project we will use
the Farrell?Jones isomorphism conjecture as a conceptual approach towards the
computation of the algebraic K-theory of infinite groups with torsion. F. T.
Farrell and L. Jones conjecture states that the algebraic K-theory of the
integral group ring ZG comes from the algebraic K-theory of the virtually cyclic
subgroups of G. This conjecture has been proven for large classes of groups, and
leads to very concrete calculations. The proposed research will use this
conjecture to compute the lower algebraic K-groups of the following groups among
others: hyperbolic n-simplex reflection groups, hyperbolic reflection groups,
three-dimensional and four-dimensional crystallographic groups, Bianchi groups,
Hilbert modular groups, and three-dimensional orbifold groups. We also intend to
get some preliminary results on the lower algebraic K-theory mapping class
groups (for these groups the Farrell-Jones Conjecture is still open). All of
these groups are of interest in low-dimensional topology.

Algebraic K-theory plays an important role in many areas of modern mathematics:
most notably algebraic topology, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In
topology, surgery theory is the name given to a collection of techniques used to
produce one manifold from another in a controlled fashion. Surgery refers to
cutting out parts of the manifold and replacing it with a part of another
manifold, matching up along the cut or boundary. With the development of this
theory in the 1960's, many problems in high dimensional topology, in particular
the classification of high dimensional manifolds, were found to have
obstructions in (and were often classified by) the algebraic K-theory of the
integral group ring of the fundamental group G of the manifold being studied. As
such, it is of great interest to obtain explicit computations of these K groups
for various groups G.
