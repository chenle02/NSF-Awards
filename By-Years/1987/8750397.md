This project would fund a micro computer classroom/laboratory dedicated to
economics, statistics and quantitative methods, class support and student
research. The economics and statistics department currently relies on the campus
mainframe computers (Cyber) and standard academic software (Minitab, SPSS) for
course projects in business statistics and uses programs written by faculty for
pedagogical support in economic theory courses. This environment is not easy for
undergraduates to deal with and is not typical of the situation they will work
in after graduation. Further, the quantitative and statistical software being
developed for business today is designed for the stand alone desktop
environment. Micro computers will be significantly more "user friendly" and will
permit the faculty to concentrate their instruction on the theory and techniques
of the subject matter without having to teach the student how to use the
computer.
