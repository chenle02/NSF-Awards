This grant supports the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to
support research on fundamental phenomena in materials. It will also be used as
a training center for undergraduate students, where they will learn techniques
and processes employed in doing research in areas of Physics, Biology, Materials
Science and Chemistry. The University of Puerto Rico, Cayey (UPR, Cayey) is a
non-PhD. granting institution located in the mountainous center of the U.S.
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Two representative projects that will use the SEM
capabilities are: (1) The synthesis of cubic boron nitride thin films using
physical vapor deposition; and (2) Characterization and optimization of metal-
insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of
Physics will offer a course on SEM techniques in which the principles and
techniques associated with the study of soft and hard matter will be introduced.
The students will have hands-on experience preparing samples and producing
three-dimensional images at high resolution. A short course will also be
prepared to certify students who will use the instrument as part of their
research. The course of Experimental Methods of Physics will use the SEM as one
of its stations where the students will develop experiments. Students from
biology courses, such as Botany, are also expected to be participants. Ten
percent of the instrument time will be assigned to demonstrations and workshops
on the use and applications of SEM, particularly aimed at students registered in
courses such as Physical Sciences and Analytical Chemistry, pre-college students
from the community, and others who are interested. A special workshop is planned
for middle and high school female students to stimulate them to pursue careers
in sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
