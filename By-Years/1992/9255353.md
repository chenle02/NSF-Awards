The Durham City Schools and the Durham County Schools have established a
partnership with the University of North Carolina Mathematics and Science
Education Network to improve the achievement of minority students in mathematics
and science. The Mathematics and Science Achievement Project uses the successful
existing model of the MSEN pre-college program and extends it to reach
elementary students and increased numbers of middle and high school students.
The Mathematics and Science Achievement Project uses in school activities with
minority students in the primary grades, elementary clubs for minority students
in the intermediate grades, in-school enrichment classes and university programs
for minority students in middle school, and after school clubs and university
programs for minority students in high school. Teachers will be given training
in extending the mathematics and science curriculum and in bias-free classroom
teaching techniques. Parents will be given advocate training. The Mathematics
and Science Achievement Project will be planned and implemented by the Durham
Public Schools with assistance from the Mathematics and Science Education
Network.
