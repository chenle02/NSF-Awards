This project concerns several problems in probability theory. One class of
problems addresses the evolution of random surfaces according to the KPZ
equation, named after its discoverers, Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang. Random
surfaces have attracted a lot of recent attention in probability theory, and
there are many unanswered questions. This project will aim to answer some of
these questions. A second class of problems involves extending and developing a
theory of lower bounds on fluctuations of random variables. Understanding
fluctuations of random variables is one of the basic goals of probability
theory, but there are many important problems where existing methods do not give
desirable results. The PI aims to make some progress in this area by providing a
new set of tools. Finally, a third class of problems centers around
understanding ultrametric spaces that arise in the study of models from
statistical mechanics. The strategy of working on problems in varied areas of
probability theory at the same time has the potential of uncovering new
connections.

The problems concerning the KPZ evolution are mainly about producing a solution
of the equation in 2D. This would be an important breakthrough because the task
of constructing any solution for the 2D KPZ equation has remained intractable so
far. The results about fluctuation lower bounds would give the optimal
conditions under which the current best lower bounds can be proved for planar
growth models. Previously, such lower bounds required restrictive conditions.
The proposed method of solution is based on a novel coupling, which may be of
independent interest. The research on ultrametricity will shed light on the
hierarchical organization of states in spin glass models, especially for models
with full replica symmetry breaking. It will also introduce a novel connection
between the study of these models and tools from graph theory such as
Szemeredi's regularity lemma.
