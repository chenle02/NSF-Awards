The main focus of this project is the mathematical analysis of complex phenomena
occurring in nature. The models under investigation originate from condensed
matter physics and quantum information theory and describe various physical
concepts ranging from quasiparticles in solids, to superconductivity and
measures of entropy and entanglement. Besides understanding the mathematical and
physical principles at work in some specific systems, analytical tools will be
developed which are mathematically interesting beyond the context of these
concrete problems and which will be applied to answer questions in pure
mathematics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate
students and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically,
the PI will revisit the polaron problem, will investigate the connection between
a microscopic and a macroscopic theory of superconductivity and study functional
inequalities in both a commutative and a noncommutative setting. Attention will
focus on a recently emerging area at the interface between harmonic analysis and
calculus of variations. A unifying feature of all these problems is that from a
certain (almost) optimality property one wants to conclude that the objects in
question have a relatively simple structure. Mathematical tools to achieve this
are often related to semiclassical analysis in a low regularity setting, and a
major goal is to quantify the underlying non-commutativity, which is inherent to
quantum physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
