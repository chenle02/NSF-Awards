This project will combine innovative sampling techniques to trace evolutionary
patterns of dinosaur diets and habitats. Combining methods of measuring wear
patterns and determining the chemical composition of dinosaur teeth can help
determine where these animals were living and what they were eating. The two
objectives of this project are to examine the dietary evolution of a group of
herbivorous dinosaurs called neoceratopsian, and to identify dietary variation
in a growth series of protoceratopsian dinosaurs. The goal of this study is to
quantify the diets of extinct herbivorous dinosaurs, something that has been
previously shrouded in mystery.

This project will provide for numerous mentoring opportunities at the American
Museum of Natural History and in the greater New York City area. Moreover,
results from these analyses will be disseminated in museum educational programs,
scientific papers, and at national conferences. It will expose the public to
innovative methods being used to study dinosaurs through the engaging concept of
dietary reconstruction.
