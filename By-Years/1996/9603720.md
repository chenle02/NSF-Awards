Steroid hormones derived from the gonads or the adrenals, have long been known
to have profound effects on cellular and organismal function. The classical
mechanism by which these hormones affect cellular function is by interacting
with intracellular receptors, which upon binding translocate to the nucleus of
the cell and alter gene expression. However, recent physiological experiments
have revealed that steroid hormones also bind to membrane-rich cellular
fractions and exert rapid effects on neuronal cells. Dr. Ramirez is isolating
and characterizing these binding sites able to elicit rapid changes in cellular
function. In these investigations, Dr. Ramirez is using a brain library to
isolate a cDNA clone for this novel receptor and to characterize the encoded
protein. If successful, the research supported by this SGER award will greatly
change our understanding of steroid hormone action in the brain and open an
entire new field of scientific investigation in the neurosciences.
