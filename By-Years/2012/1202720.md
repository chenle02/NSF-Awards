Brain Connectivity During Human Locomotion

While walking is an activity most people do every day, how the brain functions
during this movement remains an open scientific question. The project goal is to
determine what brain areas are active, what roles they play, and how they
interact throughout specific walking and walking-like behaviors. To accomplish
this, electrocortical simulations will be used to determine what specific
aspects of interaction are captured by a variety of functional connectivity
measures. Next, independent component analysis will identify neurological
sources from EEG data recorded during standing and walking in healthy and
Parkinson's subjects, and in healthy subjects performing a simplified version of
walking. Finally, functional connectivity will be measured between EEG signals
and electrocortical sources in brain regions such as the anterior cingulate and
the left and right sensorimotor cortices during these conditions to determine
how the brain functions move the body in a changing environment. This research
will provide the fellow with experience in computational neuroscience. The
project's results may benefit compromised populations by improving
rehabilitation practices, such as in analysis and treatment of movement
disorders. Understanding brain function in individuals with Parkinson's or
spinal cord injury, could potentially lead to assistive devices that restore
motor function. Further, this project will aim to increase the number of women
involved in science by mentoring undergraduates and by putting on a camp for
young girls that uses hands-on labs to show how neuroscience and math can
explain simple everyday movements.
