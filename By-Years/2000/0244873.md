The proposed research will focus on the investigation of nonabelian Gauge
Theories, non-Abelian fluids and non-commutative gravity. The PI proposes to use
analytic Hamiltonian methods to extract the finite temperature behavior of Yang
Mills theory in 3+1 dimensions as well as string breaking. The main tool will be
to use a set of gauge invariant matrix variables. The PI will study the
quantization of a nonabelian generalization of fluid mechanics that he has
developed. The PI will study applications to astrophysics as well as study the
quark gluon plasma in out of equilibrium situations. As a final project the PI
intends to study theories of noncommutative gravity described by finite
dimensional matrices. The main advantage of this approach is to be able to have
finite mode approximations to gravity that preserve various invariance
requirements.
