This project will continue and extend the P.I.'s path-breaking work in studying
the learning mechanisms at work in the cerebral cortex of mammals. The learning
algorithms now popular in neuroengineering are not powerful enough to explain
these mechanisms; the P.I. has studied the reasons why, and is working to
develop more powerful algorithms. He is working closely with neurobiologists to
find new evidence for what kinds of mechanisms are actually used in the brain,
at a very detailed level.
