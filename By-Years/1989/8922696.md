This research will investigate the patterns and timing of latest Pleistocene
deglaciation and particularly of Holocene climatic change as recorded in
fluctuations of glaciers on the Kenai Peninsula, southwest Alaska. Work will
focus in the landfast glaciers, which here lack evidence of irregular flow and
which may be expected to have experienced cycles of advance and retreat similar
to those that are widely recorded in Alaska, but with variations reflecting
individual aspect, position and hypsometry. Calving outlet glaciers in the Kenai
Fjords National Park, by contrast, have displayed prolonged advanced followed by
dramatic retreat in cycles dominated by such factors as fjords depth and
configuration, water circulation, and ice-marginal sediment accumulation.
Evaluation of moraine modification as well as the methods of radiocarbon dating,
tephrochronology, lichenomentry and dendrochronology, will be critically applied
in building the glacial chronology. Because most of the ice tongues end in
forested areas, tree-ring dating of surfaces and selective cross-dating of
living trees with buried wood may be a particularly powerful dating tool.
