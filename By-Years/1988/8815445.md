The islands of the Caribbean Sea are populated by assemblages of plant and
animal species that appear to have derived from North America, Central America
and South America. The Yellow Warbler, (Dendroica petechia), is broadly
distributed in North America and is represented by subspecies in the Caribbean,
Central and South America that differ in plumage coloration of the head. This
study will use recombinant DNA techniques and modern statistical methods to
examine the genetic structure of the Yellow Warbler species population with
special emphasis on the origin and relationships of the Caribbean populations.
The research will be one of the first applications of restriction enzyme
analysis of mitochondrial DNA to the study of avian diversity and will lead to
an understanding of the roles of dispersal, historical biogeography and sexual
selection in the evolution of diversity.
