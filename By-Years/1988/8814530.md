This award will support collaborative research between Dr. George Bruening of
the University of California, Davis, and Dr. W.L. Gerlach of the Division of
Plant Industry, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO), Canberra. The investigators will analyze the functions of, and
evolution of genetic sequences in, the satellite RNA of the tobacco ringspot
virus, which acts as a parasite on, and therefore biological control for, the
ringspot virus itself. Mutations of the satellite RNA will further be studied to
assess their ability to replicate, to be incorporated in, and to protect plants
from the effects of other viruses. The project combines the expertise of the two
investigators and their laboratories. The U.S. investigator is an expert on the
proteins and nucleic acids involved in the replication of the tobacco ringspot
virus RNA satellite, and has been successful in cloning separately the substrate
and enzyme RNAs of this virus; the Australian investigator is an expert in the
preparation of mutant satellite RNAs and transgenic plants. This research will
contribute to fundamental understanding of how satellite RNAs function, and will
guide future research in biologically engineered resistance to plant viruses.
