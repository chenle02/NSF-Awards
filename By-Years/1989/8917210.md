This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Broadbelt-Lustig's
Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of her research at the
University of Texas/Austin. The main thrust of her research will be a study of
the fundamental aspects and analytical applications of ion/molecule reactions
using a Quadrupole Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer. By this technique, ions can be
stored for long periods of time, allowing for time- and pressure-dependent
studies of highly specific gas-phase reactions. Specifically, the phenomena of
intermolecular catalysis will be studied, internal ion/molecule reactions of
cluster ions will be examined and the effects of kinetic and internal excitation
of ions prior to reaction will be probed. Insights gained through these studies
will provide a basis for exploring ion/molecule reactions of complex,
analytically relevant molecules such as lactone polymers.
