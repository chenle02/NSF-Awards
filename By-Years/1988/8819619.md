A demonstration network of sounders of the vertical atmospheric wind structure
is currently being deployed by the National Weather Service. These "profilers"
are based on Doppler radar principals and represent a major advancement in
operational instrumentation. Currently, operational wind measurements are made
by balloon borne packages every twelve hours. The profilers will not only be
capable of measurements every six minutes, but also will have better vertical
resolution. It is anticipated that these new instruments will provide research
opportunities beyond what was previously possible from operational data. The
Principal Investigators will use data from the demonstration network as well as
precursor experimental networks in a variety of mesoscale research activities.
Emphasis will be on the physical understanding of the formation and maintenance
of fronts, jets and mesoscale features of cyclones. Of special interest is the
diagnosis of the processes occurring in the formation of small-scale cyclones in
polar airstreams over land. The hourly evolution of the severe-storm environment
also will be studied to relate the vertical shear profile to the character of
convective storms.
