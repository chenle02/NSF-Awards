*** 9760942 Hang This is a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I proposal.
Currently, technology to help individuals with low vision consists primarily of
optical or electronic magnifiers. Optical magnifiers, both microscopes and
telescopes, can be hand-held, stand-mounted, or headmounted. For most such
devices, magnification and focal distance are fixed. Electronic magnifiers
include closed-circuit television systems, used chiefly for reading, and
hardware and software to enlarge text on computer screens. Closed circuit TV's
have the added capability of electronically boosting or reversing contrast.
Existing displays typically use a liquid crystal display (LCD), a light emitting
diodes (LED), or a miniature cathode ray tube (CRT) as an image source, which
relay this image via an infinity-focus optical system to the eye. All of these
display devices are bulky, heavy, and drain extensive battery power. The goal of
this program is to demonstrate that a low-weight, head-mounted, low-vision
display device (LDD) can be built so that the real-time, high contrast image,
which is captured by a charge-coupled-device (CCD), is projected (scanned) to
the healthy portion of the retina. Unlike conventional projectors, this one has
no moving parts, bulky optics, or energy consuming light sources. The LDD will
also be inexpensive to produce. We anticipate that this innovation will open up
a new avenue in the field of head-mounted display, which has wide applications
in pilot training, medicine, telemedicine, and entertainment. ***
