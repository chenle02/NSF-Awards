Current research on a first-order functional language (NESL) that supplies
parallelism through a set of data-parallel constructs based on vectors is
extended in several directions. One is the testing of the language via
scientific applications algorithms. Another is the addition of polymorphic types
to the language. Yet another is the examination of lazy load-balancing based
upon dynamic testing. In addition, implementations on several newer high
performance machines is carried out.
