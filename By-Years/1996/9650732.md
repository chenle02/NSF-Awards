The Physics Department offers several sections of an algebra-based introductory
physics course to a total of about 200 students each semester. The course is
taught using a traditional large lecture and separate lab format. Research has
shown that this format is not effective in motivating students and producing
significant learning results. This finding has led to the need to redesign the
introductory physics courses. The purpose of these changes is to increase
student comprehension, interest, and performance in introductory physics
classes; better integrate labs and lectures; and tailor the class to the needs
of the students' major fields of study. Participants in this project are
accomplishing these objectives by implementing a 'studio' instructional format.
This format is an interactive instructional system based on networked computer
workstations linked to a server controlled by the instructor. Between short
lecture segments, students can perform experiments or run computer simulations
at their desks. The instructors can videotape demonstrations, digitize the data,
and pass those data directly to the students for analysis. For each physical
concept, students at different workstations can study different applications
relevant to their respective majors. The studio replaces traditional lectures
and labs by combining both into a single learning experience. Most technology
programs and several science curricula require introductory algebra-based
physics. Making it into an exciting discovery course, adapted to the students'
respective fields of study, can have a great impact on many programs throughout
the university. Software modules developed for this project can be disseminated
through the Internet and possibly a workshop.
