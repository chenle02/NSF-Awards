The proposed research involves continuing work on the total synthesis of several
heterocyclic natural products including cylindrospermopsin, angelastatin A, and
selected cyclindricines. A number of organic reactions will be used and
developed for the syntheses, including cycloaddition of N-sulfinyl urea,
selenium-induced cyclization of allyl guanidine, and Pd(0) mediated pyrrole
cyclization. With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program provides continuing support for the research of Dr. S.M. Weinreb of the
Department of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania State University. The research
involves the synthesis of several important natural products with interesting
biological properties, and includes the development of new synthetic methods
applicable to these compounds, which have not previously been made in a
laboratory. The work will provide valuable training to graduate students and
post-doctoral fellows in the organic synthesis of natural products.
