This project will study and develop technology for Elastic Optical Networks
(EONs). In EONs flexible amounts of spectral bandwidth may be allocated to each
data channel without requiring adherence to a fixed wavelength grid. Such an
approach is well-suited for supporting a wide range of dynamic traffic demands
in a bandwidth-efficient manner. Key enabling technologies, optical arbitrary
waveform generation&lt;br/&gt;(OAWG) and optical arbitrary waveform measurement
(OAWM), will enable elastic optical networking over a large spectrum by dividing
the spectrum into spectral slices and dynamically processing information at
lower rates compatible with CMOS electronics. The project will leverage these
technologies as a basis for innovative hardware and software solutions for EON
technology, architectures, protocols, network control and management, system
integration, and testbed integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in the
basic architecture and technology for optical networking is important for US
competitiveness. The project will work with several US-based industrial
organizations as a means of technology transfer. The research results and
publications will likely to impact standardization activities of flexible grid
networking (e.g. International Telecommunication Union ITU-T SG15 on flex grid).
The project will link education and research and serve as a rich platform for
crossdisciplinary education in optical and higher-layer networking, and in
computer engineering.
