This project will complete theoretical calculations of the scattering of ionic
and neutral oxygen and the extension of the methodology developed to other
systems of importance in the upper atmosphere. The first component of the work
is to study the interaction between O+ and O, one of the most important
collision processes in the upper atmosphere. Secondly, the PI will use the
coupled channel model for the interaction of O+ with O to calculate various
other properties of the system that can be compared with high precision
spectroscopic data.
