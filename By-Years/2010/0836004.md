Models of negotiator decision making typically assume that each side is an
individual, but important negotiations are often conducted by groups.
Differences in group members' preferences, motives and information can all
contribute to serious within-group conflicts, which can in turn threaten the
success of between-group negotiations. While there have been plenty of instances
in which within-group conflict has led to failures of governmental, union or
corporate negotiations, we do not as yet understand systematically how
intragroup conflicts threaten intergroup negotiation
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do within-group processes affect between-
group negotiations -- and vice-versa? This project seeks to answer these
questions by testing hypotheses about negotiator aspirations, motives, and
information processes in groups in intergroup negotiation. It also explores the
impact of such group-level phenomena as status contests, autocratic versus
democratic group leadership, within-group disagreement, and diversity of
cultural values. The experiments use a unique combination of two laboratory
paradigms, bilateral integrative bargaining (multiple-issue tasks that allow a
range of possible agreements) and public good social dilemmas (which relates to
individuals' inclinations to cooperate with their groups). The results should
have practical implications for intergroup negotiations in many contexts,
including within and between governments and organizations.
