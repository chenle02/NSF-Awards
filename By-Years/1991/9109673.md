Cardiovascular and respiratory functions are regulated by nerve cells in an
area of the brainstem called the nucleus of the solitary tract. Dr. Barnes'
research is aimed at recording activity in this area of the brainstem in order
to determine how it functions. Hypotension and bradycardia can be produced by
application of two neuropeptides, substance P and angiotensin II, into this
area. The interactions of these two substances and their effects on autonomic
nervous system functioning will be studied. This research will contribute to
understanding the role of neuropeptides in the control cardiovascular and
respiratory functions.
