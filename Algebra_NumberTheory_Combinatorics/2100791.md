This project lies in an area of algebra that is being developed with a view
toward applications in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics. A particular focus
is on the theory of Poisson-Lie groups and cluster algebras. The former has long
served as a natural framework in which important exactly solvable models of
classical and quantum mechanics can be studied. The latter, discovered by Fomin
and Zelevinsky in 2001, have since been shown to have numerous exciting
connections with a wide range of mathematical subjects, including combinatorics,
representation theory, algebraic and Poisson geometry, as well as mirror
symmetry and statistical and high energy physics. The PIs will build upon their
previous collaborations to continue a systematic study of multiple cluster
structures in coordinate rings of a number of varieties of importance in
algebraic geometry, representation theory and mathematical physics and study an
interaction between corresponding cluster algebras. This research will be linked
to the development of undergraduate and graduate courses and research projects.
Synergistic activities are planned to promote inter-institutional and inter-
departmental cooperation, to attract graduate students from underrepresented
groups and with diverse educational backgrounds, and, through community
outreach, to expose high school students to mathematical research.

The PIs will work on applications of Poisson geometry to the theory of cluster
algebras. In more detail, the main goals of the project include: 1) construction
and study of generalized cluster structures on Poisson-Lie groups and Poisson
homogeneous varieties including Poisson-Lie groups equipped with Belavin-
Drinfeld brackets, Drinfeld doubles and Poisson-Lie duals of simple Poisson-Lie
groups,and K-theoretic Coulomb branches of 3d N = 4 SUSY gauge theories; and 2)
applications of generalized cluster structures on Poisson varieties to classical
and non-commutative discrete, integrable systems that arise as sequences of
cluster transformations, representations of quantum groups at roots of unity,
and higher Teichmuller theory.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
