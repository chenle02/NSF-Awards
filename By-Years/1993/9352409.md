9352409 Trachtman The project will purchase a nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer for incorporation into organic, analytical, polymer and physical
chemistry laboratories. This new instrument will allow a guided systematic
introduction of new experiments that will illustrate principles of NMR theory.
Approximately 550 students each year will be provided with NMR theory and
approximately 50 students each year will be provided with hands-on experience to
enable them to solve problems related to molecular structure and chemical
reaction. ***
