The University of Georgia through Dr. Charles Bender will provide ten (10)
students in chemistry an opportunity to understand computational chemistry and
computer technology and will afford the undergraduate an opportunity to conduct
a modest research project using the knowledge they had gained from the
workshops. The students will investigate several scientific computer language,
including symbolic types, such as LISP and it will explore several kinds of
computer architectures from the personal computers to high speed supercomputers.
The activity will be well supported by staff from computer vendors and will
involve several Georgia staff who are authorities in Theoretical Chemistry,
pattern recognition, programming and protein sequencing.
