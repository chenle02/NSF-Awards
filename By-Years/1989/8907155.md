Professor John S. Dahler is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop a theory of laser-induced collision
processes. Experimental studies have demonstrated the fact that reactions which
occur in colliding molecular beams are influenced by the presence of laser
fields to the extent that laser-induced association depends on the polarization
of the laser light. This research has a potential long term impact in furthering
our understanding of laser-induced chemistry. Dahler will develop theories to
explain experimental observations in the following areas: 1) field free
associative and Penning ionization which occurs in molecular beam collision
experiments; 2) the effects of polarization on chemi-ionization and laser-
induced excitation transfer processes; and 3) the characteristics of transiently
populated quasi-molecular states produced during laser-induced collisional
processes. Dahler will also develop the necessary numerical and computational
methods to perform computer simulations in support of these theoretical
developments.
