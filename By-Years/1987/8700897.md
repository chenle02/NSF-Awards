Bifurcations in differential equations with symmetry will be studied from a
theoretical and applied standpoint. In this context the term "bifurcation"
refers to a radical change in the solution set of an equation as parameters in
the equation pass through certain critical values. A particular system under
consideration is a model of Conette-Taylor flow in which fluid systems with
symmetries other than rotational are also studied.
