This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning in April 1989, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in research on projects
in Analytical, Inorganic, Organic, Physical and Biochemistry, under the
direction of a faculty member in the School of Chemistry at RPI. One group of
students targetted for participation is junior chemistry majors who will follow-
up on their summer projects during the academic year, producing a Senior Thesis.
