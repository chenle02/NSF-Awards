DMS-0405948&lt;br/&gt;Peter M. Magyar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will
examine combinatorial problems related to representations of Lie groups, both
finite and infinite-dimensional. The aim is to gain an explicit combinatorial
description of the representations, and conversely to use representation theory
to answer combinatorial questions. First he will work in Sperner Theory, which
examines methods to organize sets and numbers in ``non-interfering'' ways. The
investigator will use a new connection with crystal bases of quantum group
representations to address combinatorial problems involving Symmetric Chain
Decomposition of posets. Next, he aims to apply combinatorics, specifically the
Littelmann and Kyoto path models, to control and clarify the algebraic structure
of loop group representations. Finally, the investigator will explore
generalizations of combinatorial and geometric representation theory to
configuration varieties, multiple flag varieties, and quiver
representations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representation theory is the theory of
symmetric objects. Since symmetry is usually the key to obtaining exact
solutions in complicated situations, representation theory is one of the most
powerful tools in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The investigator's work
seeks to describe various kinds of symmetry in explicit combinatorial terms. Put
simply, the aim is to understand the objects in n-dimensional (and infinite-
dimensional) space, which, like the circle or sphere, have a large, continuous
family of symmetries, and to encode this symmetry in discrete
combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;
