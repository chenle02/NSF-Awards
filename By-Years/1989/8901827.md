This program will consist of producing copper ions along with other defects (F
centers, M centers) by x-irradiation of copper- doped (and other alkali halide)
xtals. They will study the recovery of copper ions by annealing processes, i.e.,
temperature dependence, dependence on F centers, etc. They will also use optical
absorption, thermoluminescence (TL) and electron spin resonance (ESR).
