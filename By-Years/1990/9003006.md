One important theoretical area in the field of network management and control
is the management of protocols. The principal investigator of this research will
consider prevention, diagnosis, and correction of protocol faults and
inefficiencies, from a network management perspective. In the context of this
research, the concept of "protocol" refers to any system hardware and software
that can be modelled by communication finite state machines. The research will
address three problems: 1. the distributed diagnosis of protocol faults in
distributed systems, 2. the synthesis of protocols whose performance can be
controlled, and 3 the generation of test cases for input output testing of
protocols for verification and certification. The work builds on classical
results of protocol analysis and synthesis, but seeks new formulations and
solutions within the framework of network management.
