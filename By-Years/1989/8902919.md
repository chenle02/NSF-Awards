Professor Kammeyer will study finite extensions of multi- dimensional Bernoulli
shifts. (Multidimensional here refers to the action of several commuting
transformations on a probability space, as opposed to the action of a single
transformation. A finite extension of the base process is a skew product of it
with an action of a finite permutation group.) In particular, she will seek to
determine when such an extension is itself a Bernoulli process. Her conjecture
is that this occurs if the extension is weakly mixing, and that otherwise the
possibilities are finite in number and explicitly identifiable. The one-
dimensional case of all this is well-understood and has found applications to
flows that arise naturally in differential geometry. Similar appli- cations are
envisioned for multidimensional results. The mathematical research to be
undertaken by Professor Kammeyer falls under the heading of ergodic theory. The
basic concern of this subject is what happens on the average, over the long run,
when a transformation of a space (say for concreteness a geometric object) is
iterated many times. Useful results in this area tell one that if fine structure
of the underlying space is ignored, and if the transformation mixes things up
thoroughly, then only a manageable number of distinct situations can occur.
There is now considerable interest, as exemplified in Professor Kammeyer's
project, in extending such results to the case of several transformations acting
simultaneously and interchange- ably. This project is supported under the
Research Opportunities for Women initiative.
