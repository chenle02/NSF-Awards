This award provides funding to the University of Illinois-Chicago for a three-
year, REU Site in Novel Materials and Processing under the direction of Dr.
Christos G. Takoudis. This ten-week summer program, will involve ten students
annually in individual research projects covering topics that will include
property-based appraches to materials design and manufacturing, facilitated
fluidized bed combustion synthesis, measuring activity and selectivity of novel
catalytic materials, thin film growth, and nanostructures of colloidal micelles.
The students will be provided with a comprehensive research and educational
experience in novel materials and processing and will be given ample opportunity
to exercise their originality and creativity, to develop enthusiasm for
technology development, and to experience technology creation as an exciting and
challenging career path.
