ITR: New Directions in Software Security

Amit Sahai

It is widely believed that the greatest threat to computer security today is not
cryptographic weakness but rather flawed software design and implementation, and
weakness in protecting information within software and hardware. This research
proposes to develop the area of software security - protecting functional
objects from vulnerabilities by means of fully automated software and hardware
transformations. The approaches proposed in this research attempt to build a
novel and theoretically sound foundation to this field.

First, this research considers the broad area of software transformations to
counteract security vulnerabilities caused by flaws ("bugs") in software. In
particular, this project will develop theoretical foundations and tools for
preventing attacks which exploit flaws to gain control of remote systems. More
generally, this research will aim to classify the security that computationally
limited software transformations can provide.

Second, this research considers the question of software and hardware privacy --
how to ensure that an adversary cannot learn important secrets by examining
software or hardware. In this case, this research will study transformations
such that, when the attacker gains access to the transformed software or
hardware, it cannot learn specific secrets embedded in the original software or
hardware, such as cryptographic keys or potentially even secret algorithmic
techniques. This research will propose such transformations for hardware and
software under various assumptions, and seek to determine when such protection
is impossible.
