9307980 Repko Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be
concerned with studying the interactions among the carriers of the weak nuclear
force. These forces can be probed at high energy collisions at facilities such
as the Superconducting Super Collider. The research will be important for an
elucidation of the origin of weak nuclear forces. ***
