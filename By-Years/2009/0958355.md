Testing represents one of the major manufacturing costs in the semiconductor
industry. Designing circuits with testability features significantly reduces
testing costs and time. Thus, it is important for designers to be exposed to the
concepts in testing which can help them design better and reliable
products.&lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative project between the University of
Toledo (UT) and Ohio Northern University (ONU), a "Digital/VLSI Test and
Reliable Computing Research Laboratory" is being established for the development
of computationally intensive algorithms and use of commercial CAD tools for
testing digital, VLSI, and advanced semiconductor
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the research projects being carried out
include: Novel Testing Techniques for Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) circuits;
Built In Self Test (BIST) for Embedded SRAMS in System on Chips; Testing Look-
Up-Table (LUT) Delay Aliasing Faults in SRAM Based FPGAs Using Half-Frequencies;
Analysis and Testing of Electromigration Failures; Testing and Modeling Soft
Errors in FPGAs; Reliability Analysis and Device Failures in Advanced
Semiconductor Devices; Reliability Issues Related to Power Consumption in VLSI
Chips during Test; and Small Delay Defects and Test
Generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational modules developed from the research
carried out in this project are integrated into a number of graduate and
undergraduate courses at ONU and UT. Since applications of semiconductor chips
are far and wide, many different industries including auto, aerospace, defense
and healthcare may benefit from this project.
