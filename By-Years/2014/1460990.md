University of Michigan chemistry professors Brian Coppola and Melanie Sanford
co-direct the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in
Interdisciplinary Chemistry, funded by the Chemistry Division of NSF. This is a
continuation of a long established program that began in 1989. In this renewal,
15 students from around the United States, recruited primarily from settings
where individuals do not have the opportunity to carry out graduate-level
research, spend 10 weeks engaged as full-fledged participants in the
department's research groups. There is a recruiting emphasis on women and
students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;Additional activities
(lectures, workshops, trips, and social events), offered jointly with other
programs on- and off-campus, provide a broad integration into scientific and
professional communities. A regional poster session is the culminating activity
each summer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students participate in a diverse collection
of modern research problems centered in the interdisciplinary chemical programs
in the University of Michigan chemistry department, including chemical biology,
organometallics, energy, sustainability, surface science, sensors, optics and
imaging, RNA biochemistry, and ultrafast dynamics. The REU students have access
to all of the research groups in the chemistry department, including
interdisciplinary groups. REU students produce publishable results. The
experience also gives participants confidence to remain in science, pursue
graduate education, and ultimately to join the technically-trained workforce in
academia, industry, or government laboratories.
