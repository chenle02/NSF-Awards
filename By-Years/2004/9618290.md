9618290 Hildebrand This project will complete the analysis and reporting of an
application of seafloor geodesy to the problem of describing the pattern of
horizontal deformation that occurs in the vicinity of a mid-ocean ridge crest.
The first multikilometer-scale system to measure the pattern of strain
accumulation in the vicinity of a ridge crest on nested scales from 1 to 8 km
was installed on the Cleft segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge in 1994. Resurveys
were done in 1995 and 1996.
