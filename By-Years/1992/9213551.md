In order to implement the state feedback control laws being produced by many of
the advances in nonlinear control system design, state observes will be
necessary. This research will seek to develop observers for deterministic,
discrete-time or sampled-data nonlinear systems. The main thrust will be to
extend the work on Newton-like observers in order to increase their
applicability: an improved region of convergence and a better understanding of
how to efficiently perform the computations in a "real-time" setting. An
important goal will be to do this in the context of solving an actual
engineering problem. In cooperation with engineers from Ford Motor Co., a torque
equalization problem has been identified. The initial goal will be to design and
test an observer on a simulation model, and then in an engine dynamometer test
cell, in order to evaluate the achievable performance of an observer-controller
combination.
