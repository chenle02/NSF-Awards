This grant will support the organization and hosting of a workshop on the
NSF/ONR research initiative in "Electric Power Networks Efficiency and Security
(EPNES)". The workshop will include research performers from each of the
institutions awarded grants in 2002 and 2003. It will also include the
preparation of workshop proceedings, which will include technical information
provided by the grantees that will later be developed into papers for a special
section in a serial journal.

Intellectual merit: This grant will create interaction between EPNES researchers
and stimulate intellectual discussions that will improve the collective
contributions of the researchers.

Broader impact: This grant will include a workshop proceedings which will form
the basis for a special publications section that will disseminate the findings
to a wide audience of other researchers in this area and areas related to
network efficiency and security.
