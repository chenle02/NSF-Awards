Computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) promises to be instrumental in
revitalizing declining U.S. manufacturing industries. A scaled factory of the
future will be developed to better prepare the engineer to integrate various
manufacturing activities with computers. Ten CAD/CAM workstations and one local-
area network are the hardware necessary to complete the integration of the
existing CAM lab, which already includes scaled turning centers, machining
centers, robots, and a PC cell controller. Once this additional equipment is in
place, existing in-house software application programs will support a
manufacturing database, CAD, group technology code generation, and off-line
robot and NC programming. Ultimately, the system will also support graphical
machine and cell simulation, process monitoring and control, economic analysis,
inventory management, tool and fixture design, cell loading, and automated
inspection. The scaled CIM lab will provide the student with insights into how
various manufacturing activities interact in a CIM system framework, and afford
the opportunity to take a component from concept to plan to manufacture, in a
safe but realistic environment.
