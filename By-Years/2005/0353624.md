This award provides support for an REU Site at the University of Connecticut for
up to three years. Eight students will be recruited for an eight-week summer
experience and eight students will participate in an academic year program.
Students will have a unique opportunity to engage in research related to
electrical and computer engineering. The program will serve to encourage
undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in engineering and thus impact the
nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents
engaged in research-related careers. It is also anticipated that this REU Site
will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to have broader participation in
the research enterprise of citizens and permanent residents from demographic
groups traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.
