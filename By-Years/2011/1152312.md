The field of computational biology has undergone explosive in the last decade.
To understand the computational challenges facing computational biology in the
next 5-8 years, the PI proposes to run a special session at the next RECOMB2012
(http://recomb2012.crg.cat/) focused on emerging areas. RECOMB is an
international scientific conference bridging the computational, mathematical and
biological sciences, and is an excellent forum for disseminating the latest
developments in computational biology.
