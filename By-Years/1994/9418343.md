9418343 WU This project is related to an already funded Continental Dynamics
project directed by Thomas Henyey and David Okaya of the University of Southern
California (USC), titled "Geophysical Investigation of a modern Continent-
Continent Collisional Orogen: The Southern Alps, New Zealand" (referred to as
the main project). The main project concentrates on the South Island, with an
onshore reflection transect, onshore/offshore refraction/wide angle reflection
transect and a passive seismic study using local seismicity and teleseisms as
the center pieces. The last component involves a six months deployment of broad
band instruments on the South Island to record local earthquakes and teleseisms
for focal mechanisms, SKS anisotropy and deep mantle structures directly under
the South Island. This project aims to provide a broader regional coverage by
deploying stations on Chatham Island east of South Island; near Auckland, North
Island; in Southeast Australia, in cooperation with Prof. Brian Kennett of
Australian National University; and on the South Island, for a total of 11-12
stations. The stations would be deployed for 14 months, with part of the
deployment overlapping with that of the main project. The specific questions to
be addressed are: (1) What is the lateral extent of the lithospheric deformation
associated with the New Zealand orogeny? Does it involve flow of mantle
materials on both sides of the orogen? (2) What is the precise nature of the
upper mantle anisotropy that has been discovered to the west of the South
Island? Is it related to the New Zealand orogeny or to flow under the Pacific
plate to the northwest of New Zealand? (3) What are the deeper structures under
the Chatham Rise and the Lord Howe Rise? Are there deep lateral differences that
drive mantle dynamics? (4) Are there high velocity (and high density) zones
under the South Island? What is their lateral extent? ***
