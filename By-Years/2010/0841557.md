Christopher Jarzynsky of the University of Maryland, College Park, is supported
by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program within the
Division of Chemistry for the development of theoretical tools to improve
computational efficiency in biomolecular computations. His research focuses on
increasing the efficiency of two important and challenging computational
problems: free energy estimation and the sampling of rugged potential energy
landscapes. The methods of computational thermodynamics are based on
statistical-mechanical identities which relate thermodynamic properties of
systems to their underlying microscopic details. While fundamentally sound,
these methods are typically computationally expensive. To enhance computational
efficiency, the PI has developed a novel toolkit of strategies organized around
the principle of enhancing overlap between thermodynamic
states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to having a broad impact on
biomolecular applications, the methods being developed are relevant in a wide
range of other contexts in materials, physics, statistics, and chemistry. The PI
has launched a community-driven website devoted to methods for free energy
calculations.
