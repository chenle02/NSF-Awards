The NBER Summer Institute is an important environment for developing new ideas
and forging collaborative work relationships. Summer Institute brings together
economists and scholars in other fields from universities, government, and
international organizations for a few days or a few weeks of seminars,
workshops, conferences, and cooperative research. The NBER Summer Institutes
generate timely and influential research on important economic policy questions
related to such topics as international financial stability, economic
productivity and technology, environmental regulations, social security policy,
and educational policies. The workshops are an invaluable part of the research
infrastructure in economics and assist the research of many economists.

The Summer Institute is four weeks long and includes at least 50 sessions
organized and co-organized by over 100 individuals. There are more than 2,800
attendees each summer from over 425 universities and non-academic institutions.
Sessions are also available as livestreams. About two-thirds of all attendees
are not NBER affiliates. While there are many presentations of work nearing
completion, emphasis is placed on the workshop aspects of the program where new
ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas are developed, and plans for joint
or coordinated research efforts are established. Efforts are made to include a
wide variety of new participants, and to reach out to women and minorities.
Calls for papers are circulated widely and are available on the NBER website.
