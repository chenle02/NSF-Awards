The goal of this research program is to understand the limitations and
capabilities of computing hardware. Discovery of new computing architectures and
algorithms for those architectures is another aim, and mathematical proof is the
methodology used. The work focuses on the issue of programming parallel
computers. This study examines how parallel supercomputers based on fat-trees, a
new class of general-purpose routing networks, might reasonably be programmed.
The long-term goal is to build a "metacircular evaluator," which is like a Lisp
interpreter or a universal Turing machine. Given a description of a parallel
computing structure and inputs to the structure, the evaluator should be able to
simulate itself. The short-term plan leading toward this long-term goal is to
study specific parallel algorithms, particularly set- and graph-theoretic ones.
A library of efficient data/processor structures which can be used as building
blocks in more complicated algorithms is being developed. The research also
investigates how parallel programs might be debugged and more easily understood.
