Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0205330&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design, planning, control
and management of high performance networks require a much more integrated
approach than the conventional layered approach, where each layer is designed
and optimized independently from the others. In this proposal the researchers
propose to exploit inter-layer dependencies in network protocols for improved
network performance. In particular, the researchers will focus on ad-hoc
wireless networks, in which these interdependencies are more pronounced and in
which the network will benefit significantly by crosslayer
designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus is on the interaction between the
physical layer, the MAC layer, and the routing/transport layers. The researchers
take into account the nature of the wireless medium by detailed modeling of the
transmission parameters and of the detector structure and consider both
TDMA(scheduled) and CDMAmedia-accesscontrol mechanisms. The researchers couple
these with the flow and route assignment problems and, furthermore, consider how
the transport protocol interacts with route selection and bandwidth
allocation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the researchers address the role
of network control and management in ad-hoc wireless networks and exploit its
interaction with the aforementioned layers. Finally, the researchers consider
the interaction of signal compression with rate and quality control and are
mindful of the energy consumption repercussions of the joint protocol design.
