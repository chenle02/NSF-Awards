Contributions to the Study of the Non-Commutative Chern Character: This award
recommendation is made under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the
Exchange of Scientists and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is
designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research
at research institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as
well as Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities
for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards
are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of
science, the prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as
well as criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in
science and engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and
engineers who are embarking on their research careers. This research deals with
contributions to the study of the non-commutative Chern character, which acts as
a bridge between K-theory and (co) homology, and plays an important role in
geometry and topology. The current research project aims to develop a bivariant
version of the non-commutative Chern character and explore its applications to
classical, as well as non-commutative, index theory and to the quantification of
gauge fields in physics. The project is under the direction of Professor Henri
Moscovici, Department of Mathematics, The Ohio State University, 1314, Kinnear
Road, Columbus, OH 43212, U.S.A., and Professor Marcel Berger, Director,
Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques, 35 Route des Chartres, 91440, Bures-
Sur-Yvette, France. This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as
appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents
allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
