The objective of this project is to improve undergraduate controls engineering
education. Students frequently have difficulties in learning controls, because
it is often the first subject in which they must use the properties of complex
variables and the fundamentals of linear algebra in a sophisticated manner. To
associate these mathematical concepts with the behavior of physical systems,
experimentation or realistic simulations are essential. The proposed
"assistants" will make experimentation in undergraduate-level controls easier by
providing students not only with animations of physical systems which the
student can control, but also with on-line instruction and documentation for
actual laboratory equipment. The assistants will enable students to more quickly
apply control system design and analysis knowledge presented to them. A
prototype of these assistants for a motor speed control laboratory can be viewed
on the WWW at http://www.me.cmu.edu/faculty1/messner/classes/24-246/labs/. The
main innovation of these education aids is their implementation on the WWW. They
are an extension of the highly successful Controls Tutorials for MATLAB
developed previously by the Pls. The Web-based assistants will combine
explanatory text, animated realistic simulations of physical systems, graphics
and photographs of actual experimental apparatus. The assistants will contain
detailed instructions on procedures for running simulations and conducting
experiments, and will be integrated with additional information on theory and
control system design, such as the Control Tutorials for MATLAB.
