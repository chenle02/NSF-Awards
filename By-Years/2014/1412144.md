The scientists will numerically simulate the origin of star populations in our
Galaxy. The study will include a novel approach to modeling star clusters
directly in galaxy formation simulations. They seek to unravel several unsolved
puzzles in our understanding of Galactic formation and evolution: (i) What
caused multiple generations of stars within massive globular clusters? (ii) What
is the fraction of halo stars stripped off globular clusters? (iii) Was the
bulge assembled by early mergers or by gradual transformation of the Galactic
disk? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will implement the cluster formation and
evolution model in the cosmological adaptive-mesh-refinement code (called ART)
and run several realizations of Milky Way-sized galaxies with different
environment and merger history. ART is a powerful galaxy formation code and
already includes non-equilibrium cooling and heating of cosmic gas, non-
equilibrium formation and dissociation of molecular hydrogen, thermal, kinetic,
and radiative feedback of young stars, transport of ionizing radiation, and
other important processes. Inclusion of clustered star formation will add a
realistic description of stellar populations, with a well-defined stellar
initial mass function and more concentrated feedback on the interstellar medium
(ISM). The simulations will produce a rich data model, and will be used to
interpret various observations of Galactic clusters and dwarf
satellites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will integrate the simulations into a
program of state-of-the-art scientific visualizations of galaxy formation over
cosmic time. The visualizations will be designed for display at the University
of Michigan Planetarium, and will be viewed by thousands of elementary, middle
and high school students in the Detroit metropolitan area.
