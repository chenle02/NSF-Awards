0104019&lt;br/&gt;Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to study the shock
wave theory for conservation laws and &lt;br/&gt;the Boltzmann equation in the
kinetic theory. Shock waves occurs in many &lt;br/&gt;natural phenomena, such as
supersonic flight, sonar wind, earthquakes and &lt;br/&gt;hurricanes. There is
now a satisfactory mathematical theory for the &lt;br/&gt;inviscid plane motion.
It is planned to study the multi-dimensional gas &lt;br/&gt;motion as well as
the dissipation effects. The Boltzmann equation models &lt;br/&gt;the gas motion
on the microscopic level. This is necessary for important &lt;br/&gt;physical
phenomena such as the thermal effects of the boundary on the gas
&lt;br/&gt;motion. The nonlinear waves and the boundary effects for the
Boltzmann &lt;br/&gt;equation will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Euler
equations and Navier-Stokes equations for the gas dynamics are
&lt;br/&gt;considered. The project will include the study of the nonlinear
stability of &lt;br/&gt;shock waves for these and more general systems of
hyperbolic-parabolic &lt;br/&gt;conservation laws. The approach combines the
pointwise estimates and the &lt;br/&gt;energy estimates and is based on the new
understanding of the structure of &lt;br/&gt;the Green's function for the
equations linearized about the shock. For the &lt;br/&gt;Boltzmann equation, the
positivity of Boltzmann shocks has been shown &lt;br/&gt;and the boundary
effects such as the thermal creep are being studied. &lt;br/&gt;These are based
on the new macro-micro decomposition of the Boltzmann &lt;br/&gt;equation and
time-asymptotic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
