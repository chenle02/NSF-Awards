The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a helium/cadmium laser and associated
equipment for use several undergraduate courses. In the instrument analysis
course, students perform a fluorescence spectroscopy experiment to become
familiar with the capability and operation of the instrument. In the physical
chemistry course, they carry out a Raman spectroscopy investigation as a
practical application of group theory. In addition, the instrument is used by
faculty to perform lecture demonstrations, and by students to perform additional
experiments in several upper division courses.
