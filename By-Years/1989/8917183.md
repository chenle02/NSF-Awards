Some invertebrates have complex eyes that provide novel insights beyond what
has been discovered about visual processing in the vertebrate eye. One group of
crustaceans called stomatopods, or mantis shrimp, have large compound eyes, and
social and predatory behaviors that depend on sophisticated visual processing of
form, motion, and color. The eye contains three bands of facets providing
overlapping fields of view that may aid in directing the predatory strike. Some
species' eyes have ten or more visual channels for spectral sensitivity and
polarized light detection. These animals include a diversity of species
occupying tropical marine habitats; some occupy coastal areas where color vision
in daylight is practical, while others are in deeper or murkier water, or are
nocturnal. Each species has its own pattern of body coloration, ocular anatomy
and retinal physiology. This work will examine the visual system in the context
of the behaving animals in their environment, to try to extract how these visual
systems are optimized for high performance. Techniques of spectrophotometry,
histology, chromatography, radiometry, and ethology will be used to characterize
visual pigments, intraocular filters, body coloration, photic environments, and
the ability of the animals to discriminate hues. Results should clarify how
stomatopod vision is specialized for behavior in diverse habitats. This
unusually multifaceted approach on the mechanisms of a well-defined biological
system in its environment should have impact on visual science, sensory
neurobiology, ethology, and zoology, and might be very interesting to workers on
machine vision.
