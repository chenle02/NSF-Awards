This SGER research will be directed to answering fundamental, scientific matters
concerning the control of orientation of polymer molecules on surfaces and the
chemical and physical properties of such surface-bound polymer layers. Specific
questions upon which attention will be focused are: How can the directionality
implicit in a surface be preserved in the orientation of a bound polymer at
substantial distances from the underlying? What are the unique properties of
such bound layers as contrasted with both the solution and solid (but not
uniquely oriented) states? How are the properties of such materials altered by
the presence of other molecules, and are such changes reversible, at if so, at
what rate? This fundamental science program is intended to gather the necessary
seed information upon which potential applications applications in optical
switches and molecular sensors can be built.
