Providing three-dimensional models of complex objects is important for many
applications. Unfortunately, the two- dimensional nature of displays makes
visualization of complex three-dimensional objects difficult. Observers are
required to develop mental models of three-dimensional objects by integrating
visual information received from two-dimensional views which used monocular
depth cues as coding techniques. A new display technology is currently available
that provides the binocular depth cue of stereopsis. This cue may be
advantageous when few monocular cues are available in the image. The objective
of the research is to investigate the relative merits of monoscopic versus
stereoscopic display techniques for presenting visual representations of three-
dimensional objects. It is hypothesized that the effectiveness of both
techniques will depend upon object complexity and the number of monocular cues
available. The research will attempt to determine if a trade-off exists for
using stereoscopic versus monoscopic coding techniques using a mental rotation
paradigm. Images will be created using the stereoscopic cue and a variety of
monocular coding techniques including hidden line removal, shading, texture and
rotation. The number of monocular cues available in an image will be varied.
This empirical research will provide needed data on the use of stereoscopic
displays as a tool for providing three-dimensional representations of objects,
and provide insight as to whether stereoscopic displays are feasible
alternatives to high cost graphic processing techniques.
