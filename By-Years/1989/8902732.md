The light cone formalism of relativistic quantum mechanics will be extended and
used to develop and analyse a model for the deuteron and a model for the pion
nucleon system. A two particle angular momentum operator which contains
interactions and satisfies the Leutwyler-Stern angular condition will be
developed. This guarantees a convariant form for the deuteron wave fuction, and
the sensitivity of the electromagnetic form factors to the wave function will be
explored.
