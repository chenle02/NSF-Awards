930403 Steindler The cerebral cortex provides the neural substrate for
thinking, perception, and memory. It is divided into a mosaic of regions with
different cellular composition and connections. Each region is specified to
process a particular type of information. Some regions process information from
sensory receptors, others process information coming from brain centers that
program responses. How this differentiated mosaic develops from an
undifferentiated equipotential embryonic matrix is a subject on intense interest
and controversy. This NSF Small Grant for Exploratory Research will enable Dr.
Steindler to explore the role of an extracellular matrix molecule called
tenascin in the formation of cortical boundaries. Tenascin is secreted by
neuroglia, the non-neuronal support cells of the nervous system. It is found at
the boundaries of cortical regions early in development but disappears by
maturity. Dr. Steindler hypothesizes that this molecule forms a barrier between
adjacent regions and prevents mixing of fiber afferents. He will use newly
developed antibodies to tenascin to study the role of this molecule in the
formation of regional boundaries in the "whisker-barrel field," an area of
cortex with regionally distinct boundaries that are easily discerned. Since
tenascin has a widespread distribution in the animal kingdom, this work should
provide insight into general mechanisms of pattern formation during development.
More specifically the results will have implications for theories of cortical
development and cortical regeneration after injury in the adult. ***
