A grant has been awarded to the University of Oklahoma under the direction of
B. Hoagland to develop a database of plant specimens for the state of Oklahoma
that will be accessible via the worldwide web. The approximately 250,000 species
housed in herbaria at state research institutions are a valuable resource for
state scientists, personnel at state and federal agencies, and the public at
large. These specimens also represent an important North American resource for
many groups of plants. At the present time, the information contained in these
specimens can be accessed only by visiting state herbaria or by requesting
information from curators. In order to make this information widely and quickly
available to researchers and the public, a comprehensive, web accessible,
Oklahoma Vascular Plants database is to be developed. Specific objectives of the
undertaking are: (1) to database all Oklahoma plant specimens; (2) to develop
web-based access to their information; (3) to georeference all specimens; and
(4) to bar code all specimens.&lt;br/&gt; Databasing of the plant specimens will
be conducted by trained undergraduate and graduate students supervised by the
projects principal investigators. Databasing will build upon an existing
database of 80,000+ specimens. Web access tools will be developed so that
researchers at all Oklahoma colleges and universities can input specimen records
into the database in the future. These web tools also will allow individuals to
search the database for information on particular species, map the county
distributions of species, and develop plant species lists for any county. After
the plant specimens have been entered into the database, a computer program will
be used to assign latitude and longitude coordinates to them, a process known as
georeferencing. This will facilitate the mapping of species' distributions using
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Finally, bar code labels will be affixed
to each specimen as it is being databased as an aid in management of the
herbarium specimens. &lt;br/&gt; The significance of the Oklahoma Vascular
Plants database is rapid access to information. When completed, the database and
website will facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of information
regarding Oklahoma plants not only to workers in the state, but to those
throughout the United States and the world. Increased access to plant specimen
data by government, educational, and non-government organizations will; (1)
guide activities of the Oklahoma Biological Survey; (2) help track the status of
rare, threatened, and endangered plants; (3) allow the incorporation of plant
collection data into GIS databases; and (4) facilitate rapid accumulation and
dissemination of biodiversity information. Furthermore, the database will have
direct use by the general public. Landowners will be able to access the website
and acquire information about the species known to be present in their counties.
The project also will enhance Oklahoma's science and education infrastructure by
providing training in biological databasing and data sharing via: (1) work
experiences for students and researchers; (2) collaboration among state
scientists; and (3) training workshops for state researchers. &lt;br/&gt;
