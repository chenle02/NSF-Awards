This project is focused on the development of new data analysis tools for
analyzing personal data archives, namely, the streams of digital data that are
routinely recorded reflecting different aspects of individuals' daily lives.
Examples of such data include keystrokes, email histories, text messages, social
media interactions, microblogs, as well as records of physical activity, diet,
and sleep. As sensors become more accurate and cheaper and as data storage
becomes effectively zero cost, there is increasing demand for data analysis
tools that allow individuals to analyze and gain insight into their own personal
data. This research project is developing new statistical machine learning
algorithms for analyzing these types of data. The project has a particular focus
on the development of models and algorithms to handle personal archives in the
form of event time-series data, consisting of logs of time-stamped events
involving interactions with other individuals as well as textual and other
metadata. Testbed data sets being used to support this research include
publicly-available archives of email histories, software development
discussions, Twitter microblogs, Wikipedia editing interactions, and physical
proximity data. In terms of broader societal impact, the data analysis tools
being developed by this project have the potential to significantly transform
how individuals analyze their personal data to better understand and monitor
their physical and mental health.
