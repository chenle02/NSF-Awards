9704874 Birnir The dynamics of surge, stall, and flutter in jet engines will be
investigated using the qualitative theory of nonlinear partial differential
equations ( PDE's). The Moore-Greitzer equations modelling the flow through a
compressor will be used to analyze surge and stall. First it will be determined
whether the dynamics are high or low-dimensional, then the bifurcation that
causes stagnation stall identified and methods developed to control stall and
surge. The results will be applied to the study of laboratory compressors and
the analysis of laboratory data. A simple model for flutter in rotor (and
stator) rings of blades is developed and used to study the possible flutter
modes, then control strategies for these modes will be developed. This will
first be done numerically and then analytically. Finally these methods will be
used to study a realistic model of rotor rings and the real flutter modes and
their bifurcations analyzed and methods developed to control them. The
qualitative analysis of nonlinear PDE's will be extended to dimensions two and
greater, numerically and analytically, first by studying damped and driven wave
equations, and applications of the higher dimensional theory will be
implemented. The purpose of the research is to help design jet engines that are
lighter and can be operated more efficiently and safely than contemporary jet
engines. These engines will be used in the airplanes of the 20th century and
will make air travel faster, cheaper, and safer.
