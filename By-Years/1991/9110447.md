Research to be carried out under a Research Initiation Award will investigate
experimentally the effect on the turbulent boundary layer on a wall of
dynamically modifying a section of that wall. This section will be made to move
in the streamwise direction. Hot wire measurements will determine turbulent
stresses and other statistical correlations, to characterize the details of the
flow modification. Boundary layer control can be utilized to reduce friction
losses and surface transfer in a variety of fluid engineering systems.
