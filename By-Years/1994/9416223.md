9416223 Anderson This research is to understand the site, source and path effect
of the Northridge earthquake for strong motion prediction and seismic hazard
reduction in the Los Angeles region. Preliminary work on a composite source
model generated very realistic synthetic strong motion seismograms at several
locations. This work will be continued and completed for several strong ground
motion parameters including peak acceleration and velocity, and Fourier and
response spectral amplitudes. Then the work will focus on finding the optimal
source model parameters and concentrate on site effects, expressed as a Fourier
spectral ratio of weak motions in aftershocks to predicted ground motions for a
flat-layered half space. This contrasts with the more usual reference, for
spectral ratios, of a nearby rock station or a network average. This project is
a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is
supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
