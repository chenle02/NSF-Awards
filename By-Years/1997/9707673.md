DMS-9707673 The Department of Statistics at Case Western Reserve University will
purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research
in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research
projects in mathematics, including in particular: inference and diagnostics for
generalized linear mixed models, nonparametric inference including bump hunting
problems, development and study of fractal and enhanced Burgers-KPZ hydrodynamic
interface-growth models, projection pursuit and biased sampling, small area
inference for random variables, Bayesian order restricted inference, spatial
statistics and design of experiments for high dimensional problems.
