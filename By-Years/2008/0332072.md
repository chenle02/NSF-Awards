This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Dr. Dale Margerum and
collaborators at Purdue University to study the decontamination mechanism of
bacterial spores by chlorine dioxide at both the chemical and biological levels.
Chlorine dioxide is an effective oxidizing and disinfecting agent that is used
to inactivate pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. An understanding of the
mechanism by which chlorine dioxide inactivates bacterial pathogens and spores
will help advance the application of this technology to other critical areas
such as biodefense systems, agriculture anti-bioterrorism, environmental clean-
up, and food production. This research will investigate the kinetics of
bactericidal and sporicidal activity of chlorine dioxide gas, as a function of
physical and chemical factors, such as concentration, exposure time, relative
humidity, and temperature. The kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of amino
acids and peptides with chlorine dioxide in aqueous solution will also be
studied with special attention to chlorine-containing redox by-products and its
reaction with sulfhydryl and disulfide groups.

The award serves to initiate a collaboration between research groups in the
Department of Chemistry and in the Department of Food Science at Purdue
University thereby providing professors, research scientists, post-doctoral
associates, as well as students from underrepresented groups an opportunity to
learn from the experience of researchers in other fields. Long-range
applications of understanding the mechanisms whereby chlorine dioxide
inactivates bacteria and spores may lead to a lower vulnerability to bio-
terrorism and safer food.
