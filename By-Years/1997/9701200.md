9701200&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: This project consists of two loosely connected
parts. The &lt;br/&gt;first is to study invariant differential operators and
spherical &lt;br/&gt;functions on multiplicity free representations. One obtains
&lt;br/&gt;Capelli-type identities which lead to a new kind of symmetric
&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. The second part is to study Weyl groups for Hamiltonian
&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. This might lead to a proof of the Delzant conjecture
&lt;br/&gt;concerning the classification of multiplicity free Hamiltonian
&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. A further goal is to begin a systematic study of
&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian algebraic varieties.&lt;br/&gt;-&lt;br/&gt;The background
of the project is the study of highly symmetric spaces &lt;br/&gt;like spheres
or hyperbolic spaces. It is known that a significant part &lt;br/&gt;of the
geometry of these spaces is described by a certain finite group &lt;br/&gt;of
internal symmetries, called the little Weyl group. The aim of the
&lt;br/&gt;project is to investigate two different aspects of the little Weyl
&lt;br/&gt;group. The first is its influence on invariant differential operators
&lt;br/&gt;which in certain cases lead to beautiful identities generalizing
those &lt;br/&gt;found by Capelli in the 19th century. The second aim is to
study the &lt;br/&gt;little Weyl group of Hamiltonian manifolds. These manifolds
arise &lt;br/&gt;naturally if one formalizes symmetry of a classical mechanical
system, &lt;br/&gt;like a top or a planetary system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
