The broader impact / commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation â€“
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to enable automated assembly and
scaled manufacturing of quantum computing devices, and to improve the
performance of such quantum devices. State-of-the-art quantum computers rely on
superconductor junctions operated at extremely cold temperatures.
Superconducting cables are in high demand for use in quantum computers, not only
to transmit electrical signals without loss or heat generation, but also to
enable automated assembly of quantum devices. The long-term goal of this
research is to enable the large-scale manufacturing of superconducting flexible
cables for low temperature quantum devices. Both technical training and
entrepreneurial skill development will be emphasized for postdoctoral, graduate
and undergraduate students, while local K-12 students will also benefit from the
project through outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
leverages a new concept of water-in-salt electrolyte to develop and integrate an
electrodeposition technology to fabricate superconductor thin film on flexible
substrates; and demonstrate the robustness of superconductivity during the
typical use of a flexible cable. Water-in-salt methods use a high concentration
of salt, the hydration of which depletes the free water molecules, providing the
benefits of an aqueous electrolyte while mitigating the limitations from the
presence of water. In this PFI-TT project, innovative approaches will be
undertaken to improve the adhesion between the electrodeposited superconductors
on polymers, and to suppress the thermal effects from polymer curing. In
addition to pure superconducting metal, the electrodeposition process of a
superconducting alloy will be developed as a contingency plan to further ensure
the performance and durability of the flexible superconducting
cables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
