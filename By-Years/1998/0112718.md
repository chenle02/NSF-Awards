0112718 Rose

This U.S.-Argentina award will support a planning visit by Dr. William I. Rose
of Michigan Technological University to collaborate with Dr. Jose Viramonte of
the Universidad Nacional de Salta in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The goal of this
project is to build a small support group interested in volcanic clouds of the
Andean region and to create stronger collaborations.

This project will allow the monitoring of the movement of new volcanic products
allowing the understanding of its effects. The long-term goal is to be able to
send students to Salta to work with the local volcanic clouds group for several
months.
