This project studies the role of information in individual decision making and
in the structure of markets by which resources are reallocated socially. The
underlying theme is that recognizing that knowledge is neither free nor
infinitely costly has many implications for the means by which individuals
reallocate their resources, including their stock of information, and for
transactions among individuals by which both goods and knowledge are
transferred. The role of information in individual decisions is to be studied as
a basis for the still more fundamental issue of providing a general model for
economic activity. The market as understood in standard economic theory merely
approximates economic processes, and is valid only in limiting cases where
certain information costs vanish. The outcome of this research will be above all
conceptual rather than technical, although numerous analytic questions must be
raised in the process. Also, it provides better understanding of the foundations
of the theory of economic institutions including firms, markets, and market
equilibrium.
