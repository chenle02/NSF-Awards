The modified signed-digit (MSD) number system, because of its inherent weak
interdigit dependance, has been suggested as a useful means for a fast and
parallel digital arithmetic. Recently, using various optical logic and memory
processing techniques, optical MSD arithmetic operations have been proposed.
However, in most existing optical schemes, a multiple-stage algorithm is
utilized. For a multi-stage approach, because of optical cascading, additional
signal energy loss and speed reduction is unavoidable. To maintain a fast
processing speed, a single-stage holographic optical content-addressable memory
(CAM) based MSD algorithm was suggested. However, due to its sophisticated
three-step phase-switching recording, its experimental implementation is
difficult to achieve. In this research program, a novel non-holographic opto-
electronic CAM based fast MSD addition processing architecture is developed. The
proposed concept has been verified with our first-order proof-of-principle
experiments. As figure of merit comparison of this and other existing approaches
has also been made. Based on this key opto-electronic CAM element,
implementation of more sophisticated MSD arithmetic operations are possible.
Finally, for the completion of a MSD arithmetic processing, the conversion
between the conventional binary and MSD numbers, an issue that other optical
approaches did not address, is also under investigation.
