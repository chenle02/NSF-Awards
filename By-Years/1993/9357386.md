9357386 Adams The PI plans to investigate two areas of astrophysics. The main
focus of his work will be the theory of star formation. In the past, he has
studied the growth of spiral gravitational instabilities in protostellar disks.
These instabilities can lead to multiple stars in some cases and perhaps the
formation of planets. The present goal is to understand binary star formation
and predict the mass function of forming stars. Wave excitation and propagation
in molecular clouds will be investigated to clarify the conditions in which
stars form. The second area of investigation is cosmology. The PI plans to
construct new models of the inflationary universe and the background radiation
fields. ***
