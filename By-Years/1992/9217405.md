This award supports a conference entitled: "Conference on Large Scale
Optimization". The conference will be held from 15 to 17 February 1992, at the
University of Florida. The conference will be concerned with algorithms,
applications, and software for large scale optimization. The topics will include
applications in the fields of engineering, computer science, operations
research, optimal control, economics, telecommunications, and stochastic
optimization. Its major objective is to provide a forum for cross-disciplinary
exchange of research advances, as well as a foundation for joint research
cooperation and stimulation for future research.
