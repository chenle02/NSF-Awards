John Lee will continue his studies of Cauchy Riemann manifolds. He will
investigate the ways in which certain curvature and torsion tensors on a
pseudohermitian manifold can be simplified by appropriate choice of CR structure
and contact form. The principal problems to be considered are 1) the CR Yamabe
problem which asks for a contact form with constant scalar curvature; 2) to
choose a contact form for which the Webster Ricci tensor is a scalar multiple of
the Levi form; 3) to determine which CR manifolds admit contact forms satisfying
both previous conditions; 4) to determine conditions under cwhich the CR
structure can be varied to achieve vanishing torsion and constant scalar
curvature.
