This project, investigate an observation-based execution time estimation,
approach for resource planning and usage estimation in the grid environment for
application and resource scheduling. More specifically, the proposed approaches
will collect/manage/utilize application characteristics and performance results,
and equally transfer such information across disjoint applications and hardware
platforms. With these approaches, performance data from one application's
executions on one platform helps predict the performance of another application
on another platform. The expected outcome of this research to be a meta-
predictor, an effective, efficient and sufficiently accurate cross-platform
performance prediction tool that can provide performance predictions as a
general service to assist grid users in both their long-term research planning
and their everyday job execution. These approaches will be validated and
evaluated on production platforms with applications representative for
nationally relevant high-end applications, such as National Lab production
codes.
