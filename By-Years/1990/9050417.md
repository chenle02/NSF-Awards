This project fills a gap in the curriculum of the Computer Science Department.
Workstations and transputers are the equipment additions required to support a
new course in parallel programming. Through classroom instruction and hands-on,
laboratory work, the students are introduced to and gain experience with various
aspects of parallelism. The course focuses on models of concurrency and various
mechanisms and techniques involved in parallel programming. The award is being
matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
