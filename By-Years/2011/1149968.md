Adam Wasserman of Purdue University is supported by a CAREER award from the
Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry
division to develop and apply electronic-structure methods that extend the reach
of quantum-chemical approaches based on Density Functional Theory. The methods
being investigated provide a new framework for developing and testing
approximate density functionals for accurate calculations of ground and excited
electronic states of molecules, including metastable ones. Applications include
molecular dissociation, long-range charge-transfer excitations, and conductance
through molecular wires - all cases where the need of accurate Kohn-Sham
potentials is circumvented in the new framework by the calculation of
appropriate partition potentials, a novel concept that should also prove useful
in understanding chemical bonding from a non-traditional perspective. Its time-
dependent extension will facilitate our understanding and teaching of modern
spectroscopy and molecular electronics.

Underlying most of chemistry is the notion that the energy of two bonded
fragments is lower than the sum of the energies of the isolated fragments. The
difference between those two energies can be calculated accurately for any pair
of fragments using the algorithms that Prof. Wasserman and his research group
are developing, supported by this grant. They are implementing the new
algorithms into large broadly-available quantum-chemistry codes for the benefit
of the scientific community at large. They are also developing pedagogical tools
to facilitate the dissemination of scientific advances in the field of
electronic-structure theory, using existing resources available at Purdue
University. In addition, they are increasing the involvement of Hispanic
minorities by organizing scientific events that promote Hispanic participation
in science research.
