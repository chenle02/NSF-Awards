The aim of this study is to better understand the early evolution of apes and
other primates through paleontological research at sites in northeastern Uganda.
The Ugandan fossil sites have yielded the oldest known ape of modern appearance,
as well as the oldest Old World monkey and numerous other primates and mammals.
Of particular interest is Morotopithecus bishopi. Analysis of fossils of this
20-million year old ape has revealed that unlike contemporaneous primates from
Kenya who resembled monkeys in overall body plan, Morotopithecus would have
engaged in upright postures and arm swinging behaviors like its modern
relatives. The adaptations for upright posture and forelimb suspension suggest a
close relationship between Morotopithecus and living apes and humans.
Furthermore, as the oldest known ape to exhibit these adaptations,
Morotopithecus is key to understanding their origins. Much remains to be
determined about Morotopithecus including its relationship to both living and
fossil ape species, its paleoenvironmental context and its anatomy. Research
will include field collection of more fossils, as well as investigation of the
geology and paleoecology of the Ugandan sites. The latter will provide crucial
contextual data on the timing of evolutionary events and on the conditions under
which Morotopithecus and other mammals evolved. Broader impacts of the study
include the participation of four women (the P.I. and 3 senior personnel) and
the training of American and Ugandan students. Although East Africa is "the
cradle of humanity", historically few East Africans have participated in
paleoanthropological research.
