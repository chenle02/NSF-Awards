Through this project, the institution acquired a Fourier Transform Infrared
(FAIR) Spectrometer which markedly improved the instructional program in
Chemistry at the college. The improvements included: (1) doubling the number of
experiments using infrared spectroscopy in the curriculum. The new level of
exposure to infrared spectral interpretation has been ideal for the training of
students in this key technique. (2) For the first time, students have been able
to learn and use the important concepts of signal averaging and Fourier
transform spectroscopy. (3) The purchase of diffuse reflectance sampling
accessory for the FAIR allowed easy and rapid study of solid samples with
infrared spectroscopy. (4) The excitement of modern scientific instrumentation
has been transmitted to introductory level students, both majors and non-majors.
These efforts have built on the department's successful incorporation of
advanced instruments in first year courses, and have extended to courses which
had no usage of modern instrumentation. The curricular improvements include all
branches of chemistry, and have benefitted students ranging from precollege
level to senior chemistry majors doing independent research projects. The
institution has contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
