This grant supports the research of Professor D. Wright and A. Yukie. They will
work on the theory of zeta functions associated with prehomogeneous vector
spaces with a view to calculating the discriminants of quartic and quintic
extensions of global fields. They hope to use this theory to obtain mean value
theorems for the 2-class number of cubic fields. This is research in the field
of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such
as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest
fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic
reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an essential tool
in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes
for electronics.
