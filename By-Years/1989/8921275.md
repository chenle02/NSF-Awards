This grant will support Dr. Williams' theoretical and experimental work in two
important areas of artificial neural computation: recursive networks for
processing time-varying signals, and multiscale networks for exploiting
information at multiple resolutions. Recursive networks will be important for
control and signal-processing problems with feedback delays of unknown duration.
Multiscale architectures and learning strategies are needed for large-scale
problems of practical importance, including those with complex spatial and
temporal components. Proposed target applications are in speech recognition and
adaptive sensorimotor control.
