9625642 Zheng ABSTRACT The investigator will continue the study of diffusion
process related to heat propagation in a composite medium. The proposed research
is related to several areas of probability theory: the theory of Dirichlet forms
and Markov processes, weak convergence theory, stochastic calculus and
martingale theory. The investigator is mainly interested in the following
problems: 1) Time-dependent Dirichlet form and moving boundary problems; 2) The
analysis of the Markov chain models which give approximating solutions for the
above problems; 3) The estimate of the rate of weak convergence when a sequence
of Markov chains approach a diffusion process. The investigator expects that
this proposed study will introduce more applications of the existing results of
diffusion process theory thereby enriching the whole theory. The main purpose of
this investigation is to study problems related to the temperature evolution of
an object composed of several different materials. Two examples are the melting-
freezing process of ice hills on the oceans and temperature control inside a
nuclear reactor. For those problems, the real computations are very complicated
and sometimes applied scientists do not even know if their computational result
is precise enough to the applicable to the real world. The investigator will use
a special mathematical model known as "diffusion processes" to simulate the real
temperature evolution on those objects. Moreover, the investigator will study
how to realize this process on a computer and how accurate the computer
simulation result will be.
