The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Harvard University supports
interactive and interdisciplinary materials research in three primary thrust
areas. Phase Transitions and Failure Mechanisms: Metals, Ceramics and
Superconductors represents a synthesis of core materials science efforts in
phase transitions and superconductivity with ongoing collaborative work in
micromechanics. Activities in the thrust span a range of materials scales from
atoms to grains to polycrystals to composites; the research addresses the
relationships between macroscopic properties and microstructural features. The
thrust on Thin Films, Interfaces, and Surfaces focuses primarily on the links
between chemistry and physics, and deals with the fundamental properties of a
wide range of thin-film materials and structures. These include liquid-crystal
films, polymerized membranes, self-assembled monolayers, liquid helium films and
liquid metal surface morphologies, surface reconstructions, and two-dimensional
arrays of Josephson junctions. A newly organized effort on Microelectronic
Materials addresses the electronic properties of compound semiconductor
heterostructures with graded composition; novel approaches to synthesis and
characterization of epitaxial semiconductors and liquid metal mediated crystal
growth; and atomic transport semiconductor materials. The Harvard MRL also
supports the development, operation and maintenance of major central research
facilities including a surface facility operated in collaboration with the MIT
MRL. The MRL provides seed funding for new faculty and for high-risk projects in
materials research that are related to its overall program. The MRL program
currently involves 24 faculty members, 8 postdoctoral research associates, 18
graduate students, 8 undergraduates through the Research Experiences for
Undergraduates program, and 7 other scientific and technical professionals. The
Harvard MRL is directed by Professor Henry Ehrenreich. //
