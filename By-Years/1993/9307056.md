9307056 Clark Salticid spiders are important animals for studying visual
communication because males of many species are brightly colored and have
decorations that are used to identify sex and species. While most animal species
have only one type of male, the salticid spider Maevia inclemens has two male
morphs that are so different they look as if they should belong to different
species. The morphs also have distinctly different behaviors during courtship,
but both appear to be equally successful, which raises questions about how
females deal with two males that look and behave very differently. Dr. Clark
will investigate mate selection by females, to determine if one male morph has a
reproductive advantage over the other male morph. One morph has a conspicuous
display, which may attract female attention from greater distances. However,
this advantage may be offset by the risk of predation from birds, wasps, or
other spiders. Dr. Clark will examine the trade-offs of a conspicuous display
versus a cryptic display performed at different distances. Mate-selection
experiments will be conducted utilizing new video and computer- animation
techniques, allowing the experimenter to control male movement, distance from
the female, and natural background coloration. Since very little is known about
how such unusual male morphologies and behaviors evolve, these studies will
contribute to an understanding of the selection mechanisms maintaining a unique
male dimorphism in nature. In addition, the continued development of the video
and computer-animation techniques will allow more detailed studies to be
conducted on visual processing systems. These techniques allow animal morphology
and behavior to be manipulated in ways that are not possible with live animals,
and will contribute to more sophisticated animal behavior research projects in
the future.
