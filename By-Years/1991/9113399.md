This project initiates the first year of a five-year continuing award to the
University of Cincinnati to join with the University of Arkansas and Florida
Atlantic University in merging with the Georgia Institute of Technology's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling. The
university has developed the company support to be added to the Center's
industry base. The research projects approved by the new consolidated Industry
Advisory Board for the University of Cincinnati are "Decision Support System for
the Design Packing and Palletizing", "Simulation Generator for Material Handling
Systems" and "Evaluation and Enhancement of Fresh Fruit Material Handling,
Transport, and Storage." A minority woman undergraduate is augmenting the
Center's research program by studying "Palletizing Simulation." The researchers
are recognized experts in their fields and have the capability and facilities to
participate in the new merged Center. The Program Manager recommends the
University of Cincinnati be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year
continuing grant. An Additional $3998 is recommended from the Women, Minorities,
and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program. Near the end of each 12
month period the Program Manager and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers
Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,
including the following: (1) the extent to which the university-industry
interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to which the support
base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a robust research program is
developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend
support of the next period of this continuing grant.
