The objective of this research effort is to design and develop manufacturing
enterprise architecture (MEA), which will serve as a blueprint for the
implementation of computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) in the factory of the
future. This approach is necessary to the domain of manufacturing, especially in
the context of CIM. During the initial phase of the research, the
apparel/textile manufacturing sector will be used for the development of the
Textile Apparel Manufacturing Architecture (TAMA). Methodologies currently
available for the development of such an architecture, do not lend themselves
well to the investigation since symbolic knowledge plays a crucial role in the
successful operation of an enterprise (e.g., in production planning and
scheduling). TAMA will subsequently be generalized to encompass other
manufacturing processes. Issues related to a domain or industry independent view
of manufacturing will also be investigated. Thus, the five-year research
objective is not only to have a successful implementation of CIM in
textile/apparel manufacturing, but also to have a generic MEA for the factory of
the future.
