Recent determinations of diffusion rates of cations in several common minerals
allow a mineral dating method to resolve between protracted slow cooling and
discrete later tectonic events. This project will study Paleozoic metamorphism
and deformation in the southern and central New England Appalachians. It will
obtain Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and U-Pb isotopic data on co-existing minerals in high grade
metaigneous gneisses and amphibolites in order to determine the time of last
recrystal- lization or initiation of cooling following high temperature
metamorphism. The results of this study will allow features of middle Paleozoic
and late Paleozoic shear zones to be dated, yielding a clearer understanding of
major events in the northern Appalachians.
