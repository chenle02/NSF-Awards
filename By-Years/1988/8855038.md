The four-week summer program Science Enrichment for the disabled to be held at
the University of Lowell, will provide physically disabled junior high school
students with activities in science, mathematics and computers. Activities will
stress experimental design, the use of variables and controls, and the accurate
recording of data. Students will be given problems to solve which involve
ethical dilemmas and implications to introduce them to the importance of
unbiased work in science. Students will meet people with disabilities, both in
the project staff and in interviews with other professionals, who work in
technical areas.
