This is a timely electrical/computer engineering approach to the difficult
problem of producing automatic control of physiological variables. A new era is
emerging, namely, that of "smart systems", ie., computers/controllers that have
sufficiently large CPUs (central processing units) that the ability to make
"judgments" can be programmed. This proposal utilizes this capability to "make
judgments" on the physical condition of a simulated patient by analyzing
simulated physiological data; the computer then commands an appropriate response
to a changing patient condition. This input data can be quite complex such as
the inclusion of intravenous drug infusion.
