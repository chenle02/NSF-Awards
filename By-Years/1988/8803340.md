This project will continue detailed studies of the Stillwater Intrusive Complex
with the goal of understanding the high tempera- ture hydromagmatic environment
and its role in remobilizing trace element components (esp. platinum-group
elements, or PGEs) and altering the primary cumulate rocks of the complex.
Models of magmatic vs. hydrothermal fluid transport of PGEs) will be tested
using (a) compositional variations of hydrous phases (e.g. apatite) as a
function of stratigraphic height and in veins vs. cumulate rocks, (b) mass
balance of trace element budgets, (c) stable isotope evidence for origin of
fluids, (d) phase equilibria constraints on intensive parameters, and (e)
preliminary experimental investigations of mineral solubilities in Cl-brines at
high temperature.
