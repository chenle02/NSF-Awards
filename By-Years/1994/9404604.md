9404604 Rivera The investigator extends a variety of theoretical results for
dynamical systems and applies them to problems in electrical engineering and
mathematical biology. The theoretical results include: shooting methods,
spectral analysis of operators on Banach spaces to obtain new results on
invariant manifolds, and linearizations about stationary solutions. These
results are applied to analyse the existence and stability of travelling waves
in PDE epidemic models and the losses in NFDE models of electrical power
transmission lines. Biologists have observed that animal and human epidemics
spread throughout a geographical area in the form of a travelling wave.
Engineers have observed how much loss occurs as electricityis transmitted
through power lines over distances. The mathematical models mentioned above give
reasonable approximations to essential features of these physical phenomena and
enable us to improve our ability to predict and control them. This is important
because of the expanding problem of animal and human epidemics (e.g. HIV-AIDS
and rabies). The investigator applies analytical and computational methods to
improve understanding of these models and to interpret the physical meaning of
the results.
