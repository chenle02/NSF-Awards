The investigator studies problems in structural and computational number theory,
notably the arithmetic of varieties such as elliptic curves and surfaces, and
their relations and applications to other areas of mathematics such as error-
correcting codes and Euclidean lattices. Specific projects
include:&lt;br/&gt;Extending the investigation of high-rank K3 surfaces to
supersingular surfaces in positive characteristic; continuing and extending the
use of explicit equations and moduli of high-rank K3 surfaces in characteristic
zero, with various applications to modular curves and varieties and to
Diophantine records; further study of the connection between bilinear (Somos)
recurrences, theta sequences, and explicit moduli spaces; generalizing results
with Scott Kominers on harmonic weight enumerators via representations of Lie
algebras to treat linear codes over arbitrary finite fields; improving and
extending results with Henry Cohn and Abhinav Kumar on sphere packings and
related questions; and working with Kent Boklan on completing the solution of
Waring's problem for seven cubes in the remaining residue classes mod
18.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will continue to study
problems in number theory concerning the mathematical structure of algebraic
solutions of equations and the practical computation and applications of such
solutions. This should lead both to better understanding of the structure of
those equations and their solutions (elliptic curves, etc.), and to further
connections with other topics such as the theory of computation, error-
correcting codes, and sphere packing.
