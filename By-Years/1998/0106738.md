Spear&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0106738&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal is to develop
trace element partitioning as a tool to assist petrologists in the task of
deciphering the metamorphic history of a terrane, and to apply this tool to
further our understanding of Earth history. Detailed studies will be carried out
on metapelites that have undergone partial melting (anatexis) and rocks that
have undergone high P/T metamorphism in order to characterize fully the trace
element zoning and partitioning in major and accessory phases. &lt;br/&gt; An
empirical calibration of a monazite-xenotime thermometer will be augmented and
enhanced to include the influence of HREE, Th and U on monazite YPO4 content,
and procedures developed for the application of this thermometer to yield
meaningful results. Two additional thermometers, YAG-xenotime and YAG-monazite,
will be similarly enhanced so that they are applicable over a wide range of
conditions. Additional new, empirical thermometers based on yttrium partitioning
between garnet and accessory minerals at high pressures will be explored
&lt;br/&gt; Thermodynamic models of whole rock reactions and mineral composition
variation will be developed to place accessory mineral paragenesis on a firm
theoretical footing. The models will be used to make predictions about the
involvement of accessory minerals in major phase reactions, and in the
interpretation of natural parageneses observed in the study suites. &lt;br/&gt;
