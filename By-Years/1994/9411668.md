9411668 Headrick The Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source(CHESS) and the
School of Engineering and Applied Physics and Cornell University will construct
a Semiconductor Thin Film Growth/X-ray Diffraction System dedicated to support
research in thin film microstructures. Specifically, this equipment will support
several new and existing research programs studying the growth o thin films of
wide bandgap III-V materials using Gas Source Molecular Beam Epitaxy (GSMBE),
Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE), and other new proposed growth techniques using ion,
radical and molecular sources. By utilizing the high intensity x-ray bams
available and CHESS, this system will be able to perform time resolved
measurements of the structure of semiconductor thin films during growth. This
research studying time-dependent effects is expected to yield critical insight
in the development of advanced growth techniques and new microscopically
structured materials. Such structures are needed for electronic devices,
optoelectronic devices, optical storage media, protective coatings and UV-
transmitting windows based on the III-V nitrides, i.e. AIN, GaN and InN. ***
