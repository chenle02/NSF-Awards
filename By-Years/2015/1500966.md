This research project concerns both algebraic geometry, which seeks to
characterize solutions to algebraic equations with geometry, and representation
theory, which is a systematic investigation of symmetry. Despite their abstract
nature, the answers to many questions in both of these subjects boil down to
being able to compute certain numbers. The purpose of this research project is
to use new techniques from algebraic geometry and commutative algebra to recast
these numbers as combinatorial quantities, making them easier to understand with
a computer. By utilizing conceptual connections to other scientific fields, this
research will also advance the understanding of several questions in
mathematical physics and mathematical biology. Undergraduate students are
involved directly as collaborators in the project, providing them with training
in advanced mathematical topics and the use of 3D printing techniques in
mathematical research.

The algebraic geometry of moduli spaces of principal bundles and branching
varieties naturally produces two interesting enumeration problems: counting
branching multiplicities of a map of reductive groups, and finding the dimension
of the spaces of conformal blocks from the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model of
conformal field theory. This research aims to further understanding of these
quantities using the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies and the quickly evolving
field of Berkovich geometry. These theories will be used to provide new
polyhedral descriptions of conformal blocks and branching multiplicities, as
well as further the understanding of the topology and symplectic geometry of the
spaces under consideration.
