The increasing economic importance of robotics in the manufacturing environment
is widely recognized. There are many situations in which it would be
advantageous to remove some of the structuring constraints on the environment,
and have the capability of moving the robot to the work. This project covers a
three-year program of basic research in motion coordination, including
coordinating the actuators of a mobile manipulation system, allocating forces
and torques within the resulting closed kinematic chains, and developing
algorithms for obstacle avoidance.
