This award provides funding for graduate students and early-career postdocs to
participate in the conference "Current Developments in Mathematics" which will
be held November 16-17, 2018 at the Harvard University Science Center in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. The CDM conference is jointly sponsored by Harvard
University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The purpose of the
conference is to provide a forum for the latest significant theories and
research developments in various branches of advanced mathematics. Topics
presented by prominent speakers include a diverse variety of mathematical
research including differential geometry, topology, number theory, algebraic
geometry, algebraic topology, stochastic analysis, algebraic combinatorics,
Hodge theory, geometric analysis, probability theory, and symplectic geometry.
