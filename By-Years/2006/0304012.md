The Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, "Engineering
Applications of Thermal and Electrical Transport in Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube
Films," at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, under the direction of Dr. Nikhil
Koratkar, is funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers,
Directorate for Engineering. The project is focused on developing two laboratory
experiments and a multimedia virtual-lab demo that demonstrates how thermal and
electrical transport in multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) films can be
exploited in a very practical way to improve the performance of engineering
systems.
