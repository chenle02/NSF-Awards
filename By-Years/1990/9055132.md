The University of Minnesota, College of Biological Sciences, will continue its
eight-week, commuter Young Scholars project in the Life Sciences for 20 students
entering grade 12. Students will select a faculty mentor and pursue a research
topic within the problem area being investigated by that team. This mini-project
forms the basis for an end-of-session report at a poster symposium. The poster
will be taken back to the student's home school and will be the basis for
continued interaction between the student, the school, and the College.
Participants will also attend weekly seminars and discussion groups on
scientific philosophy, methodology, ethics, and careers. Each student will be
given individualized attention by college advisors and by career exploration
personnel.
