9713942 Bryant Initial studies have shown that micro-vibrations properly applied
to bodies in sliding contact can reduce their wear by 50% or more. In this
follow-up study the basic mechanisms involved will be studied and techniques
will be developed to optimize the effect using passively generated vibrations
for several target technologies, including automotive and aircraft brakes as
well as electrical brushes. It is expected that near the end of the study subtle
design changes can eventually be developed for automotive brake systems which
will enable passive generation of vibrations that promote the vibration-induced
wear reduction without having any deleterious side effects and that this could
result in a very significant drop in brake wear. ***
