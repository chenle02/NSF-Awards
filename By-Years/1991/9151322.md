This project upgrades the quality and changes the approach of College Physics
Labs by increasing student inquiry skills through experiences which stress
problem solving and experimental skills. This is done by introducing computers
for data acquisition and analysis along with appropriate experiments in
mechanics and nuclear science. These improvements in reviving the interactive
nature of the laboratory experience are also structured to benefit secondary
education science teacher students by stressing skills and the use of modern lab
equipment that the State requires them to learn. A subsidiary benefit of this
program is the use of this equipment in upper division labs when it is not being
used in introductory labs.
