An ideal method to obtain valuable information on atmospheric pollutants is
through the use of LIDAR.SEO proposes in this Phase I to use a Q-switched Ho:YAG
laser to pump an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) with AgGaSe2 nonlinear
crystal as the gain medium for the generation of continuously tunable output
from 3 um to 12 um. This laser system will be used as the transmitter for a
LIDAR system to detect atmospheric pollutants. Phase I will consist of
developing an OPO system tunable from 3 to 12 um and some prellmlnary LIDAR
measurements.
