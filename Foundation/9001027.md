The investigator will study several topics in set theory, primarily concerning
the core model and its applications. The major aim is to generalize the core
model, first to include everything up to Woodin cardinals, and then to include
Woodin cardinals as well. Preliminary results have revealed the probable
structure of this core model, and the main remaining problem is to find a
condition on the extenders in the core model which will ensure that iterated
ultrapowers of the core model are well-founded. Other problems include questions
related to the singular cardinal hypothesis, to infinitary Ramsey theory, and to
the existence of definable cofinal sequences witnessing the singularity of an
infinite singular cardinal. Set theory is usually considered the foundation of
all mathematics, so studies of this kind are in a sense exploring the limits of
mathematical possibility. What axioms about sets can be trusted as a sound
foundation? What economies of proof can be achieved by using stronger set
theoretic assumptions? Questions such as these are the motivating forces of this
and other projects in set theory.
