9313153 Tippur An experimental research program will be undertaken that
explores crack initiation and growth along material interfaces subjected to
thermo-mechanical loads. This investigation will assist in understanding the
failure mechanics of engineering structures made of polymer and metal matrix
composites, adhesive joints in aircrafts, and interfaces in layered micro-
electronic devices. It is anticipated that the research will contribute towards
modeling the influence of transient thermal loads and thermal gradients on crack
initiation toughness and mode mixity and developing new methods for
characterizing fracture of bimaterial interface subjected to thermo-mechanical
loading. The primary focus will be towards understanding the transient nature of
the pre-initiation crack tip fields that lead to crack initiation and
propagation along material interfaces due to thermo-mechanical loading. ***
