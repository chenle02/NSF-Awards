Abstract for proposal of Jorgenson

Jay Jorgenson proposes to continue ongoing research with his co-authors into
applications of heat kernel analysis to number theory. Jorgenson and Serge Lang
will study spectral theory on finite volume quotients of symmetric spaces using
generalizations of Eisenstein series defined using heat kernels, as opposed to
classical Eisenstein series which are defined using automorphic forms. Jorgenson
and Lang plan to investigate questions involving analytic continuation,
functional equations, and special values of their heat Eisenstein series. Upon
completion of this component of their work, Jorgenson and Lang then will
investigate applications of heat Eisenstein series to Weyl's law as well as to
constructions of zeta functions which will yield higher rank generalizations of
Selberg zeta functions. In collaboration with Jurg Kramer, Jorgenson will study
analytic aspects of Arakelov theory. In recent work, Jorgenson and Kramer study
bounds on special values of Selberg's zeta function and asymptotic bounds
through covers. Jorgenson and Kramer propose to extend these results to study
asymptotic behavior of Faltings's delta function through covers, thus extending
results first obtained by Jorgenson in his 1989 Stanford Ph.D. thesis. In
collaboration with Jozek Dodziuk, Jorgenson plans to use Lang's definition of
degenerating number fields (from Lang's 1971 Inventiones paper) to study
spectral theory on the corresponding sequence of degenerating Hilbert modular
varieties. The proposed methods to employ involve generalizations of research
previously obtained by Jorgenson with Dodziuk and with Huntley and Lundelius. As
time permits, Jorgenson plans to study proposed additional research problems
with Carol Fan, Edward Jenvey and Peter Grabner.

Classically, the heat kernel is a function defined for positive values of time t
and points x and y in a domain D, and the heat kernel measures the amount of
heat at point x in D at time t when a unit burst of heat is introduced at point
y in D at time zero. Although the origin of the heat kernel lies in physics, the
mathematics surrounding the function known as the heat kernel manifests itself
in virtually every area of pure and applied mathematics. In addition, the heat
kernel is present in the theoretical foundations of many fields of statistics as
well as econometrics and, more specifically, financial mathematics. Part of the
research undertaken by Jay Jorgenson and his collaborators involves
understanding various ways in which the heat kernel appears in one area of
mathematics and then translate the questions, theorems and techniques to other
areas of mathematics, statistics, and economics. Going beyond mathematical
research, Jay Jorgenson proposes to extend his research endeavors to incluce
applications of heat kernels to practical problems of financial mathematics and
economics, which naturally includes developing ways in which one can program
constructions of heat kernels in order to obtain precise, numerical evaluations.
