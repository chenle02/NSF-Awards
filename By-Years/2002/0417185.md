The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the pathway of protein
import into the chloroplast. The chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis and
houses an array of biosynthetic pathways needed for plant growth and
development. A novel genetic screen using Arabidopsis thaliana will be initiated
to broaden an understanding of what determines the regulation and specificity of
protein import. The study will: 1) Identify mutant plants that show a loss of
herbicide tolerance, resulting in an herbicide sensitive phenotype, providing an
initial indication of an import defect. Herbicide tolerance can be conferred by
a special EPSP synthase, a key enzyme required for synthesis of essential
aromatic amino acids in the chloroplast. The precursor of EPSP synthase is
normally imported from the cytosol. An herbicide sensitive phenotype will
indicate that a mutation in the import pathway has prevented the correct
localization and function of the enzyme. 2) Identify the location of green
fluorescent protein (GFP) in the same transgenic plants that exhibit an
herbicide sensitive phenotype. Localization of GFP fused to a chloroplast
targeting signal will establish if the mutants identified in the herbicide
screen are defective in an import step. 3) Characterize the mutant plants at the
genetic and phenotypic levels. Comprehensive morphological, cellular and
molecular analyses of the mutant phenotypes will be carried out. 4) Identify the
gene responsible for the mutant phenotype through genetic mapping experiments.
Given the central role of the chloroplast, elucidating how it is assembled and
functions is a goal of fundamental importance. This project will provide
research training for post-doctoral associates, graduate students, and
undergraduates.
