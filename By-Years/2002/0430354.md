This proposal describes an approach to performing multi-resolution system
behavior monitoring at runtime and generating models based on this monitoring in
dedicated distributed and parallel systems. The research offered focuses on
dedicated systems, particularly clusters performing a well-known set of tasks
that occur with relatively predictable frequency. Anomaly detection can be
accomplished through comparison of the observed runtime system behavior against
a high-fidelity model of the system. The following three specific sub-areas will
be emphasized:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-resolution Behavior
Monitoring&lt;br/&gt;Data Fusion&lt;br/&gt;Flexible Behavior
Modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work is to further
understanding of anomaly detection within cooperating processors working over
high speed networks in such a way that the resulting overhead is acceptable. The
proposal also includes a continuing industrial collaboration, as well as the
completion and initiation of PhD dissertations and involvement of historically
underrepresented groups in a summer research program.
