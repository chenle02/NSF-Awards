In science the challenge is always finding a signal in the noise. Examples
include hurricane forecasting and monitoring both intelligence and seismic
activity. Our proposal addresses these issues through a broad framework we call
generalized feature mining. The framework has two major components: feature
mining, and shape-based data mining and analysis. At its core, feature mining
detects features for a specific application domain. Each instance involves a
specific extended shape description tailored to it. For evolutionary
simulations, feature mining also tracks features across multiple temporal
scales. Shape-based data mining and analysis learn from the process. The aim is
to correlate information from the extended shape descriptors with transient
detection to find or refine spatio-temporal rules for the evolution of features.
Environmental influences, such as walls, must be built into the rules so they
are predictive. To close the loop, the detected features can be displayed as
they are found or refined. The evolutionary rules predicted by our framework can
lead to new science { not only understanding the underlying phenomena but also
leading to computationally simpler models that encapsulate the essentials.
