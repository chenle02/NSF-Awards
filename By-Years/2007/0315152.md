LeRoy Peterson and Kenneth Williams, Francis Marion University, and Hans-Conrad
zur Loye, University of South Carolina, are jointly supported for research in
organic-inorganic hybrid materials. They will prepare and characterize new
ligands derived from bipyridines, incorporate them into new organic-inorganic
hybrid materials, investigate new organically templated polyhalobismuthates, and
synthesize new II/VI and III/V supertetrahedral clusters.

These hybrid materials often have porous structures that can support catalysts
or selectively separate gases. They also show interesting electronic and optical
behaviors. This project also builds a collaborative project between a primarily
undergraduate institution and a Ph.D. granting institution in South Carolina.
Undergraduates from Francis Marion University will conduct cutting-edge
materials chemistry research and interact with faculty and graduate students at
the University of South Carolina. This project will also involve female and
African-American students, contributing to a diverse and well-trained future
workforce.
