This project concerns the role of perceptually concrete materials in teaching
generalizable scientific concepts, with a particular emphasis on computer
simulations. While concrete content appears to facilitate the learning of
specific pieces of information, previous research has shown that it may impair
students' ability to apply that information to new situations. The proposed
studies explore the relation between the superficial, concrete details through
which a phenomenon is presented, and the abstraction of deeper scientific
principles underlying the phenomenon. The specific content to be learned
concerns the principles of complex systems in a range of STEM domains such as
civil engineering, biology, economics, and mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research methods involve classroom-based and laboratory experiments
incorporating computer simulations of scientific principles. By observing how
interaction with one simulation affects students' understanding of subsequently
presented information, the investigators can assess the degree to which the
underlying scientific principle has been successfully abstracted. The proposed
research is divided into two broad lines. First, the investigators explore the
role of comparison of multiple cases in students' ability to acquire
generalizable principles from concrete examples. Second, they examine the degree
to which physically and spatially plausible mechanical systems may serve as
models for understanding complex or unintuitive causal systems. In both lines,
the investigators explore the ways in which learning is affected by factors such
as the degree and type of concrete detail depicted, the relative overlap of
concrete and structural information between cases, and the concrete and
structural variability with the test cases. Studies will include students in 8th
grade science classes.
