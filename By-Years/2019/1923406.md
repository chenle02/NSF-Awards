University of California - San Diego's Center for Research on Educational
Equity, Assessment and Teaching Excellence (CREATE) and Education Studies
Department will develop the Computer Science: Learning and Inquiring with
Students Through Equity Networks (CS-LISTEN) as a Pre-K12 Pathways project. In
K12 education, the use of students as change partners is rare. This project will
use a Youth Participatory Action Research methodology to gather student voices
around CS4All and equity. This project will leverage an existing research-
practice partnership formed around student co-research, communities of practice,
and network improvement communities to rectify the lack of student
participatory-design shortcomings in student pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
