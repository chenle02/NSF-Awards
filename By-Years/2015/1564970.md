This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Randolph College in Lynchburg,
Virginia will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students pursuing
bachelor's degrees with a major in a physical science, engineering, or
mathematics. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic
support to increase persistence and degree completion. Project efforts will
include an intensive summer transition program; a seminar series through the
four years of college; enhanced tutoring services in a living-learning
community; peer, faculty, and industry mentoring program; and enhanced access to
internships and research opportunities. The project will also conduct research
to help determine the most effective way to utilize mentors from industry in
helping to support student degree completion. Scholarships and support for
academically strong low-income students, who may not otherwise be able to afford
college, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to
the economic vitality of Virginia and the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will advance understanding of the role of living-learning communities,
research participation and use of mentors from industry to increase retention
and degree attainment in STEM majors. Mentoring will be a particular subject of
study. While the value of mentoring is well accepted, a majority of prior work
in this area focuses on peer or faculty mentors. The project at Randolph College
will study mentoring of undergraduates by industry professionals. The study will
attempt to assess factors impacting students' potential for mentoring and will
develop effective models for structuring the mentoring experience with mentors
from industry. The findings that emerge from the program will be disseminated
widely to the STEM education community and will help to increase understanding
of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support
programs.
