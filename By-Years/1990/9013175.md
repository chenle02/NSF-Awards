This award will help support a 12 month research visit to the laboratories of
the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI), in collaboration with Dr.
Yasuharu Sugiyama. Dr. Kim will take part in experiments at subbarrier energies
which are tailored to study the earliest phase of heavy-ion reactions through
nuclear interactions. These experiments should advance our views of interactions
between heavy-ions below and near the interaction barrier. These experiments
were conceived and proposed by the Reaction Dynamics Group of the Oak Ridge
National Lab Physics Division and rely on the superb resolving power of the
magnetic spectrometer (ENMA) and the high-quality heavy-ion beams of the JAERI
laboratory.
