The objectives of this research are threefold: (1) to use cladistic data to
delimit areas of endemism in and reconstruct the biogeographic history of the
cool-temperate afromontane rain forest biota in Africa and Madagascar; (2) to
revise and provide cladistic analyses for several spider taxa occurring in
Africa and Madagascar likely to contribute to (1), and (3) to contribute to the
higher classification of the spider superfamilies Araneoidea, Lycosoidea, and
Migoidea. The resulting area cladogram will provide information bearing upon
several hypotheses regarding the age and mode of origin of patterns within the
forest biota in Africa and Madagascar. Funding is requested for personnel,
equipment, and travel necessary to complete revisionary studies on the
Cyatholipidae, Zoropsidae, Migidae, Microstigmatidae, Amaurobiidae Phyxelidinae,
and Orsolobidae. The revisions will be based upon material already in museums as
well as that acquired on collecting trips to Cameroon, Madagascar, and Tanzania.
