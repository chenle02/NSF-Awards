9361742 Levesque This project is to develop runtime analysis tools that can
examine the data distribution of a program, and establish a communication
pattern for transferring the data between processors. Additionally, it will be
important to supply the user with a facility to arrive at an optimal
decomposition of data on irregular grids across the parallel system. The success
of this project will assure the availability of powerful parallelization tools
for converting large FORTRAN applications to massively parallel processing more
viable for users from many application areas. ***
