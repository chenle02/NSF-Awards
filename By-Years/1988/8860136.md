Methods for reliably assessing the in-situ strength of timber piles will be
studied using nondestructive evaluation procedures involving spectral analysis
of longitudinal stress wave parameters. Basically the nondestructive test
parameters are obtained by impacting the speciman longitudinally and recording
the input and output sonic waves that result from the impact. Using a number of
advanced statistical procedures, correlations are obtained between the waveform
parameters and the mechanical properties of the timber piles. Development of
reliable nondestructive test procedures for in-situ wood piles will enable
structural engineers to evaluate the structural reliability and rehabilitation
potential of existing pile structures.
