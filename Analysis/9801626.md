Proposal:DMS-9801626 Principal Investigator: Joseph J. Kohn Abstract: Kohn will
continue to do research in the theory of several complex variables, partial
differential equations and related topics. In particular, he is interested in:
global regularity, hypoellipticity, Holder and L-p estimates, domains with
piecewise smooth boundaries, and embeddings of CR manifolds. Kohn is currently
working on the subject of hypoellipticity both for boundary behavior in several
complex variables and for differential and pseudodifferential operators. His
interest is in finding qualitative (be they geometric or algebraic) conditions
under which hypoellipticity holds. The technical part of much of this research
is connected with estimates which do not "gain" smoothness, so the error terms
are of the same magnitude as the object one is trying to estimate. Kohn is
developing techniques to deal with this type of difficulty. Since Cardano's work
on the cubic equation in the sixteenth century it has been known that complex
numbers are needed, as an intermediary step, to find real solutions of certain
problems even when such numbers appear neither in the statements nor in the
solutions of the problems themselves. Thus, by the middle of the last century,
it was recognized that complex analysis is deeply intertwined with many
fundamental problems of mathematics, science, and technology. One of the most
spectacular instances of this is the use of "Dirichlet's principle" (which
arises in fluid mechanics) to understand the foundations of the theory of
functions of one complex variable and, in turn, the use of complex analysis in
the study of fluid flows. In recent times much of the research in complex
analysis has focused on functions of several complex variables, where the
counterpart of the Dirichlet principle appears in what is known as Hodge theory
and in the so-called d-bar Neumann problem. Kohn is doing research in this area,
research that also involves work in partial differential equations, harmonic a
nalysis, and geometry. Kohn is currently working on problems of "smoothness" and
"propagation of singularities" that arise in the study of partial differential
equations.
