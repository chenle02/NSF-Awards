The San Diego Supercomputer Center and the National Center for Atmospheric
Research will conduct a summer institute that will present a series of cutting-
edge topics in geocyberinfrastructure to 40+ participants. The topics are data
management, Web services, grid technology, GIS, parallel processing, and
scientific workflows. These are important topics that can provide immediate
benefit to the community at large. A selection committee will choose applicants
from across the Earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences. The participants will be
expected to serve as ambassadors for the IT topics in their home institutions.
Additionally, the proceedings will be videotaped and content placed on a Web
site to ensure the broadest possible impact. The institute is intended to serve
as a prototype for an expanded educational program in the future.
