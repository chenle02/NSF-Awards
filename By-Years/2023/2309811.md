The Number Theory and Combinatorics in Duluth Conference will be held at the
University of Minnesota, Duluth, from July 31 to August 4, 2023. The goal of
this conference is to bring together people of all career stages, from students
to internationally recognized experts, who are studying topics in combinatorics
and number theory from various overlapping perspectives. This conference will
feature invited talks by researchers working at the forefront of their fields as
well as contributed talks and 5-minute lightning talk sessions, which will
enable every participant to speak. Mathematicians from underrepresented
demographics, early career researchers, and researchers from non-R1 institutions
are especially encouraged to attend to ensure a broad exchange of knowledge and
perspectives.

Combinatorics and number theory have been historically interconnected in a
variety of ways and have been central in both answering many classical questions
and leading to new research directions. Examples include the Gauss circle
problem, generating functions, representations of integers as sums of squares
and Jacobi's formulas, the partition function, and the work of Ramanujan. These
connections have been especially prominent in recent years, particularly due to
the extensive use of tools from one area to the benefit of the other. This
conference will bring together a wide variety of researchers, and the format of
the conference has been designed to give all participants the opportunity to
speak to facilitate the exchange of ideas and to encourage collaboration. The
