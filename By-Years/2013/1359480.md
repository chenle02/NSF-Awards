The goal of this REU Site is to engage undergraduate students on a wide range of
aspects in robotics research - including mechanical engineering, design,
electrical engineering, and computer science - while learning how to build
complete systems that are able to deal with all of the complexities and
uncertainties of the real world. REU students gain insight into the process of
doing research in a university environment, what it takes to be a successful
graduate student, working on a multi-disciplinary robotics project in a large
research group, and what graduate student life looks like. The skills that
students are learning by participating in this REU Site will prepare them for
graduate studies and to enter the rapidly-expanding robotics industry, and help
the United States maintain its lead as a technological innovator. We are
starting to see robots enter our daily lives, and we need students who
understand how to put together complete working systems and make them work in
the real world. The ability to work as a team, across disciplines, is a vital
skill in today's research and work environments, and not only in robotics. This
REU Site is teaching students the non-technical skills that will make them
attractive hires in any field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU students work alongside
with faculty, graduate students, and other undergraduates on cutting-edge
problems in robotics, with the goal of getting robots to work robustly in the
real world, not just in the laboratory. Student projects are advancing the state
of the art in walking robots, human-robot interaction, control of complex
mechanical systems, and long-term autonomy. More information about this REU Site
