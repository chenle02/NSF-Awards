Communication lifelines, such as those provided by the nation's public switched
networks, are essential to effective and speedy recovery from damaging
earthquakes. However, communication lifelines, including those used for
emergency governmental communications, are themselves vulnerable. There is,
therefore, a need to develop a capability to project the extent, duration, and
failure modes of telecommunication lifelines service outages for two purposes:
1) to estimate the potential magnitude of the communications problem that can be
anticipated in the aftermath of major earthquakes, and 2) to identify measures
or system enhancements for preventing or mitigating those problems. This effort
will develop a forum to bring together the practical experience of the
telecommunications industry with the theoretical knowledge and methodological
techniques of the research and academic communities in a multi-disciplinary
Workshop that provides a unique opportunity to share the theoretical and
practical understandings of the impacts of major earthquakes on communication
lifelines. The primary purpose of the Workshop is to exchange ideas and thereby
stimulate improved approaches to projecting, and ultimately reducing,
communication lifeline damage and service outages from major earthquakes. This
activity will provide a critical component of the technical basis required for
the development and implementation of mitigation measures focusing on the
planning and design safety of communication networks and systems exposed to the
threat of earthquakes. It is also intended to serve program development in
research efforts related to the seismic resistant design of urban lifeline
systems.
