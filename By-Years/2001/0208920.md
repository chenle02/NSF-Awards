&lt;br/&gt;Energy is becoming the limiting resource for many applications, as
processor performance and network bandwidth continue to rapidly advance. Devices
such as wireless sensor networks, cell phones with integrated personal
organizers (PDAs), laptops, and even Internet hosting centers are all concerned
about power consumption either due to limited battery capacity or the high cost
of operating and cooling large server farms. In many of these systems main
memory can become a significant portion of the overall power budget,
particularly with the advent of low-power, high-performance
processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates main memory power
management research issues that span several levels of computer system design:
from the operating system managing memory power states, to the design
characteristics of platform architectures, and finally down to the details of
internal DRAM organization.&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate power
management design decisions within each system level and explore interactions
across levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
