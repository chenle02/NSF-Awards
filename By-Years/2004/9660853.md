*** 96608253 Tang This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
develop an advanced process monitoring technique for the Chemical Mechanical
Polishing (CMP) metal planarization process. CMP planarization was primarily
developed in the semiconductor industry in response to depth of focus budget
problems and multilevel metalization problems. Estimates are that the
approximately $70 million CMP equipment market will grow to $300-400 million by
1997. The planarization capabilities of CMP provide significant relief to the
Depth of Focus Budgets or current microlithographic tools and to process
complexities of multilevel interconnections. ***
