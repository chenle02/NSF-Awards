Support is being provided to purchase a new Charge Coupled Device detector
system for Ritter Observatory with a large format (770 x 1152 pixels) chip and
enhanced blue sensitivity. This detector will be used with an existing echelle
spectrograph to provide four times the wavelength coverage (with equal
integration time) possible with the present CCD, and would permit observations
at shorter wavelengths than is presently possible. Presently 3-4 faculty
members, 4-6 M.S. and Ph.D. level graduate students, and 6-8 undergraduate
Physics majors are involved with observing projects with the Ritter telescope. A
large-format CCD will enhance research opportunities in the areas such as early-
type stellar atmospheres, interstellar material, and stellar chromospheres. Due
to prior purchased of similar CCD system, many components (computer, software,
image display) need not be duplicated. This award is being matched by the
University of Toledo.
