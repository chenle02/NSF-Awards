This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and professional
development experiences for 50 nationally selected secondary school chemistry
teachers in each of three years. The overall goals of the multiyear project
involve the updating and deepening of the participants' chemistry backgrounds
and teaching methodologies, the networking of the participants with university
science faculty, the conduct of planned in-service workshops by the participants
in their home schools and area colleges, appropriate recognition for honors-
teachers participants, the dissemination of the project materials and results
nationally, the investigation of the modelistic approach within a carefully
planned documentation, assessment and evaluation effort. The summer leadership
institutes will be held on the Princeton University campus. These will be
staffed by four renowned university scientists/chemical educators and by an
outstanding secondary school chemistry teacher with special expertise in
computer applications to chemistry teaching. An advisory committee of
distinguished scientists and educators will guide the planning of the program
and the conduct of the evaluation and documentation activities. Participants
will be encouraged to submit proposals for regional workshops conducted for
other teachers; modest grants to support materials purchase and other costs will
be available.
