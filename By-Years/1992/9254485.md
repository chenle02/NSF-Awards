ABSTRACT ESI 92-54485 Ricky Carter Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, Inc. Cambridge,
MA Mathematical Inquiry Video Tapes: Tools for Professional Growth This is a
3-year project to develop and disseminate some 10 20- minute video tapes for use
in pre- and in-service programs for middle school mathematics teachers. The
tapes deal with problems that arise when teachers try to introduce inquiry-based
learning into their classrooms, and focus on: (1) the use of technology as an
effective tool for supporting student investigations; and (2) the role of the
teacher in facilitating student conversations about mathematics. Each tape
highlights a particular issue, like: characteristics of inquiry-oriented tasks;
management of pair- and small-group work; when to intervene? etc. The tapes are
as "unstaged" as possible--featuring real teachers with real students in real
classrooms. They are based on pieces of curriculum that PIs of major curriculum
projects have identified as being particularly suited for illustrating various
aspects of inquiry learning. In addition to the classroom footage, each tape
also shows teachers reflecting on the issues illustrated on the tape. The tapes
are to be pilot-tested in a variety of settings, including television broadcasts
to teachers, regional summer workshops, school-site workshops, etc. A national
Advisory Board, as well as an outside evaluator, monitor the development of the
tapes throughout the various stages of development--from initial script outlines
to raw video footage to pilot-testing and on to the final edited product. The
completed packets--consisting of a video tape and appropriate accompanying print
material--will be made available to NSF-funded teacher enhancement projects, and
to others via EdCo (a consortium of greater Boston school districts)), MCET (the
Massachusetts Educational Telecommunication Network, and a private publisher.
Cost sharing is $121,600, which is 11% of the total NSF contribution.
