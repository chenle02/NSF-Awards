This grant under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions program supports the
development and fabrication of superconducting thin film devices. They are to be
used as detectors to record the passage of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
speculated to be the eagerly sought dark matter in the universe. The new devices
will detect phonons in extremely sensitive superconducting tunnel junctions
sensors. The research will be carried out at the sophisticated facilities
created by the P.I. with support from NSF in previous years at San Francisco
State University.
