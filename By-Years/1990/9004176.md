We will determine the relative timing of genetic recombination and chromosome
pairing in normal strains of the fungus Coprinus cinereus. We will ask if the
presence of flanking insertion/deletion heterozygosities alters the timing or
amount of exchange in the test interval. We will examine recombination in the
test interval using strains that fail to complete chromosome pairing due to the
presence of the rad3-1 mutation. We will also monitor the timing of genetic
exchange between homologous sequences that are located at non-homologous
positions in the genome. The specificity of meiotic chromosome pairing is not
known. It has been suggested that some aspects of the recombination mechanism
might provide this specificity, but evidence to test these models is lacking.
Such models would predict that exchange should precede or occur simultaneously
with pairing, but not follow pairing. Such models also predict the occurrence of
mutant strains that are recombination-proficient but pairing deficient. These
two predictions will be tested in the experiments proposed here. The results
will provide an important framework for understanding the molecular basis of
homologue recognition in meiotic prophase. All living organisms have mechanisms
to ensure that their genetic information, packaged in their chromosomes is
passed from one generations to the next in a faithful and orderly way. This is a
proposal to resolve some important long-standing questions about the nature of
these mechanisms.
