The Institute for Telecommunications Technologies (IT2), a regional partner of
the National Center for Telecommunications Technologies (NCTT), develops a
telecommunication and convergence technologies program in San Diego area.
Working with the large telecommunications Industry in the area, the project
establishes a hands-on teaching and learning telecommunications laboratory and a
comprehensive curriculum that includes web-based learning modules and self-paced
tutorials, and teacher education workshops. The project develops articulation
agreements with feeder high school districts and partners with four-year
colleges and universities in the San Diego area. To increase the representation
of women in telecommunications technology, the project provides counseling and
encouragement of high school women and student and faculty mentoring of women
students along with a dedicated website.
