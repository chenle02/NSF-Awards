The Problem of self consistent plasma wave-particle interaction is studied using
the CHIP-1 facility. The objective is to explore these interactions under
chaotic conditions in order to provide a meaningful set of data useful to plasma
theorists studying chaotic motion. The research has application to space physics
and particle accelerators and has significance in many other areas of physics
trying to understand and predict chaotic dynamics.
