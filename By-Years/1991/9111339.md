A Research Initiation Award will fund a study of advanced nondestructive testing
of structural materials by acoustic emission. A combination of model development
and experimental validation will be used. The model will use an acoustic signal
source which is an actual crack propagation and arrest event and which includes
crack location and orientation, crack tip velocity and duration of propagation,
component geometry, and mode of fracture. The dynamic stresses will be
calculated at each point by the integral method. From the stresses the local
dynamic displacements will be calculated and used to determine the expected
acoustic emission signal waveform.
