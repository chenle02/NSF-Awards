George Schatz of Northwestern University is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program within the Division of Chemistry
to study self-assembly processes for a variety of multifunctional nanomaterials
in a variety of chemical processes using theoretical&lt;br/&gt;methods that
include quantum mechanics, empirical potential models (both atomistic and
coarse-grained), molecular dynamics, and statistical mechanical modeling based
on kinetic Monte Carlo and configuration-biased Monte Carlo methods. The self
assembly processes of interest include problems in mechanically induced self
assembly, the formation of chemisorbed aryl, alkane and DNA thiolates on gold
nanoparticles, and amphiphile self-assembly to make micelles and
fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the PI is actively
involved in a wide range of activities to communicate this program of research
and the excitement of nano-science to broader audiences and to train students in
the theoretical methods used in computational nanoscience. Selected projects
from this research program have been incorporated into general chemistry labs
and lectures that are given to hundreds of students at Northwestern each year.
Some of the software is being developed into user-friendly software at
www.nanohub.org, which is a site that provides a graphics front-end, and
gridcomputing backend capabilities.
