This project develops a sustainable and replicable industry-academia partnership
model for helping talented, but financially disadvantaged, students complete
their baccalaureate degrees in timely fashion and move successfully into the
workforce. The activities of the project demonstrate that significant
improvements in retention, placement, and workforce streaming is achieved by
combining scholarships, professional development activities, intervention, and
academic support in a coherent program designed to help empower students to take
responsibility for their own success. Students majoring in Computer Science and
in Civil, Computer, Electrical, Mechanical, and Ocean Engineering are the
scholarship recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the
project is achieved through Professional Development Workshops (PDW), a unique
development of the current CSEMS project, that are highly effective in building
student self-confidence and in broadening their horizons. CSEMS students are
assuming leadership roles in the University and in the
community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project are realized
by making a direct impact on national workforce needs. It supports NSF
initiatives on integration of diversity into its programs and on integration of
research and education. The refined and tested industry-academia student
development model can be replicated in many ways, in whole or in part. For
example, the FAU Colleges of Engineering and Business have joined to offer an
elective course based on PDW concepts that are open to all students in both
Colleges.&lt;br/&gt;
