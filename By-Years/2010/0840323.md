Proposal Title: SGER: Collaborative Research: Exploration of Distributed
Creativity&lt;br/&gt;in Multi-Site 3D Tele-Immersive
Spaces&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-
Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 07/29/08&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the
impact of geographically distributed 3D tele-immersive&lt;br/&gt;environments on
dancers' creativity and their perception of themselves and each
other.&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the project will study the impact of digital
options, such as scale and&lt;br/&gt;multiply, on the dancers' creative
expression and improvisation. A formal notation,&lt;br/&gt;called a creativity
graph, will be derived from a Laban movement analysis of the&lt;br/&gt;dancers'
movement. A dancer develops a creative dance, a new sequence of
phrases,&lt;br/&gt;when he/she generates a new association between two movement
states (e.g. a new&lt;br/&gt;association between two Laban positions) based on
some feedback from the immersive&lt;br/&gt;environment due to either invoking
digital options or due to some unexpected&lt;br/&gt;performance of the system.
This project will have a fundamental impact on our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of
dancers' creativity within tele-immersive dancing environments
and&lt;br/&gt;computing and will contribute a new concept of transformational
movement graphs as a&lt;br/&gt;computational representation of dance creativity
in distributed multi-site 3D&lt;br/&gt;tele-immersive spaces.
