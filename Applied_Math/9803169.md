DMS-9803169 Asymptotic and Statistical Analysis of Volatility and its
Implications for Derivative Pricing and Risk Management K. Ronnie Sircar In
financial mathematics, a methodology (due to Black and Scholes) exists for
pricing and hedging against the risk of derivative securities (eg. options) on
stocks when the volatility of the stock is constant. However, it is widely
believed that volatility has a random component and must be described by a
suitable stochastic model. This project aims to produce a statistical
description of stock volatility dynamics using historical price data, and to
combine it with an asymptotic analysis of the partial differential equation for
derivative prices to infer the market's view of probable future stock movements,
and in particular, whether this view has become more pessimistic since the 1987
crash. The analysis will exploit the discrepancy in time-scales of fluctuation
between the Brownian motion driving the stock price process and the volatility
stochastic process. The spectacular growth in the size of the derivatives market
over the last twenty years (currently it has a turnover of trillions of dollars
in the US) plus recent infamous (and equally spectacular) risk (mis)management
disasters such as the Barings and Orange County fiascos, have created an urgent
need for good mathematical and computational models to quantify the respective
risks and rewards of such investments. This project aims to build on the Nobel
Prize winning methodology of Black, Scholes and Merton, to take into account the
fluctuating nature of market volatility. Mathematical tools are combined with
statistical analysis of past prices to produce formulas and software that
accurately capture the potential losses and gains in today's vast derivative
market.
