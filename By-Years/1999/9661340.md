*** 96-61340 Micheels This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
Project will develop a novel portable and low cost nitrogen dioxide gas monitor
for air quality testing and leak detection. The monitor is based on photo-
acoustic detection and incorporates recent advances in electro-optics to provide
a practical, high sensitivity, portable detection device. This nitrogen dioxide
gas sensor is expected to have much improved detection sensitivity, shorter
response time, lower maintenance, and little or no chemical interference. Phase
I will build a prototype instrument and subject it to critical tests to evaluate
its performance for trace atmospheric nitrogen dioxide monitoring. Such
monitoring is of great importance in urban areas where nitrogen dioxide produced
from fossil fuel combustion results in serious human health hazards. This high
sensitivity, portable monitor will find commercial applications: a) in air
quality monitoring in urban areas that have air pollution problems, and b) in
leak detection and industrial hygiene in chemical process plants that use or
produce nitrogen dioxide in their operations. ***
