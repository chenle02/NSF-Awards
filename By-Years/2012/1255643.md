Dr. Matthew Wolf-Meyer and Dr. Nancy Chen, both of the Department of
Anthropology at the University of California-Santa Cruz, will convene two linked
workshops, one in Santa Cruz and the other in Los Angeles. At each of these
workshops they will bring together researchers whose work informs understanding
of the contemporary practice and experiences of medical pluralism in the United
States. Medical pluralism refers to the coexistance of different medical systems
in a single societal context. While most previous research on medical pluralism
has been on the extension of allopathic or western medicine into non-western
societies, Wolf-Meyer and Chen will focus their workshops on consumer choice in
contemporary western, market-driven contexts. Because of its long tradition of
diverse immigration and multiple established medical treatment options,
California is a particularly apt site for this undertaking. The outcome of the
workshop will be a special issue of a professional journal on medical pluralism
in the United States, and the establishment of a network of researchers who can
pool their collective knowledge and resources for future research, grant
applications, and publications.
