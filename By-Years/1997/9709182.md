*** 9709182 IBERS This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at
Northwestern University to acquire two IBM workstations with associated
software. This equipment will enhance research in which the primary applications
will center in the areas of electronic structure, both in the development of new
codes using density function, relativistic and ab-initio methods, and in
applications to problems ranging from chemical dynamics through electron
transfer and molecular spectra to embedded clusters. A workstation network of
fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs
of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development
environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art
graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art
applications of parallel processing. ***
