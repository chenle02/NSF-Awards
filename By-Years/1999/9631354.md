Impingement of fish into hydroelectric dams and water intakes to power plants
is a significant problem in many parts of the United States. The problems are
two-fold. First, many fish are killed when they encounter the dams or intakes
and cannot escape the rapidly flowing water. Second, there is potential damage
to the power generating equipment due to the large number of impinged fish.
Thus, it is of considerable economic importance to find ways to prevent the
interactions between fish and the dams or power plant intakes. One of the most
successful methods developed to date is the use of high frequency sound to repel
clupeid fishes (herrings and relatives) from these obstacles. For reasons that
are yet unknown, these commercially important species swim away from these
sounds. At the same time, we know very little about how clupeids detect the
ultrasonic sounds, or the kinds of sounds that can be most successfully used to
repel the fish. The purpose of this study is to examine the hearing ability of
clupeids in order to better understand how they detect sounds, and which sounds
they detect, with the ultimate goal being to develop methods to more effectively
prevent the impingement of clupeids at dams and power plant intakes.
