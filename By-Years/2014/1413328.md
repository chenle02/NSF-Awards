The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr.
Yi Lu of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to study the dependence of
the redox potential of metal centers in proteins on the secondary coordination
sphere of the metal center. This effort is important because the redox potential
of proteins is a property at the heart of many chemical and biological
processes, ranging from electron transfer in photosynthesis and respiration, to
catalysis in fuel cells and nitrogen fixation. Despite the importance of redox
potentials, a comprehensive and systematic understanding of factors that control
the redox potentials of the proteins, particularly those factors that do not
perturb the primary coordination sphere of the metal centers, remains elusive.
This project will contribute to filling this knowledge gap; the new knowledge
will be applied in addressing interesting problems in chemistry and biology. The
interdisciplinary research will be a ground for the sound training of students.
The results of the research will be integrated in new and existing courses and
in presentations to a broad range of audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research project will advance the fundamental understanding of the factors that
affect the redox potential of metal centers in proteins. The new understanding
will be applied in the synthesis of new water-soluble, stable redox agents for
biochemical studies, which in turn will be used to study the transfer of
electrons in the inverted regime of Marcus theory, and of biocatalysts whose
activity is tuned by changes in their redox potential. The methods by which the
redox potential will be rationally modified include point mutation directed
exclusively to the second-coordination sphere of the metal, use of non-natural
amino acids to change the steric and electronic properties of the metal site in
ways not possible using natural amino acids, and protein directed evolution to
afford the fast exploration of a relatively large sequence space.
