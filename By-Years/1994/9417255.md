This award is for support for a three year project to continue an on-going study
of time-dependent processes of Antarctic ice sheet snow accumulation and
transport dynamics, using a recently developed system which automatically
disperses colored glass microspheres onto the snow surface at 14 day intervals.
The microspheres act as both a time marker and tracer within the snow profiles.
Currently, two units are deployed on the Ross Ice Shelf near automatic weather
stations. After another year of operation at the existing sites they will be
moved and operated for two years at an automatic weather station site influenced
by strong katabatic winds and an automatic geophysical observatory facility on
the polar plateau, where precipitation and wind-blown snow characteristics are
very different from coastal regions. This research will combine experimental and
modeling approaches to try to understand the processes controlling snow
accumulation and wind-driven transport of snow.
