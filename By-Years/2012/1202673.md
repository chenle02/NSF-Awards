Borehole temperatures provide a history of the surface temperature variability
and are thus extremely useful for paleoclimate reconstructions. A database of
borehole temperatures was produced by researchers at the University of Michigan
and has been available for the research community for about 15 years. It is in
need of updating and expanding, which is the principal aim of this project. The
Principal Investigator of this project is one of the original authors of the
database. The five goals of the project are: 1) to renovate and maintain the
database with the latest online database technology; 2) to continue data
acquisition for better geographical coverage; 3) to refine the climate
reconstruction techniques to improve surface temperature reconstructions of the
past several millennia or more; 4) to assess the uncertainties of the borehole
reconstructions and how they compare to traditional proxy-based reconstructions;
and 5) to compare the borehole reconstructions with Climate Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) model simulations to evaluate the energy fluxes
across the ground surface and the change in heat content of the near surface
solid earth since the last glacial maximum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts include some undergraduate student training and mentoring, but
principally the development of an accessible database of borehole temperatures
in collaboration with the National Climate Data Center, Paleoclimatology Branch.
