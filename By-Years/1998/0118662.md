The National Research Council (NRC) through its Division on Engineering and
Physical Sciences, will conduct a workshop to investigate the potential role for
NSF in innovative research for improved fire safety. The purpose of this
workshop will be to survey and assess the current state of knowledge, research,
education, and training in the fire safety field. The results of the workshop
will help to define how best to marshal U.S. intellectual, financial, and
institutional resources to develop the knowledge necessary to save lives and
reduce injuries and property loss from fire. The final report will specifically
address the potential of the National Science Foundation to serve as an
incubator for basic and interdisciplinary research, professional collaboration,
graduate and undergraduate education, and technology transfer in the field of
fire safety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
