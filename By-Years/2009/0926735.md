This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award the PI will test four
hypotheses about what drives changes in the Atlantic overturning circulation on
orbital timescales over the last 3 Ma. A dataset of more than sixty benthic
oxygen isotope records and more than fifty carbon isotope records will be used
to reconstruct detailed patterns of circulation change and link specific
circulation responses with particular forcing mechanisms. This work will
contribute to the understanding of which forcings are important drivers of
circulation change and how overturning changes affect regional and global
climate. Funds will support a PhD student. The PI is an early career female
scientist with no prior funding from NSF.
