ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal aims at developing new tools in low-
dimensional dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;Studying laminations/polynomials requires a
combination of techniques &lt;br/&gt;which already allowed us to show the
existence of wandering gaps of &lt;br/&gt;laminations and should lead to the
description of dynamics of an individual &lt;br/&gt;polynomial, and to the
description of the combinatorial analog of the &lt;br/&gt;boundary of the
connectedness locus (i.e., the Mandelbrot set for high &lt;br/&gt;degree
polynomials). For the cycles of polynomials we plan to develop&lt;br/&gt;the
rotation theory analogous to that for interval maps, and a version &lt;br/&gt;of
the Sharkovskii theorem. We continue developing theory of &lt;br/&gt;c-tent
plane maps which combine expansive properties of tent maps with
&lt;br/&gt;properties of complex quadratic maps and should play the same role
for &lt;br/&gt;quadratic complex maps as tent maps play on the interval. We also
deal &lt;br/&gt;with Milnor attractors for conformal measures of complex maps,
and &lt;br/&gt;work on some problems in interval
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some natural processes/maps are described by low-
dimensional dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;The project aims at solving a few
problems helping describe these maps,&lt;br/&gt;as well as their families. Among
non-invertible maps in dimensions higher&lt;br/&gt;than 1 the best in terms of
their properties are complex polynomials, and&lt;br/&gt;we plan to study the
families of their combinatorial analogs for dimensions &lt;br/&gt;higher than 2,
as well as individual polynomials in terms of the coexistence&lt;br/&gt;of their
cycles (periodic processes). We also study so-called c-tent
map,&lt;br/&gt;Milnor attractors, and some problems for map of the
interval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
