This three.year project will examine the development of tactile discrimination.
It is known that information on touch projects to a region of the brain labelled
S1, the primary somatosensory cortex. Single nerve cells in S1 respond to touch
applied to particular local areas of the body, and the area eliciting a response
is called the "receptive field" of that cell. The most effective tactile
stimulus for the receptive field of a given cell may have particular spatial
features (such as preference for small points, or separation distance between
points) and temporal features (such as rapidly vibrating or moving points, or a
maintained touch). In recent studies in kittens, the responses of cortical cells
appeared to be limited compared to those in adults. Yet in monkeys, infants show
touch discrimination that is at least equal to adults. This study will examine
S1 neurons and psychophysical thresholds in response to patterned tactile
stimulation, in macaque monkeys during the first year of age. Response types
will be classified by their capacity to code spatial and temporal features of
geometric dot patterns applied to the skin of the hand. The stimuli will be
presented by an automated discrimination apparatus. Both behavioral
discriminations (using a "same or different" decision) and neuronal firing
patterns will be quantitatively measured. It is expected that the capacity of
neurons to signal differences between different surfaces will relate to the
capacity to make behavioral discriminations among these same surfaces.
