0119494&lt;br/&gt;Wu&lt;br/&gt;The development of a technology for performing
endoscopic cellular level imaging inside the body would have a powerful impact
on biomedical research and health care. This program is a collaboration between
investigators at UCLA specializing in MEMS optical technology and investigators
at MIT specializing in biomedical optical imaging. The investigators propose to
develop new microscanning MEMS devices and endoscopically integrate them with
optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, and optical coherence
microscopy, creating a new technology for internal body imaging. Vertically
integrated studies combining novel MEMS device design with biomedical imaging
and clinical feasibility studies will be performed. &lt;br/&gt;
