The investigator and his colleagues study various problems in the analytic
theory of L-functions and mean values of multiplicative functions. In particular
the investigator aims for an improved understanding of the distribution of zeros
of L-functions, their behaviour at special values, and the size of extreme
values in the critical strip. The second main aim of this project is to describe
the spectrum of possible mean-values of multiplicative functions whose values at
primes are constrained to lie in special subsets of the unit disc. The
investigator, in collaboration with Granville, intends to develop further the
close connection between such mean values and solutions to a family of integral
equations.

This project concerns problems in the area of multiplicative number theory. A
fundamental problem in this area is to understand the zeros of the Riemann zeta
function and other L-functions. These functions encode much information about
prime numbers, and other arithmetic objects. Besides being of intrinsic interest
to mathematicians, ideas emerging from these problems have found use in computer
science, cryptography and coding theory.
