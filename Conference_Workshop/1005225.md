The idea that many algebraic invariants in number theory should have analytic
analogues forms one of the central themes of arithmetic geometry today. Iwasawa
theory takes this theme a step further, insisting that certain p-adic limits of
algebraic invariants should have p-adic analytic relatives, an idea that has
proven very fruitful. The PIs are organizing the conference Iwasawa 2010 at the
University of Toronto from July 5-9, 2010, in coordination with the Fields
Institute. This conference is the latest in a biannual series of international
conferences on Iwasawa theory, and the first to be held in North America. The
series has consistently attracted a worldwide audience, and speakers are invited
upon consultation with a distinguished scientific committee. The award will
provide travel support for U.S. speakers and junior researchers to the
conference.

Number theory attempts to answer fundamental questions in arithmetic, such as:
what are the solutions to a given polynomial equation? Iwasawa theory is a major
area of research in number theory that provides, among other things, a means of
relating the solutions of certain such equations to interesting mathematical
functions (known as p-adic L-functions). The award will provide travel support
for U.S. mathematicians to the international conference Iwasawa 2010 organized
at the University of Toronto in coordination with the Fields Institute, during
the period July 5-9, 2010. In particular, support for U.S. graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers will provide them with the opportunity to learn from
some of the foremost experts in the field. Moreover, the conference will educate
the experts on new techniques and developments in Iwasawa theory, thereby
promoting even greater progress on its many open problems and new directions of
research.
