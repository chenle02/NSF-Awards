With this grant Dr. Hunten continues a wide ranging research program of
theoretical studies of the atmospheres of objects in the Solar System. The
projects include investigations of : (1) The effects of infalling ring material
on the atmosphere of Uranus, specifically the possibility that sedimenting dust
might be a heat source for the lower thermosphere; (2) A theory of
micrometeorite entry into an atmosphere, particularly as related to (1); (3) The
atmospheric structure and processes on Mercury and the Moon; (4) The use of a
Mars aeronomical model to study ozone distribution and soil oxidants; (5)
Thermospheric and mesospheric modeling of the terrestrial planets and Pluto; (6)
The structure and energy limited escape of Pluto's upper atmosphere; and (7) The
origin and evolution of the Solar System.
