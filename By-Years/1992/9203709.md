This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant Biology.
The applicant received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley
in molecular genetics in maize. He plans to carry out his postdoctoral
fellowship in the laboratory of Dr. Donald McCarty at University of Florida. His
research entitled "Genetics and molecular biology of embryogenesis and seed
maturation in maize" will broaden the applicant's scientific training into plant
development.
