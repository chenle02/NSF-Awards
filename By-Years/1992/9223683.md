9223683 Clifton This award is for the renewal of funding for the Materials
Research Group at Brown University on the topic of micro- and nano-mechanics of
failure resistant materials. The research emphasizes the extension of solid
mechanics analysis to smaller length scales. Advances in high-resolution
electron microscopy with the development of Computational Fourier Transform
method for interpreting atomic-resolution micrographs of regions near atomic
lattice defects have been combined with advances in lattice-statics modelling
and modelling of the interactions of discrete dislocations to achieve
measurements and computations down to nanometer scale. The topics emphasized
include optimization of reinforcement size, shape, and distribution in
composites; thermal cycling creep of fiber-reinforced composites; frictional
resistance to fiber pull-out; void growth by coupled diffusion and deformation;
crack tip fields; and deformation patterns and shear band formations. The new
research addresses improved failure resistance in two critically important
technologies: composites and microelectronics. These applications require a
deeper understanding of the basic mechanisms of plastic deformation and fracture
on the scale of the microstructure of the material. The research requires
expertise in both solid mechanics and materials science and engineering.
Students are being trained with skills in these complementary disciplines.
