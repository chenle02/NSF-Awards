The investigator studies three types of problems in structural graph theory. (1)
To determine if a given graph contains spanning subgraphs with small maximum
degree, in particular, Hamilton cycles and spanning trees. (2) To determine if a
given graph contains a specific graph as a topological minor. (3) To determine
the number of cycles in a cycle decomposition or cycle covering of a graph. The
invesitgator also works on the knapsack problem in combinatorial optimization.

A graph can be viewed as a network which consists of nodes and links. Graph
theory studies properties of networks (such as reliability) which are of both
theoretical and practical interest. The investigator works on problems
concerning the existence of small networks inside big networks. The research has
potential applications in designing networks where special reliability condition
is required at certain nodes.
