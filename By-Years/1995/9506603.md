9506603 Van Vleck The Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences and the
Center for Wave Phenomena at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) propose to
purchase one Silicon Graphics Power Challenge L and five Silicon Graphics
Indigo2 workstations. These machines will comprise the core research computing
environment for both the Department and the Center. This environment will
facilitate the generation of distributed code for ongoing research projects at
CSM. The system will provide a distributed computing environment that will be
employed for several projects. In particular, it will immediately enhance
projects in (1) Computational Biological and Material Sciences, (2) Parallel
Numerical Methods, (3) Symbolic Computation, (4) Neural Networks, and (5)
Seismic Modeling and Inversion.
