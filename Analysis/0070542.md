Chang proposes to continue her study of problems in conformal geometry involving
higher order elliptic operators and systems. The main theme is to study the
integrand of the Gauss-Bonnet formula on 4-manifolds via a fourth order elliptic
operator with leading term the bi-Laplace operator called the Paneitz operator.
Three research projects are proposed. The first one connects the study of the
integrand to the study of Monge-Ampere equations. The second one is to extend
her earlier work on the regularity of bi-harmonic maps to a general setting. The
third one is to generalize the classical work of Cohn-Vossen and Huber relating
the growth of the Gaussian curvature to the Euler characteristic from complete
surfaces to complete 4-manifolds.

The main motivation of the project is to study the geometric and topological
structure of manifolds via analytic methods--mainly via the study of the partial
differential equations satisfied by the curvature of the manifold.
