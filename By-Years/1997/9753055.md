9753055 Landau, Susan University of Massachusetts POWRE: Certification of
Security Protocols This research involves security properties of protocols and
other systems that are built with cryptographic techniques. Investigators look
at two principal issues; the first is ``protocol busting,'' which studies how
complex protocols built from other pieces (such as secure cryptographic systems)
can become insecure through misuse of the cryptographic pieces or through
unwarranted assumptions about them. The second issue being tackled is developing
methods to certify security properties. Research in protocol-busting involves
the examination of proposed password-based session-key agreement protocols, and
studies characterizations under which an authentication scheme can safely
incorporate a small shared piece of secret information (e.g. a password). The
investigators develop protocols for multi-user authentication when the group is
large and in flux; techniques include graph-theoretic and algebraic methods. The
investigator is studying certification schemes of cryptosystems for
authentication in a distributed network. Developing a certification scheme means
developing a logical framework for the various types of attacks that have arisen
on cryptosystems, and then developing a suite of appropriate tests. The
distributed algorithms work concerns developing protocols to delegate authority
in a multi-user environment.
