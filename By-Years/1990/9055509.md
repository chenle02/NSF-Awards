ASTRONOMY - HOW DO WE KNOW? is a 4100 sq. ft. exhibit and program package for
Discovery Place that will: 1) interpret the physical and chemical nature of
astronomical bodies in the Universe, highlighting the scientific processes used
in their discovery, 2) interpret, through interactive exhibits and programs, the
basic technologies of the scientific study of astronomy, and 3) function as the
complementary exhibition area to the new Spitz Space Voyager Planetarium system
and its multi-dimensional program capabilities. ASTRONOMY - HOW DO WE KNOW? will
make the science of astronomy more accessible to the public by demonstrating the
above objectives through the fundamental concepts of Gravity, Light, Motion and
Distance. Visitors will leave with a greater understanding of the process of
learning about the Universe. Discovery Place will utilize the formative
evaluation process in developing these exhibits to assure a product that will
not only appeal to a broad audience, but will also meet a variety of identified
needs within that audience. The exhibit and program package will open in
October, 1992, with an anticipated yearly attendance of 700,000. The exhibits
will be a permanent part of the museum and will be renewed through the general
operating budget of the museum.
