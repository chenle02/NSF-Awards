Geology, unlike astronomy, physics, or geometry, is of relatively recent
origins as a science. It cannot trace its history back to ancient times.
Clearly, thinkers in antiquity and medieval times observed and offered
explanations for certain terrestrial phenomena, but geology came into being only
in the wake of the great intellectual transformations of the 17th and 18th
centuries. The ingredients of a specifically geological perspective -- e.g., a
view of the earth not as a cosmic region but as an object; a historical outlook
on nature, and ideas on how to decipher the earth's superficial parts
historically; conviction that the earth's constituents are governed by processes
reducible to general understanding -- were gradually assembled over the course
of a century and a half, before the spectacular success of geological science
became evident in the first part of the 19th century leading up to the work of
Charles Darwin. Dr. Taylor is investigating the early development of geological
science by focussing on the historical role of natural law as a model for
scientific investigation and explanation in the thought of a group of 18th
century naturalists. By assessing the importance ascribed by a selection of
French scientists during the middle and later decades of the 18th century to
recognition of law-like regularities in their efforts to establish a science of
the earth, Dr. Taylor hopes to contribute to the historical recovery of the
cultural framework of geology's origins. He will examine this groups scientific
works and their use of empirical generalizations in scientific argument. Dr.
Taylor argues that the Enlightenment's emphasis upon reduction of phenomena to
empirical rule was manifested in the ways geological concepts were formualted in
the 18th century, as well as in the ways early geologists began to conduct
fieldwork and to devise methods for graphic representation of phenomena they
thought significant. These studies by Dr. Taylor promise to greatly enhance our
understanding of the origins of the science of geology.
