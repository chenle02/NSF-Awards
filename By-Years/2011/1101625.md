The investigator will study various combinatorial and enumerative problems in
algebraic geometry. Fundamentally linked to these problems are the study of
moduli and parameter spaces and their cohomology theories, the study of objects
combinatorially rich in structure, and degeneration techniques and their
applications. In particular, the investigator proposes to investigate
equivariant quantum cohomology theories, affine Grassmannians, Hessenberg
varieties, flag varieties, moduli spaces of curves, quot schemes, GKM spaces,
and stacks and their toric degenerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research problems are concerned with fruitful interactions between modern
methods in algebraic geometry and new developments in combinatorics, symplectic
geometry, and physics. The proposed projects have significant potential impact
on enhancing the understanding of fundamental objects in algebraic geometry and
their connections to one another. Through research, education, advising, and
organizing, the investigator will promote interactions and collaborations
between students and faculty of colleges and universities.
