The research part of this CAREER project develops accurate and efficient
numerical methods for a number of important problems including high relative
accuracy (tiny percentage error) eigenvalue and singular value computations,
updating the singular value decomposition (SVD), and distance problems in linear
systems and control computations. Although current methods for solving them are
abundant, many important questions remain unanswered. For example, a large
number of recent papers describe numerical methods to compute all eigenvalues
and singular values to high relative accuracy for a few isolated special classes
of matrices, but a common explanation and a common numerical method are missing.
As another example, the ability to rapidly update the SVD is critical in signal
processing applications since problems are often real- time, but none of the
current methods is efficient enough for this purpose. A goal is to provide a
common explanation and a common numerical method for high relative accuracy
eigenvalue and singular value computations. It turns out that the common
explanation and common numerical method are applicable to many new interesting
classes of matrices, arising from areas as diverse as combinatorics and
numerical solution of ODE's and PDE's. The project also aims at providing rapid
methods for updating the SVD, hence removing a major bottleneck in SVD-based
methods for various signal processing applications. The education part of the
project is to develop software tools so that students taking abstract
mathematics courses can clearly envision and play with the sometimes abstract
objects and results on the World-Wide Web with vivid graphical display. The plan
also includes new graduate courses in numerical linear algebra with scientific
and engineering applications.
