This award provides funds for the development, testing and dissemination of two
environmental science courses targeted at freshman and sophomore students. The
focus of the courses will be local environmental issues, with emphasis on
original research projects that involve collection of data in the field.
Although the topics and methodology will be identified by faculty, the research
will be real in that its outcome will not be known ahead of time. The applicants
expect to combine knowledge and techniques from diverse areas of science
(biology, chemistry, geology, and political science) in developing a truly
multidisciplinary program. Funds will also enable the hiring of a recent
graduate who will aid in course development and instruction. The applicants
expect that the courses will figure in development of a Masters in Science
Education program now being planned by a consortium of five colleges in the
Amherst area.
