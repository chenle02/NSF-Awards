9301209 Schaffer This project investigates the potential for processing metals
using pulsed magnetic fields. The research employs positron annihilation
spectroscopy (PAS) to determine the effects of the pulsed magnetic fields on
material structure. The (PAS) results are supported by X-ray diffraction,
hardness, and resistivity measurements. The material structure-related
measurements are correlated with mechanical property measurements (tensile,
hardness and wear). Modeling of the magnetically-induced defect recovery is
pursued by consideration of the behavior of the overlapping stress fields
created by the pulsed magnetic field and the defect structure. %%% This research
will clarify material structural changes induced by magnetic-induced defect
recovery. This could lead to new processing treatments for metallic materials.
