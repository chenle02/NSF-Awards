The University of Toledo will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Chemical Engineering for 40 students entering grades 11,12. The UT
Chemical Engineering Summer Workshop is designed to introduce high school
students to the career opportunities available to them in engineering. Through a
combination of experience: group discussions, laboratory experimentation, hands-
on computer work, independent group investigations and field trips, the Workshop
participants will receive an exciting introduction to the field of engineering.
Additionally, the ethics of engineering and science will also be carefully
explored in an interesting videotaped session and group discussion. Follow-up
activities planned in the academic year include engineering experiments led by
the Workshop participants in their home school science classes, field trips with
the University Student Chemical Engineering Chapter and invitations to the UT
annual engineering college open house.
