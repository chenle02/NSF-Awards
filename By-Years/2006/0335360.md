This one-year design study focuses on the use of information and communications
technologies to enhance both pre-service education and in-service professional
development programs within the MSPs. The project's five key tasks are to: (1)
develop resources to inform the MSPs about approaches to online professional
development, online enhancements for site-based professional development, and
online tools and techniques to support professional learning communities; (2)
provide consultation services for a set of MSP projects that decide to use
online technologies in their teaching enhancement programs; (3) offer a
capacity-building program that will enable MSPs to develop the capacity to
incorporate effective online professional development within their projects; (4)
collaborate with the evaluators of the MSPs that use online technologies to
inform future practices of those projects, other MSPs, and the field of
professional development in general; and, (5) assess the use and potential use
of online supports for improving teacher quality across the MSP projects, to
inform a possible follow-up proposal to expand technical assistance, evaluation,
and research in this area, within the MSP Learning Network.&lt;br/&gt;
