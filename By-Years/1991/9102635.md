This research involves two closely related approaches to debugging parallel
programs, pre-execution static analysis of program source code and post-mortem
trace analysis of an execution history. Pre- execution analysis has the
advantage that all possible executions are explored. Unfortunately, in the worst
case, this analysis may require all possible program states to be examined
resulting in unacceptable complexity. However, techniques developed at UCSC have
shown that, for many programs, program states can be examined in large groups
rather than individually. In contrast, trace analysis algorithms developed at
UCSC execute in polynomial time. They have the disadvantage that only errors
associated with the input used to generate the trace can be detected. In
addition to the refinement of these techniques, this project will investigate
the combination of a single system that ameliorates the disadvantages of each
technique.
