This research investigates the built-in defects and the dry etching damage
introduced in the Si1-xGex films synthesized by various methods, thereby
developing a damage free RIE process for strained and unstrained Si1-xGex
material. The study will involve both physical characterization involving SEM
and TEM and electrical characterization involving I-V, C-V and DLTS
measurements. The etch rate of these films will be measured. A few ion implanted
Si1-xGex samples will be subjected to electrical characterization. The
information from this study will provide significant insight for the process
control during the integration of the Si1-xGex films in industrial silicon VLSI
fabrication processes.
