Recent excavation and survey work by Drs. Edward Schortman and Patricia Urban
in the Naco valley in Honduras has indicated the presence of a complex
prehistoric polity which reached florescence in the late first and early second
millennia A.D. At the central site of La Sierra, investigators noted 38
monumental platforms in the core area and 468 constructions overall which date
to the Late Classic period. In the surrounding region, they located a large
number of sites, all of which are significantly smaller than La Sierra itself.
On this basis they suggested that the site represents the capital of a state
level polity which encompasses the entire valley and possibly extends beyond
these physiographic limits. With National Science Foundation support the team
will continue their research in the Naco Valley. Their goal is to understand the
political mechanisms which permitted stratification and centralization to
develop. They believe that the economic system was controlled by the elite and
organized in such a way to maintain this domination. This extended both to local
craft production as well as importation of specialized commodities. To test this
idea they will excavate a series of household groups both within and beyond La
Sierra to determine the range and intensity of craft activities performed in
different portions of the polity. These data will be correlated with site
location in relation to La Sierra and other indicators of household prestige.
The research is important for several reasons. First, it will increase our
understanding of how complex societies are developed, maintained, and eventually
collapse. The diachronic data which such archaeology can provide will shed a new
light on mechanisms of political control. Secondly, the project will provide
data from a relatively unknown area and these will be of interest to a large
number of archaeologists. Finally, this project supports research at an
undergraduate institution and will provide students firsthand exposure to the
practice of science.
