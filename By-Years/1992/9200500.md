This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at the University
of Southern Mississippi. The funds provide support for ten undergraduate
students selected from candidates who have completed three years from colleges
in the Southeastern United States as well as Indiana, Illinois, Texas,
Washington, and Wisconsin. Participation includes a summer session and the
following academic year. Special emphasis is placed upon recruitment from under-
represented groups such as females and minorities. Students having three years
in the physical sciences are considered. Scholastic achievement is the primary
requirement for participation in the program, with consideration given for prior
research experience, and recommendation by a faculty member. Scholastic courses
on polymer science and laboratory safety are required during a ten week summer
session. The research under supervision of faculty members will involve topics
in the areas of ionomer coatings and composite membranes, crystallization
kinetics of semicrystalline ionomers, nylon copolymers, graft polymers, and
polyelectrolyte/surfactant coacervates, and bioabsorable composite materials.
The professors involved in this program have a strong record of interaction with
undergraduate students in research.
