The research work will have as its focus measurements of electron-positron
(e+e-) collisions at the LEP collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland using the
L3 detector. LEP is scheduled to begin operation in July 1989 and is expected,
during the coming decade, to be the highest energy e+e- accelerator operating in
the world (&lt;200 GeV). The field of research is that of experimental
elementary particle physics. This research studies the basic building blocks of
matter (e.g., electrons, positrons, quarks, Higgs bosons) at very high energies.
The experiments use accelerators (colliders) which provide the highest energy
particles made in the laboratory. The data is collected and analyzed using
highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and techniques.
