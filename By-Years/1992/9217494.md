It is proposed to study small-scale velocity differences in open and closed
turbulent flows. Of special interest is the cross-over from the chaotic state
(few degrees of freedom) to the fully turbulent state, where "cascade" ideas of
turbulence may be applied. The turbulence will be probed by conventional
techniques, such as laser Doppler velocimetry, and also by homodyne light
scattering, which permits the measurement of velocity differences without making
the "frozen-turbulence" assumption. Also to be studied are: the dynamics of
phase-separation of fluids and liquid crystals contained in porous media; and
nucleation in fluid mixtures under uniform shear. The common thread running
through all of this work is that of systems driven far from equilibrium. %%% The
research deals with "self-similar" phenomena which have the property that they
look the same when viewed on all scales of magnification. Turbulent fluids
exhibit this self-similarity, which will be studied by light scattering. Another
self-similar occurrence is the motion of fluids constrained within porous media
(e.g., oil in sand). The goal is to understand the origin of this self-
similarity.
