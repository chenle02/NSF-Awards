The recent wave of democratic transitions in Latin America, Eastern and Central
Europe, the Pacific Rim and elsewhere is producing revolutionary changes in the
political structures and political life of many nations. The events have forced
social scientists to rethink our ideas about political change and to reconsider
the lessons of earlier academic debates about the social, cultural, and economic
contexts in which Democracy can take root. This award supports a series of
faculty/student workshops that will examine alternative theoretical models as
they apply to the lessons of democracy and democratization. The workshop will
bring together some of the leading scholars in the field and provide an intense
training experience for the next generation of scholars interested in these most
important topics.
