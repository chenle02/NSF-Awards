The integration of micromechanical devices on silicon chips is an emerging
technology. Micromechanical devices, including actuators, motors, and sensors,
are projected to have applications in robotics, instrumentation, medical probes,
space-based systems, and sensor arrays. Recent research results have shown that
moving parts, such as gears, linkages, and motors, can be fabricated using
modified silicon processing techniques. The proposed research seeks to develop a
CVD tungsten-on-silicon technology to fabricate fully released, movable
microstructures for actuators and motors. Specifically, the goals of this
research include: (1) to develop a tungsten-silicon technology to produce
stress-free, movable microstructures, (2) to fabricate a linear, electrostatic
actuator with 10 micron travel using the tungsten-silicon technology, (3) to
fabricate test structures to measure and characterize friction and stress for
tungsten-silicon microstructure systems, (4) to fabricate a linear micromotor,
and (5) to identify the key science and technology issues for future research
and development of microelectromechanical systems.
