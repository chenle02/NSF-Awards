The investigators will advance the state of ionospheric tomography by: (1)
refining the "weighted, damped, least-squares" (WDLS) technique for
tomographically inverting total electron content (TEC) records, (2) formalizing
partition of over- and under-determined image parameters estimated by the WDLS
technique, (3) constraining plasma density estimated in image cells to
nonnegative values, and (4) generalizing the WDLS technique to permit systematic
augmentation of TEC data with plasma-density measurements from any external
source.
