Because the composition of bone collagen is affected by diet,
paleoanthropologists have used analyses of both trace elements and isotopic
ratios in skeletal remains in an attempt to reconstruct patterns of subsistence.
In particular, this approach has been employed to study the adoption of maize
agriculture among North American Indians. Changes in hypothesized diets have
then been correlated with changes in social organization. Because maize has a
slightly different ratio of carbon isotopes from most native North American
vegetation, paleoanthropologists have used variation in carbon 12/13 ratios as
an indicator of the amount of maize in the diet. While, from an empirical
perspective, the results appear reasonable, many details of the system are not
fully understood. Dr. Margaret Schoeninger's work is directed to filling in the
blanks. Dr. Schoeninger will carry out a number of related activities. She will
study modern samples of prehistoric strains and determine isotope ratios. She
will then subject such samples to burning and other diagenetic factors to see if
they affect the ratio. She will also analyze a series of materials recovered
from archaeological sites which also contain maize remains. Bone collagen stable
isotope ratios will be determined. Maize kernels will then be analyzed for
overall isotopic composition, as well as the isotopic composition of individual
biochemical components and individual amino acids. This research is important
for several reasons. First, it will help to develop techniques which may be used
to investigate a number of archaeological situations. Secondly, it will increase
our understanding of U.S. prehistory. Finally, because the project includes
students, it will assist in the training of young scientists.
