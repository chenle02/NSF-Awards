This project is concerned with research in group theory and ring theory. One
investigator will be working on character theory. In particular, he will examine
M-groups, the properties of the set of irreducible character degrees of solvable
groups and the interactions between characters and sets of primes in these
groups. The other investigator will work on group rings, crossed products,
Galois theory and enveloping rings. He will apply Delta-methods to restricted
enveloping rings of infinite dimensional Lie algebras. He will also determine
when such rings satisfy a polynomial identity. Furthermore he plans to work on
computations of Grothendieck groups and Gelfand-Kirilov dimension. A group is an
algebraic structure with one operation. A ring is an algebraic structure with
two operations, addition and multiplication. It forms a group with respect to
addition. These are basic abstract structures which occur in many settings in
mathematics, chemistry and physics.
