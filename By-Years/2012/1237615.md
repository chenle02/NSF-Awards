The objective of this research is to perform a fundamental study on the
underlying science of terahertz (THz) wave generation and detection in gases.
The approach is to use ambient air and/or selected gases as THz wave emitters
and sensors with femtosecond laser excitation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The principal design concept is based
on recent experimental and theoretical research on pulsed THz-wave emission and
measurements in air or selected gases. A focused optical pulse with &gt;100 ?√ùJ
pulse energy and &lt;100 femtosecond pulse duration in gas creates an
atmospheric plasma, which produces very intense (&gt;200 kV/cm) and ultra-
broadband THz waves (0.1 to 10 THz) in the far field. Using the air-breakdown-
coherent-detection (ABCD) method, or the radiation-enhanced-emission-of-
fluorescence (REEF) method, air or air-plasma can also sense pulsed THz waves
both in local or remote distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
fundamental research of THz waves will have an impact in many scientific areas,
beyond its historical uses in the astronomy and the laser fusion communities.
The resulting technology should find use in many advanced photonic laboratories.
The research has the potential to impact a wide range of applications including
nondestructive testing, homeland security, and biomedical applications. Research
projects with undergraduate students with an HBCU, Morehouse University, will be
started.
