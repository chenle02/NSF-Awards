This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program by the
Chemistry Division in support of Dr. Andrew Barron's research on gallium and
indium chalcogenide molecules, phases and applications. Specifically, Group
III/VI complexes will be prepared with geometries which will transform into
predictable solid phases upon thermal chemical vapor deposition. Additionally,
deposition of these new solid phases on gallium arsenide semiconductor surfaces
will provide lattice-matched films that will passivate the surface. As an
example, gallium sulfide precursors have been prepared which form a new cubic
phase of gallium sulfide. The goal of the research is to extend these results,
including the electronic characterization of, and development of applications
for, the new cubic phase. New metalorganic chalcogenide compounds of indium and
gallium will be synthesized and used for growth of indium and gallium
chalcogenide thin films, both of known and new phases. An ultimate goal is the
fabrication and testing of actual devices based on these films. %%% This
research will extend both the fundamental chemistry and the practical
photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications of new III/VI solid state
materials.
