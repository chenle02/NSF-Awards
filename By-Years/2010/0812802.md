This project mainly covers three important research areas under the broad
umbrella of climate dynamics by focusing on:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) Seasonal
and year-to-year variations in the strength of the tropical upwelling in the
Brewer-Dobson circulation. A major goal is to determine whether the annual cycle
is forced primarily by variations in the upward flux of wave activity at high
latitudes or by seasonal variations in the strength of the equatorial
tropospheric planetary waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) 20th century climate
variability. Possible foci are (i) drought episodes and/or (ii) the pronounced
interdecadal variability of extratropical Northern Hemisphere
temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c) Structure and dynamics of intermediate
frequency (6-20 day period) variability and the degree to which it is dominated
by linear Rossby-wave dynamics versus nonlinear processes such as wave
breaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this project will also explore
preliminarily a strategy for quantitatively assessing the impact of global
warming upon snowpack over the Pacific Northwest that is more robust with
respect to sampling fluctuations than conventional analysis of trends in
snowpack measurements. The temperature sensitivity of snowpack (i.e., the
percentage loss in snowpack per Â°C temperature rise) is evaluated using four
different approaches. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will serve to promote
more robust strategies for assessing the impacts of global warming, more useful
measures of the impacts of global warming, understanding of mechanisms
responsible for the secular trends in temperature and concentrations of trace
constituents in the tropical lower stratosphere, a more definitive attribution
of 20th century climate change, and a more sound phenomelogical basis for long
range weather prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the
potential for improved weather and climate prediction and the training and
mentoring of several graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
