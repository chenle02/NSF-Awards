The University of Arizona's I/UCR Center for Microcontamination Control which
primarily studies microcontamination problems for the microelectronics industry,
an industry with a key role to play in the drive for U.S. competitiveness in the
world. The Center has been in operation for six and one half years, in fully
compliance with I/UCRC guidelines. The Center has been active in a number of
research areas including: (1) The electrokinetic behavior of particles in
liquids used in etch baths, (2) Particle detection and formation in vacuum
systems, (3) The detection and control of electrostatic discharge in production
situations, (4) The detection and evaluation of particles using electromagnetics
scattering, and (5) The modeling of Cleanroom Aerosol Dynamics. The quality of
the Center has also been recognized by others. The expertise in the Center was
instrumental in the award of a SEMATECH Center in the area of Contamination and
Defect Control to the University of Arizona. This Center complements the
activities of the I/UCRC. The Program Manager recommends that the University of
Arizona I/UCRC for Microcontamination Control be awarded $30,000 per year for
three years for a Self-Sufficient Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center Partnership.
