Responding to stressful events in the environment is a fundamentally important
activity for all organisms. Within the stress response, there is a plasticity of
glucocorticoid action, allowing for specificity in the response depending on
life history strategy, reproductive stage, body condition, or even time of day.
This proposal explores the mechanisms, environmental regulation, and functional
consequences of this plasticity among three subspecies of the white-crowned
sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii, Z. l. oriantha, and Z. l. pugetensis).
The three subspecies have different distributions that are likely to affect the
evolutionary pressures shaping the stress response. In particular, these
sparrows breed at different elevations and latitudes and thus have breeding
seasons that differ markedly in length. Gambelii is the northern-most
subspecies, breeding in the arctic and sub-artic regions of North America. The
breeding season is short (allowing only 1 clutch per season). Oriantha breed in
sub-alpine meadows of the western United States. They can raise one and
sometimes two clutches per season. Pugetensis breeds at low elevations in the
Pacific Northwest and usually raises 2 or 3 clutches per season. This proposal
explores the possibility that the length of breeding season has a strong
evolutionary influence on how birds respond to stress. Specifically, in birds
with time to raise only one or rarely two clutches, the fitness consequence of
abandoning the nest may be substantially larger than in birds that can raise up
to three clutches per season. Thus, animals with short breeding seasons should
be less responsive to stressors, and therefore less likely to abandon their
young. The stress response of each subspecies will be evaluated measuring basal
and stress-induced corticosteroid responses to capture and handling,
corticosteroid binding globulin levels (to estimate the bioavailability of
glucocorticoids), and glucocorticoid receptor levels (to estimate the tissue-
specific sensitivity to glucocorticoids).
