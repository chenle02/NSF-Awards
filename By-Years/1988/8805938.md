Quantitative knowledge of the structure of surfaces and interfaces is central
to the resolution of a host of important scientific questions. This project will
use multiple scattering methods for data analysis of diffraction spectroscopies
sensitive to the short-range and long-range order of materials. A major focus of
our program is to apply these state-of-the-art techniques to study the structure
of clean surfaces and that of metastable structures produced in the form of
ultra-thin films using epitaxial growth techniques. Results of this work will
greatly impact on the area of surface crystallography and the understanding of
crystal growth.
