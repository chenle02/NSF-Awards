This one year EAGER will explore a new and potentially transformative approach
to small volume protein separations called surface isoelectric focusing (sIEF).
sIEF offers the potential for simpler, cheaper, quicker, and sensitive analysis
by operating 100 times smaller than previous IEF techniques.

This research will expand knowledge in isoelectric focusing to separate and
identify amphoteric molecules, e.g., proteins, at very high resolution, which is
fundamental to medical diagnostics of proteopathy diseases involving protein
abnormalities and pharmaceutical screening of therapeutic proteins. IEF in
larger scale slab gels is resource, labor, and time intensive being replaced
clinically by smaller volume, genomic and affinity approaches. Glycoengineering
of therapeutic proteins has been shown to improve molecular stability, regulate
physicochemical and pharmacological properties, and improve pharmacokinetics
with better absorption, longer circulation times, and decreased clearance rates.
This work could produce the knowledge necessary to lead to the beginning of an
sIEF tool which could interface seamlessly with therapeutic protein libraries.
The result would be rapid screening and valuable charge and isoelectric point
information to aid with the development of therapeutic proteins.
