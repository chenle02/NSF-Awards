9413921 Landsman This Academic Research Infrastructure Program proposal involves
the development of a cellular research facility. The cellular research program
at the Scholl College emphasizes the study of diseases involving the
musculoskeletal and vascular system of the lower extremities. This program
offers a unique form of cellular engineering in which cells will be examined in
dynamic environments. Chronic repetitive mechanical stimulation associated with
ambulation ultimately leads to numerous significant changes in the foot.
Diabetic and neuropathic patients develop plantar ulcerations, and arthritic
joints become further degenerated as a result of this trauma. Conversely,
osteoporotic bones become more fragile, due to the inability of certain patients
to accumulate and retain bone substance. The understanding of the relationship
between macroscopic mechanical stimulation, and its expression at the cellular
level is not well developed. New methods and equipment used to apply
specifically controlled loads to cells in culture is critical to study these
cellular responses. The focus of this research will be to develop the
specialized equipment needed to carry out these experiments. ***
