ABSTRACT Kochanek, Christopher AST-9401722 Gravitational lenses, particularly
radio ring lenses, can provide important new information on the structure of E
and S0 galaxies. This information is independent of traditional dynamically
studies, and it has radically different systematic problems. The greatest
advantage of lens models is that they directly measure the gravitational field
in the distant galaxy, thereby avoiding all the systematic assumptions needed to
determine the mass distribution from dynamical studies. This research will use
algorithms for inverting radio lenses to systematically invert the radio lenses
using families of mass models to determine the mass distributions in the inner
5-10 kpc of the lens galaxies. In cases where one sees the lens galaxy, the MMT
will be used to make dynamical measurements for comparisons. This will allow a
direct calculation of the anisotropy of the velocity dispersions, and a direct
calculation of the mass to light ratio. There will also be algorithmic
improvements in the inversion method. ***
