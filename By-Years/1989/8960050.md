This is a SBIR Phase I project to develop a novel non-intrusive surface
temperature measurement technique for the in- situdetermination of both
temperature and emissivity. The technique employs small local modulation of the
temperature of the surface to be measured and detection of the modulated surface
radiation. By modulating the surface radiation, extraneous radiation from other
surrounding bodies is excluded, and the spectral shape of the modulated
radiation is a function of surface temperature. The objective of the project is
to demonstrate the technique at temperatures in the range of 1700 K. The
approach will be primarily experimental and will involve the construction of a
test system, and comparison of the results obtained from this technique with
those of conventional techniques. The successful application of this device
would be useful in monitoring industrial processes, boiler operation,
diagnostics in gas turbines, jet engines, and rockets, and various control
applications.
