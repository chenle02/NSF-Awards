A bottleneck can occur when a new population is established from a few
individuals. Bottlenecks have been invoked as a mechanism in the formation of
new species because they may dramatically modify mating behavior, but the
specific effects of bottlenecks on courtship repertoire have not been tested to
confirm such a mode of speciation. Recent studies have shown that traditional
models are inadequate to predict bottleneck effects on genetic aspects of
complex traits, such as body size and survival. The proposed study will apply
classical quantitative genetic techniques currently employed for morphology
(i.e., statistical comparisons of body dimensions of parents and offspring) to
examine the effects of bottlenecks on courtship behavior. Specifically,
videotaped courtships of 100 families of each of twelve strains that have
undergone population bottlenecks and four control lines of the housefly will be
assayed for genetic variation and covariation of four courtship behaviors. These
analyses will more clearly establish the efficacy of bottlenecks to alter the
genetic properties of courtship elements and the consequent potential of
bottlenecks to catalyze speciation. The successful management of endangered
species critically depends upon such information for more thorough and accurate
understanding of the effects of small population size on the genetics of
reproductive behavior.
