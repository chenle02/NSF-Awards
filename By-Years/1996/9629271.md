Masters 9629271 The PIs propose to construct a seismological earth model
consistent with a large body of recent seismic data spanning several orders of
magnitude in frequency. The project includes two workshops with
interdisciplinary participation of mineral physicists, geodynamicists and
seismologists to develop the modeling strategy and agree upon inclusion of data
sets, and at the end of the project to evaluate the performance of the model.
