This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop innovative visible blind UV detectors based on a novel metal-oxide
system that is analogous to Gallium Aluminum Nitride (GaN). It is based on a
wide band gap oxide system that is realized by alloying two primary oxide
compounds, exhibiting a wider and tunable band gap, creating semiconductor
materials which have energy gaps from 3.3 eV to 7.9 eV with high radiation
hardness. The project investigator has already patented the concept of making
and applying tailorable band gap oxide materials. The goal of this proposal is
to study the feasibility of growing wide band gap metal-oxides and ultraviolet
detectors on low cost substrates such as glass, polyimide, and silicon for
commercialization of cost effective products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
technology can be extended to produce large format detector arrays and which can
improve their reliability. Other areas where GaN detectors can be used are in
telecommunications, chemical sensing, and homeland
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
