This award funds the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in
physics at the Miami University Oxford Campus. Ten students will be supported
for ten weeks of summer research each year in topics from biophysics, optics and
quantum optics/quantum information, condensed matter physics, and physics
education research. The goals of the site are to provide (i) mentored research
opportunities for a diverse group of students; (ii) professional development
topics; (iii) interactions with other students and faculty on a professional and
social level. The overarching goal is to promote physics as a professional
choice and send more talented students to graduate school in STEM
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student mentoring will take place on multiple
levels. REU students work in groups with one or two undergraduate students and a
Masters level graduate student. Working groups will meet regularly with the
mentors and discuss progress, or solve problems encountered. The site will
enhance the research and professional skills of the participants and the
students will meet on a regular basis to discuss professional development
topics. Through these activities, the site is training the next generation of
physicists.This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership
with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
