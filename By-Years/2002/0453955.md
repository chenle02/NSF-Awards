0453955&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides renewed funding for an REU Site
program at Mote Marine Laboratory. The REU Site received initial funding via
proposal 01-39392. The first REU programs were run in the summer of 2003 and
2004. The program will bring 8-10 students to the laboratory each summer for a
10-week program. The intellectual focus of the site will be on basic and applied
research related to estuarine science, particularly as applied to aquatic
pollution, natural toxins, habitat alteration and coral reef decline. Students
will also participate in discussion groups on essential career skills, research
seminars, and field trips. They will be expected to complete written and oral
reports on their research topic at the end of the program. &lt;br/&gt;
