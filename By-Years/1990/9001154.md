Various topics in mathematical analysis associated with orthogonal polynomials
will be taken up in this project. On the same interval, there are many classes
of orthogonal polynomials. In each class, orthogonality is defined with respect
to a measure (density) concentrated on the interval. The main theme of this work
is a continuing effort to understand the relationship between the measure and
the recurrence coefficients of the corresponding polynomials. Associated to each
class of orthogonal polynomials is a unique algorithm which produces the higher
order polynomials in terms of the lower. This recurrence is a simple linear
relation, and it is the coefficients in the relation that are of considerable
interest. Methods to be employed include minimizing polynomial integrals (the
Christoffel function), asymptotic behavior of difference equations and
eigenvalues of infinite tridiagonal matrices. The methods used for studying
eigenvalues of matrices can be adapted to the study of solutions of the
Schrodinger equation in a central field of force, and the Christoffel function
is related to statistical prediction theory. Results of polynomial
approximation, a natural by-product of this work, and prediction theory are
valuable in digital processing of electronic signals.
