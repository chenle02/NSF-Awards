ABSTRACT This proposal is to fund innovative exploratory research on two-phase
flow heat transfer in microchannels. Microchannels have applications in
electronics cooling and miniature heat exchangers involving high heat fluxes.
The new idea is to employ a porous boundary to act as a wick to assist in the
removal of condensate. Existing knowledge about heat and fluid flow in porous
media involving larger channels does not applied because the forces acting on
the fluid do not scale linearly with the physical dimensions. The Principal
Investigator proposes to conduct experiments to study the physics of condensing
two-phase flow behavior and determine the effects of the porous boundary on heat
transfer.
