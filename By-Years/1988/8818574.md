With the increasing availability of parallel computing systems, the problems
associated with constructing parallel algorithms, mapping them onto parallel
architectures, and determining algorithm and system performance have grown in
importance. The results of poor mappings are inefficient computation and system
performance, and an overall reduction in the speedups potentially obtainable
from a given parallel processor. The proposed research is aimed at examining
approaches to allocating tasks to processors in a manner that ensures effective
use of the available resources (i.e., high processor utilization with minimal
delays due to interprocessor communications). A number of task allocation (load
balancing) algorithms are proposed. One is based on utilizing a new parallel
simulated annealing algorithm, while a third is a hybrid of the former two
approaches. Contrasting these algorithms with each other, and with other
algorithms proposed in the literature is a key part of the proposed research.
