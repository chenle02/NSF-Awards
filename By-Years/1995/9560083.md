9560083 Sokolov This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will explore a newly discovered characteristic of resonant tunneling diodes. The
University of Minnesota has been found a novel and strong stress dependence in
the current-voltage characteristics of III-V semiconductor double barrier
resonant tunneling devices. The effects are attributed to piezoelectric
properties of the materials, and the stress dependence is magnified by a
strongly nonlinear dependence of the resonant tunneling current on the applied
bias. Preliminary estimates of the gauge factor, which is a strain gauge figure
of merit, approach 1000, which is roughly five times the sensitivity of silicon-
based piezoelectric sensors in common industrial use. Phase I will assess a
novel resonant tunneling strain sensor relative to current strain sensor
technology. With consulting support from the University of Minnesota, the
company will model the current-voltage characteristics, model possible modes of
operation, and study potential packaging approaches and their effects on
performance. Commercial applications of resonant tunneling strain sensor
technology are expected to be large and numerous in miniaturized, highly
sensiive sensors for both industrial and military purposes. Applications include
strain sensors, acoustic sensors, pressure sensors, accelerometers, seismic
sensors, and various varioussensors capable of remote operation.
