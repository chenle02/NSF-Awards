A field study of the variability of the North Atlantic Deep Western Boundary
Current (DWBC) will be conducted using a combination of experimental approaches:
hydrography, chemical tracers and Lagrangian floats. The main objectives of the
study are to determine the synoptic velocity and water mass structure of the
DWBC and determine the fluid parcel pathways in the DWBC and identify the
regions of exchange with the interior.
