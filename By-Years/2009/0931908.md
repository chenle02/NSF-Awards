The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research
in&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics (ICERM) is a new Institute. Its mission is to
support&lt;br/&gt;and encourage research in the mathematical sciences with
a&lt;br/&gt;thematic focus on the fruitful interplay between mathematics
and&lt;br/&gt;computers, explored and developed through computation
and&lt;br/&gt;experimentation. ICERM will accomplish these goals through
a&lt;br/&gt;variety of programs and activities. The Institute will run
one&lt;br/&gt;large research program per semester, with each program
focusing&lt;br/&gt;on a particular subtopic that aligns with the
general&lt;br/&gt;theme. Program participants will range from graduate students
to&lt;br/&gt;senior researchers. During the summers, the Institute will
host&lt;br/&gt;additional programs for postdoctoral scholars and early
career&lt;br/&gt;researchers, as well as for undergraduates selected from
a&lt;br/&gt;national pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICERM will be a novel institute
in an area of growing&lt;br/&gt;importance. An Institute in computational and
experimental&lt;br/&gt;mathematics has the potential to cut across disciplines
within&lt;br/&gt;and beyond mathematics and statistics. The Institute
programs&lt;br/&gt;will strongly emphasize training and retaining graduate
students&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral scholars in the mathematical sciences
community.&lt;br/&gt;ICERM's leadership has substantial experience in supporting
and&lt;br/&gt;working with underrepresented groups in the
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;sciences, and Institute programming will provide
new&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for underrepresented students and scholars.
ICERM&lt;br/&gt;has already initiated partnerships with leading research
intense&lt;br/&gt;companies and national research laboratories, and effective
plans&lt;br/&gt;to nurture these partnerships will help to sustain a rich
and&lt;br/&gt;deep interaction with the broader research community.
