Research will be carried out in the study of high energy nucleons and pairs
following muon capture by nuclei. The underlying physics motivation is to probe
to high momentum structure of the nuclear wave function and explore the meson
exchange process. The isospin structure of giant resonances will also be studied
using pion single charge exchange reactions, both inclusive and in coincidence
with subsequent decay particles. The angular momentum and isospion structure of
giant resonances will be studied by inelastic electron excitation, both
inclusive and in coincidence with subsequent decay particles. As soon as
polarized electrons become available at Bates they will be used to provide an
additional degree of freedom in the study. These two latter studies are
motivated out of interest in many-body nuclear structure.
