9408145 Durand With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Stephen Durand will
collect pilot data to assess the feasibility of a technique to determine the
geographical source for timbers used to construct the Great Houses in Chaco
Canyon, New Mexico. Chaco Canyon is a major archaeological site which was
occupied between 900-1150 AD. The amount of labor involved in the construction
of large "apartment houses" and ceremonial kiva lodges indicates a high degree
of political organization and the integration of large numbers of individuals
within a single social system. Archaeologists wish to understand what led to the
emergence of the Chacoan system and have attempted to determine the geographic
extent of its sphere of influence. Dr. Durand's project will provide important
information which will assist in this process. His very preliminary data
indicate that the wood used to build the great Chacoan structures bears the
chemical imprint of the specific region in which an individual tree grew and
that variations in chemical composition reflect the substrate of the particular
region. Therefore, through analysis of the trees, it should be possible to
determine points of origin. In this first stage of the project, he will collect
pilot data to determine how well the chemical fingerprinting system works. This
research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to
many regional archaeologists. It will shed new light on the development of
cultural complexity in the Southwestern United States and help in the
development of a tool of potentially broad scientific utility.
