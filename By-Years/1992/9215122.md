This project will examine the following two topics: 1) The understanding of
solar-terrestrial relationships and the solar-interplanetary electrodynamical
phenomena which control the propagation of energetic charged particles in the
heliosphere over a 22-year solar magnetic cycle, and, 2) The physics of solar
flare charged particle acceleration propagation and the associated neutron
emission from solar flares. The experimental approach to the first topic is
based on using charged particles as probes of the heliospheric magnetic fields.
For the second topic, the PI will investigate solar flare particles acceleration
through spacecraft measurements of the charge particles spectra, elemental and
isotopic composition as a function of time for nuclear species from hydrogen to
nickel. Studies also are made of solar flare neutron emission using a high
altitude, equatorial super monitor. Both scientific objectives require the
continuing support of neutron monitors (for nuclei of relativistic energies) and
a network of instruments on spacecraft located throughout the heliosphere. This
proposal includes support for the standard neutron monitors at Climax, Colorado,
and Mt. Haleakala as well as the 18-counter super monitor on Mt. Haleakala. The
data from this network are available to the scientific community. The remainder
of the proposal supports analytical and theoretical research directed to the
research areas described above.
