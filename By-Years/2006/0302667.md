0302667&lt;br/&gt;Taylor&lt;br/&gt;This award to University Hawaii at Manoa
provides support for the acquisition of a 38 kHz, deep-profiling acoustic
current profiler to be installed on R/V Kilo Moana. It also supports the lease,
with option to purchase, a new, digital nutrient analyzer for determining
concentration levels of ammonium, nitrate, silicate, nitrite and phosphate in
seawater samples. This instrument is expected to be used on Kilo Moana and other
UNOLS research vessels, as well as in a laboratory on the University of Hawaii
campus when not at sea. It is expected that the robustness of the instrument for
shipboard operation and its overall performance will be evaluated during the
lease period, and results provided to NSF and other oceanographic researchers
for intercomparison with existing systems. These acquisitions should provide a
substantial advantage to marine scientists in their research during 2003 and
future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
