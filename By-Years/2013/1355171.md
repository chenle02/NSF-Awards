All organisms, including humans, cannot live without the vast microbial
menagerie that lives in and around us. Critical to understanding the vital
functions of these communities is knowledge about the processes responsible for
microbial species. How microbial species are generated and maintained over time,
and whether they are even independent units is not known. Whitaker and
colleagues combine genetic and genomic tools to define the rules of speciation
in the model microorganism Sulfolobus. Their goal is to better understand the
evolutionary and ecological parameters that govern how genetic material moves
between individual cells and result in the generation and maintenance of
microbial diversity on which we depend.

A more robust understanding of microbial biodiversity will help propel discovery
and innovation in a host of scientific fields, ranging from emerging infectious
diseases to climate change modeling, that are being transformed by the microbial
revolution. Whitaker will extend an understanding of the microbial world and its
impact on daily human life through Project Microbe, a curriculum designed to
integrate microorganisms into the national K-12 education, in the college
setting at the University of Illinois, and outside of the classroom through the
Osher Life Long Learning at Illinois program.
