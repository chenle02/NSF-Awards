This award supports a quantitative biogeographic study of Paleogene
paleoceanography of the Southern Ocean based on sediments recovered by Ocean
Drilling Projects. This work will focus on plankton redistribution patterns as
indicators of changing surface water isotherms and circulation patterns. It is
crucial to global environmental models to understand the Southern Ocean
circulation during a time when it may not have been the generator of abyssal
waters.
