The objective of this research is to study high level global path planning and
dispatching of multiple vehicles using statistical models and graph
representation techniques and a low level multi-sensor based local path planning
and navigation system. These efforts will support the development of a complex
manufacturing floor material handling system using guide path independent
autonomous vehicles. Particular efforts to be emphasized in this project include
development of a geometric representation of the factory floor and a graph
representation of the paths in a factory; development of vehicle dispatching
techniques and a collision avoidance strategy; and the development of an onboard
Hierarchical Mutiprocessor Computer System to support real time operation of an
intelligent mobile robot. The design and implementation of an experimental
system to test the proposed approaches will also be pursued.
