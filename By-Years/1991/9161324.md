A Phase I SBIR award will fund preliminary evaluation of a volume- specific,
limited-scan photon backscatter technique for rapid non- destructive
determination of the composition and thickness of hidden layers, such as
subcoating corrosion. Initial analytical studies will determine proper
selections of source and beam collimation, source energy and placement of
source-object-detector. Experimental verification will follow and the
sensitivity of the technique will be determined.
