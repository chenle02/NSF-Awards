Abstract

There is a long and fruitful history of interaction between various branches of
analysis and probability theory. This proposal focuses furthering these
connections, both by applying recent results in probability to analyze dynamical
systems, and using ergodic theory and other branches of analysis, to study
questions in probability. Two probabilistic models which have seen large
contributions from ergodic theory are first passage percolation and Richardson's
growth model. The work in this proposal aims to apply techniques from ergodic
theory to study questions of coexistence of multiple infections in Richardson's
growth models and the existence of one sided geodesics in first passage
percolation. One proposed application of probability results to study dynamical
systems is the use of domino tilings the possible ergodic properties of two
dimensional subshifts of finite type. Another is to use recent advances in
necessary conditions for ergodicity of g measures to answer a longstanding open
question about the necessary conditions modulus of continuity of an Anosov map
on the torus which ensures ergodicity of the corresponding measure preserving
system.



Mathematicians have long used probabilistic models to gain understanding of
complex physical, biological and social systems. Examples of these models
include the Ising model to understand the process of magnetization, random
graphs to study the spread of disease through sexual contact, and Richardson's
growth model to understand the spread of infection. This proposal aims to
contribute to this field by using new techniques in the mathematical field of
dynamical systems to analyze probabilistic models inspired by physics and
biology.
