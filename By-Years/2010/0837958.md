Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIS - 0837958&lt;br/&gt;Workshop: Coordinating EU-
US Digital Library Education&lt;br/&gt;Pomerantz, Jeffrey P.
&lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project requests funds to support a
two-day workshop to be held at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
The meeting is intended to develop and launch a coordinated international
digital libraries curriculum project. The two-day collaborative workshop will
bring together about 15 experts in information and computer science research and
educational curriculum development. The objectives are to coordinate digital
libraries education in the US and the EU, the strengths of which complement and
inform each other and by doing so provide broader opportunities for students on
both sides of the Atlantic and better prepare the next generation of
researchers. Given the global nature of the Web and digital information
generally, and the increasing globalization of e-science, this effort is central
to preparing students and researchers to effectively use an international data
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;
