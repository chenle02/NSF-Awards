AST-0216105&lt;br/&gt;Draine, Bruce T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal
Investigator and his team will create a powerful parallel-processing facility
for research in astrophysics on problems, which do not require "shared memory"
or ultra-fast inter-processor communication. Studies will include: Light
scattering from irregular interstellar grains, cosmological structure formation,
dynamical evolution of gaseous protoplanetary accretion disks, and several other
compelling astronomical sciences research topics. The system will contain 96
dual CPU "slave" systems with a total of 192 Central Processing Units, and 192
gigabytes of RAM with a 3.8 TB disk. &lt;br/&gt;***
