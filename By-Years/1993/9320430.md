This research will examine the factors which translate what one knows into what
one does. When humans or animals learn something there are times when that
learning is turned into action and times when it is not. However, when learning
is not acted upon it does not mean that the knowledge originally has been lost.
This research uses a simple animal model of this type of learning situation to
examine the status of learning as the performance based on that learning
changes. Pigeons are trained to associate a light with the delivery of food. The
learning of this association is evidenced by the pigeons' pecking at the light.
It is known that if the relationship between the light and the food delivery is
changed, the pigeons may stop pecking at the light. But it is also known that
this cessation of responding does not mean that the pigeons "forgot" that the
light and the food are associated. Under some conditions the pigeons will start
pecking the light once again. This means that the pecking evoked by the light is
not a good indicator of the status of the pigeons' knowledge about the light.
Therefore, the research to be conducted uses two methods of Pavlovian
conditioning, blocking tests and second order conditioning tests, to assess the
status of associations (like that between the light and food) independently of
responding. The use of these procedures will help the PI to understand the
conditions under which associations are acted upon and the conditions under
which knowledge about a particular association can be changed. Simple
associations are the building blocks of learning. Therefore, to gain a fuller
understanding of behavior, whether animal or human, one needs a clearer
understanding of the determinants of basic learning and performance processes.
The research to be conducted under this grant aims to broaden the understanding
of behavior by examining the relationship between what one knows and what one
does.
