An international conference "Statistics: Reflections on the Past and Visions for
the Future" will be held March 16-19, 2000 at the University of Texas - San
Antonio. Although the meeting is in honor of the 80th birthday of C. R. Rao, the
primary focus of the conference will be to provide a forum for participants to
meet and discuss the changing face of statistical research. The topics will
include multivariate analysis, environmental and ecological statistics,
biostatistics, genetics, image processing and other contemporary research areas
that reflect the enormous contributions of C. R. Rao to the field. The meeting
encourages students and young researchers to engage in fruitful dialog with
senior statisticians. This proposal provides funds to ensure that U.S.
participants will be able to hear and network with the best experts on these
topics from this country and from abroad, and to provide access to the
conference for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, new researchers, and
members of underrepresented groups
