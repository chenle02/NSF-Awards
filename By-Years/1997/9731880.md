PHY-9731880- David Ellis, University of Toledo

The "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" in the Physics Department of the
University of Toledo will be continued. This program places eight students each
summer in the research programs of the Department, which cover a number of
topics in Physics and Astronomy. The students will be given a number of
opportunities to interact professionally. Available research fields include
astronomy, astrophysics, atomic physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics,
materials science, and optics. Student projects will include a written report
and an oral presentation of results. Also, students will participate in a weekly
seminar, with speakers including students, faculty, and visiting researchers.
Students will be recruited nationally, and free housing will be provided, so
that students from various regions can meet each other and broaden their view of
the diversity of physics programs in the U.S. Group social activities and field
trips will enhance students' overall experience.
