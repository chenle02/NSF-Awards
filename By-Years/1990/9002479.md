This proposal is to make chloroflouromethane (CFC) measurements on the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the southeastern Pacific on
longitudes 88 and 150 west. The CFC tracers data are used to identify upper
ocean formation processes, and are important in the assessment of ventilation
and subduction mechanisms. These measurements and related tracer observations,
along with hydrographic measurements will form the basis for the ocean
circulation description which is an objective of WOCE.
