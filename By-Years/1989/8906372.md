This equipment grant supports research directed at developing qualitative and
quantitative global correlations between process performance, material
properties, and machining parameters; an off-line optimization scheme; and an
on-line monitoring and computer-based control system for wire electro- discharge
machining (WEDM). The on-line monitoring device and adaptive control system is
based on stochastic models and the spectrum analysis of the gap voltage,
current, and power signals. The stochastic models of the gap condition provide
necessary information about random distribution of thermal load required for
developing a realistic thermal model and a better understanding of the
microscopic behavior at the gap.
