This grant is for the partial support of the Twelfth U.S. National Congress of
Applied Mechanics to be held during June 26- July 1, 1994 at the University of
Washington, Seattle, WA. The Congress will provide a forum for the presentation
of state-of- the-art research findings in the entire area of applied mechanics
to a large audience of leading active workers in that field from academe,
government laboratories and industry. This Congress is the twelfth in a series
of such Congresses that started in 1950. They are held once every four years at
different locations in the U.S., and are attended by eminent researchers from
all over the world. The gathering of these individuals at the Congress will
allow for personal interactions that will provide exchange of information and
ideas, and the possible formation of new research groups, in a variety of
disciplines. Proceedings of the Congress will be published and will thus be
available as an archival resource for future use by the engineering, science and
technology communities.
