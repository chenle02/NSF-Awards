Well established research groups in polymer science and engineering, applied
thermodynamics, separation processes, and plasma polymerization provide the
foundation for ten undergraduate students (from Polytechnic and other
institutions in New York City metropolitan area) to initiate a research
experience. Research projects include diffusive separation processes, control of
crystallization processes, properties of nonpolar mixtures, transport properties
of gaseous and liquid states, surface energetics in engineering fibers, and
plasma modification of films. Well founded and coordinated pre- participation
and post-participation plans are formulated including the students's evaluation
of the program and the impact of the program on future directions for the
student.
