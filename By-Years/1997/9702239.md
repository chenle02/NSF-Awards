ABSTRACT Proposal No: CTS-9702239 Proposal Type: CAREER Principal Investigator:
J. Karl Johnson Affiliation: University of Pittsburgh This CAREER grant is
awarded through the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the
Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The objective of the proposal is to
demonstrate the feasibility of using novel carbon nanotubules for advanced
hydrogen storage systems. The calculations proposed will answer the question of
whether carbon nanotubules are better suited for hydrogen storage than the best
currently available commercial adsorbents. Phase diagrams, adsorption and
desorption isotherms for hydrogen adsorbed in single tubules and in a honeycomb
array of tubules, including the effect of adsorption in the tubule interstitial
regions (where three tubules meet) will be computed. The amount of hydrogen
adsorbed will be maximized as a function of tubule diameter over the range of
operational temperatures and pressures. Hydrogen storage could be the first
commercial application for carbon nanotubules. Possible applications of
nanotuble based hydrogen storage systems include hydrogen powered vehicles,
hydrogen transportation, gas separation, etc. Three main educational projects
are also identified in the proposal (1) Development of web-based interactive
instructional modules (2) Internet based learning and research for high school
students (3) Participation in the Research Experience for Undergraduates
program.
