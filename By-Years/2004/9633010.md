The focus of this research is on interprocedural program analysis; the specific
goal of this project is to quantify the tradeoffs between precision and
compilation speed for a number of interprocedural analyses. The initial work on
this project has focused on implementing a flow-sensitive interprocedural
pointer alias analysis. The current activities on this project are aimed in the
following three directions. (1) A flow-insensitive interprocedural pointer alias
algorithm will be implemented. The tradeoffs in precision and efficiency between
this algorithm and the flow- sensitive variant will be quantified. (2) A sparse
representation of alias information will be developed that avoids storing
redundant information at the cost of retrieving it during an alias query. (3)
Experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this
representation. A natural extension of a flow-sensitive pointer alias analysis
for C++ type analysis will be implemented. Experiments will be conducted to
demonstrate its effectiveness and compare it to previous work. ***
