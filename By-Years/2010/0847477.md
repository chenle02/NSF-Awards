Recent observations of our own Sun as well as other stars suggest the need for
new approach to modeling stellar evolution, which fully takes into account the
inevitably magnetized nature of stars. Dr. Pascale Garaud (University of
California - Santa Cruz) will work on the construction of a multidimensional
stellar evolution model which takes into account magnetic fields, rotation and
all other associated dynamical effects. As a part of this project a new
numerical model developed which couples the exact solutions of the nuclear
evolution equations to a dynamical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for the
internal flows and fields on the larger scales, and a well-tested and
experimentally calibrated turbulent MHD closure model for the smaller scales.
This new work is a natural extension of Dr. Garaud's ongoing research on the MHD
structure of stellar interiors.

Dr. Garaud and her collaborators will also launch a yearly international Summer
School and Workshop in Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (AFD). The lecture series
will be loosely modeled on the world-renowned Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Summer
School hosted by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The lectures will be
focused on teaching students the theoretical (mathematical and computational)
tools for certain classes of problems in AFD. A related scientific workshop will
be organized at the end of each lecture series inviting this time both theorists
and observers, thus completing the program with a state-of-the art dual
perspective in the topic studied. The venue will alternate between different
partner countries to enhance the international dimension of the program and
share organizational costs. The lectures will be published on the web.
