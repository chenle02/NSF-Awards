9706892 Garofalo The proposal is concerned with three projects: 1) Optimal
regularity for nonlinear pde's and systems in Carnot-Caratheodory (CC) spaces
and the applications of this theory to geometry, isoperimetric and Sobolev
inequalities, minimal surfaces in (CC) spaces and their regularity, Dirichlet
problem in nilpotent Lie groups: Connection between harmonic measure and
perimeter, harmonic maps between CR manifolds. 2) Symmetry in overdetermined
boundary value problems, both interior and exterior, in Euclidean and CR
geometry, minimizers in the isoperimetric and Sobolev inequalities in the
Heisenberg group, a conjecture of E. De Giorgi and its parabolic counterpart. 3)
Unique continuation for sub-elliptic operators, applications to scattering,
inverse problems on the Heisenberg group, unique continuation for nonlinear
equations of p-Laplacian type. The proposed research sits at the confluence of
two main areas of interest in mathematics known as partial differential
equations and geometry. Both areas find their origin and motivation in problems
arising in the observation and description of natural phenomena, at every scale.
A main focus of the proposed research is, e.g., the reconstruction of the shape
of a body knowing some quantities that can be measured on the surface that
surrounds the body. Such a problem has a great relevance in the applied sciences
and is especially important in areas of Federal strategic interest ranging from
computerized tomography, to biotechnology, to control of the core of a nuclear
reactor, etc. The proposed research will also contribute to the development of
human resources through the involvement of young investigators (doctoral
students). The principal investigator is also writing a book which will focus on
those aspects of the program that has been developed over the past few years in
collaboration with several doctoral students.
