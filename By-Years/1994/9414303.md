ABSTRACT 9414303 Filisko Partial travel support will be provided to several
invited speakers to participate at the Electrorheological (ER) Materials and
Fluids Symposium, organized on August 21-22, in Washington, D. C. This meetings
aims to promote advanced made in the specific field of research in the last few
years, and to identify new opportunities. The main topics to be discussed at the
meeting are: design and synthesis of ER materials components; basic physical
mechanisms, effect of component properties on ER performance, and ER
requirements for commercial applications.
