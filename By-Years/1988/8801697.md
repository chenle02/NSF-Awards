Dr. Herbert Haas, Director of the Radiocarbon Laboratory at Southern Methodist
University's Institute for the Study of Earth and Man, will purchase a low level
background liquid scintillation counter. The "Quantulus" will permit increases
in both the productivity and precision of the laboratory and permit the dating
of both older and smaller samples than is now possible. In the last half decade
radiocarbon dating has been revolutionized by the application of a direct
counting accelerator technique. However problems entailed by this approach have
also become apparent. Sample costs are high and waiting time is long. Dr. Haas
has demonstrated that traditional liquid scintillation counting, using a state
of the art machine will combine the advantages of accelerator dating with lower
cost and shorter turnaround time. He plans to use this machine to examine the
issue of the emergence of anatomically modern humans and will date several sites
in Europe and the Near East which document this transition. Radiocarbon dating
is crucial to archaeological research and Dr. Haas has developed a first rate
laboratory which has analyzed archaeologically important samples. The addition
of a high precision liquid scintillation counter will increase his contribution
as well as permit him to address important specific problems. It will also
provide a test case for the utility of the machine.
