The investigator will study several problems in probability, most of which
concern mixing times for Markov chains. The first problem is to develop tools
for using local mixing properties of a Markov chain to understand convergence in
the global sense of the mixing time. The investigator hopes to apply these tools
to analyze the connection between spatial mixing and temporal mixing in spin
sytems. The investigator will also study problems relating to exclusion
processes. One example is Aldous's conjecture that in the symmetric exclusion
process the spectral gap does not depend on the number of particles. Further
problems concern asymmetric exclusion; for some of these models the mixing time
is believed to be lower than the corresponding symmetric version but existing
techniques cannot verify this.

In recent years a large body of mathematics has been developed relating to
finding the mixing time of a Markov chain. A problem that illustrates this body
of research is that of determining how many shuffles are necessary to randomize
a deck of cards. Here, mathematicians have had great success, finding very
precise answers for many models of card shuffling. However, interest in mixing
times is not limited to card shuffling since Markov chains are a crucial tool
for applications in a wide range of areas. Simulations of Markov chains consume
an enormous number of computer cycles each year and are applied in such areas as
computer algorithms, statistics and statistical physics.
