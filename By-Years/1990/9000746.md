Professor Lowell Kispert and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Alabama are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, twelve (12)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects range from synthetic biochemistry to
catalysis to study of thin films. The department will view the program as
successful if students continue in research careers. A unique feature of this
program is the involvement of high school teachers and students.
