This is a program to study the motion of the two electrons in alkaline earth
atoms when both are excited in the intense electromagnetic field of short laser
pulses. Barium is chosen as the prototype. One electron will be excited into a
Rydberg state, followed by controlled excitation of the other, and measurements
will be made to determine the redistribution of population among the bound
Rydberg levels. Attempts will also be made to observe interferences between the
possible paths of evolution of the excited states.
