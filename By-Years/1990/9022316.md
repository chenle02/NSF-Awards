The research will contribute to the U.S. JGOFS studies of the central
equatorial Pacific through the determination of the settling particulate flux.
The proposal combines "core" research and "process-oriented" research involving
temporal variations in composition and flux of particles across an equatorial
transect at 140oW. The core part of the proposed research will deploy sediment
trap moorings across the equatorial transect and determine the concentration of
some key components in the settling particle flux. These studies will define the
relationships among sediment burial, carbon flux, and productivity in different
biological systems and help define the oceanic response to major climatic
change. This process-oriented science will use trace elements in selected
sediment trap samples to establish proxies for productivity. By combining
sediment trap sample analyses with sediment analyses, the P.I.'s will evaluate
variations in particle flux from event scale to glacial-interglacial scales.
They will also use trace element data to evaluate the eolian flux across the
equatorial Pacific, the seasonal pattern of this input, and its relationship to
biological productivity. This part of the research will contribute to the
important question of micronutrient metals as limitations on oceanic
productivity.
