This project is an analytical and experimental effort to develop the design
theory for high performance hydrostatic bearings, using water as a fluid medium.
Water offers some important design characteristics, such as very low temperature
rise, for high precision machine tool applications. It also overcomes the
environmental issues that are traditionally related to oil bearings. Some of the
significant issues that need to be addressed are waters tendency to turbulent
flow, because of its low viscosity and its ability to corrode. Preliminary work
has shown that some of these can be overcome using certain types of ceramics and
manufacturing the bearing components to very tight tolerances. These issues will
be further investigated and formalized in the development of the design
methodology. A keen interest in this project has been exhibited by industry,
which should assist in the transfer of these results into practice. This
research is of significant interest to the nation's equipment industry.
