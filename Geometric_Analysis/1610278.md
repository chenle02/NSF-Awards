The principal investigator's research concerns the study of complex manifolds,
which are higher-dimensional curved spaces that are defined using the complex
numbers. The simplest examples of such spaces are called Riemann surfaces, which
are complex manifolds with one complex dimension (and therefore two real
dimensions), and include the familiar surfaces of the sphere and of a donut.
Higher-dimensional complex manifolds include for example Calabi-Yau manifolds,
which are a fundamental tool in string theory. Complex manifolds are ubiquitous
objects in mathematics, and have wide-ranging applications in physics and
engineering. The proposed research projects will expand our knowledge of the
geometry of higher-dimensional complex manifolds using analytic techniques, and
in particular partial differential equations (PDEs). These projects lie at the
intersection of several mathematical disciplines, such as differential,
algebraic and symplectic geometry, complex analysis and PDEs, and techniques
from all these fields are necessary to attack them. Progress on these questions
will not only shed some light on some basic problems in mathematics, but will
also have applications in physics and other sciences.

The principal investigator proposes to use techniques from geometric analysis
and nonlinear partial differential equations to investigate problems about the
geometry of complex manifolds. The first project is about applications of
analysis to the construction of currents on complex manifolds, which are used to
study the geometry of (1,1) cohomology classes on compact Kahler manifolds. In
the second project the principal investigator will develop new analytic
techniques to construct special metrics on non-Kahler complex manifolds, by
solving Monge-Ampere equations for (n-1,n-1) forms, building upon earlier work
of the principal investigator with Szekelyhidi and Weinkove which culminated in
the solution of Gauduchon's conjecture. The third project is about understanding
collapsed limits of Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds. This is closely related to
the theory of mirror symmetry, which was inspired by physical considerations.
The fourth project is centered on Donaldson's program to extend Yau's solution
of the Calabi Conjecture in Kahler geometry to symplectic four manifolds, and to
its applications to symplectic topology.
