This award supports graduate and postdoctoral student participation from US
universities, national labs, and non-profit research organizations to attend the
22nd International Meshing Roundtable (IMR) Conference be held in October 2013
in Orlando, FL. IMR created in 1992 is a unique conference for researchers in
the field of mesh generation to exchange ideas and is also an excellent
educational opportunity for students who are working on the meshing research and
related applications. Potential topics for discussion in the conference include:
mesh generation and modification, meshing for high-performance and distributed
computing, CAD and computational geometry issues, and applications of meshing in
computer graphics, finite-element analysis, computational fluid dynamics,
biomedical engineering, processing of laser/CT/MRI scans,
etc.&lt;br/&gt;Students have the opportunity to attend a short course in meshing
where the lecturers are internationally known experts in mesh generation. The
instructors address practical problems for the design and implementation of both
unstructured and structured grid generation. The course is ideal for graduate
students that just enter the field and for advance graduate and postdoctoral
students that want to expand their current skills and knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop provides a forum to foster discussions mesh generation and will enable
the identification of areas of common interest and potential collaboration among
attendees from academia, National Laboratories, and industry. Priority will be
given to students/postdocs presenting a paper or poster at the conference. The
PI plans to diversify the accepted attendees' pool and attract underrepresented
groups.
