This project will provide support for shipboard scientific support equipment for
the research vessel POINT SUR, an NSF owned ship operated by the San Jose State
University, Moss Landing Marine Laboratory, and dedicated to use in support of
ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items
as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, Dr. John Martin is full qualified to direct this
project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
installation of shipboard equipment. This project which will allow the
institution to replace an ageing radar and acquire a wireless intercom.
