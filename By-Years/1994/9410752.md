9410752 Baruah The project will investigate approaches to deal with the
performance depredations resulting from transient overloads in time-critical
applications. The research aims to understand the behavior of resource
allocation algorithms under overload conditions, with the goal of building
overload-tolerant systems. More specifically, the project will address the
following problems a). Identification and analysis of new performance metrics
for characterizing systems with overload conditions. b). The design and analysis
of scheduling algorithms for systems with overload conditions. c). Applicability
of various computational paradigms (e.g., randomized, parallel) to the design of
overload-tolerant systems. d). The identification of heuristics and guidelines
that may assist the designer of overload-tolerant systems. The result of the
project will play a role in the design of systems and algorithms that guarantee
optimal or near optimal performance. ***
