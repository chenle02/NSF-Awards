Hsieh&lt;br/&gt;0845754&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cellular engineering involves the
analysis and modification of cell function in order to achieve a set of desired
characteristics for a system. One approach has been the use of genetic
manipulation to alter cell regulatory processes. The research objective of this
project is to utilize RNA interference to engineer mechanotransduction processes
for the purposes of enhancing efforts in cell-based therapies, such as tissue
engineering. Such applications often involve spatially heterogeneous cells and
matrix, and sites that possess an adverse mechanical environment. The
incorporation of intrinsic control over cellular mechanobiologic function, in
addition to current strategies, may enhance the performance of cellular
constructs. This project investigates the modification of mechanotransduction at
different levels. Pericellular regulation will be studied by individually
silencing types II and VI collagen and small leucine-rich proteoglycans, decorin
and biglycan, and assessing their contributions to cell mechanics and
mechanobiologic response. Altering transmembrane and intracellular
mechanosignaling will be investigated through interference of stretch activated
channel KCNK2, actin bridging protein รก-actinin, and G-protein signaling
molecules RhoA and Rock1. The impact of using engineered cells for generating
stratified tissue constructs will be determined by fabricating dual population
hydrogels that are maintained in long-term co-culture and co-
stimulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational objectives that are integrated
with cellular engineering include the introduction of new classroom and research
opportunities at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Students will learn how
cellular engineering can serve as a tool in bioengineering and as a novel
approach in biomechanics. More broadly relevant educational objectives are to
generate greater awareness of the bioengineering field, and to provide current
bioengineers with a competitive advantage in the job market. To promote
awareness, the PI plans to expand his current outreach program, which involves
both giving demonstrations at high schools and bringing high school student
groups to the University of Maryland. To enhance bioengineering design
experience, a pilot program will be tested wherein multidisciplinary teams of
engineers will be formed. This will allow bioengineering students to leverage
their cross-disciplinary skills, and provide opportunities for other engineering
students to learn how their skills can be applied to bio-related designs.
