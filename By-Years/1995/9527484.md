EEC-9527484 Weldon Environmental and energy considerations are slowly forcing
the automotive industry toward the electric car. The University of Iowa's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Simulation and
Design Optimization of Mechanical System is currently performing research
addressing most areas of vehicle design except for the power and drive train.
The University of Texas at Austin has extensive facilities and capabilities for
research in electromechanical systems and proposes to collaborate with the
Center so that it could address total electric vehicle design or the electric
car. This award provides funding to prepare and hold a planning meeting at the
University of Texas at Austin in the fall of 1995 to determine a research agenda
with industrial interest and to determine if there is sufficient industrial
support to warrant the formation of an Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center site at the University of Texas at Austin. The University of Texas at
Austin research site will address electromechanical component, subsystems and
system modeling and simulation.
