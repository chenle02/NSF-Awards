Despite the vast growth of the chemical sciences and industries over the past
century and a half, and the profound transformations they have wrought in the
world, their modern history is little understood. This grant supports a three-
day conference of historians of the chemical sciences, together with historians
and social scientists in related fields, chemical scientists, secondary school
chemistry teachers, and others concerned with science education, to explore
issues and challenges facing the historian of modern chemical sciences and
technologies. This is the first conference to be devoted to this research area.
The conference is taking place in May, 1990 and has three objectives: 1)
presentation and interactive discussion of "cutting edge" research in cognitive,
institutional, social and technological history; 2) discussion of documentation
strategy for recent and contemporary chemical sciences; and 3) consideration of
"public" communication with historians, chemical scientists, educators and
science writers. A special feature of this grant is the provision for funds to
bring ten secondary school chemistry teachers to the conference in order for
them to participate in the discussions aimed at accomplishing these objectives.
The conference papers, commentaries and discussion are being published. The
volume should provide a benchmark for historians and chemical scientists, and
for those working to promote the public understanding of science.
