This project takes on three distinct areas of research in Random Matrix Theory
(RMT). The first stems from the recent discovery by the investigator and
collaborators of a connection between the Tracy-Widom laws of RMT, their
generalization to the so called "beta-ensembles", and a family of random
Schroedinger operators. This connection opens the door to a deeper understanding
of the analytic structure of Tracy-Widom laws. It also presents a new method for
investigating the universality question at the spectral edge for both random
matrices and random Schroedinger. The second set of problems concerns bulk
fluctuations for ensembles of matrices with no assumed symmetry. Such questions
are of growing interest in theoretical physics on account of the ties between
these fluctuations and the Gaussian Free Field. Finally, the investigator looks
at several applications of RMT to wireless technology where probabilistic and
analytic techniques from RMT are employed to estimate the capacity and
performance of multiple-antenna communication systems with feedback.

Matrices and their spectra (eigenvalues) are fundamental objects throughout
mathematics and its applications. The study of random matrices (again, RMT)
addresses the natural question: "What do the eigenvalues of the typical matrix
look like?" Or, said another way: "What properties of the spectra are universal
in that they depend only on the rough characteristics (e.g. symmetries) of the
matrix ensemble?" It is therefore not surprising that RMT has serious impact in
disparate areas of mathematics ranging from Statistics to Number Theory to
Operator Algebras, as well as in Physics and Engineering. On the theoretical
front, this project brings new ideas to the study of the universal properties of
the largest eigenvalues in symmetric matrices and also the bulk (or generic)
eigenvalues in matrices without symmetry. On the more directly applied side,
this project looks at problems in the theory of wireless technology where,
interestingly, the design and performance analysis of many efficient
communication systems leads to mathematical problems cast in the language of
RMT. The engineering issues here are of the utmost practical importance - while
the demand for wireless communications continues to grow, the spectrum remains a
limited resource. Presenting a natural setting for collaborations between
mathematicians and electrical engineers, this project will sponsor joint
meetings along with jointly mentored graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers.
