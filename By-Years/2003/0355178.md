This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award
provides funding for the development of an algorithm to aid in the design of
manufacturing facilities for increased competitiveness. The layout algorithm
will determine the best placement of departments within a manufacturing facility
to provide the most efficient material flow. The algorithm uses design
techniques from very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuit design, where
thousands of modules are placed on a computer chip to minimize the size of the
chip. A continuous-based department representation and mixed-integer programming
facility layout model is combined with a sequence-pair structure from VLSI
design. Fixed departments, department shape restrictions, and material handling
aisle networks will be additional problem aspects considered in the developed
algorithm. After the layout algorithm is developed, it will be tested on
problems from the research literature, as well as data from an industrial
collaborator.&lt;br/&gt; If successful, the results from this research will lead
to improvements in the design of manufacturing facilities since the facility
layout is the cornerstone of facilities planning, and facilities planning
provides the substrate upon which the manufacturing system resides. Expected
improvements would be in terms of lower material handling costs, reduced work-
in-process, reduced manufacturing lead times, and improved product quality to
enhance the competitiveness of the manufacturing enterprise. These improvements
will be realized through the ability to solve larger problems that can be solved
now, as well as providing better solutions to problems that are presently solved
sub-optimally. This work will also likely lead to ideas from facilities planning
being transferred to VLSI design, with possible impacts on that industry as
well.
