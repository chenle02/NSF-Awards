The purpose of this research is to produce statistical tests and methods for the
construction of confidence regions that are valid for the general k-endogenous
variable, overidentifying instruments, model. In addition there are several
subsidiary goals. First, the work will be extended to the general GMM framework.
It is very likely that the distribution of test statistics carries over to
nonlinear and nonspherical models, but works needs to be done on those details
which rely on the significance of the first stage simply because the standard
GMM approach doesn't have a separately identified first stage. Second, the
distinction between included and excluded exogenous variables needs to be
clarified in computing the degrees of freedom for the `switched-LR` and
`switched-LM` statistics. Third, recent work by others will be extended which
provide diagnostics for finding `weak instruments.` It is clear that simple
tests of first-stage significance are inadequate. Fourth, the practical
significance of the methods developed will be demonstrated by applying them to
real data. In particular, the widespread adoption in labor economics of natural
experiments as a source of instruments should provide a good `test bed.`
Inference using the above methods will be compared to the traditional methods
currently employed.
