This research program involves theoretical investigations of the nonequilibrium
transport phenomena of charged particles under the influence of rapidly space-
time varying fields in rf discharges. The program has two objectives: first,
obtain a nonequilibrium fluid description of the behavior of charged particles
in terms of density, mean energy, and average velocity; this nonequilibrium
fluid description is able to model the ballistic transport phenomena in rapidly
space-time varying fields and will be compared to a kinetic description and
experimental results to assess the validity of the description; secondly,
develop a parallelized code on CRAY X-MP/24 to self-consistently simulate the
transport of charged particles in the rf discharges of the Gaseous Electronics
Conference RF Reference Cell multidimensionally based on the nonequilibrium
fluid description and compare the simulation results with experimental results.
Successful completion of this investigation will contribute to the understanding
of the nonequilibrium transport phenomena of charged particles in rf discharges
and to the design of rf plasma processing reactors.
