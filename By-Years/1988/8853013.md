Modern computer-based measurement systems can have a major impact on the quality
and productivity of engineering education. However, there is a danger that
highly sophisticated equipment can mask rather than enhance learning. It is
important that students use relatively simple equipment at the beginning of a
laboratory program to help them build their intuition. This project involves the
addition of two vector voltmeters and two impedance analyzers to the Microwave
and Communications Laboratory to complement the existing automatic network
analyzers. The goal of the project is to develop experiments around this
equipment which build intuition, and ease the transition from theory to complex
measurement systems. The project will be used as part of an on-going overall
study of the proper role of emerging hardware and software technologies in the
engineering classroom and laboratory.
