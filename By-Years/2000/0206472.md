SES-0206472&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Howard Schuman&lt;br/&gt; University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Grant for Exploratory Research will
support the inclusion of key questions in December 2001 and January 2002 surveys
done by the Survey Research Center Monthly at the University of Michigan.
Surveys are administered each month to 300 new respondents and reinterviews are
completed with 200 respondents who participated in surveys six months earlier
(June and July 2002 surveys). This project builds on a recently completed study
by adding post-September 11 data in order to assess the effects of the terrorist
attacks on American collective memory. The previous project, SES-0001844, "
Collective Memory: Persistence and Change Over Fifteen Years," examined American
collective memories by replicating in 2000 a study completed in 1985. The
primary hypothesis explored in this research is that each generation receives a
distinctive imprint from the major political and social events that occur during
its youth and the effects of this imprint persist throughout the life course.
That is, past events and changes that people of all ages recall as especially
important tend to be those that occurred during their adolescence or young
adulthood. Open-ended questions were used to obtain information about
significant events and responses were coded into event categories (e.g., World
War II, the 1973 Kennedy assassination, Vietnam War, the Moon landing, Iran
hostages). Results were analyzed to determine the extent to which memories of
public events that were first discovered in 1985 persisted in
2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new data will allow the PI to gauge the impact
of the terrorist attacks, the subsequent economic impact, and the threat of
anthrax and other omens of weapons of mass destruction on respondents answers to
questions about events they consider important post-September 11th. These will
be compared to responses collected in June and July 2001. &lt;br/&gt;
