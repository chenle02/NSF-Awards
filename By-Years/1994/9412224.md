9412224 Rundel The structure and dynamics of riparian ecosystems in the
chaparral region of Southern California have not been studied in any detail.
Trees and woody shrubs are the dominant component of plant cover in these
ecosystems, but a high diversity of herbaceous riparian species are also
present. The recent extensive fires in Southern California heavily impacted this
reparian zone over large areas, with both direct effects on plant cover and
woody debris and longer term effects on debris flow and runoff. This proposal
investigates a series of hypothesis relating chaparral fire to: 1) changes in
woody debris and consequent impacts on sediment flow; 2) mortality of riparian
trees; 3) seedling establishment for riparian trees; and, 4) nutrient loss and
movement through riparian systems.
