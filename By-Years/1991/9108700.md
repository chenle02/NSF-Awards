The principal research objective of the State/Industry University Cooperative
Research Center for Molecular and Microstructure of Composites at the Case
Western Reserve University and the University of Akron is to conduct fundamental
research on the development of ultra-performance composites through purposeful
molecular and microstructure design. The characteristics of the ultra-
performance composites include more than 50% improvement of properties such as
fracture toughness, hardness, radar transparency, electromagnetic shielding,
reduction of viscosity for the ease of processing, reduced coefficient of
friction, reduced weight, cryogenic compatibility, high energy resistance, etc.
An interdisciplinary cross-campus team will address the core research program
which includes five interactive components. These are: molecular modeling,
interface/interphase, characterization, chemistry and synthesis, and processing.
Research in the non-core program designed to promote use of developments in
industry will be initiated only as the core research projects yield technology
transferable results. The Edison Polymer Innovation Corporation (EPIC) will play
a key role in facilitating, coordinating and implementing the Technology
Transfer/Implementation Program which is designed to advance Ohio's economic
development and industrial competitiveness. Initially, the Center will have
eleven large, medium and small companies in the industrial consortium. Company
representatives will participate in the Center's Advisory Board and Technical
Committee. The Director and the Associate Director of the Center will be located
at the Case Western Reserve University and University of Akron, respectively.
The educational program will include: joint advisorship of graduate students,
summer program for industry personnel. The State of Ohio, industry and NSF will
provide matching funds totalling $750,000 in the first year.
