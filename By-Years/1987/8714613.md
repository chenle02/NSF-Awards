This grant, under the Computational Science and Engineering Initiative in the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program, is in support of new
developments in the so-called quantum random walk method for determining
energies and other properties of molecules. The method, a statistical approach
to solving the Schroedinger equation, is capable of great accuracy and is
expected to have significant impact on the field of theoretical chemistry.
Professor Anderson will use the determination of the potential energy surface of
the F + H2 -&gt; HF + H atom-exchange reaction as a vehicle for exploring
refinements and extensions of the random walk method, and will determine
accurate potential energies for small clusters of helium atoms. These prototype
systems illustrate many of the complexities of more elaborate chemical reactions
and structural features.
