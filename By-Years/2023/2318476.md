The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is the National Science
Foundationâ€™s most prestigious award for early-career faculty who have the
potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead
advances in the mission of their department or organization. Early-career
faculty often face challenges in proposal writing, and they often have limited
experience interacting with NSF program directors. To address these challenges,
this project will fund the annual CISE CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop in 2023,
2024, and 2025, aiming each year for conference facilities at or close to the
NSF headquarters in Alexandria, VA.

The purpose of the workshop is to provide guidance and support to early-career
faculty members who are planning to apply for the NSF Faculty Early Career
Development (CAREER) Program award. The workshop aims to help these individuals
in developing successful research and education plans, to provide a platform for
meeting with NSF program directors, and to offer networking opportunities for
exchanging ideas with other early-career CISE faculty members. Each year, the
workshop expects about 250 CAREER-eligible junior faculty in NSF-supported
disciplines at U.S. universities and colleges to attend. Preferences will be
given to junior faculty in CISE-related disciplines, with travel support for
participants from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), from
minority-serving institutions (MSIs), women, members of underrepresented
minority groups, and persons with disabilities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
