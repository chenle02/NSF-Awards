The proposal has two main components. The first attempts to describe nucleon
structure, and the interactions between nucleons in terms of Quantum
Chromodynamics, (QCD). There are two regions with a straightforward connection:
short distances, where asymptotic freedom allows a perturbative treatment in
terms of quarks and gluons, and large distances, where nucleons appear as
manifestations of the non-linear nature of QCD at large distances: the latter
leads to a picture of nucleons as solitons, and can be handled in the large N
(number of colors) and classical limit, while interactions between them can be
described in terms of multimeson exchange. ("QCD at small q is a complicated
nonlinear theory of mesons" Witten). The aim is to understand the connection
between these two pictures. As a start 1/N and quantum corrections to the
soliton picture are to be tackled. The second component is to continue the study
of scattering theory with techniques that combine algebraic and analytic
techniques: this has applications to molecular as well as nuclear physics.
