The binding of polyelectrolytes to oppositely charged colloids and surfaces is
important in biological phenomena and in environmental processes. The binding
energetics are controlled by the colloid surface charge density, the effective
charge of the polyion binding sequence, and the Debye screening length. The
structure of the resultant complexes or aggregates depends, in addition, on the
dimensions of the colloidal particle, the chain length of the polyion, and the
concentrations of these two species. This work describes polyelectrolyte -
nonionic/ionic micelle systems as a paradigm for the investigation of these
effects. Interaction energetics will be explored by establishing the
interrelationship among various parameters at critical binding conditions. The
structure of soluble polyion-micelle complexes will be explored using static and
dynamic light scattering, as a function of the dimensions of the two macroionic
species. Of special interest is the transition from intrapolymer micelle
binding, to polymer bridging of micelles, as the size of the micelle increases
relative to that of the polyion. Phenomenological relationships developed will
be compared to current theoretical treatments, and their general utility will be
evaluated for other charged colloids, e.g. silica.
