Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0441170&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: David Eisenbud&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematical Sciences
Research Institute (MSRI) is a national&lt;br/&gt;research institute that seeks
to further mathematical research&lt;br/&gt;through broadly based programs in the
mathematical sciences and&lt;br/&gt;closely related activities on widely ranging
topics. The&lt;br/&gt;Institute operates without permanent faculty and conducts
long&lt;br/&gt;programs (half- or full-year), conferences, and
introductory&lt;br/&gt;workshops aimed at students and postdoctoral researchers.
MSRI&lt;br/&gt;contributes to the development of the mathematical
sciences&lt;br/&gt;workforce through postdoctoral appointments to the long
programs,&lt;br/&gt;summer graduate programs, and administration of the Bay
Area&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Olympiad and Berkeley Math Circles. Outreach
and&lt;br/&gt;communication efforts include public lectures in the
San&lt;br/&gt;Francisco Bay area, sponsorship of films on mathematics,
and&lt;br/&gt;systematic Web video delivery of recorded MSRI
lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MSRI Web site at http://www.msri.org/
describes upcoming and&lt;br/&gt;past programs, solicits ideas for future
programs, and offers&lt;br/&gt;application forms for Institute
activities.&lt;br/&gt;
