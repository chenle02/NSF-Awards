This award supports the research of Professor S. Rallis and Professor D.
Ginzburg to work in automorphic functions. Professor Rallis intends to work on
the relation of the Rankin Selberg integral representation of L functions to
various problems in the theory of automorphic forms. Professor Ginzburg intends
to work on applications of the Rankin Selberg method to Langland's conjecture.
Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the middle of the
nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and physicists have thus long realized
that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic
nature. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole
numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its
historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in
theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory.
