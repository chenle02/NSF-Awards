Absorbance spectroscopy is widely used in many fields and lower limits of
detection are currently set by limits of sensitivity and reproducability of
available instruments. An instrument with significantly improved sensitivity
would extend use of many existing procedures and permit use of others not
currently employed due to instrumental limitations. Wavelength modulation
spectrophotometry has been used in a number of applications and has a great
ability to reduce some types of noise. The proposed work will continue the
development of a technique using wavelength modulation spectrophotometry to
monitor kinetic assays by accurately measuring minute changes in sample
absorbance. Phase I research demonstrated feasibility of such an approach by
constructing and operating an experimental model of an instrument which used
novel methods of eliminating spurious amplitude modulation effects that normally
accompany wavelength modulation. The performance results were: noise = 6.1 x
10-6 A RMS at A = 0; max. practical sensitivity = 10-3 A full scale; drift = 0.4
x 10-6 A/min. The noise and sensitivity of this experimental instrument surpass
the best reports in the literature, and obserations during operation of the
instrument suggest much potential for further improvement of these parameters.
Phase II research will center around two objectives: 1) reduction of instrument
drift, noise, and inaccuracy and 2) evaluation of instrument performance over
the full range of expected operating conditions. At successful conclusion of
Phase II, we will have demonstrated instrument noise below 2x10-6 A RMS at A =
0; drift below 0.1 x 10-6 A per minute, and accuracy 5% of full scale. These
goals will be achieved by investigations of noise and drift and subsequent
instrument modification to improve performance.
