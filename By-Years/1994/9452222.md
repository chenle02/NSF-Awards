9452222 Horner North Central College proposes to incorporate several laser
experiments into its physical chemistry laboratory. An introductory physics
laboratory will also be affected. Short timescale (50 ns - 10 ms) events
heretofore inaccessible in the laboratories will be investigated using chopped
or pulsed lasers. In the physical chemistry laboratory a chopped helium-neon
laser beam will be used to study the thermal lens effect and measure the heat
capacity of a solvent. A pulsed nitrogen laser will function as the excitation
source in two other physical chemistry experiments. In one, the kinetics of a
colorful photoisomerization reaction will be studied using the pulse-probe
method. In another experiment students will measure luminescence lifetimes to
learn about factors influencing radiationless electronic relaxation of excited
metal ions, with special emphasis upon collision-induced energy transfer.
Chemistry and physics students in an introductory physics laboratory will
receive an early exposure to modern optical methods as they use the pulsed
nitrogen laser to determine the speed of light. Several benefits will accrue
from this project. Topics previously encountered only in the lecture portion of
physical chemistry will be brought to life in the laboratory. The instrumental
backgrounds of North Central College chemistry students will be greatly enhanced
by their encounters with the modular (rather than "black- box") experimental
apparatus, and students will get a taste of modern experimental research methods
in physical chemistry.
