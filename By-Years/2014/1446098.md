The objective of this NUE project, Engineering Innovation in Biomedical
Nanotechnology, at the University of Arizona (UA), under the direction of Dr.
Eniko T. Enikov, is to develop to introduce nanoscale science and engineering
through an innovative use of a technical elective senior design course in
mechatronics, followed by an ABET-mandated senior-level engineeirng capstone
design project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities include: 1)
Delivery of mechatronics design course focused on use of giant magneto-
resistance (GMR) sensors and the fabrication of an electro-spinning
manufacturing cell. 2) Mentoring of two senior capstone design teams/year
comprised of engineering and business students who will use the GMR sensors and
electro-spinning apparatus in clinical applications (In collaboration with the
UA College of Medicine and the College of Management). 3) Demonstration of a
working prototype of a smart catheter with embedded flow sensor enabled by the
application of super-paramagnetic nano-particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project seeks to develop a model for nanotechnology education that can
be adopted by other institutions. To broaden the impact of the project, the PIs
have partnered with the UA McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at
the Eller College of Management whereby student teams of engineering and
business students will develop product ideas based on nanotechnology and
subsequently create product prototypes as part of the senior capstone design
course in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on the prior work
of the PI, Dr. Enikov, in developing undergraduate laboratory experiments in
nanotechnology, which showed that an evolutionary design approach can be used
successfully to complete a relatively complicated nanotechnology project within
the framework of the standard junior- and senior-year courses.
