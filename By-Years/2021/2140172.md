A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these
institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational
appreciation for science and mathematics education. Sustainability of STEM
instructional capacity gains is significantly enhanced by retaining the talent
of credentialed STEM faculty. This project aligns directly with that goal.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions to
institutions of higher education. For tribal colleges and universities, whose
core operating funds are directly aligned with student enrollment, drops in
enrollment equate to loss of funding. To mitigate against detrimental pandemic-
related effects on STEM instructional capacity, this award will support the
salary and professional development of one full-time STEM faculty member at Bay
Mills Community College. This TCUP STEM Faculty award is intended to help
maintain Bay Mills Community Collegeâ€™s STEM program as the college recovers from
the deleterious impact of the pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
