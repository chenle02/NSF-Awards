*** 9710375 CRAIG Norman C. Craig of Oberlin College is supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his high resolution fourier-
transform infrared (FTIR) studies of nonpolar fluorocarbon molecules. The cis or
gauche effect predicts that the more polar isomer has the lower energy; Craig
will analyze the rotationally-resolved infrared spectrum of the nonpolar isomers
of 1,4-difluoro- and 1,4-dichlorobutadienes and the microwave spectrum of the
polar isomers to determine their complete structures. The overall goal of these
studies is to gain information about the adjustments in molecular bond lengths
and angles that accompany changes in a molecule's configuration, that is, in the
positions that large atoms or groups of atoms occupy when attached to certain
molecular skeletons, such as a rigid carbon-carbon double bond. The results of
these experiments will help in understanding the propensities for one molecular
configuration over another and to stimulate high-level theoretical calculations
designed to explore these cis or gauche effects. ***
