Transcription of the HO gene in the yeast S. cerevisiae is subject to three
separate types of control. Transcription is repressed in diploids, (a/d
repression); it is activated in haploids, but only those which have undergone
cell division (mother cells). Finally, activation of HO transcription is
restricted to the late GI phase of the cell cycle (cell cycle control). UAS
elements in distinct upstream regulatory regions (URS) mediate mother/daughter
control (URSI) and cell cycle control (URS2). These UAS elements can act
automonously to activate HO transcription when they are physically separated
from each other. However, within the context of the HO promoter, neither UAS is
sufficient to activate transcription. Deletions which remove URSI from the HO
promoter prevent HO transcription. In addition, mutations in either of two
regulatory proteins which specifically mediate transcription from the UAS in
URS2 also eliminate HO transcription. Such results imply the existence of an
additional negative control region within the intact promoter whose action is
only overcome when both URSI and URS2 are active. The experiments in this
research planning grant are designed to genetically identify and characterize
the sites and trans-acting factors involved in this negative control.
