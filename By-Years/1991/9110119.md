Recent experimental studies have shown that many extraordinary magnetic
properties can be achieved in multilayer nanostructure polycrystalline thin
films, e.g. high coercivities. In this proposal, a computer modeling study is
proposed to simulate the microscopic magnetization processes and structures in
the multilayer nanostructure film. The main objective of the study is to
understand the mechanisms for those extraordinary magnetic properties and to be
able to suggest new film nanostructures for developing more advanced magnetic
thin films. Important physical quantities and intrinsic material properties,
such as crystalline structure and interfacial properties are included in the
model. Ferromagnetic exchange and magnetostatic interactions are included.
Microscopic magnetization configurations and their dynamic behavior are obtained
by solving coupled Landau-Lifshitz equations. In this study, small size
magnetization structures are to be discovered and behavior of these structures
which determines the film magnetic properties will be characterized.
Correlations between film magnetic properties and film nanostructures, intrinsic
material properties, and interfacial properties will be obtained.
Superparamagnetic constraint on the film microstructures will be investigated.
In this study, we will also search for optimum film structure and material
properties in developing the film for ultra- high density magnetic storage
applications. This modeling study will be combined with experimental research on
the same type of films. Available experimental results and information on
material and microstructure will be used to verify and improving the modeling at
all stages of the study.
