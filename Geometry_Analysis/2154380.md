This project investigates open questions in the areas of analysis, geometry, and
dynamical systems. These mathematical disciplines are crucial for a host of
scientific fields, including engineering, biology, and economics. For example,
the mathematical modeling of any physical phenomenon that undergoes change over
time can be viewed as a dynamical system. Similarly, geometry is the basis for
numerous current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This research
project will enhance the tools available in the aforementioned mathematical
areas. The axiomatic development of geometry, which postulates a set of basic
assumptions from which all other reasonable conclusions are logically deduced,
dates back to ancient Greece. The major focus of this project is a detailed
study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean axiom, attributed to
Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer postulated. The resulting mathematics turns
out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual,
Archimedean, kind. The project will also generate research opportunities at a
variety of levels, suitable for work by graduate and undergraduate students.

This project will employ non-Archimedean tools to study a range of problems in
analysis, dynamics, and geometry. Essential to this endeavor is an understanding
of Berkovich spaces, which are non-Archimedean analogues of real and complex
manifolds. One component of the project involves a detailed study of the space
of metrics on an ample line bundle on a compact complex manifold. Geodesic rays
within this space can be studied via non-Archimedean methods. Another topic for
consideration is the Kontsevich-Soibelman conjecture, which originally arose in
the study of mirror symmetry. In the areas of analysis and dynamics, non-
Archimedean techniques will be employed to construct invariant currents for two-
dimensional complex dynamical systems, allowing for a study of the growth of
arithmetic complexity along orbits of arithmetic dynamical systems.
