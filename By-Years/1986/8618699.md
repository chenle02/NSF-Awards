The recent abundance of interactive programming environments is significantly
aiding the programmer of large software systems. Response times are enhanced by
decreasing unnecessary recompilation, usually at the expense of sophisticated
program optimization. This project addresses the issue of providing an effective
interactive environment for developing highly optimized programs. Two principal
issues are to be investigated. (1) development of a recompilation system that,
in general, provides substantially better interactivity than existing
environments for highly optimized code but supports the same level of
optimization; (2) assessment of the most efficient recompilation strategies
under various scenarios of edits, program structure, and code optimization. This
project focuses on adapting the Rn Fortran programming environment at Rice
University to provide fine-grained partial recompilation without sacrificing the
ambitious (global and interprocedural) program optimization inherent of this
environment. The approach consists of applying the incremental, intraprocedural
optimization techniques recently developed by the PI to the large-grained
partial recompilation system of Rn . The performance of the fine-grained,
partial recompilation system will be compared with the existing larger-grained
compiler of Rn under different condition. Ideally, the recompilation system
would be able to use this information to automatically determine when it is more
efficient to perform fine-grained recompilation analysis or a total
recompilation. A foreseen contribution of this research is a usable programming
environment which offers precise recompilation analyses coupled with the support
of highly optimized programs.
