Support is being provided for domestic graduate students to attend the 2nd
International Conference on Attosecond Physics (Atto-2009). This conference is
being held on the campus of Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas,
beginning on July 28, 2009, and ending on August 1, 2009.

Atto-2009 is organized around the following topics: Attosecond generation High-
order harmonic generation Attosecond physics Ultrafast dynamics and imaging of
molecules Laser-plasma interaction and super intense lasers Free-electron x-ray
lasers Coherent control High-power ultrafast lasers Carrier-envelope phase-
controlled ultrafast lasers Ultrafast dynamics in solids, surfaces and clusters
