9616882 Crabtree This proposal requests partial support for the annual summer
research conference on Transcription which will be held from August 10-15, 1996
at the conference center at Snowmass Village, Colorado. The primary objective of
this meeting is to bring together researchers who study transcription in many
different biologic contexts. Because of the diversity of biologic events
controlled by transcription, the meeting offers the opportunity for researchers
in many different areas to come together to focus on the unique contributions of
transcription to their individual studies. The meeting will begin with sessions
designed to explore the structure and function of the basal transcription
apparatus and the contributions of chromatin to the control of transcription.
Later sessions will emphasize the contribution of transcription in recombination
and repair, the action of hormones, and signal transduction. Other sessions will
emphasize the role of transcription in regulating the cell cycle,
transcriptional mechanisms used by oncogenes and viruses, and finally the
contribution of transcriptional control mechanisms to the determination of cell
type. ***
