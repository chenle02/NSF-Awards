This grant is for the partial support of a Symposium on Computational
Neuroscience at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis on October
17, 1992. This symposium will be a Satellite Meeting of the 1992 IEEE Systems,
Man, Cybernetics Conference which will be held in Chicago on October 18th to
21st. The symposium will emphasize an area which was the subject of a special
initiative; i.e., Biosystems Analysis and Control, which involved two
directorates and three divisions. The symposium also will act as a follow up to
the NSF sponsored workshop on "Bio-Control by Neural Networks" which was held in
May, 1990. It will promote the interdisciplinary investigations between
engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists and neuroscientists into the area
of computational neuroscience.
