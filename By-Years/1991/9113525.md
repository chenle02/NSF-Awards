This award allow the establishment of a regional archival center for early life
history stages of fishes (eggs and larvae) of the Pacific Northwest at the
University of Washington. The project will consolidate and curate 7 individual
collections now at UW (1 at School of Fisheries; 2 at School of Oceanography; 1
at Int. Pac. Halibut Comm.) and a t government agencies (3 at Alaska Fisheries
Science Center) in the Seattle area. The consolidated collection -- 48,000 lots
-- will be the third largest fish egg and larval holdings in the U.S. The
collection transfers have the written approval and recommendation of the USNM,
the National Marine Fisheries Service of NOAA and the IPHC. The USNM is not in
position to accommodate these collections; but, as required by law, a
representative collection of the holdings at the National Marine Fisheries
Service will be made available to the USNM. Each of the separate collections
will now receive far better curatorial care and more research use in the
archival center. The increased availability of a reorganized, integrated
collection will help fill the demand for larval fish specimens for research and
education in ecology, systematics, embryology and morphology and will also
promote ontogenetic studies.
