9451638 Dickstein The biology laboratory implements a hands-on component of a
required biology course for first-year engineering students. The goal is to
impart basic biological concepts to future engineers, many of whom will be
working in fields having a biological, biomedical, or environmental impact. The
course and laboratory focus on the concepts behind molecular biology,
biotechnology, and environmental biology. Laboratory experiments demonstrate the
concepts of enzymatic specificity, in vitro manipulation of DNA, growth of a
microbial population, recombinant DNA, and gene regulation.
