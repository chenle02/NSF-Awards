This international, multi-institutional, collaborative project will advance our
knowledge regarding how alluvial and fluvial geomorphic systems respond to
climate change at millennial timescales in arid and semiarid regions. The
project specifically aims to analyze the coupled hydrologic and geomorphic
response during post-glacial times in the arid Elqui valley in northern Chile.
Cosmogenic nuclides, luminescence dating and soils stratigraphy will be used to
characterize, in terms of process and timing, the production, storage and
transport of sediment from hillslopes to alluvial and fluvial reaches. Two
nearby lacustrine records will be analyzed over the same temporal window with a
suite of paleoenvironmental indicators. The robust coupled dataset is expected
to contribute to our understanding of the local and regional pedology,
geomorphology, tectonics and paleoenvironment of the semiarid western Andes.
Furthermore, understanding how landforms and soils evolve over Holocene
timescales will contribute to geologic research of similar regions in other
parts of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the
advancement of undergraduate geology programs at University of Nevada Reno and
California State University Bakersfield, the latter a Hispanic-Serving
Institution. The project has a strong international partnership with Centro de
Estudios Avanzado en Zonas Aridas (CEAZA) in La Serena, Chile, as well as
Dalhousie University in Canada and will provide international research
experiences for two U.S. undergraduate students. The research will aid land use
planning and hazards mitigation efforts for the region as well as other parts of
the world with similar arid environments. Outreach activities will be
coordinated with the Chilean partner. This project is jointly supported by the
Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics, Paleoclimatology, and International Science
and Engineering programs.
