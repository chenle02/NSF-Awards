This grant supports the compilation and spherical harmonic analysis of the
global ensemble of heat flow measurements published through the end of 1986. The
last comprehensive published compilation was made more than a decade earlier,
comprising some 5500 the present size of the data set is estimated to exceed
15,000 values, making a new compilation and analysis imperative. Heat flow
constitutes the largest energy flux within the earth, and is a first order
constraint in predicting temperatures within the outer few hundred kilometers of
the planet. Heat flow is, therefore, an important parameter in global and
regional geodynamic studies, igneous and metamorphic petrogenesis,
paleomagnetism and geochronology, sedimentary diagnosis and hydrocarbon
maturation, and a host of other temperature dependent or thermally activated
processes within the earth.
