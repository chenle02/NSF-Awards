The efficiencies of thermoelectric devices are generally limited by the
properties of the available materials. This study will use ion beam modification
to produce improved thermoelectric materials. By introducing defects and/or
alloying elements by ion implantation, the thermal conductivity of the materials
will be lowered without reducing the Seebeck coefficient or the electrical
conductivity thus resulting in a higher figure of merit and making possible a
higher efficiency in thermoelectric generators, coolers, etc. In Phase I
silicon-germanium alloys will be deposited in thin film form, doped by ion
implantation, and the relevant electrical properties will be measured. Phase II
research would attempt to improve the figure of merit of the materials using ion
implantation, resulting in an increase in the theoretically attainable
efficiency. Since the applications of these devices indicate that their market
will be international, this research would improve the nation's competitive
position by advancing the state of the art and ensuring that domestic firms
would have access to the latest research results.
