The Alfred University Calculus Initiative (AUCI) is a multi-faceted project that
combines an innovative and distinctive curriculum with classroom transformation,
video lessons and examples, online quizzes and homework, and web-based
implementation into a comprehensive calculus experience. This project is
informed by current research and trends in STEM education, which include
engaging students with visual and online technology, creating an active learning
environment in the classroom, and incorporating meaningful applications. The
AUCI is developing a website from which users can access various course
components from remote locations. To take advantage of the intrinsic portability
of the course materials, the AUCI is forming partnerships with area school
districts so that the course may be offered to high school students on their own
campuses and for college credit.

The fundamental goal of the AUCI is to increase understanding and success in
calculus and precalculus while maintaining the level of rigor and breadth
required for post-calculus courses. One of the key ideas to achieving AUCI's
goal is a fundamental re-ordering of calculus topics. The evaluation of this
project focuses on student learning outcomes and success in first-year calculus
courses as well as on student perceptions of and attitudes towards the course
content and delivery methods. Since each component of the project is adaptable
to suit nearly any STEM discipline, the research being conducted on the effects
of its content and structure have the potential to be a valuable resource for
those interested in new perspectives on teaching calculus and other STEM courses
in general.
