This project is concerned with the study of Poisson-Vlasov and Maxwell-Vlasov
systems which model the time evolution of a collisionless plasma moving under
the influence of its self inducted electromagnetic field. Main emphasis will be
placed on proving the existence of global smooth solutions and time asymptotics
in the context of modeling solar winds. A procedure for construction of multiple
steady state solutions will be further analyzed. This project has implications
in atmospheric sciences as well as areas of energy such as nuclear fusion.
