This is a proposal to develop a general-purpose flexible workstation for the
analysis of acoustical signatures of biological and non-biological systems. The
workstation will contain a variety of signal processing andclassification
algorithms that can be invoked interactively. The emphasis will be on developing
algorithms based on neural networks, and on gaining capability to analyze
several signals simultaneously.
