Although this project is about geometric group theory, the inspiration for many
of the methods and questions comes from geometric topology, particularly the
geometry and topology of three-manifolds. The main part of the project is on
relatively hyperbolic groups. In collaborations with several mathematicians, the
PI will apply diverse methods (including group theoretic "Dehn filling") to the
understanding of relatively hyperbolic and hyperbolic groups. The goal of these
explorations is to shed light on some fundamental problems in hyperbolic groups,
especially the question of which hyperbolic groups contain surface subgroups.
This question is closely related to the virtual Haken conjecture of Waldhausen.
A second part of the project is aimed at developing a general theory of the
"variety" of actions of a fixed group on negatively curved (but not necessarily
proper) spaces.



Geometric group theory is the study of infinite groups (objects from abstract
algebra) using the techniques of geometry and topology. A central idea is that
the best way to understand an abstract group is to see it concretely as a group
of symmetries of some geometric object, such as a crystal lattice or a rooted
tree. While this idea allows the transfer of techniques from diverse areas of
mathematics (including theoretical computer science, analysis, geometry,
topology, and dynamics) to group theory, it also has led to new insight into
these other fields.
