9407521 Blecher Experiments on the radiative muon capture in hydrogen and
helium-3 will be carried out in order to further understanding of the
fundamental electroweak interaction and its effects in well understood complex
nuclear systems. This work will be carried out at the TRIUMF facility in Canada.
Compton scattering and pion photoproduction experiments, both using linearly
polarized photons, will be carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's
Laser Electron Gamma Source. The goal of this experiment is to extract
information on the deformation of the lowest energy nucleon resonance. Lastly,
an experiment to search for time reversal violation in k-meson decays will be
carried out at the KEK facility in Japan. This experiment will search for
phenomena not predicted within the currently accepted standard model of
fundamental interactions. ***
