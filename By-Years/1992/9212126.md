This project is to expose senior-level undergraduates in electrical and
mechanical engineering to recent research advances by focusing on a specific
application. The application selected is the design and control of a walking
robot. The main reasons for this choice are (i) the recent experience of some of
the PI's (Azarm, Dayawansa, Tsai) in directing groups of senior undergraduates
to design, build and test rudimentary walking robots (in the context of a
course) and (ii) the almost endless possibility of incorporating advanced
concepts and techniques (mechanisms synthesis, nonlinear control, speech
recognition). The current course will be restructured. Main aspects will
include: (i) incremental development of a long term (three-year cycle) project,
with different focus each year; (ii) emphasis on application of research results
obtained by the PI's and their research groups; (iii) creating an environment
conducive to interdisciplinary research and education; (iv) active involvement
of graduate students in transferring their research results to undergraduates
and thus complementing more theoretical thesis work; (v) industrial and federal
involvement; (vi) strong connection with the ECSEL program. This course will be
cross-listed in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.
