the Laplacian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
is concerned with estimates of solutions of wave&lt;br/&gt;equations on (both
compact and non-compact) Riemannian manifolds, &lt;br/&gt;possibly with
boundary. We are interested in how the&lt;br/&gt;geometry, the boundary and the
regularity of the metric influence&lt;br/&gt;certain basic estimates. Problems
of this kind arise both in the&lt;br/&gt;study of local and global existence of
solutions of nonlinear wave&lt;br/&gt;equations and in the study of
eigenfunctions of Laplacians in&lt;br/&gt;quantum chaos. Although these topics
are widely separated in their&lt;br/&gt;physical origins, the relevant
mathematics is closely related and&lt;br/&gt;the techniques and insights in the
two areas cross fertilize in&lt;br/&gt;a fruitful way. Each of the PIs is an
expert one of these areas.&lt;br/&gt;By pooling our knowledge through a FRG
grant we shall be able to &lt;br/&gt;make significant progress in these fields
as well&lt;br/&gt;as possibly in related ones such as general relativity
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eigenfunctions are the building blocks of
functions. Understanding&lt;br/&gt;their basic size and concentration properties
helps us solve new &lt;br/&gt;differential equations. In the other direction,
techniques from&lt;br/&gt;the study of nonlinear wave equations have recently
been used&lt;br/&gt;to prove new results about eigenfunctions. This proposal
is&lt;br/&gt;about continuing this cross-fertilization of related
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
