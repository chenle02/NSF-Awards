The proposed research targets improving the computing environment for important
scientific problems without requiring large expensive systems. The objective of
this new fundamental research is to perform science domain exploration to
broaden the applicability of scalable RC systems and GPUs across other domains
and industry sectors that have great computational needs; and research methods
and develop an infrastructure to enable domain computational scientists (not
expert users of accelerators) to use accelerator technologies (based on FPGAs
and GPUs) in a productive manner.

The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential to greatly expand the use
of reconfigurable computing for solution of critical [problems in science and
engineering. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as
individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the
centers portfolio through collaboration of two of its sites as well as extend
the scope and horizon of the CHREC center research projects and direction,
benefiting current industry members while attracting potential new ones. The PIs
research will likely impact diverse undergraduate and graduate students at each
institution.
