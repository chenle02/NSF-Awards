The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses
on the detailed dynamics of heterogeneous reactions. The work promises to
provide detailed information about reactions at surfaces that is crucial to a
basic understanding of surface reaction processes. This sort of information is
important in many applications, such as heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion and
wear, and electronic device processing. Oxidation of carbon monoxide by oxygen
on platinum, oxidation of carbon monoxide by nitric oxide on platinum, and the
reduction of nitrogen dioxide by carbon monoxide on gold and platinum surfaces
will be studied. The chosen systems provide a progression of reaction energetics
and mechanistic differences. A range of surface science probes will be used, and
the reactions will be studied using a molecular beam scattering system. The
experiments will be interpreted using trajectory calculation modeling.
