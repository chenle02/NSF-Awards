EAR-9504808 Durek, Joseph J. The goal of this project is to characterize the
three-dimensional anelastic structure of the earthOs mantle in order to
constrain models of temperature and viscosity variations in the mantle. This is
a notable challenge because it is difficult to separate the effects of
attenuation from elastic focusing of energy. The immediate objective, therefore,
is to characterize focusing better in order to remove this contribution to
attenuation. A relatively new array of 13 broadband seismometers administered by
U.C. Berkeley can provide critical data for resolution of this problem. The
Fellow will examine anomalies in surface wave signals received by this array
from clusters of sources in order to determine the anelastic structure along
specific corridors. Because the potential sources of the anomalies have are
sensitive to different components of the velocity structure, it is possible to
better quantify elastic focusing along parallel ray paths, or OcorridorsO
without associating them with a specific global 3-D elastic model. Applying
similar techniques to other arrays and clusters of earthquakes will lead to
improved attenuation modeling along other corridors, and ultimately, at a global
scale.
