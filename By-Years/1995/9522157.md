9522157 Alo This award provides for infrastructure designed to substantially
increase the numbers of minority students going into and completing degrees in
the computing disciplines at the University of Houston-Downtown. The project has
three primary components: Students, Academic Program, and Research with strong
recruitment, mentoring, curriculum enhancement, and research development
activities as parts of the project. Collaboration with Rice University has been
established and will be an important part of the overall effort. Community
college linkages will be initiated, a Saturday Academy for high school students
has been established, research experiences for undergraduates will be expanded,
and the faculty research environment will be enhanced. It is anticipated that
this project has the potential to become a model for development of programs for
minority success at other similar urban universities. ***
