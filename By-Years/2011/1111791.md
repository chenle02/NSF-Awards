With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting Professor Jon D.
Stewart of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida to develop
new enzyme catalysts for asymmetric conjugated alkene reductions. To date, the
overall impact of these enzymes on synthetic chemistry has been modest because
the wild-type enzymes accept only a limited range of substrates, provide one
possible stereoisomer and lack long-term stability. To overcome these problems,
existing flavin-dependent reductase enzymes will be systematically varied at
amino acid positions rated most likely to yield improved mutants. X-ray
crystallography will be used to understand how substrates bind in the active
sites of improved enzymes.

The broader impacts involve mentoring high school students (U.F. Precollegiate
Training Program), undergraduates (NSF REU), graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers, including members of historically underrepresented groups in
chemistry. Moreover, the work will provide diverse training in chemistry, x-ray
crystallography, molecular biology and biochemistry to these coworkers. In terms
of scientific broader impacts, this work is directed at efficient,
environmentally benign methods for producing chiral building blocks for
medicinal, agrochemical and industrial chemical applications. In addition, the
insights gleaned from combining protein engineering, structural studies and
catalytic assays will provide new information on flavoproteins, an important
class of biocatalysts involved in a diverse set of reactions at the
chemistry/biology interface.
