9512231 Chiang An advanced surface microscopy facility, consisting of an
ultrahigh vacuum low energy electron microscope (LEEM) and a ultrahigh vacuum
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) installed within the same vacuum system with
sample transfer between the two instruments, will be established. The
combination of the two instruments, LEEM and STM, within the same ultrahigh
vacuum environment will enable the structural study of the surfaces of materials
with both atomic resolution (STM) and in real time (LEEM). Both microscopes will
permit control of the sample temperature during imaging and deposition of metals
and adsorbates. The facility will be used by eleven investigators and their
research groups to study surface properties in several key areas. These include:
(1) dynamics of surface structural changes, such as nucleation and growth of
metal, semiconductor, and oxide overlayers; (2) structural effects on
adsorbates, such as segregation, diffusion, and reactivity; (3) synthesis and
characterization of nanoscale materials, such as quantum dots, thin-film
fullerene polymers, and nanoclusters. %%% Two complementary types of surface
microscopes, a low energy electron microscope and a scanning tunneling
microscope, will be utilized to probe surface systems with varying spatial and
time resolution as a function of important parameters such as temperature and
coverage of adsorbates. The possibility exists to image an important class of
catalysts and simultaneously investigate their reactivities and catalytic
properties. ***
