Improved, reliable accelerometers suitable for wide deployment in seismic
arrays are needed for the measurement of ground displacements due to
earthquakes, earthquake precursors, and man-made seismic events. Improvements
are sought in broad-band sensor response down to fractional Hertz, with wide
dynamic range, high reliability, and reduced maintenance costs. Wide dynamic
range devices capable of measuring both small seismic events (precursors) and
also severe earthquakes are needed. In response to this need, Optical
Technologies (OPTECH), a Division of Dynamic Systems, Inc., proposes to research
and develop a laboratory prototype, Triaxial Fiber-Optic Seismometer (TFOS).
Using phase measuring and reset-counting demodulation, the resulting device will
be capable of detecting seismic signals in a range of from subnano-g up to
approximately 0.23grms. Thus, the measurement span of the Phase II triaxial
seismometer prototype is expected to exceed 170 dB.
