PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0800526&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Yale University&lt;br/&gt;NSF
PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: McKinsey,
Daniel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: "Direct Searches for Dark Matter Using Noble
Liquids"&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astronomical observations
indicate that the universe is dominated by some unidentified dark matter whose
total mass exceeds that of normal matter by a factor 5-10. A theoretically
favored dark matter candidate is a new weakly interacting massive particle
(WIMP) interacting only weakly but nevertheless producing rare nuclear recoils
detectable in suitable targets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide
funds to enable this research group at Yale University to contribute to the LUX
dark matter experiment that promises to substantially improve the sensitivity
to, or discover, the existence of WIMPs. LUX is a proposed two-phase
(liquid/gas) xenon experiment, with a liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chamber
mass of 300 kg. LUX is based on the same basic technology as the recent XENON10
experiment which has set stringent limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon
elastic scattering cross-section. On LUX, this group will be responsible for the
slow control electronics, xenon purification systems, and a system for deploying
radioactive sources for detector calibration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the
Broader Impacts, the development of technology related to noble liquid detectors
will find use in the increasing number of experiments worldwide using noble
liquids as detection materials. These projects will also result in technical
training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate
and undergraduate students. LXe, LAr, and LNe may have practical application to
gamma ray imaging for astrophysics, Homeland Security, and medical imaging, as
well as for fast neutron detection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
