9614463 Chester This research is for collaborative research between Columbia
and Texas A&amp;M Universities on the failure processes in the New Madrid
Seismic Zone (NMSZ) of the Central U.S. through characterization of
microearthquake clustering. Earlier analysis is to be extended to clustered
events throughout the NMSZ. Most clusters are located near the kink in the
central segment, or near the junctions of that segment with other major
segments. The spatial/temporal clusters occur over a range of depths of 4 to 9
km, display both strike and reverse slip focal mechanisms, and are located both
near and away from the segment junctions and the kink. The goal is to provide
the best physical model for the clustering and give additional insight into 1)
the relation of the static stress drops of the larger ruptures to focal depths,
focal mechanisms, and locations near or away from the junctions, 2) the mode of
interactions among major fault segments in the NMSZ, such as triggering of
ruptures by seismic or aseismic preslip along intersecting fault segments, and
3) the role of fluid involvement in faulting processes. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
