Gelatinous zooplankton comprise an important and sometimes dominant component of
the total Antarctic marine zooplankton, but have received so little study that
even the systematics is poorly developed for many taxa. Knowledge of these
organisms is essential for understanding the structure and function of the
overall marine ecosystem. Harbison proposes a generalized study of three
important groups (ctenophores, salps and pteropods). Research will include work
on systematics, feeding behavior and rates, and in the case of pteropods, growth
rate, age structure of populations and role of their shells in the oceanic
carbonate cycle. Organisms will be collected mainly by SCUBA equipped divers,
and will be studied both in situ and in shipboard or laboratory aquaria.
Research will be conducted at McMurdo Station, at Palmer Station, and on
shipboard.
