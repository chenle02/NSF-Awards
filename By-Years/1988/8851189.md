The data acquisition and control laboratory serves the needs of several courses.
The laboratory will include analog and digital electronics, computers, computer
interfacing devices and software. Topics taught in the laboratory include: a)
hardware and software interfacing techniques, b) methods of computer based
automation, measurement, data acquisition, experiment control, and data
analysis. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match
for the NSF award.
