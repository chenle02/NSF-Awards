Conversational interviewers--survey interviewers who depart from strictly
standardized methods by explaining critical survey concepts to respondents--can
sometimes improve response accuracy in fact-based surveys. Using experimental
methods, the current research examines in more detail how different kinds of
conversational interviewing affect response accuracy, defined as the fit between
respondents' answers and the official definitions of key concepts in the
questions. The aims include understanding the cues that interviewers consider as
they judge whether respondents need help interpreting questions, and
understanding how and when respondents know that they don't know how to answer
survey questions. This project contributes to several practical goals. Knowing
more about how different kinds of interviewer deviations from the survey script
affect response accuracy can help survey researchers choose interviewing
techniques most appropriate for their research goals and cost constraints; that
is, any gains in accuracy from conversational interviewing may not be worth the
additional expense. Knowing more about what leads respondents to ask
interviewers for help interpreting questions, when respondents display other
kinds of uncertainty, and how this uncertainty is displayed is essential for
training conversational interviewers. The results can inform current face-to-
face and telephone survey interviews, as well as potential computer-based survey
systems, both textual and spoken.
