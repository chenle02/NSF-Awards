Students study a single model system, the enteric nervous system of the guinea
pig, in order to learn how to address a research problem at multiple levels.
Techniques utilized include: (1) bioassays to determine the effects of
neurochemicals, (2) immunohistochemical localization of endogenous
neurochemicals, and (3) determination of the distribution of neurochemical
receptor binding sites. Equipment includes a tissue bath with an interface
system for computerized data capture of bioassay data; and epifluorescent
microscopes (equipped with a brightfield cube and a darkfield condenser) for
localization of neuropeptides. Students design and perform an original research
project and present their results in the form of a scientific manuscript.
