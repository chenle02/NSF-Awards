Few contemporary issues are as threatening of the domestic order and stability
of the United States as that of the race relations. As a consequence, Political
Scientists have invested heavily in research on the nature, dynamics and
determinants of racial attitudes in America. To date, however, virtually all of
this research has focussed on the attitudes of white Americans. Very little
attention has been given to the racial attitudes of blacks. This research
replicates a major 1968 survey of racial attitudes in the racially diverse
Detroit metropolitan area in order to develop longitudinal data on the changing
racial attitudes of both white and especially black Americans. Specifically,
this research will use data on racial attitudes over the past quarter century to
test an enhanced theoretical model of black racial attitudes, develop a more
comprehensive understanding of black's perceptions of racial discrimination, and
examine the nature, extend, and causes of these attitudes over time. Examination
of white racial attitudes in the same community will serve as a valuable point
of comparison. When completed this ambitious project should greatly increase our
understanding of the nature and direction of race relations in the United States
and provide a better foundation with which to address any remaining obstacles to
the improvement of these relations.
