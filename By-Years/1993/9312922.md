9312922 Mayne The research addresses the problem of obtaining nonlinear
controllers for the control of linear and nonlinear systems subject to control
and state constraints. There will be two prongs to this research, both employing
optimization. The first will be concerned with online optimization and will
build on our existing results on receding horizon (model predictive) control in
which we have overcome many of the obstacles impeding its use for the control of
nonlinear systems; our research will endeavor to remove the remaining
restrictions,. to improve the observer- based controller, and to develop an
adaptive version of the receding horizon controller. The second prong will be
directed to the development of novel, nonlinear controllers, designed using,
extensive off-line optimization, for controlling constrained dynamic systems,
both linear and nonlinear. This research constitutes a new approach to an
important, but difficult area, and it motivated by the results we have obtained
in receding horizon control. A beneficial side effect of success in this area
would be the provision of initial feasible controls (i.e., controls which
satisfy the control and state constraints) for receding horizon control, thus
mitigating one of the most difficult problems arising when this type of control
is employed to control constrained nonlinear systems. ****
