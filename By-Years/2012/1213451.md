The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professors Peggy A. O'Day
from the University of California- Merced, Karl T. Mueller from Pennsylvania
State University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and James D. Kubicki
of Pennsylvania State University who will perform collaborative research that
will investigate reactive surfaces of environmental solids and their dynamic
nature. Competitive adsorption, kinetics, and aging in aqueous systems of
divalent cations sorbed to oxide and clay mineral surfaces will be examined
through the development of novel, site-specific probe molecule(s) using solid-
state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in conjunction with
complementary spectroscopic/microscopic characterizations and computational
chemistry. This research will address fundamental, long-standing questions about
active, molecular binding sites at surfaces of environmental solids and their
dynamic nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate scaling of mineral surface
reactivity is broadly applicable and essential to a number of important
applications of societal relevance. Potential broader impacts include, for
example, assessing risks associated with environmental contaminants such as
surface and subsurface migration or natural attenuation of metal, radionuclide,
and organic contaminants; quantifying processes such as nutrient input of P, N,
and Fe sorbed on mineral particles into lakes or the oceans; and estimating the
extent of CO2 reaction and sequestration by minerals in subsurface injection.
This research program will train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in
interdisciplinary chemical environmental sciences involving multiple and
iterative spectroscopic characterization methods and quantitative computational
approaches.
