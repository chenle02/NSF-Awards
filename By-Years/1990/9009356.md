An experimental study will be conducted, under a Research Initiation Award, of
supersonic flow with shock waves interacting with frictional boundary layers. A
novel focused Schlieren technique will be used to form holograms of the three-
dimensional density gradients in the flow field. The technique, if successful,
could be implemented in conventional high speed windtunnels, and thus perhaps
gain widespread usage in the future in the diagnosis of three-dimensional
supersonic flows.
