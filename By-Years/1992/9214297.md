The purpose of this award is to renovate Dabney Hall, the main facility of the
Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University. About two-thirds of
the project addresses the serious deficiencies in the ventilation system. The
remainder of the work includes renovations required to take advantage of the
improvements in ventilation and to bring the building up to modern code
specifications and improve communications. Fifteen new chemical fume hoods will
be added. More space for proper chemical storage will be made available and
research space, electric power, and safety showers will be modernized. Finally,
a modernized telephone and computer communications system also will be added to
bring Dabney Hall into the 1990s. This modernization project should strengthen
the accreditation credentials of this historically excellent chemistry
department.
