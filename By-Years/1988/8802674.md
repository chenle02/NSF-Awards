This research is about questions of stability in geometric inequalities for
convex bodies. Progress has recently been made by others in this area and three
problems which arise in this context will be studied. The in- and circumradius
of convex sets appear in the inequalities which establish stability or in their
proofs, and additional work on inequalities of this type may lead to the
resolution of a conjecture which originated in algebraic geometry. Bonnesen-
style inequalities are involved in some cases and the investigator has studied
these extensively.
