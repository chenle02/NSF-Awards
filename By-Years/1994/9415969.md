9415969 Salinas This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Norberto Salinas of
the University of Kansas who is organizing jointly with Prof. E. Ramirez de
Arellano of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), a research
workshop on operator theory and complex and hypercomplex analysis. The purpose
of this workshop is to bring together experts from operator theory as well as
experts from complex and hyper-complex analysis to discuss work combining ideas
from the theory of Lie groups, non-commutative harmonic analysis, simplectic
geometry, the theory of pseudodifferential operators, and partial differential
operators with applications to complex analysis. The meeting will provide a
unique opportunity to promote research collaboration and interaction among the
participants. ***
