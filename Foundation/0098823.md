Massachusetts Institute of Technology TITLE: GREATER BOSTON LOGIC CONFERENCE NSF
RECEIVED DATE: 9-26-2000 12:00 am SUMMARY: For over twenty years the Greater
Boston Logic meeting has met every odd-numbered year at MIT. Each Meeting is a
chance for young mathematical logicians, graduate students, and post-docs to
hear about and to discuss current work in mathmetical logic. The National
Science foundation has provided critical support for this effort for at least
twelve years.

In addition to invited talks by senior logicians, a large number of short
contributed talks is given by younger logicians. Space and time are set aside
for informal discussions. Women and minorities are invited to participate.
Approximately 100 people are expected to attend the meeting.
