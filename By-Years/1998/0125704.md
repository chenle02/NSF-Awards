This project focuses on new approaches to maximizing power consumption in
handheld and other wireless devices by combining a network-centric view of the
power-consumption issue (aximizing longevity for the network rather than device
by devic) with the more traditional device-centric view (power management
capabilities for the individual device). The project will model and evaluate new
architectures and algorithms that allow the operating system to accept input
from the applications and interact closely with the network for minimizing
overall energy in the wireless system. The focus of the research is:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) power-management of individual nodes &lt;br/&gt;2)
power-aware routing, in the sense that the power is minimized for the overall
network and not only for individual messages or streams. &lt;br/&gt;3) a
combination of the variable voltage scheduling with the power-aware routing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that through algorithm development and
analysis, simulation and testbed implementations, the results of this project
will lead to a better understanding of how to provide more efficient power
management to nodes with rechargeable batteries, and how to integrate CPU and
network power management under one paradigm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
