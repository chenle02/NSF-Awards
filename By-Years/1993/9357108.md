9357108 Forbes This NSF Young Investigator Award from the Organic Dynamics
Program supports the work of Professor Forbes at the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill on biradical systems in an array of chemical systems. The
specific areas are: (a) studies of exchange couplings in novel semi- flexible
organic biradicals by exploring the effects of unsaturation, spacers,
temperature, and solvents with the objective to evaluate the through-bond and
through-space mechanisms; (b) studies on diffusion of organic reactive
intermediates on solid surfaces using ultra fast time-resolved EPR spectroscopy
with emphasis on determining the influence of solvents; (c) studies using
biradicals as probes of polymer chain dynamics and photodegradation including
the use of supercritical fluids; (d) synthesis of bi- and tricyclic ketones
using olefin methathesis; and (e) improving the multiple frequency time-resolved
EPR spectroscopy methodology. %%% With this NYI award Professor Malcolm Forbes
will conduct studies of organic biradicals in a variety of systems that range
from the synthesis of polycyclic ketones to olefin methathesis and anionic
polymerization. The research is largely aimed at determining how the different
parts of molecular systems communicate with each other electronically and how
external factors such as solvents, temperature, and spacers influence the
diffusion, dynamics, and exchange couplings. The work will include diffusion
studies on the solvent/solid interface and studies on photodegradable polymers.
