Despite the availability of baby monitors, parents continue to check on their
baby at regular intervals. Conventional video or audio based baby monitors are
not able to detect vitals or identify if the baby is unwell. Parents like
existing video based monitors to confirm that the baby is safe and well when
awake, but the lack of body movement while the baby is sleeping leads to anxiety
and repeated check on the baby. This problem recently led to the development of
wearable baby monitors that can detect vitals. However, wearables are perceived
detrimental to the baby's health due to radio frequency effects and possible
skin allergies. The technology developed by this team involves integration of
software and hardware enabling concurrent non-contact measurement of heart and
respiratory rate, and temperature from a single device, day and
night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team will build a portable non-contact
device to detect vital signs and eliminate the need for hardware to be attached
or in extremely close proximity to the baby. The proposed solution is Cocoon
Cam, a wearless network-connected system that consists of hardware and software
sensors and provides video, audio, and vitals on a dashboard to check on those
at day or night. Parents can view the dashboard on a smartphone and set
personalized alerts for any of the monitored features. Parents perceive that a
dependable device that could help monitor vitals is beneficial and gives peace
of mind that their babies are healthy and comfortable.
