Noori Higgins Laboratory, a multidisciplinary research facility, on the campus
of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), is home to the Department of
Mechanical Engineering. Constructed in 1941, the building has never been
renovated or upgraded substantially. The research activities presently conducted
are in the areas of controls and vibrations, fluid dynamics, biomechanics and
biofluids, laser holography and metrology, and combustion. Though organized
around the traditional disciplines of mechanical engineering, the research
conducted addresses emerging area of Critical Technologies, such as
Manufacturing, Biomechanics and Thermal Science. Although WPI has an ongoing
engineering effort, critical infrastructural deficiencies exit which impinge on
the research that is conducted in the facility. This award will provide funding
for the renovation of research space for the lower level of the Higgins
Laboratory Building. Existing laboratories lack proper and adequate air quality
control, electrical power, accessibility, and waste management. Space will be
upgraded to consolidate research activities that are currently scattered in
small, outdated and compartmentalized facilities. By organizing the available
space to encourage exchange, the improvements will facilitate interdisciplinary
efforts between all groups. The renovated facility will provide ample space to
meet the requirements of the growing numbers of students in the Mechanical
Engineering Program at WPI. These trained students, a high percentage of whom
are U.S. citizens, will significantly contribute to the Nation's intellectual
capital in several Critical Technology areas.
