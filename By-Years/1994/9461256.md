This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will show that adaptive
optics can make a major contribution to ground based optical and infrared
astronomy by making it affordable. Astronomers have been increasing the size of
telescopes for years in an effort to increase both resolution and light
collection capabilities. This approach is limited due to Earth's atmosphere
degrading the image at seeing time. As apertures increase larger than the seeing
cells in the atmosphere, improved resolution is lost. Adaptive optics can remove
most of the degradation. AO systems developed for military applications are not
practical for astronomical use due to high cost and brightness of the reference
object needed. One key component to any AO system is the deformable mirror which
can remove atmospheric wavefront errors. Military contractors sell deformable
mirrors at costs over $100,000. Valpey-Fisher Corporation believes these mirrors
made in bimorph form can be produced for under $10,000. They will work in
collaboration with J. Elon Graves and his adaptive optics group at the
University of Hawaii. Their experience in machining and polishing PZT materials
will allow them to produce these mirrors.
