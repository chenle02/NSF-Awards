EDGE is a proposed project to obtain deep seismic reflection data on the
submerged part of the continental lithosphere. Four marine deep seismic
reflection transects on the U.S. margins are proposed. This award will support
the first two profiles. A unique feature of the project is that it will use
commercially available multichannel seismic reflection acquisition capability,
acquired on "ships of opportunity" to minimize obilization/ demobilization
costs. Year 1 is expected to be devoted primarily to data acquisition in the
Cook Inlet region of the Gulf of Alaska and offshore Chesapeake Bay. Year 2 will
be devoted to data processing, analysis, and preparation of initial reports.
Significant cost sharing for the Chesapeake Bay profile is being provided by
Texaco.
