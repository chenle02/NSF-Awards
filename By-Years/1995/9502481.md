Abstract Parker CO Schl/Mines CTS-9502481 Dr. Parker is an experienced
researcher and has proposed a difficult and innovative research plan in the area
of spray droplet combustion under high pressure conditions which makes use of
picosecond laser diagnostics in the infrared. The problem is important and the
nominee has the experience to be successful. His teaching plan which includes
curriculum development and undergraduate research appears to be realistic and
innovative. His proposal was well thought out and very well written.
