This project examines the growing importance of finance in the American economy
and its relationship to state policy. It defines financialization as the phase
of capitalist development in which accumulation occurs largely through financial
channels in the investment, insurance, and real estate sectors. Such growth of
the finance sector replaces traditional channels of accumulation through trade
and commodity production. The investigator suggests that the growth began with
the crisis of Keynesianism in 1968 and continued into the decade of the 1970s.
To evaluate this argument, the project uses data from national income accounts,
financial newspapers, federal reserve documents, congressional records, and
interviews with policy makers to answer three questions: 1) To what extent is
financialization occurring in the American economy in the post-1970 period? 2)
What configuration of political forces within the state promoted the turn to
finance? 3) How has financialization altered patterns of state intervention in
economy?
