This proprosal is funded under the Research Initiation Awards (RIA) Program
Announcement, NSF 88-99. Current computational environments for scientists
suffer from various deficiencies. They are generally non-interactive and
difficult to program. The provide little in the way of direct manipulation
interfaces, domain-specific constructs or facilities for symbolic (non-
numerical) programming. This work will build a suite of programmable
applications for computational physics in three domains: oscillators, difusion-
limited aggregation, and chemical kinetics. These applications will be designed
to maximize expressiveness. The will have interactive, learnable interfaces and
a domain-enriched dialect of Scheme to provide programmability. This will
provide a prowerful and expressive computational media for scientists. The
experience will be articulated in termas of broad, practical guidelines for
programmable application design. //
