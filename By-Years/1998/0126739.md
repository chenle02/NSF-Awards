This CCLI-EMD Proof-of-concept has as its primary goal the integration of
haptics technology into required undergraduate engineering courses to improve
learning and teaching in the engineering program at the Ohio University. Haptics
indicates force and touch feedback to the human from a computer. Commercially
available haptic interfaces can greatly augment education: " feeling is
believing". Teaching and learning can be more compelling, fun, and engaging with
better student retention via the integration of haptics technology.
Specifically, we are developing haptics-augmented software activities and
Internet-based tutorials, and integrating these tools into undergraduate
engineering physics and statics/dynamics courses. The PI has delivered similar
products in the K-12 arena, sponsored by NASA.

Though this proof-of-concept haptics technology development and evaluation is
taking place at Ohio University, we have a nationwide focus with a goal of
systematic changing the nation's undergraduate engineering programs via
integrated haptics technology and curriculum. The College of Engineering
personnel are performing the haptics technology, software, and tutorial
development. The College of Education personnel are leading the integration of
the resulting technology into the undergraduate engineering curriculum, the
transfer of project results to K-12 science and technology teacher preparation,
and the project evaluation efforts at Ohio University.

The deliverables for this project include prototype haptics-augmented PC
software learning activities, HTML-based tutorials, and integrated curriculum
for physics and statics/dynamics courses. Pilot tests on each of these courses
will be conducted to evaluate project results. The dissemination of the results
of this project will consist of conference papers and a journal article. Also,
we will study the potential of commercially disseminating the products of the
project nationwide. We will submit a full development proposal to NSF CCLI-EMD
at the project conclusion.
