The principal investigator will conduct research in three areas of the theory
of stochastic processes. Two areas have to do with large deviation theory. The
first concerns proving the fundamental large deviation principle for Markov
stochastic processes with "discontinuous statistics", a class that includes
diffusions with discontinuous drift and small diffusion coefficient as well as
certain scaled queueing systems. The second area involves numerical and
simulation methods. The third area of study is concerned with developing the
theory and applications of the solution to the Skorokhod Problem, which is a
basic and useful tool in the study of various "constrained" stochastic
processes. The principal investigator will study several areas of the theory of
stochastic (random) processes. One of the areas involves proving the fundamental
large deviation principle for Markov stochastic processes with "discontinuous
statistics". This class of stochastic processes is important in certain
applications of stochastic control.
