Two theoretical investigations are planned. Both are concerned with
experimental findings on exotic atoms. One is an attempt to account for
regularities in exotic atom formation believed to be related to shell structure.
This investigation, which should be relevant not only to existing experimental
results but also to results coming from LEAR, will employ, at least initially, a
simplified adaptation of a procedure due to Born and Flock for dealing with
nearly adiabatic processes. The negative meson will be treated as a classical
particle moving in a realistic potential due to the capturing atom, while the
electrons will be described by wave functions that take into account shell
structure. The other investigation is concerned with three body association
reactions, especially the one believed to complicate attempts to measure the
Lamb shift in muonic helium. Although the immediate goal is to achieve a
thorough understanding of an especially simple reaction--the one that occurs
when a positive helium ion forms a diatomic molecule in helium gas and which has
been studied for decades-- it is intended ultimately to compute the rate
coefficient for a similar reaction involving a muonic helium ion that has
recently been investigated experimentally at SIN.
