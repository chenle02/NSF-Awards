9500441 Hennage This proposal is a request for support for the Integrated
Photonics Topical Group of the Optical Society to be held 23-25 Feb. 1995 at
Dana Point, CA. NSF funds for the conference will concentrate on support of
students and education. A report by the students will be included in the final
report. Research topic areas include: 1. Active Semiconductor Devices. 2.
Waveguide and Waveguide Devices. 3. Modeling, Numerical Simulation, and Theory.
4. Photonic Component Manufacturing Technology. Some of the specific invited
papers are: "Phased Array WDM Devices on InP", by Bart H. Verbeek, Philips
Research Labs., The Netherlands; "High Speed Modulation and Short Pulse
Generation Using MQW Modulators and Their Integrated Light Sources", by Koichi
Wakita, NTT Optoelectronics Laboratories, Japan; "Long Wavelength Vertical
Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers", by John Bowers, University of California, Santa
Barbara; "Modeling high speed dynamics in semiconductor lasers", by R.
Nagarajan, University of California- Santa Barbara; "Overview of quantum wires
for optical devices", by Joel Schulman, Hughes Research Laboratories; "Design
