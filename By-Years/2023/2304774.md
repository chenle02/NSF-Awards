The interplay between algebra and geometry is one of the classical themes in
mathematics. Traditionally, one studies geometric objects via their symmetries.
In geometric group theory the situation is reversed: one starts with a group of
symmetries of an algebraic object (for example, another group) and constructs a
geometric object with the same symmetries. Here the focus is on the study of
symmetries of surfaces. Surprisingly, its geometry is to a large degree governed
by hyperbolic geometry that goes back to Gauss, Lobacevski, Poincare and others.
The goal is to better understand this phenomenon. The proposer's PhD students
and postdoctoral researchers are also involved in parts of this investigation.

The most important result about the dynamics of classical mapping classes is the
Nielsen-Thurston classification, which explains the behavior of iterates of
simple closed curves. The same goal in the case of surfaces of infinite type
looks to be much harder, but certainly worthy of a systematic study. The family
of groups of proper homotopy equivalences of a locally finite graph is a sister
family to the family of big mapping class groups, with many similarities and
intriguing differences that the investigator wants to explore. More classically,
the investigator wants to build ``towers'' of successive approximations to the
classical mapping class group complexes, as well as complexes associated to
automorphism groups of free groups, much like the Taylor series. The process of
building these towers is called ``disintegration'' and preliminary work shows
that it succeeds for the arc and curve complexes and sheds new light on their
large-scale geometry. This is yet another attempt to establish that the
complexes associated with automorphism groups of free groups have finite
asymptotic dimension, perhaps the main outstanding open question about the
large-scale geometry of this group. The questions about ergodic measures could
have been asked many years ago, but new methods are needed to answer them.
