The project is concerned with a new and promising route to the synthesis of
films and coatings of high Tc oxide superconductors, which utilizes a polymer
precursor as a coating medium. It is an extremely flexible coating process
ultimately adaptable to a broad range of applications, including continuous wire
and ribbon transport media. Initial results in the La2-xSrxCuO4 and YBa2CU3O7-x
systems indicate that superior microstructures are possible by this technique
including fully dense, controlled-grain size films. With proper substrates,
controlled-texture films and coating may be achievable. The research will
characterize the interrelationship between processing parameters, microstructure
obtained, and the superconducting properties of YBa2CU3O7-x coatings synthesized
on a variety of ceramic and metallic substrates. The influence of positive and
negative properties will be examined. Electron microscope techniques (TEM, STEM)
will be used for microstructural and microchemical characterization.
Measurements of critical temperature, current, field and their strain tolerance
will be conducted on the coatings.
