Efficient algorithms are fundamental to various areas in computer science. This
project will study new techniques for designing efficient algorithms for hard
combinatorial problems. The interaction between theoretical analysis and
practical implementations of such hard problems will be explored. Furthermore,
this project will advance the study of algorithms and systems in a minority-
serving institution where under-represented students will gain valuable
experience in foundational cutting-edge research. More precisely, this project
will investigate novel measures for some classical and important NP-hard
problems, algebraic techniques for designing exact and parameterized algorithms,
and parallel/distributed implementations of exact and parameterized algorithms.
The first part is devoted to studying the effects of new measures on designing
algorithms for well-known NP-hard problems such as the Boolean Satisfiability
Problem. The second part is focused on expanding the power of algebraic
techniques to those seemingly difficult problems involving vertex deletion. The
last part is to devise a clever way to implement resulting algorithms on a
parallel/multi-core machines.
