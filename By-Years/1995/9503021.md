9503021 Alexander This research will be undertaken as part of the CRISP
(Combined Research Industry Scholarship Project) under the 1994-95 GOALI (Grants
Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry) initiatives. The aim of the
GOALI initiatives was to provide some mechanism to encourage and promote
industry-university partnerships to work on research problems of interests to
industry. It is believed that such partnerships can grow and lead to other
meaningful joint industry-university research projects that can be of benefit to
both industry and academia. The industrial partner for this research is Liqui-
Dri Foods, a Division of Quaker Corporation. The objective of the research is to
reduce process variability with an emphasis on improving the control systems of
fill process lines at Liqui-Dri/Quaker. The control systems were designed to
keep four filling lines at Liqui-Dri/Quaker on target. However, the workers tend
to shut off these control systems because they feel the control systems are slow
to react. This study is aimed at integrating monitoring systems with the
automatic control systems in order to detect the changes in the underlying
process models used by the control systems to predict system state. In the
research, a diagnostic module will be used to determine the form of the
disturbances and probable causes of system instability. The design and use of
fuzzy controllers for controlling the process will also be investigated. Due to
its applied nature, the participants on this project stand to draw some
significant benefits from it. For the industrial partner, control of process
variability will translate to enhanced product quality and reduced losses due to
potential overfill. The reliability of the system will be enhanced. From the
academic points of view, the researchers will gain some practical experiences on
a real industrial problem. However, on a more general perspective, outcome of
this research can be applied to a host of industrial problems where close m
itering and monitoring are critical to line reliability and functionality.
