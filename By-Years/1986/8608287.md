The ability to manipulate the output of a semiconductor laser at a very high
rate is necessary if optical communication and signal processing applications
are to achieve full potential. This effort will investigate these and other
fundamental problems in this area. In addition, the trade-offs between speed and
pulse spreading factors has been carefully considered.
