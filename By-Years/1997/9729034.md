9729034 Kelts This award provides fifty percent partial funding support for the
Limnological Research Center's lake core acquisition, storage and analysis
facility located on the University of Minnesota- Minneapolis campus. The
remaining support necessary to operate the facility is to be provided by the
University of Minnesota. The core laboratory is a multi-user facility that
provides the limnological research community equipment and infrastructure for
collecting and analyzing lake sediment cores from a variety of lake
environments. The study of lake sediment cores contributes directly to the
analysis of past climate variations, and by making available coring equipment,
core storage, and instrumentation for analysis, the core laboratory of the
Limnological Research Center is contributing to the U.S. research effort in
Global Change. ***
