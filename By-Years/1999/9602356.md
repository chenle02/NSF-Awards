Modular Approach to Biotechnology Laboratory Instruction Based on a Novel Green-
Fluorescent Protein This project is developing laboratory modules in
biotechnology for secondary school and undergraduate level students and their
teachers, based on a unique protein, the green-fluorescent protein (GFP), which
serves as an easily visualized reporter for gene expression and all steps in
protein purification. Detection requires only a long-wave UV lamp, making the
system adaptable to low-budget curricula. Because the protein is so easily
visualized, it enhances the students' understanding of molecular biology and
biochemistry making each step in the laboratory exercise an exciting experience.
Initial concepts for GFP-based laboratory modules were developed at Rutgers in
1989 and have been successfully "field tested" for five years. Nine other
institutions including one other major research university, one four-year
college, two county colleges, three high schools, one major biochemical supply
corporation, and one national laboratory are joining Rutgers in an informal
consortium to advance the GFP-based laboratory module concept. Originally
isolated from a bioluminescent jellyfish. GFP can now be cloned into other
organisms. Thus. the gene and its protein are available for widespread use. The
project is developing GFP-based laboratory modules geared for the advanced
secondary school and junior college levels. The modular "kit" approach to
teaching biotechnology techniques allows both protein purification and
recombinant DNA techniques to be transferred to all appropriate settings with
only minor modifications. This GFP-based modular approach provides major changes
in the way technicians are trained and can be projected on a national scale to
be widely applied in the biotechnology community.
