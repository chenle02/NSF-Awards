0426170&lt;br/&gt;Grimes&lt;br/&gt;This research is specifically aimed at
developing a highly sensitive, specific ricin sensor platform which, with the
intellectual foundation in place, can be readily extended to enable simultaneous
identification of multiple biotoxins or pathogens in aqueous media (e.g. water,
blood, serum). Also, the sensor platform is designed to be of relatively low
cost enabling practical implementation of the resulting sensor technology. The
fundamental and critical questions to be answered by this research are, can mass
sensitive magnetoelastic sensors be modified to permit the quantification of
protein biotoxins, and can these devices be packaged into a small hand-held
sensor to aid in the rapid quantification of ricin concentrations? To answer
these questions the following specific aims are proposed: (1) investigate, on a
fundamental level, the binding of the ricin biotoxin to polymer thin films
modified with biorecognition molecules (antibodies or GSLs). In preliminary work
the investigators have accomplished this for both ricin and E. coli O157:H7.
Here they will identify antibodies or GSLs which the model biotoxin (ricin) will
bind, then immobilize these recognition molecules on the surface of
poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels or self-assembled monolayers, and study the
binding of the model biotoxins to these modified surfaces, (2) develop
techniques for patterning these biomolecule-modified polymer gels on
magnetoelastic substrates and study the changes in resonance frequency induced
in the magnetoelastic material by binding of the model toxins onto the sensor
surface, and (3) integrate the recognition molecule-modified magnetoelastic
sensors and appropriate electronics into a hand-held device that can be readily
used to monitor biotoxin content in collected fluid samples within a disposable
cartridge. While efforts in this proposal are strictly focused on ricin, the
resulting sensor technology could be adaptable to other toxins.
