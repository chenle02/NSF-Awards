This work is to improve our understanding of the role of marine snow in the
(oligotrophic) North Pacific Central Gyre where data regarding such questions is
especially lacking. Souba samplings of seawater at station ALOHA will be
evaluated from the perspective of the aggregation process itself: marine snow
composition, abundance, size and structure. Macro-aggregation rates and marine
snow residence times will be independently estimated using 234Th:238U
disequilibria techniques. Analysis of data will be constrained by high quality
biological, chemical and physical water column data.
