This proposal is a request for support of an MRS conference on "Materials
Interactions Relevant to the Pulp, Paper and Wood Industries". The conference
will include papers on structural relationships and component properties of wood
and wood-based composites, fiber-fiber and fiber-matrix interfaces, cellulose
fiber composites and properties of ligno-cellulosic material surfaces.
