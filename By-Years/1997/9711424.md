9711424 Channell No geomagnetic paleointensity records are available for the
high latitude Southern Hemisphere. The study is aimed at developing such a
record from the upper Quaternary piston cores collected by R/V Thompson in 1996
during an ODP site survey cruise. The record will be useful for independent
intra-hemispheric correlations to tie the North Atlantic records with Antarctic
and Greenland ice core records. Environmentally biased stratigraphies, such as
stable isotopes, can not provide such independent correlative tool for
millennial scale climatic interpretations.
