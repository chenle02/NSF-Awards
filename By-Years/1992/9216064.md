A set of existing informal arrangements for providing assistance in setting up
new computer networks in under-networked areas and linking them to the U.S. will
be enhanced and focused on the particular needs of U.S. scientists traveling to
or developing collaborations with such areas. The resource center will provide
installation tool kits for network software, together with documentation, advice
and information about possible linkages to existing networks and facilities. It
will provide a catalyst and focal point for making textbooks and surplus
hardware available to critical individuals and hub facilities from which
national and regional network spines might be expected to evolve. The primary
focus will be on proven, time-tested and reliable technology in all areas, with
the objective of serving users who are not computer experts. By building on
existing support networks of people and facilities, the center will accomplish a
high leveraging of NSF funds.
