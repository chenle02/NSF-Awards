The 41st Annual Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference (STDC) will be hosted by
the Mathematics and Statistics Department of the University of Missouri-Rolla
(UMR), March 29-31, 2007. This will be the first time the conference has been
held in the American Midwest. Leading researchers, both nationally and
internationally, will be invited to present their latest research results in
either 50 minute plenary or 25 minute semi-plenary talks. Conference steering
committees are charged with inviting not only established researchers in the
various subfields of Topology and Topological Dynamical Systems but also
emerging young mathematicians with particular attention to underrepresented
minorities and female members of the community. In addition to the invited
speakers there will be four parallel session for contributed papers in the areas
of Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General and Set-Theoretic Topology, and
Geometric and Geometric Group Theory. Approximately 200 participants are
expected to attend.

Ideas and concepts of topology and dynamical systems are ubiquitous in not only
modern mathematics but also increasingly in many other fields. To cite just two
examples, topoisomerases in molecular biology are so named because they change
the topological structure of biologically active macromolecules, and chaotic
attractors, which are a focus of study in dynamical systems, find applications
in such areas as ecosystem analysis and weather prediction. The UMR hosted
forty-first meeting of the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference will help
propel research in Topology and Dynamical Systems into the coming years with
renewed vigor helping to make certain the mathematical and scientific knowledge
is available to solve problems facing the nation and the world.
