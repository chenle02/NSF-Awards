Thermal manufacturing processes represent a multi-disciplinary field
incorporating the application of thermal, fluid, and material sciences, as well
as systems design and control theory. Most thermal manufacturing processes have
the following characteristics in common: high temperature, luminous, and thermal
distortion. The extreme luminosity of the heat source in these processes often
inhibits the thermal or geometrical process parameters from being monitored.
This award is to acquire instrumentation for the establishment of a Thermal
Manufacturing Processes Laboratory to support teaching and research activities
in the area of machine vision systems for welding, rapid prototyping, and feud
deposition modeling. The research project has a balance between theory and
experiment, and will provide valuable mechanism to support both teaching and
research activities.
