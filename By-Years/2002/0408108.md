The striking abundance of bacteriophage (viruses that infect
&lt;br/&gt;bacteria) in the environment has prompted many questions about their
&lt;br/&gt;ecological and evolutionary roles in nature. Bacteriophage often
&lt;br/&gt;kill their bacterial hosts and such viral-caused mortality has been
&lt;br/&gt;shown to have important consequences for nutrient cycling and the
&lt;br/&gt;maintenance of biological diversity. This project will characterize
&lt;br/&gt;the interactions between bacteria that consume nitrate (denitrifying
&lt;br/&gt;bacteria) and the bacteriophage that infect these bacteria.
&lt;br/&gt;Denitrification is an important process in many natural environments,
&lt;br/&gt;as well as in engineered environments such as wastewater treatment
&lt;br/&gt;plants. However, the role of phage in these communities remains
&lt;br/&gt;poorly understood. We will determine 1) whether the interactions
&lt;br/&gt;between phage and bacteria in this system can be predicted from
&lt;br/&gt;earlier studies of much simpler microbial model communities, and 2)
&lt;br/&gt;how interactions between phage and bacteria affect the efficiency and
&lt;br/&gt;stability of the denitrification process. Improved understanding of
&lt;br/&gt;this denitrifying community will lead to improved functional
&lt;br/&gt;performance in engineered environments, as well as a better
&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the factors influencing the function of natural
&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;
