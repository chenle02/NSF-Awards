9530299 Perfit The Juan de Fuca Ridge has been the site of an extensive study of
volcanology and hydrothermal activity. The segment that appears to be most
volcanically active (known as the Coaxial segment) has had two eruptions since
1981. The PI has been involved in the collection of basalts from this ridge for
several years and wishes to analyze these rocks to investigate the compositions
of the lavas and how they change with time. This work would be synthesized into
a map that contained the data from the rocks, the hydrothermal vents, and
photos.
