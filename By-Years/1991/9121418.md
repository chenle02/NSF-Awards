ABSTRACT The "Northern Caddoan Dictionaries Project" will compile reference
dictionaries of two closely related American Indian languages of the Caddoan
family, Arikara and Pawnee, which are spoken today by only a dozen elderly
tribal members in North Dakota and Oklahoma. The dictionaries, each to contain
approximately 8,000 entries, will draw upon all available lexical and textual
materials: data collected by the PI over the past twenty-five years; data
collected by anthropologists earlier in the century; and data in historical
sources. Three months of additional field work will fill in lacunae in the data
base. Although there is no dialectal diversity within Arikara today, there are
two dialects of Pawnee still spoken--South Band and Skiri-- and the Pawnee
dictionary will account for the differences between these two forms of speech.
The project, part of a larger effort to document Pawnee and Arikara as fully as
possible, will result in the first reference dictionaries ever compiled for
them. The dictionaries, moreover, will provide essential data for the
comparative study of the Caddoan language family and the interrelationships of
the Caddoan languages with other genetically related languages families in the
New World. They will also serve as reference tools for scholars and in language
classes in the Arikara and Pawnee communities.
