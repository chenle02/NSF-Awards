This project's goal is a more advanced understanding of the kinematic and
dynamic characteristics of the Cardan joint. This is a shaft coupling element
used extensively in manufacturing, agricultural, automotive, and other
machinery. The requirement for operating at higher speeds, under increased
loads, and with improved reliability suggests that more than prior experience
and proof-testing must be used in the design process.
