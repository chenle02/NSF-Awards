The research develops solutions to understand the influence of three dimensional
effects during dynamic fracture of materials and verifies the results. The
project develops a novel mathematical approach for three dimensional
elastodynamic crack problems and carries out computational work in which
numerical solutions will be sought to understand the fracture process. The
analytical and numerical phases of the project are closely related and will be
carried out in parallel. A verified three dimensional model is not currently
available to understand the dynamic fracture process of solids. The lack of such
a development inhibits a complete fundamental understanding of the various
phenomenological features of dynamic fracturing, that are observed in
experimental research and in engineering practice. A successful completion of
this research would result in major advances in the development of theory
governing the dynamics of crack propagation, and would provide realistic
descriptions of the fracture process.
