This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Identifying
rapidly changing genes and their impact on the speciation process in sunflowers
through genome level sequence comparisons." If speciation is caused by
adaptation to different environments, genes under strong selection for different
adaptations may also be speciation genes. This study uses comparative analyses
of genome sequences among sunflower species to identify genes on which natural
selection is strongest and then tests to see if these genes are involved in
speciation.
