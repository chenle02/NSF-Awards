Minerals of the apatite group are very important accessory minerals in all types
of rocks. As a major constituent of bones and teeth it is the object of much
research in the medical field, and is commercially exploited for a number of
important uses. The relative chemical and structural simplicity of apatite and
its occurrence in a very wide range of rock types make it potentially ideal as s
mineralogical "monitor" of the relative activities of fluorine, chlorine and
water in the environment in which it crystallized. It is proposed to calibrate
this "monitor" by determining the solid solution mixing behavior and by
evaluation of endmember thermodynamic properties with experiments at 0.5 Kb
pressure, and temperatures between 600o and 900oC. The information to be derived
from this study will have important applications in the study of igneous
processes and volcanic phenomena, formation of porphyry ore deposits, and
composition of metamorphic fluids. The fundamental thermodynamic data obtained
may potentially have applications in other sciences and chemical engineering.
