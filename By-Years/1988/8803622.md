This award will continue and expand a study of domain structure in
titanomagnetites utilizing the dried Bitter method and the scanning electron
microscope. A series of experiments are planned to investigate the effects of
various surface treatments and different magnetization states on domain
structure in magnetite and titanomagnetites. These experiments will include both
domain pattern observations and bulk magnetic property measurements.
