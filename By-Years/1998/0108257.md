0108257 Karim

This award is to support travel of Dr. Nazmul Karim and Dr. Ranil
Wickramasinghe, both in the Department of Chemical and Bioprocessing Engineering
at Colorado State University, to Bangladesh. They plan to meet with Dr. A.K.M.A.
Quader, Professor and Head, Department of Chemical Engineering at the Bangladesh
University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in Dhaka. They plan to develop a
research project for removing arsenic from drinking water wells. That project is
to be submitted later to NSF for funding. Their approach is to develop
engineering methods to rid contaminated water from its arsenic, utilizing
separation techniques currently being studied for other industrial applications.
