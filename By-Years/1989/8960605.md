Phase equilibria in the thallium superconducting system will be measured. The
goal is to understand the complex solid-liquid- vapor equilibria that govern
crystal growth of the thallium based family of superconductors. This study will
involve exposure of films and powder mixtures of known composition to controlled
overpressures of thallous oxide and oxygen vapor at high temperature (600 - 950
C) followed by quenching. The composition and microstructure of quenched samples
will be examined to identify the equilibrium high temperature phases. In this
manner the liquidus and solidus temperatures, equilibrium overpressures, and
stable phases will be determined in those regions of composition that are
important for thin film and crystal growth. Additional information on phase
changes will be gained by differential thermal analysis (DTA) using sealed gold
ampoules to control thallium volatility.
