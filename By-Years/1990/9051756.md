This project's main goal is to enhance the preparation of undergraduate science
majors by incorporating the use of 60-MH NMR into organic, physical, analytical
and research course laboratories. The new instrument has allowed a guided
systematic introduction of new experiments that illustrate the principles of NMR
theory. Students are provided with the theory and "hands-on" experience to
enable them to solve problems related to molecular structure. Undergraduate
science majors have been given experience in manipulation of chemical
substances, have been introduced to advanced, sophisticated techniques in
synthesis and analysis, and have been able to expand their intellectual ability
to deal with modern instrumental problems. The institution contributed to this
project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
