The major emphasis of the research on mixing shear flows will be on the
identification of mixing mechanisms for different Richardson-number regimes and
the effect of internal-wave radiation on the energetics of the mixing process.
The studies on mixing across diffusive interfaces surrounded by turbulent
convecting layers will be a combination of theory and experiment, and will focus
on the mechanisms responsible for determining the equilibrium interfacial-layer
thickness and the buoyancy transfer at low stabilities. It is expected that the
research on the formation of local mixed regions and their lateral spreading
will shed light on the appropriate scaling parameters for the vertical size of
turbulent patches and will provide understanding of their gravitational collapse
process that is responsible for the formation of microstructure in stratified
turbulent fluids.
