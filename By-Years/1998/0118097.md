This RUI project is devoted to studies concerning the implementation,
visualization, and analysis of Probabilistic Road Maps (PRMs). The PRM has been
actively studied in recent years, and is increasingly seen as an important, if
not the best, tool for certain robotic motion planning problems. New
probabilistic roadmap heuristics will be developed and experimentally verified.
To study the underlying problem and to verify developed strategies, supporting
visualization software will be developed. This work will provide a research
experience for up to nine undergrads at a place, which is primarily a teaching
university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
