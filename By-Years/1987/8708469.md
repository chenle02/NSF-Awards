Dr. Susan Leschine, of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, proposes a
study of a group of microorgnaisms new to science: cellulose degrading, nitrogen
fixing, and anaerobic bacteria. The ecology community is excited about their
discovery and possible roles in carbon cycling. Results of these studies will
contribute to our understanding of the phenotypic and genotypic diversity
present among anaerobic cellulolytic microorganisms, their quantitative
contribution to cellulose breakdown, and their numerical distribution in natural
environments. The possible role of physiological interactions with non-
cellulolytic microorganisms will also be investigated. These investigations are
intended to fill a gap in our understanding of the dynamics of carbon cycling in
natural environments. Moreover, the techniques devised to conduct this study
will be generally useful for identifying introduced (e.g., genetically
engineered) as well as indigenous microorganisms in diverse environments.
