The research area that this principal investigator (PI) will focus on during
his Presidential Young Investigator award is the control and management of
information flow in communication networks. The focus will be on overcoming the
bottlenecks of switching and network processing that result from using optical
transmission and electronic devices. Processing bottlenecks may arise in network
protocols. The PI plans to develop analysis techniques for evaluating
performance of higher level protocols using, for example, a non-statistical
approach to predict worst case performance. To address the switching bottleneck,
the PI plans to synthesize and investigate the performance of switching
architectures which utilize massively parallel processing and the benefits of
spatial statistical multiplexing and deflection routing.
