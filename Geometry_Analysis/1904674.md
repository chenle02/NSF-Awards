This project concerns the geometric calculus of variations, that is the study of
the properties of objects which are optimal in some sense for a geometric
functional. These variational problems arise in diverse areas of pure and
applied mathematics and also in many physical sciences. For example, minimal
surfaces arise as minima of the the area functional and provide a mathematical
model of soap films. This project focuses on a geometric functional called
entropy which has drawn a lot of recent interest as a natural measure of the
complexity of a surface. The main tool used to study this functional is the mean
curvature flow which is a dynamic process that, roughly speaking, continuously
deforms a surface in a manner that decreases its area as quickly as possible.
Mean curvature flow was first studied as a model of certain phenomena in
materials science and has also found applications in computer graphics and image
recognition. Furthermore, as a geometric heat flow, it is closely related to the
Ricci flow which was used by Perelman to solve the Poincare conjecture. The mean
curvature flow also has promising potential applications to topology - some of
which are explored by this project.



This project will use mean curvature flow to investigate hypersurfaces in
n-dimensional Euclidean space of low entropy, that is, hypersurfaces for which a
natural measure of geometric complexity, entropy, is small. The first goal is to
build on work of L. Wang and the PI and to better understand properties,
especially topological ones, of hypersurfaces of low entropy. This requires the
investigation of the structure of non-compact self-similar (both shrinking and
expanding) solutions to the mean curvature flow. The overarching objective is to
see if hypersurfaces of low entropy in Euclidean four-space must be smoothly
deformable to the unit sphere. This question is closely related to the smooth 4D
Schoenflies conjecture -- an important open problem in low-dimensional topology.
