9310009 Ellison This research consists of three projects which examine economic
systems in which a large population of economic agents try to learn from their
past experience. The first two projects concern agents who frequently interact
with others in strategic situations, and explore whether they come to play the
game by accumulating experience about how their opponents have played in the
past. The first project explores the plausibility of mixed strategy equilibria
where players are heterogeneous because of differing experience. The second
project explores a fundamental assumption of many models of learning, and argues
that because of the dynamics of the interactions, learning is more likely to
lead to some equilibrium outcomes than to others. The third project studies
agents choosing between competing technologies whose problem is a social one
only because they can gain information by looking at the choices of others. The
research focuses on the implications of very simple behavioral patterns in
models which may be applied to such problems as the choice of farming
technologies and the structure of labor contracts. ***
