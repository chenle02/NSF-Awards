This research is in the control of plasma instabilities and the study of
instability driven anomalous transport. Specifically, the multimode feedback
stabilization of plasma instabilities utilizing a new concept of 'normal mode
states' will be studied. A state feedback scheme in conjunction with either a
state reconstructor or a Kalman filter will be devised. A remote suppressor
appropriate for high temperature plasma will also be developed. Furthermore,
instability driven anomalous diffusion will be experimentally studied including
its relationship with instability parameters. The experimental work will utilize
the redesigned Columbia Linear Machine. This research effort is in the feedback
control of plasma instabilities and on the anomalous plasma transport induced by
them. Instabilities afflict all plasmas irrespective of the type of devices they
are part of and their intended applications. These include basic experimental
devices, plasma sources for neutral, electron and ion beams, plasma etching
devices for solid state fabrication and fusion machines. The instabilities cause
non-uniformities in plasma, increased transport and, if violent enough, can
cause macroscopic break up. The elimination of these instabilities is sometimes
necessary, but their suppression is always desirable for better performance. As
redesigning increasingly better equilibria has often failed to eliminate these
instabilities completely, feedback control appears to be a very attractive but
neglected area of researach.
