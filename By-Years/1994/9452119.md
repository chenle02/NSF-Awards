9452119 Cannon Mississippi College is upgrading and expanding the program in
biochemistry. This will include the addition of an ACS chemistry major with a
Biochemistry option. In order to accomplish this, a second semester of
biochemistry was added; molecular biology, medicinal chemistry or research will
be available as the advanced course. Biochemistry I Laboratory is being
completely reorganized to include more instrumentation and more modern
techniques. The addition of a preparative ultracentrifuge and an ultrasonic
processor will make possible a variety of experiments to Biochemistry, Molecular
Biology, Microbiology, and Immunology laboratories. Experiments have been
designed that involve both differential and gradient centrifugation.
Undergraduate research will be greatly enhanced due to the availability of a
wide range of projects made possible by this new facility. Such experience will
lay a better foundation for graduate school.
