Gateway Technical College (GTC) in conjunction with 2DX2 Geothermal Systems,
Inc. 2DX2, Alliant Energy, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources are
addressing the needs for qualified earth drillers with expertise in geoexchange
drilling techniques by 1) adapting a military water well drilling curriculum for
use in geothermal drilling courses; and 2) providing professional development
for GTC faculty that are teaching the curriculum. The drilling curriculum is
inherently interdisciplinary and requires an understanding of mathematics,
chemistry, geology and physics. The drilling curriculum adapted from the
military assumes expertise in heavy equipment operations and includes topics in
military operations, pumps and well development. These topics are being replaced
by units in safety, heavy equipment handling, maintenance and transport. Making
a drilling curriculum available at a public technical college allows
underrepresented groups to enter the field and GTC is attempting to recruit
unemployed, underemployed, and dislocated workers into this program. This
program also aims to help reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil by offering energy
efficient geothermal heat pumps as an alternative. Dissemination of the
curriculum is being done in coordination with several ATE Centers.
