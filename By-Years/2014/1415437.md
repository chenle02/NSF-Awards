Light sources are accelerators that circulate electrons around a storage ring,
producing very intense beams of photons in a range of useful wavelengths.
Photons are produced by synchrotron radiation, which is generated when electrons
experience acceleration due to a change in the direction of their trajectory. By
shining these photons on a sample to be studied, basic properties of these
sample materials can be inferred. Using radiation of different wavelength (e.g,
X-rays or ultraviolet) can help elucidate material properties at different
distance scales in the samples being studied. Light sources have many
applications, including in biology, physics, materials science, and national
security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to develop a new technique to
quickly change the direction, or undulate, electrons in a light source.
Typically light sources use static magnets that undulate electron beams to
generate radiation. However, with current technology it is difficult to obtain
short undulator periods needed for shorter radiation wavelengths and reduced
electron beam energy operation without compromising the overall beam quality. To
overcome these limitations, the PI will develop a novel short-period
electromagnetic undulator operating at millimeter-wave with a period of less
than 1 millimeter (mm). The scaling laws for this type of undulator predict an
aperture, typically, three times the undulator period. This represents a
paradigm shift for the design and implementation of undulators for light
sources. Because the surface field is very low at the walls of the Radio-
Frequency (RF) undulator, the field at the center of the undulator is predicted
to be much higher than anything possible with a static magnetic undulator. The
design goal is to have an approximately 5 Tesla field for an undulator that has
less than 1 mm period. This device will have the added benefit of fast dynamic
strength and polarization control of the produced
light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the training of PhD students
and post-doctoral scholars at Stanford University, engaging them in advanced
RF/microwave design algorithms and simulation tools. This project has the
potential to have a profound impact on many beam-based light sources. Dreams of
compact economical free electron lasers, which can be installed at many
universities and research institutions, will become closer to reality as RF
undulators become a common tool. This applies also to light sources developed
for a variety of medical and industrial applications as well as applications
related to national security.
