9304715 Serpa The deformation of continental crust along transform plate
boundaries involves the interaction of large-scale crustal fragments that my
rotate about both vertical and horizontal axes and are bounded by combinations
of strike- slip, normal and thrust fault domains. Models for these types of
interactions lead to significant space and time problems as the blocks interact,
particularly at the corners of blocks. This project will examine the sinistral
eastern Garlock-dextral southern Death Valley fault intersection from surface
structures and shallow seismic data. Increased knowledge on the 4-dimensional
behavior of this complex intersection are expected to develop the deformational
sequence experienced in this experienced in this example and to provide a guide
to extending this information to other, less well exposed, system elsewhere.
