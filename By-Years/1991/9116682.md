Research in a broad selection of topics in theoretical gravitation will be
continued at Washington University. Professor Suen will study various classical,
semi-classical and quantum systems in general relativity and cosmology. The
elasticity of a black hole horizon interacting with its environment will be
analysed. A study of the properties and the formation process of oscillating
soliton stars will be carried out. Gravitational collapses of quantum mechanical
systems will be studied using the semi-classical Einstein equation. Dr. Suen
will also study his recently proposed formulation of quantum cosmology, which
requires no ad hoc theory of initial conditions. Also of interest is the
probability of having the universe tunneling from one classical trajectory to
another in terms of the quantum cosmological wave function.
