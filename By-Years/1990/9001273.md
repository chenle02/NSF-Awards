This project is concerned with the representation theory of finite groups. The
principal investigator will examine the endomorphism rings of permutation
modules in characteristic p, Alperin's conjecture and related questions, and
central units of finite order in blocks of RG. The postdoctoral associate will
study modular Hecke algebras and quadratic G-modules in characteristic two. This
research is in the general area of the representation theory of finite groups.
One of the main applications of group theory to other mathematical and
scientific fields is in representation theory.
