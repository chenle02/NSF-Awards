This grant supports the participation of Dr. Hudson in the AIRS II project
(second Alliance Icing Research Study), a collaboration of American, Canadian,
and European agencies and institutions motivated by the practical problem of
aircraft icing. The AIRS field program is scheduled for the winter of 2003-04
and based at Mirabel Airport, north of Montreal, Canada, where a surface
observing network and ground-based remote-sensing equipment will be located. Dr.
Hudson and his colleagues will be responsible for cloud microphysical
observations aboard the NSF C-130 aircraft operating out of Cleveland, Ohio. The
main scientific objective is to explain the circumstances by which regions of
supercooled cloud can form and continue to exist though ice crystals may also be
present. The C-130 will be equipped for measuring the water content and ice
content of clouds; the concentration, size, habit, and density of ice crystals;
the concentration of ice-forming nuclei; and the concentration and
characteristics of aerosol particles both within the project area and in the air
upstream of where the clouds form. Dr. Hudson will operate his CCN (cloud
condensation nuclei) spectrometers to give information on the nucleating ability
of aerosol particles in and around the clouds of interest. Attention will be
focused on the large nuclei that are active at low values of supersaturation.
These are the particles that quickly grow to sizes large enough to promote
coalescence and the formation of drizzle-size drops, which are a major cause of
aircraft icing. CCN are a critical link in the sequence of events leading from
aerosols in the clear air, to the formation of cloud droplets, to the generation
of either ice crystals or raindrops. The research contributes not only to the
fundamental understanding of microphysical processes in supercooled clouds but
also to the advancement of aviation safety.
