Graduate student Karl Vincent, under the supervision of faculty adviser Dr.
Noel Holmgren of the New York Botanical Garden and City University of New York,
plans a comprehensive study of the morphology, chromosome constitution,
flavonoid chemistry, and pollination relationships of an estimated ten species
of the genus Penstemon in western United States. New morphological features will
be studied using scanning electron microscopy; these characters will be
intergrated with chemical and chromosomal ones to construct a reliable
classification of the group and determine evolutionary relationships. Field
studies will test the association of particular pollinating insects (bees,
wasps, and flies) with particular floral forms in the different species. Results
of the project will include an improved taxonomy of these plants and insight
into the adaptive evolution of floral form.
