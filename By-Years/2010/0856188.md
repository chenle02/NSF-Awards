This is a proposal for participant travel support for the Annual Graduate
Student Probability Conference for the years 2009 and 2010. In 2007, a group of
graduate students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UW) - with
assistance from Professor Thomas Kurtz organized the first Graduate Student
Probability Conference. This conference provided students and postdoctoral
fellows from across the country with the opportunity to interact
with&lt;br/&gt;their peers and learn about exciting new directions of research
in Probability from some ofthe leaders in the field. After a successful debut
with roughly 30 participants, the conference was again held at UW in 2008
growing to about 75 attendees. The third and fourth conferences in this series
will be held at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
(UNC)&lt;br/&gt;in May 2009 and 2010 respectively. The conferences will be co-
hosted by graduate students in the Department of Mathematics at Duke University
and the Department of Statistics and Operations Research at UNC. Although
graduate students are fully in charge of all aspects of organization - including
the writing of this proposal- Professors Jonathan Mattingly (Duke&lt;br/&gt;U.)
and Amarjit Budhiraja (UNC) will act as faculty advisors for this effort. The
project has received partial support through the Statistical and Applied
Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI).&lt;br/&gt;The third conference in the
series will be held May 1 { May 3, 2009. Over the three days of the conference,
participants { which will primarily be graduate students and postdocs will have
the opportunity to deliver and attend talks on a variety of topics in
Probability.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to student and postdoc speakers, there will
be three keynote speakers that will&lt;br/&gt;survey recent developments and
future directions in their area of expertise. These speakers will be established
leaders in the field and will collectively represent a broad range of
topics&lt;br/&gt;in the theory and applications of Probability and Stochastic
Processes. Professor David&lt;br/&gt;Aldous (UC Berkeley) has accepted the
invitation as one of the keynote speakers for the 2009 conference.&lt;br/&gt;It
is anticipated that each conference will be attended by approximately eighty
graduate students and postdocs. NSF support will enable partial travel
reimbursements of up to $300 per participant for up to thirty participants, per
year. NSF funds will also be used to cover travel and other local expenses of
the three keynote speakers. SAMSI support will enable travel reimbursements for
up to additional twenty graduate student participants.&lt;br/&gt;
