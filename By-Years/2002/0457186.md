This experimental research program is aimed at investigations of atom-light
interactions in radically nonperturbative, ultrahigh laser intensities up to
10^19 W/cm^2. The studies are among the first to extend these studies into
ultrahigh field intensities and are focused on atomic and optical physics. The
science has direct bearing on topics fundamental to Atomic, Molecular, Optical,
and Plasma physics, including new multi-electron phenomena, magnetic field-atom
interactions, relativistic continuum dynamics, and ultrafast radiation from
laser-atom interactions. The broader impact of the program will be on fourth
generation XUV and X-ray radiation light sources and applications as wide-
ranging as attosecond science and time resolved x-ray diffraction.
