Abstract This research objective of this collaborative research award is to
break the barriers between the disciplines of geometric modeling and engineering
analysis by placing engineering analysis of imprecise geometric models on a
solid theoretical foundation and by developing the next generation of software
tools based on the developed theory. Significant applications of this research,
which cannot be handled by conventional methods, include analysis of unrepaired
CAD models, reverse engineered or scanned models, models with small geometric
features, toleranced models, and concept sketches. The research approach is
based on treating imprecise models as families of geometric shapes, and on
reformulating the problems of engineering analysis in terms of distances to the
imprecise geometric boundaries. Specific deliverables of the research include
theoretical foundations for the analysis of imprecise models, development of
efficient geometric and numerical algorithms to support the theory, and
implementation of prototypes demonstrating the efficacy of the obtained research
results in the context of specific applications.

If successful, the research will lead to significant advances in the field of
computational engineering, resulting in a substantially wider adoption of the
analysis tools throughout the product design cycle, as well as in emerging areas
beyond engineering. Specific practical advances in interoperable systems will
include analysis of early design concept models, constructed or acquired models
with numerical errors, and detailed toleranced models. The results of this
research have the potential to make a major impact on the educational
curriculum, liberating students and practitioners from dealing with tedious data
preparation and eliminating the need for unrealistic assumptions about the
geometry.
