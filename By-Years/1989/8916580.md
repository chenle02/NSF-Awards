This award will provide 40% of the cost of acquiring a graphics computer system
to be installed and operated for the global geodynamics research group in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. The University
is committed to providing the remaining 60%. The equipment will be used
primarily in constructing simulation models of plate motions and mantle
convection where graphic visualization and high-speed computing capabilities are
needed.
