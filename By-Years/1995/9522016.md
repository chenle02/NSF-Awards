In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Graham Fleming in the Chemistry Department and Lauren Mets
in the Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology at the University of
Chicago will conduct experimental and theoretical studies of photosynthetic
energy- and electron-transfer. The PIs will investigate the transfer of
excitation among pigment molecules in photosynthetic antenna molecule, processes
which occur on the femtosecond time-scale and longer, using ultrafast nonlinear
spectroscopy. Theoretical models will be constructed to help explain such
dynamical data as the vibrational energy and phase relaxation rates. The goal of
this research is to characterize the interactions between chromophores, the
light-absorbing parts of molecules, as well as the strength of these
interactions and the time scales on which they occur. These studies should help
in the understanding of the remarkable efficiency of photosynthesis in both
plants and photosynthetic bacteria.
