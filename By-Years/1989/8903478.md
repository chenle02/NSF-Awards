The project is a collaborative seismic study with the Institute of Physics of
the Earth in the USSR. The analysis will use an extensive earthquake data set
from the Tien Shan area of the USSR to precisely locate earthquakes, determine
the orientation and stresses on faults, and determine the structure of the crust
and upper mantle. This region is one of the best examples of an actively
deforming intracontinental mountain belt and is analogous to the time of the
Laramide orogeny in the Rocky mountains of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming during
the Late Cretaceous. The determination of deformation of the crust in Tien Shan
bears on the occurrence of earthquakes and seismic hazard in other seismic areas
of the world and thus has direct application to the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
