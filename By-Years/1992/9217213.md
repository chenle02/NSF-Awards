In this project, the PI and his team will continue a series of fundamental
studies of turbulence using laboratory experiments to model ocean conditions.
Focus will be on turbulent mixing in uniform-gradient shear flows, in Kelvin-
Helmholtz billows, and in a fluid with spatially varying Vaisala frequency.
