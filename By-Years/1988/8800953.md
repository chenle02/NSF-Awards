Dr. Sharma proposes to study the regulation of a membrane bound guanylate
cyclase from adrenal cortical and Leydig cells, which is important in
steroidogenesis. Since his previous studies have shown that an activator of
protein kinase C inhibits the activity of the enzyme, he proposes to examine the
effect of phosphorylation on this enzyme. He will first see if this guanylate
cyclase is a substrate of protein kinase C, and then see if phosphorylation
affects steroidogenesis or cGMP production. Since protein kinase C is activated
by diacylglycerol, he wants to look at a possible interaction of the PI pathway
in the regulation of this enzyme. Dr. Sharma has previously demonstrated that
cGMP has a mediatory role in adrenal steroidogenesis, and has identified a
membrane-bound guanylate cylase which also binds the ANF. Dr. Sharma's studies
will aid in our understanding of the stimulation and regulation of
steroidogenesis.
