Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) has enabled the visualization of
dynamic protein interactions, studies of protease activity, alterations in
membrane voltage potentials and calcium metabolism within living cells. It has
also allowed the conduction of high-throughput screening assays such as for
quantification of gene expression. However, FRET is confined to microscopy and
it is becoming increasingly crucial to translate FRET assays to small animal
imaging where the in vivo physiological context is critical for drug
development, the study of diseases, and fundamental cellular and molecular
biology.

The long term research goal is to establish optical fluorescence tomography, in
particular FRET tomography, as a robust 3D quantitative imaging modality for
pre-clinical and clinical oncology applications. As a step towards this goal,
the research objective of this CAREER proposal is to test the hypothesis that
quantitative whole-body FRET optical tomography of live small animals is
achievable when patterned wide-field time-resolved Fluorescence Molecular
Tomography (FMT) is employed. To accomplish this objective, the proposed
research approaches are: (a) Implement and optimize patterned light strategies
for multispectral time-resolved optical tomography; (b) Create new strategies
for fast and robust FRET optical reconstructions based on time gates, Monte
Carlo forward model reconstruction algorithms and graphical processor unit (GPU)
computational architecture; (c) Establish FRET tomography in live animals by
imaging NIR-Transferin labeled FRET pairs co-internalized in cells, implanted in
live animals and quantify the donor fraction experiencing FRET (i.e. cell
internalization).
