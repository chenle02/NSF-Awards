This project focuses on the development of novel photolabile protecting groups
(PPGs). PPGs are indispensable tools in both basic and applied sciences.
However, simple and practically useful PPGs for some important functional groups
are not yet available. The goal of this project is to enrich the PPG toolbox
with a series of structurally simple and mechanistically novel PPGs for
carbonyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups, and to explore their synthetic
applications. Highly efficient green chemistry methods for PPG installation will
also be pursued, along with mechanistic studies of relevant and interesting
reactions.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Pengfei Wang of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham. Professor Wang's research efforts are
focused on the development of novel photolabile protecting groups and their
applications. Successful development of the new methodologies will have a
positive impact on organic synthesis, drug delivery, photolithography, and
biochemistry.
