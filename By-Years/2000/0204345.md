This research develops an integrated strategy for the
effective&lt;br/&gt;testing of ubiquitous software systems accessed by the
massive user&lt;br/&gt;population, such as those used to support the Internet
and World Wide Web (WWW),&lt;br/&gt;to ensure their satisfactory performance and
reliability from the users'&lt;br/&gt;perspective. This strategy includes three
important components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Development of a set of high-level
operational profiles (OPs),&lt;br/&gt;which enumerates major functions to be
supported by a software and their&lt;br/&gt;usage frequencies by target users,
organized in groups of related user&lt;br/&gt;functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.
For each high-level function group above, a Markov chain based&lt;br/&gt;model
is constructed to exhaustively test high-level operations
and&lt;br/&gt;selectively test important low-level implementations, with the
testing results&lt;br/&gt;analyzed to identify system bottlenecks for
reliability improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Reliability of the critical
parts identified above can be assured&lt;br/&gt;using traditional testing
techniques or other quality assurance techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will involve industrial partners, including IBM, Nortel
&lt;br/&gt;Networks, and Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics, for result validation,
&lt;br/&gt;software tool support, and future deployment.&lt;br/&gt;
