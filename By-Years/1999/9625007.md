This CAREER proposal addresses new paradigms for exploiting and teaching
instruction-level parallelism (ILP). Statically-scheduled microarchitectures
achieve high performance by relegating to the compiler the responsibility for
detecting and scheduling ILP. Drawbacks to this approach include a lack of
object code compatibility between generations, the reliance on program profiles,
and the erosion of the individual compilation model. This research will develop
new paradigms for ILP that remove the draw-backs by enlisting the OS, the
linker, the assembler, the instruction encoding and the microarchitecture. The
educational plan will introduce the compiler's role in the undergraduate
curriculum as the sophomore and senior levels by developing two courses:
"Introduction to Machine Language Programming" will be modified to include an
awareness of performance issues and the role of the compiler; and a senior level
course will be developed to teach back-end ILP compiler optimization. An
important feature of this proposal is the training of graduate students in a
fundamentally and technologically significant area of ILP. The research and
educational activities will use the TINKER Instruction Set Architecture that has
been constructed by the principal investigator and his students.
