Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses Scratch (a 2D
environment developed at MIT) to build a new CS0 course for at risk students -
those students who are weak in mathematics and/or have not previously been
successful in the introductory computer science (CS1) course. There are three
objectives of this intervention for at-risk students. 1) To establish or improve
students' understanding of core programming concepts, in order to prepare them
for success in CS1. 2) To help students to establish a positive impression of
programming. 3) To increase overall retention in computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of Scratch offers some particular
advantages. Scratch has a comprehensive set of audio/visual capabilities that
allow the creation of interesting animations and games. Having been designed for
younger students, Scratch is very intuitive. It does not allow syntax errors or
require compilation, so students can focus on their higher-level problem-solving
and design skills. Scratch provides instant gratification in an engaging
audio/visual environment that is just not possible in most other languages. The
Scratch community provides the added benefits of collaboration and competition,
within a class, and among the world-wide online
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course materials developed in this project
are made available to faculty at other institutions via a dedicated website. The
project plan is shared with other educators interested in Scratch at the
Scratch@MIT conference, and the project findings are presented at Scratch@MIT
and at SIGSCE.&lt;br/&gt;
