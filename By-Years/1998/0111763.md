This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines standardized
survey interview procedures to determine if these procedures depress
respondents' motivation and ability to engage in effortful thinking, by
alienating, confusing. and rushing respondents through the interview. The
investigator tests this interviewer-respondent interaction with three
complementary survey experiments. These experiments provide different means of
exploring how to induce effortful thinking, how to detect it, and how to
determine its effects. The experiments compare political opinions constructed
under standardized procedures with those constructed under "ideal conditions"
that are designed to encourage effortful processing.
