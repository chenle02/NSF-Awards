The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative science project between
Dr. Nandor Balazs of the State University of New York, Stony Brook, and Dr. I.
Lovas of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Budapest, is to use statistical
mechanical methods to formulate descriptions of relativistic nuclear (heavy ion)
collisions. Various aspects of the research will combine techniques drawn from
condensed matter physics, nuclear physics and particle physics to focus on the
central problem of signatures (transient formation) of quark plasma effects.
Joint efforts should contribute to further development of the kinetic theory of
quark-gluon plasma and, potentially, yield useful models of the hadronization
process. This project in theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents, pool resources and share
research facilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
