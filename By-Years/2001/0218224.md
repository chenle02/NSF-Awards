Functional logic (FL) programming languages provide several&lt;br/&gt;advantages
over declarative languages based on either functions or&lt;br/&gt;predicates
only. A narrowing engine is an essential component of&lt;br/&gt;FL languages.
Narrowing engines available to date are all&lt;br/&gt;prototypical and almost
universally incomplete. The goal of this&lt;br/&gt;research is the design and
development of a general, efficient and&lt;br/&gt;complete narrowing engine for
FL languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will define both internal and
external&lt;br/&gt;representations of executable FL programs---the latter in
XML.&lt;br/&gt;This approach will decouple the frontends of different
compilers&lt;br/&gt;and interpreters of FL languages from the narrowing engine.
This&lt;br/&gt;separation will enable frontends for different languages to
use&lt;br/&gt;the same backend. By contrast to other contemporary
research&lt;br/&gt;efforts, the proposed narrowing engine will map
narrowing&lt;br/&gt;computations to computations in an imperative language.
The&lt;br/&gt;internal representation of the executable code will be
a&lt;br/&gt;thin-layer bytecode over the mapping of narrowing computations
to&lt;br/&gt;computations in an imperative language. This approach promises
a&lt;br/&gt;good efficiency without sacrificing tasks, such as
tracing,&lt;br/&gt;debugging and profiling, that are more easily implemented in
an&lt;br/&gt;interpreter. An integral part of the implementation will be
a&lt;br/&gt;run-time environment for using the narrowing engine in the
backend&lt;br/&gt;of a compiler/interpreter of FL languages.&lt;br/&gt;
