A dedicated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Laboratory supports the
laboratory teaching and learning activities for two GIS introductory courses.
Additional advanced GIS courses result in the establishment of a comprehensive
GIS program. GIS courses also support two occupational /technical programs
Engineering Technology and Computer-Aided Drafting /Design. The objectives of
the project include refining the curriculum of the two GIS courses; providing
students with hands-on laboratory activities to facilitate learning of GIS
principles; preparing and training faculty with the theoretical foundation and
technical skills to teach GIS; and using the two GIS courses as the foundation
for a comprehensive GIS program and to support occupational/technical programs.
The evaluation plan includes both process evaluation and outcome evaluation
components that will use qualitative and quantitative techniques to evaluate the
project and faculty/student outcomes. *
