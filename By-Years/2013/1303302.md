A major theme in number theory which has emerged over the last several decades
is that one can better understand a given arithmetic object (be it a modular
form, Galois representation, L-value) if one can put this object into a p-adic
family. Modular forms fit into Hida/Coleman families; Galois representations are
parametrized by universal deformation spaces; L-values are interpolated by
p-adic L-functions. In this proposal, Pollack seeks to study three different
instances of p-adic variation. First, he aims to give a conjectural formula for
the cyclotomic mu-invariant of a cuspidal eigenform. His method is to transfer
information from a p-adic family of Eisenstein series to the Hida family of the
cuspform in order to calculate the relevant mu-invariant. Second, he aims to
study the variation in p-adic families of Kato?s Euler system attached to a
modular form. A novel aspect to his approach is to vary the Euler system over a
Galois deformation space. As ordinary and non-ordinary forms are intertwined in
this space, he hopes to transfer known Iwasawa theoretic information from the
ordinary case to the non-ordinary case. Third, he proposes a number of
computational projects relating to p-adic variation including the computation of
Hida families and of weight one forms.

Number theory, one of the oldest fields of mathematics, has often borrowed
methods from other mathematical fields to attack questions relating to the basic
properties and patterns of numbers. For instance, calculus is the study of
functions of a continuous variable, but nonetheless has had a profound impact on
number theory despite its very discrete nature. This proposal explores the idea
of trying to better understand certain number theory objects, namely modular
forms, by putting them into a family and studying the family as a whole. Imagine
the difference between studying the actions of an ant versus the role of an ant
in its colony. The notion of a family in number theory is done through p-adic
analysis. P-adic analysis is a generalization of modular arithmetic which itself
gained great public fame in its role in public key cryptography, the backbone of
internet commerce. Thus, by studying families of modular forms, the goal of the
work proposed in this project is to deepen our understanding of any individual
modular form on both a theoretical and computational level. Modular forms are
intimately related to elliptic curves which are also very useful in cryptography
and are commonly used to encrypt cellular transmissions. Thus any deepening of
our understanding of modular forms could have potential cryptographic
applications.
