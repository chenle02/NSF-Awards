The Oceanography Society will: provide partial support for students to
participate in the first meeting of the Society; support the next meeting of the
deans of oceanographic institutions and prepare and distribute the report of
this meeting widely to the oceanographic community; and initiate publication of
a series of booklets on careers for students in ocean sciences. The Oceanography
Society is the first U.S. professional society devoted exclusively to ocean
sciences and covering all disciplines within this field. The Society's first
meeting will provide a unique opportunity for students entering the field to
become involved in activities of the Society and to provide input to the
Society's planning of activities relevant to the needs of students. The deans'
meeting will provide an opportunity for senior administrators within the U.S.
ocean science community to provide guidance from the prospective of the major
ocean science institutions to professional activities relevant to these
institutions' needs. Lastly, the Society will begin preparations for publication
of a series of booklets to provide career guidance for those entering ocean
sciences.
