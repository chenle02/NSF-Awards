Ray 9728239 The gene SHORT INTEGUMENT (SIN1) is an important regulator of
reproductive and vegetative morphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutations in
this gene cause uncoordinated morphogenesis of ovule integument cells, cause a
heterochronic shift in the program of meristem fate change, and, so far uniquely
in plants, produce a pronounced maternal-effect disruption of embryonic pattern
formation. These preliminary studies indicate that SIN1 plays an important role
in cell fate specification. We have now proposed two models that address the
mechanism by which SIN1 controls meristem fate. Here we propose to: I. Clone the
SIN 1 gene and determine its sequence. II. Test genetic models of how SIN1
regulates flowering time by continuing our analysis of the effects of sin1
mutation on functions of the meristem identity genes APETALA2, and LEAFY, as far
as possible during this funding period. Commitment to inflorescence development
is the first important step towards reproductive development in flowering
plants. The last important step constitutes fertilization and embryo development
which occur within the ovules. The preliminary work described here has
established a genetic connection between the earliest and the last steps in
plant reproduction. The studies proposed here investigate the mechanisms behind
this connection.
