The purpose of this award is to provide funding to enable 83 undergraduate and
graduate students to attend the 2012 joint conference of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers International Manufacturing Science and Engineering
Conference and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers North American
Manufacturing Research Conference. The attending students will participate in
the conference by giving technical papers, participating in a poster session to
display their research, and taking part in a design competition. The conference
will be held June 4-8, 2012, at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend,
Indiana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students who attend this conference will have
a chance to see the latest work in their respective fields and to talk to the
investigators directly. This will both give them a better perspective on the
world of manufacturing and better prepare them to complete their thesis
research. There is also an international aspect to the conference, enabling the
students to become more internationally oriented. The benefits to the nation in
the long term will include a better educated manufacturing engineering
workforce.
