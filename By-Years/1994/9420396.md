This project is creating an experimental system using the Internet that will
allow students in design courses to use rapid prototyping services. Three
participant institutions, Carnegie-Mellon University, the University of
California at Berkeley, and Stanford University are participating in the
project. Each has developed individual technologies for virtual and physical
prototyping, which currently stand alone. Bringing these technologies together
will result in exciting new capabilities. Partnerships with industrial partners
and a Federal laboratory are also anticipated. This project addresses key issues
in prototyping, and is creating a network of interconnected services to support
the rapid design, test, and manufacture of mechanical, electro-mechanical, and
electronic products.
