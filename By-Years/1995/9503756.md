9503756 Bluhm The proposed project focuses on the behavior and properties of
Rydberg wave packets. Of particular interest is the behavior of these packets in
external fields such as those produced by a short laser pulse. Recurrent
behavior is observed under this set of conditions and resembles that of squeezed
states. Finally, the role of supersymmetry in Rydberg wave packets will be used
to provide a description of these states which in complementary to that of
quantum defect theory. ***
