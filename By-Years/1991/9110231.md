Global warming associated with the greenhouse effect has emerged as a leading
environmental concern. Many nations, including the United States, are
considering policy measures designed to reduce the rate of green house gas
emissions. Moreover, multilateral action is being discussed under the auspices
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The objective of this project
is to develop a modeling framework for assessing the impact on the U.S. economy
of policies aimed at mitigating global climate change. Specifically, the project
consists of three separate, but related parts. The first involves developing new
econometric methods for estimating industry-wide models of productivity growth.
Attention is focused on autonomous increases in efficiency for both energy and
non-energy inputs. The underlying model to be developed will allow productivity
trends to be both deterministic as well as stochastic. Second, new methods will
be developed for assessing the distributional impacts of policies aimed at
mitigating the effects of global climate change. These distributional impacts
are likely to be very significant, especially for policies that rely on taxation
of energy use. The third part of the study will involve the development of new
algorithms in order to achieve the maximum possible computational efficiency in
assessing the impact of policies aimed at mitigating climate change.
