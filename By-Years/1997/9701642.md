9701642 Wang A CAREER award supports studies of heavily loaded conformal contact
tribological machine elements. An integrated theoretical-numerical-experimental
approach will be used with emphasis on the mixed lubrication and boundary
lubrications regimes and on failure transitions. The ultimate goal is to develop
accurate models of performance in conformal contacts for use in design of
advanced machine elements of this type. The educational component of the award
focusses on stimulating the student's creativity and self-motivated activities
by integrating fundamentals, design, and career development. ***
