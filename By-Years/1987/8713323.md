Professor Dueker will investigate the application of object-oriented computer
languages to the capture, storage, and manipulation of information regarding
spatial relationships among mapped features, with specific applications to
cadastral mapping. He seeks to develop a language that will capture the spatial
structure inherent in legal descriptions and survey measurements, and also to
develop a rule-based system that would resolve conflicts found in legal
descriptions and surveys of adjacent land parcels. This research is a step
toward the creation of a rule-based expert system that will assist in the
construction and maintanance of cadastral information in geographic information
systems (GIS). Its broader implications touch on the basic theory of spatial
relations and on expert systems applications to GIS problems.
