This is a travel award for an exploratory visit to the MIT to visit faculty and
examine facilities. Initial contacts have been made with Dr. Graham Walker, who
has expressed an interest in serving as postdoctoral mentor. This travel award
will enable the investigator to meet with other members of the department and to
become familiar with the laboratory holdings and library facilities as well.
Initial discussions of possible arrangements for a postdoctoral appointment will
also be held.
