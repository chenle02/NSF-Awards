The University of California at San Diego will provide a ground-breaking new
computing facility, Wildfire, that will be made available to the research
community to both well established users of high end computing (HEC) and
especially to new user communities that are less familiar with how HEC can
advance their scientific and engineering goals. &lt;br/&gt;The distinguishing
features of Wildfire are:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Deliver 1.8-2.0 Petaflop/s of long
sought capacity for the 98% of XSEDE jobs (50% of XSEDE core hours) that use
fewer than 1,000 cores and also support larger jobs. The exact number will
depend on the speed of the processor being delivered by Intel but cannot be less
that 1.8 Petaflop/s.&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Provide 7 PB of Lustre-based Performance
Storage at 200 GB/s bandwidth for both scratch and allocated storage as well as
6 PB of Durable Storage&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Ensure high throughput and
responsiveness using allocation/scheduling using proven policies on earlier
deployed systems such as Trestles and Gordon&lt;br/&gt;(iv) Establish a rapid-
access queue to provide new accounts within one day of the request&lt;br/&gt;(v)
Enable community-supported custom software stacks via virtualization for
communities that are unfamiliar with HPC environments. These virtual clusters
will be able to perform at or near native InfinBand
bandwidth/latency&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wildfire will provide novel approaches
for resource allocation, scheduling, and user support, queues with quicker
response for high-throughput computing, medium-term storage allocations,
virtualized environments with customized software stack, dedicated allocations
of physical/virtual machines, support for Science Gateways and bandwidth
reservations on high-speed networks. Wildfire has been designed to efficiently
serve the 98% of XSEDE jobs that need fewer than 1,000 cores, while also
supporting larger jobs. The award leverages but also enhances the services
available through the XSEDE project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wildfire
acquisition will work to increase the diversity of researchers able to
effectively make use of advanced computational resources and establish a
pipeline of potential users through virtualization, science gateways and
educational activities focused on the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate
levels.
