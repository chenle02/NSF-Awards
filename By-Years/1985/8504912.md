Process control in the textile industry is an important problem in view of the
tremendous volumes of material involved. In this research a distributed control
system will be evaluated. The objectives are to establish that second-generation
distributed control systems can be used generically as simulators, to develop
concepts for use of distributed control techniques in textile processing, to
drive suitable control algorithms, and to test the results in a neighboring
textile plant. A Beckman RMV 9000 distributed control system will be used to
emulate an existing dyeing operation. Plant data will be used to design the
process simulation and to check the predictions. Process graphics will be a
novel feature. Analog and digital functions will be determined for the dynamics
of the components of the process. Screen displays of variable trends will be
provided.
