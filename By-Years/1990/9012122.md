The purpose of this continuing research is to produce a quantitative economic
history of the emergence and perfection of efficient and integrated
international capital markets during the period 1811-1914. This study will also
involve developing a data base consisting of the share price lists published
regularly for the stock exchanges of London, Amsterdam, Paris, and New York. The
research results will provide new insights into the disruptions and subsequent
adjustments in the pricing of internationally-traded financial assets that are
created by the addition of new markets and traders, changes in government
regulations of existing markets, changes in institutional design of stock
markets, or advances in the technology of communications linking the various
financial markets. This research is important because it will provide a
quantitative standard of market integration and efficiency that can be used to
calibrate measures of financial market operation in other periods. Further, the
nineteenth century is an especially interesting period for establishing such
measures for evaluating current developments in international financial markets.
This period is characterized by the spread of financial capitalism to variety of
countries with very different legal and institutional histories, and by the
integration of the corresponding secondary markets in transferable securities
through the first telecommunications revolution. Also, this period ends with
rise of increasing regulation of stock exchanges in the form of both self-
regulation and state regulation.
