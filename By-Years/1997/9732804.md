9732804&lt;br/&gt;Gidley&lt;br/&gt;We propose an interdisciplinary research
program that combines the well known defect sensitivity of positron techniques
with state-of-the-art positron beam technology in order to detect and image the
early stages of microstructural damage in a wide range of engineering materials
where traditional techniques are not adequate. The inability to characterize
defect evolution on the manometer size scale represents a major missing link in
our fundamental knowledge of the synthesis-to-failure life cycle of many
engineering materials. If materials scientists can measure the microstructural
evolution of damage from synthesis to failure they will be greatly aided in
improving such material properties as strength and durability, wear and
corrosion resistance, environmental compatibility, and fabrication cost
effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of this research is to
demonstrate new measurement technology which addresses the initial stages of the
nucleation and growth of defects to form larger voids that eventually lead to
sample failure. Such defect accumulation (which can be highly localized) may be
induced by mechanical means (e.g., fatigue, thermal stress), by chemical means
(e.g., corrosion), by radiation, or by other agents such as electromigration.
Sample systems range from crystalline metals to amorphous polymers to
heterogeneous composites, and include such diverse items as microelectronic
devices, passivation layers on reactive metal surfaces, and pipes in nuclear
power reactors. The primary new technique to be used in this research is the
positron microscope/microprobe. This advancement in positron beam technology
will extend the known defect sensitivity of Doppler broadening spectroscopy,
positron emission, and positron lifetime spectroscopy by incorporating depth
profiled, microscopic lateral resolution. This will pen-nit non-destructive,
three dimensional, nanoscale, defect imaging. A more traditional non-microscopic
beam will continue to be used in a depth profiled mode when studying particular
surfaces and films that do not require lateral
resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is a broad-based
exploratory program that builds upon a strong existing collaboration between the
University of Michigan Physics Department and the Materials Science and
Engineering Department. To provide critical guidance in such an
interdisciplinary program we have sought out expert collaborators working at
universities, national laboratories and in
industry.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
