The funds are requested to support student travel to Quantum Information
Processing Workshop to be held at the Banff Centre in Canada, on 10-16 January,
2016. This workshop is the central event in the area of Quantum Computing and,
more generally, Quantum Information Science. It is expected that QIP will bring
together about 500 leading researchers in theoretical aspects of quantum
information and computation, and play a role as one of the most important venues
for the groundbreaking research in theoretical computer science. NSF support
will help broaden participation at the QIP Workshop by subsidizing the travel
for up to 20 student participants who might not otherwise attend QIP. Organizers
aim at increasing the number of student and postdoctoral participants from the
under-represented groups.
