In this project the researchers propose to investigate an alternative model for
assessing complex thinking in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) education. The method, Epistemic Network Analysis, is said to measure
student skills, knowledge, identities, values, and epistemology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two iterative design cycles over five years are proposed.
The investigators will use existing data to do psychometric analyses, develop
visualizations, develop a toolkit, and work with and disseminate a toolkit to a
community of early adopters. The work will be conducted using data from several
engineering education games. Dissemination will be in the form of the toolkit
and academic publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is important because
it represents a departure from current thought about assessment and the notion
of isolating content learning from values, epistemologies, and skills. Because
the work proposed by the investigator retains such data and examines their
interdependencies, the ENA method represents a potentially transformative
approach to assessing complex STEM thinking.
