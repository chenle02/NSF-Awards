9317405 Grant The objectives of this research are: (1) to obtain ground and
aircraft-based measurements of ice nuclei; (2) to quantitatively describe these
measurements in a manner suitable for use by numerical cloud models; (3) to
adapt these descriptions to a detailed microphysical cloud model; and (4) to
compare the measurements and simulations with observations of ice formation
derived from aircraft data during WISP-94. ***
