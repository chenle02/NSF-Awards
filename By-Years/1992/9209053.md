This project consists of three research components in the general area of phase
transitions and critical phenomena. These are: i) Discrete models of interfaces
in three dimensions, including a study of surface fluctuations. ii) Percolation
and related ferromagnetic models, including a study of (d+1)- dimensional models
with d-dimensional disorder, which arise naturally from d-dimensional disordered
quantum spin systems. iii) Spin glasses, including a study of the multiplicity
of pure phases in short-range models. These mathematical studies are geared to
develop an understanding of certain important physical and technological
phenomena. Interface models arise in the study of wetting and lubrication.
Disordered quantum spin systems are being extensively used to model the effects
of impurities in superconductors. Spin glasses are closely related both to
neural networks (an important development in artificial intelligence) and to
large scale scheduling problems such as the famed "travelling salesman problem".
