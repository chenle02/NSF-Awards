This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). This project is dedicated to the study of Random Matrix
Theory and its applications. Random matrices arise naturally in many diverse
fields including statistics, data science, computer science, and physics. For
example, random matrices were originally introduced in physics to study the
nuclei of heavy atoms. The aim of this project is to understand the properties
of certain random matrix models that arise in several diverse domains including
control theory, statistical genetics, and the study of neural networks. This
research opens the door to a deeper understanding of applications in these
domains and has the potential to create avenues of future fundamental research
in Random Matrix Theory and related fields. This project also features a number
of educational components that integrate research and teaching. These components
include a summer academy for high school students interested in advanced
mathematics; participation in organized activities designed to allow high school
students and scientists to meet and interact in an informal setting using
interactive demonstrations; and undergraduate and graduate student mentoring.

The overarching research goal of this project is to understand the behavior of
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of random matrices with dependent entries. The
research program is divided into three themes, which are quite disparate in
background, application, and tools. The first theme concerns the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of matrices arising in the study of random networks and graphs,
including matrices that appear in synchronization problems and network control
theory. Motivated by open questions in statistical genetics, the second theme
concerns the spectral properties of sample covariance matrices constructed from
dependent random samples. The third theme is inspired by cutting-edge results in
the theoretical study of neural networks and involves random matrix products.
This interdisciplinary research program is integrated with student research and
exploration projects, designed for students ranging from the high school to
graduate level.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
