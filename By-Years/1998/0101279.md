&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arctic Research Consortium of the United
States (ARCUS) is to provide organizational support for Arctic sciences to
develop, promote, and implement arctic research and education by nurturing the
orderly growth of arctic research through tasks that cannot be accomplished as
effectively by individual researchers, institutions, agencies, or by currently
existing advisory bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, they will provide
services in four areas. They are: &lt;br/&gt;o Arctic science planning-
coordinating science planning for the arctic research community at several
levels, including continuing examination of logistical requirements with the
goal of improved access for all researchers in the Arctic;&lt;br/&gt;o
Organizational support for research programs included in the Office of Polar
Programs Arctic Sciences Section-the Arctic System Science Program (ARCSS), the
Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP), and the Arctic Natural Sciences Program
(ANS);&lt;br/&gt;o Development and coordination of arctic science educational
activities; and&lt;br/&gt;o Information and outreach activities to disseminate
information about arctic research to the scientific community, policy and
decision-makers, and to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
