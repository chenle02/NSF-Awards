Meech 9731083 This project, sponsored by the University of Hawaii, will carry
out a five-year project teaching astronomy concepts to 150 high school teachers,
30 each year with some repeaters. The intent of the program is to enable the
teachers to teach their students astronomy while at the same time doing actual
astronomy observations. Thus the teachers will learn the astronomy concepts by
actually doing the observations themselves thereby also becoming involved in
astronomy research. Cultural astronomy will also be a part of the content. This
is of special interest to teachers from the nine Pacific Rim territories where
cultural astronomy is an important local issue. The teachers selected will
participate in two pre-workshop seminars, a five-day summer workshop working
with professional astronomers to gain content knowledge and acquire insight into
research and a 13 day program working with students in astronomical observations
and development of the appropriate pedagogy for hands-on activities. During the
next, and following, academic years the program will be supported by internet
activities, seminars and classroom workshops.
