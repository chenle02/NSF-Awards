This project addresses the problem of preparing students to deal with a variety
of equipment and uses in a one-semester course. The project permitted the
institution to acquire computer hardware, software, and interfacing equipment.
The course is divided into two pedagogical segments, one involving computer
hardware, the other data manipulation and modeling. The connection between the
two parts is important. The first part gives the students the opportunity to
learn to determine hardware requirements necessary to solve a particular
problem. The interfacing segment provides a significant component of hands-on
hardware experience at the chip and board level. The purpose of the modeling
part of the course is to teach the students a)how computer technologies can be
applied in modern chemistry, and b)the various common hardware and software that
are available to the chemist today. The students who successfully complete this
course have attained some expertise in molecular modeling and are sufficiently
familiar with a range of approaches to a broad spectrum of problems so that they
have the perspective necessary to configure a system for a particular
application or adapt an existing system to a new application. The institution
contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
