Numerical simulations aimed at forecasting solar Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)
require specification of the actual velocity field of the plasma at the solar
photosphere. This information must be "derived" from proxy magnetogram
observations, and this can lead to errors and inaccuracies in the inferred flow
fields. Realistic numerical simulations of solar magnetoconvection will be
employed to simulate synthetic magnetograms. Then using schemes provided by
observers in the SHINE community the velocity field will be "derived" through,
(i) local-correlation tracking, (ii) feature tracking, and (iii) minimum energy
fitting techniques. By comparing these inferred velocity fields against the
known flows one may, (i) identify which methods most accurately determine
velocities, (ii) characterize pathologies in the methods, (iii) suggest ways to
remedy these pathologies, and (iv) disseminate these results to the many users
of these methods in the solar physics/SHINE communities.
