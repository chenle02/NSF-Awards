A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V
Savannah. The R/V Savannah is a 92 foot coastal research vessel, owned and
operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;Since
put into service in the fall of 2001, this 92-foot coastal/local class research
vessel has proven to be a capable and cost-effective platform for a range of
research and education projects. The primary working area for the vessel has
been the continental shelf, coastal and estuarine environments of the
Southeastern United States. The ship has also conducted cruises that have
crossed the Gulf Stream into the western Sargasso Sea and as far as Curacao in
the SE Caribbean. In 2013, the R/V Savannah completed 111 days at sea. NSF
funded projects accounted for 37% (41 days) of the total sailing schedule. In
2014, R/V Savannah is scheduled for 189 days with NSF days accounting for 64% or
121 days of the total sailing schedule.&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation
requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt; Mooring Deployment /Overboard
Handling Gear $20,272 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of
the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
