This project will provide for the additional printing and distribution of a
National Academy of Engineering brochure, "Engineering and Human Welfare: 10
Outstanding Achievements, 1964-1989". Since engineering is not included in the
curriculum of most secondary schools, students at that level have little
exposure to the scope and excitement of the engineering disciplines. Extensive
distribution of this brochure can be a very cost-effective way of creating
interest in engineering at earlier age. This, in turn, can have a positive
effect toward increasing the number of students in the engineering pipeline.
