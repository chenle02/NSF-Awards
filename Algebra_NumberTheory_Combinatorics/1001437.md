Mathematically, the research focuses on interactions between combinatorics,
geometry, and algebra. The projects are centered around specific applications to
natural sciences, including evolutionary biology, medical imaging, dynamics of
chemical reactions, algorithms and computational complexity, and theoretical
high-energy physics. More specifically, the projects include: (1) algorithms for
finding centroids in spaces of phylogenetic trees, and general gradient
optimization methods for piecewise differentiable functions on polyhedral
spaces, with applications to evolutionary biology and medical imaging, and to
computational complexity of convex polyhedral spheres; (2) applications of
commutative algebra of binomials to dynamics and stability of mass action
kinetics in chemistry; (3) efficient algorithms for combinatorial game theory
using connections to commutative algebra, based on techniques involving
generating functions; and (4) commutative algebra and algebraic geometry of
algebraic varieties, with large group actions, arising in high-energy physics.

Interactions between modern combinatorics, geometry, and algebra have become
increasingly rich in recent years. This research will explore and deepen these
connections at their interfaces with a number of other disciplines, including
biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, statistics, and operations
research. The specific mathematical projects focus on computational geometry and
optimization; the algebra of polynomials; and smooth geometry in the presence of
symmetry. Despite the range of the proposed intellectual activities in
mathematics and its applications, they are drawn together by unifying themes in
geometry and algebra. By supporting personnel (undergraduates, graduate
students, and postdoctoral researchers), this project will have substantial
positive effects on education through research in the aforementioned areas.
Fostering ties between these areas, among personnel as well as in scientific
discovery, is an explicit, central objective.
