Racial and gender disparities have been documented in many areas, including
employment, health care, mortgage and other lending situations, motor vehicle
stops and searches as well as in other scenarios of law enforcement such as jury
selection, prosecution and sentencing. Two of the most important causes for the
observed racial and gender disparities are racial/gender prejudice and
statistical discrimination. The term "prejudice'' refers to the presence of a
psychic utility differential accrued by "the decision-makers" (i.e. the
employers, the doctors, the lenders, the police officers, the judges etc.) in
making their decisions on "the treated" (the job applicant, the patient, etc.)
when the treated have different races and genders. In contrast, the term
"statistical discrimination" refers to a scenario in which the "decision-makers"
see "the treated" with dissimilar races and genders differently only because of
the legitimate information that is contained in race and gender characteristics.

Two important and related questions are addressed. First, how can one
distinguish the roles of racial/gender bias from that of statistical
discrimination in the observed racial/gender disparities? Second, what are
potential issues to be aware of in the attempts via, e.g. affirmative action
policies, to reduce the disparities? The investigators develop new empirical
methods and theory as well as new empirical applications to address these
questions.

In the first project of this proposal, the investigators propose a unified and
general framework to formally investigate the conditions under which disparities
caused by prejudice and statistical discrimination can be distinguished. The
general framework allows the investigators to formally assess the validity of
many existing tests in the literature, and also permits them to propose valid
empirical tests.

In the second project of the proposal, the investigators suggest and
empirically implement an outcome-based test for the role of prejudice among
emergency department physicians based on the bounceback rates of patients who
are discharged from their initial emergency department (ED) visit upon some
diagnostic tests. This empirical application is a new contribution to our
understanding of the large racial disparities in health care access and health
outcomes.

In a third project, the researchers analyze the potential problems caused by
the fact that a policy-maker - who is interested in increasing racial and/or
gender diversity in the workplace - typically has to delegate the hiring
decisions to an agent, and the principal and the agent may have conflicting
objectives. Two important questions are addressed. First, how do the delegation
decision and conflict of interest aspects of the affirmative action problem
affect the achievement of affirmative action goals? Two, what are the potential
strategies that the principal may adopt to alleviate these problems?

Given the importance of racial and gender disparities, as well as existing
affirmative action efforts to reduce such disparities, this investigation will
bring many new theoretical insights, empirical methods and facts to the social
discourse on issues of racial and gender equality.
