This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
magnetorheological (MR) fluids using nano-sized magnetic particles. MR fluids
are a family of smart materials that have the unique ability to undergo rapid,
reversible, and significant changes in their rheological properties on
application of an external magnetic field. These unique properties make MR
fluids very attractive for such applications as shock and vibration control,
brakes, and precision finishing technology. However, problems persist with
commercial MR fluids due to the relatively large magnetic particles used
(typically 3-5 um). These problems include poor stability against sedimentation
and redispersibility. In this Phase I project, nanosized magnetic powders will
be developed to produce MR fluids with improved stability and redispersibility.
This will be followed by optimization of synthesis, characterization, and
testing of the MR fluids.

The commercial applications of this project are expected to include electrically
controllable dampers, brakes, clutches, engine mounts, throttle valves, cross
steppers and precision finishing technology.
