The PI continues her investigation of algebraic and topological aspects of
simplicial complexes associated with partially ordered sets (posets) and
monotone graph properties. The theory of poset topology provides a deep and
fundamental link between combinatorics and other branches of mathematics such as
topology, algebra and geometry. There are five parts to the project. The first
three parts are connected with the study of topological properties of a new
poset operation coming from commutative algebra, called Rees product. By
studying the Rees product of two very simple posets, the PI and John Shareshian
have discovered some remarkable enumerative and algebraic identities. The most
striking of the enumerative identities is a conjectured q-analog of a well-known
identity for the Eulerian polynomials in terms of the joint distribution of the
major index and the excedance index. In Part 4, the PI proposes to obtain a
k-analog of a well-known relationship between the homology of the partition
lattice and the homology of the complex of graphs that are not connected. The PI
and Shareshian have a precise conjecture on what that should be, involving the
so called 1 mod k partition poset and the complex of graphs that are not k-edge
connected. In Part 5, the PI proposes to continue her study of the matching
complex, the chessboard complex and variations. These complexes arise in diverse
settings such as group theory, discrete geometry and commutative algebra.

Algebraic combinatorics is an area of mathematics that seeks to establish
connections between combinatorics and fields of pure mathematics that involve
algebra. The idea is to use these connections to enrich combinatorics and the
other fields. Combinatorics is the science of counting, arranging and analyzing
discrete configurations. A communications network is an example of a fundamental
discrete configuration called a graph. Graphs and other discrete configurations
arise in various fields of mathematics, computer science, physics and biology.
Combinatorial methods are playing an increasing role in these fields.
