9510033 Dettman The Asian Monsoon is one of the largest and most important
weather systems on Earth. The development of a strong monsoon climate has been
identified as a possible cause of the expansion of C4 grasslands and an oxygen
isotope shift in soil carbonates in Pakistan and Nepal. This study will examine
the development of the modern monsoon, one dominated by the high Tibetan Plateau
which today virtually precludes any dry-season precipitation. The isotopic
composition of aragonitic molluscs will be used to reconstruct the seasonal
isotopic variation of rivers in the foothills of the Himalayas between 12 and 1
Ma (million years before present). By combining the 18O of micro-sampled weekly
or monthly shell growth increments with temperature estimates based on fossil
floral assemblages, the seasonal change in the 18O of river water can be
calculated. The goal of these measurements is to examine the isotopic
composition of river waters on a seasonal basis in order to estimate the aridity
of the dry season and the seasonal variability of rainfall. Strong seasonal
aridity is indicated by positive 18O values of surface water in the dry season.
The seasonal amount of precipitation can be roughly estimated because the
isotopic composition of rainfall is a function of the amount of rainfall at low
latitudes. Shell carbonates 13C of carbon in the rivers. This allows changes in
the 18O record to be directly related to changes in the plant biomass of the
region (C3 versus C4). Nepal will be the primary focus of this study because of
the useful stratigraphic distribution of well preserved molluscs, but some shell
beds in Pakistan will also be studied to allow comparison of different regions
under the influence of the Asian Monsoon.
