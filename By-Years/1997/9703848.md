9703848 Smith University of Alaska will operate the R/V ALPHA HELIX during 1997
as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-funded projects.
The R/V ALPHA HELIX is a 133' general research vessel owned by the National
Science Foundation and constructed in 1966. The ship is schedules for 112
operating days in 1997, of which 65 days are in support of NSF-sponsored
projects. The cruises include significant research cruise legs to the Aleutian,
Bering, and Chukchi Sea regions during minimum ice conditions in late summer.
This vessel is part of a fleet used by NSF and other research agencies to
support oceanographic research. Most oceanographic research requires specialized
equipment that must be permanently installed on the research vessel. Trained
crew members are also required to support the equipment systems and research
operations. This is the first year of a planned two year cooperative award. ***
