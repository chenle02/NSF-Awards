The project deals with the measurements of the kinetics of the production of
carbon fibers using iron catalysts. It will incorporate physical
characterization of the catalyst, support, and the carbon formed along with the
analysis of the reactive gas phase. A kinetic/mechanistic model of the process
will be developed. Carbon fibers have high strength and modulus and low weight.
They are therfore used for high strength light weight structural components. The
project has the potential for a new process for growing filamentous carbon
fibers catalytically.
