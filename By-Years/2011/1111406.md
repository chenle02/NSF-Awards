In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Fraser F. Fleming of the Department of Chemistry at Duquesne
University will explore fundamentally new reactions of metalated nitriles.
Preliminary results demonstrate the viability of several new reactivity patterns
for alkylating alkenes, aromatics, and creating medium-sized carbocycles.
Studies to expand and develop these forays into robust synthetic methods will be
undertaken. Asymmetric alkylations of zincated and magnesiated nitriles will be
performed through a combination of screening and mechanistic probes to address
one of the most difficult challenges in the field: stereoselective alkylation of
a chiral, metalated nitrile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is likely to lead
to new methods for stereoselectively assembling hindered, quaternary centers.
Fields as diverse as medicine and materials rely on exactly this type of robust
chemistry. The nitrile-based arylation is particularly well suited to the
synthesis of several nitrile-containing pharmaceuticals and drug leads because
the method uses an inexpensive, abundant copper catalyst rather than palladium
catalysts that are currently required for the same
transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three broader impacts will be reached
through this research: institutional development, elevation of nitrile
chemistry, and student training. As a teacher-scholar institution a strong
emphasis is placed on undergraduate and graduate mentoring while pursuing
research excellence. In this context, the student research will, in part, be
guided by a post-doctoral associate with reciprocal mentoring from the PI to the
post-doctoral associate.
