The emphasis of this work is on the development of new single electron transfer
initiated photochemical reactions. Photochemical group transfer reactions which
result from the formation of reactive dipolar intermediates will be investigated
in detail. Photochemical preparation and trapping of 1,3 dipoles such as
azomethine and carbonyl ylides will be studied as will 1,4 dipole forming and
trapping reactions of alpha ketoamides and alpha ketoesters. Single electron
transfer initiated photomacrocyclization reactions will also be studied, first
using phthalimides. Photomacrocyclization of phthalimides will be used to
determine the factors which govern efficiencies and regioselectivities of
photocyclizations then that information will be applied to macrocyclic
polyether, polyamide and polypeptide syntheses.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Patrick S. Mariano of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of New Mexico. Dr. Mariano will explore photochemical group transfer,
cyclization and redox reactions. The photocyclization reactions studied will
serve as the foundation for new polyether, polyamide, and polypeptide syntheses
and thus have potential applications for the preparation of antibiotics and
other pharmaceuticals. Discovery of selective, photochemical amine oxidation
reactions has potential applications in the design of inactivators of
flavoenzymes such as monoamine oxidase. Students trained during the course of
this work will be broadly trained in preparative organic chemistry and
preparative photochemistry and gain skills needed by the pharmaceutical
industry.
