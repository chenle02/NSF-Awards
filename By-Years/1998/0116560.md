This project ((in collaboration with Dr. Ricardo Oropeza, ITSEM CEM, Mexico)
will investigate the problem of sensor-based exploration of unknown environments
by autonomous robots. The work will include autonomous construction of a
representation of the environment (the mapping problem), annotating the map with
landmarks for robot localization, and the use of the constructed map for
navigation.
