9520839 Zewail Over the past three years, this research has been centered on the
use of ultrafast laser spectroscopy to probe molecular dynamics. The new
research will focus on three directions: (a) studies of real-time dynamics in
large (nano) molecular clusters; (b) studies of the photophysical and
photochemical dynamics of materials under high pressure, reaching up to 4000
atmospheres; and (c) the use of novel laser techniques to examine and control
selective processes in inhomogeneous systems. The objectives are to resolve the
primary picosecond and femtosecond dynamics under these novel conditions of
controlled, size, density and distance, and to learn about forces governing the
transition to the condensed phase limit. %%% This research is concerned with the
investigation of the ultrafast dynamics in clusters and at high pressures. The
goal is to use ultrafast laser techniques, with picosecond and femtosecond
lasers, to resolve and study important features of the dynamics involved in the
transition from the isolated molecule to the condensed-phase limit. Studies of
microscopic large clusters and systems at high pressures offers unique
opportunities to test, on a fundamental level, molecular interactions under
controlled conditions of size, density, and distance. These studies will cover
elementary and complex molecular systems. ***
