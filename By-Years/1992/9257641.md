A programs of research to study novel optoelectronic devices based on II-V
semiconductor heterostructures is described. The devices include quantum
cylinder surface emitting lasers, MSM photodetectors, and quantum well inter-
subband transition-based devices. The research includes a component for the
study of new, wide band gap photonic materials. The materials system to be
studied is based on the III-V nitrides, with (in,Ga,Al)N as an example.
