This project deals with questions from pluri-potential theory and dynamics in
several complex variables. Pluri-potential theory is the higher dimensional
version of potential theory in the complex plane. The investigator plans to
study certain classes of pluricomplex Green functions for the complex Monge-
Ampere operator, from the point of view of their foliation structure and also in
relation to some questions from algebraic geometry. A second goal of the project
is to consider polynomial estimates of Bernstein-Walsh type related to graphs of
entire transcendental functions. The investigator plans to study certain
properties of entire functions from this point of view. Such properties are also
of interest in transcendental number theory. Finally, the investigator is
concerned with studying the dynamics of classes of polynomial automorphisms in
higher dimensions.

Complex analysis in one and in higher dimensions has important connections with
many fields of pure and applied mathematics and, indeed, with other sciences. It
is often the case that one gains insight about concrete problems once they are
formulated in the context of complex numbers. This is because of the powerful
methods and tools developed in the study of holomorphic functions in complex
analysis. Studying complex dynamical systems proved to be important for
understanding the behavior of more complicated real dynamical systems arising in
mathematics as well as in physics and biology.
