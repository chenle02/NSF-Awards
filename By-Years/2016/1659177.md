This awards supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at Old Dominion University. The site provides opportunities to eight
undergraduate students each summer for ten weeks of research on topics in
accelerator and nuclear physics. There are continued opportunities for two
students during the academic year. The REU site is a partnership between Old
Dominion University and Jefferson Laboratory; students are housed at Jefferson
Lab and their research projects are located there. Both accelerator and nuclear
physics are research areas with applications with important societal impact,
including in the areas of medicine, homeland security, and energy production. By
exposing these undergraduates to these exciting fields, the program will
increase the flow of talented students into these areas, whether that be a
graduate program in accelerator science, or jobs in
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students can choose from experimental and
theoretical projects. They develop their communication skills by presenting a
progress report talk in the 7th week,&lt;br/&gt;and then writing a final paper
on their work and presenting a poster on the last day. There are two
scientific/technical/professional development talks scheduled each week for the
undergraduates, in addition to the many other regular activities at the lab. The
students receive training on technical writing, and each student will be
mentored to present his/her results at a conference during the academic year
following their summer research.
