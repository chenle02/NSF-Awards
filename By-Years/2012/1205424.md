CI-P:Collaborative Research: The Speech Recognition Virtual Kitchen

This project provides a "kitchen" environment to promote community sharing of
research techniques, foster innovative experimentation, and provide solid
reference systems for automatically recognizing speech, as a tool for education,
research, and evaluation. The research infrastructure is built around virtual
machines (VMs), which can be reconfigured and shared easily. We liken the
virtual machines to a "kitchen" because they provide the environmental
infrastructure into which one can install "appliances" (e.g., speech recognition
toolkits), "recipes" (scripts for creating state-of-the art systems for a
toolkit), and "ingredients" (spoken language data), along with "dishes"
(completed experiments with log-files for reference).

The planning project engages the community to tackle some of the issues that
have previously hampered efforts in cross-community sharing, including
distribution methods and intellectual property issues. The project also provides
an example architecture, which serves as a focus point for community-wide
discussion.

In terms of broader impacts, the project engages researchers and educators that
typically do not participate in automatic speech recognition (ASR) research by
providing travel scholarships to a workshop at INTERSPEECH2012. In a wider
scope, the infrastructure may be useable by other data-intensive fields
(synthesis, dialog systems, NLP, computer vision, data mining). By providing a
permanent, publicly available resource for research, education, and evaluation
in ASR research, we can better train the next generation of undergraduates and
graduates. The "kitchen" gives them easy access to a large number of state-of-
the-art implementations, and facilitates deeper analysis of algorithms and
better comparisons across systems.
