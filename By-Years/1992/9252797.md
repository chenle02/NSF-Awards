This program offers a three-week summer institute of courses in mathematics and
science which are designed to reinforce students' understanding of science while
also encouraging creativity by having them work on selected topics and projects.
The academic year component continues students' explorations through sessions
with visiting scientists, special activity groups and field trips. Eighty
students will participate each year. Major goals of the program are to: 1)
encourage students to continue taking the critical mathematics and science
courses during their secondary education; 2) create an awareness within the
community for talented students to pursue careers in these areas; 3) create a
cohort of students who share similar interests; 4) ensure that these students
proceed to higher education; and 5) increase the probability that these students
will pursue a career in mathematics and/or science.
