9554607 Jones The Roanoke River Valley Consortium consists of five improverished
school systems with student populations that are predominantly People of Color:
Bertie, 78%; Hertford 73%; Northampton, 79%; Warren, 77%; Wedon City, 98%. The
vision is to provide science, mathematics and technology professional
development for K-8 teachers. This will enable teachers to implement changes
designed to increase opportunities for student achievement. This program will
enable teachers to integrate exemplary curriculum materials into North
Carolina's curriculum in science, mathematics, and technology. The planning
grant will allow the school community to become familiar with such materials as
Science and Technology for Children, Middle School Science and Technology,
Windows on Mathematics, Windows on Science, Jasper Woodbury Series and Bob Moses
Algebra Project. Approximately 528 teachers and 30 schools will participate in
this project.
