This WIDER project is transforming the introductory STEM courses at Berea
College into high-­engagement, active learning environments following the
SCALE-­UP model that has shown to be successful in physics and other STEM
disciplines. Introductory courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and computer
science are being targeted. Baseline data described the enrollments and
instructional modes in the targeted courses. These courses are being further
enhanced by the inclusion of undergraduate Teaching Associates from the Berea
College Labor Program (work study), who are acting as peer instructors in the
classroom and enabling the program to maintain a student-­teacher ratio of 10-1
that is supporting student learning.

The underlying change strategy for this project can be described as
environmental/emergent. It is capitalizing on a faculty culture of reflective
teaching, while moving towards a shared vision for first year STEM courses. This
project is creating lasting, transformative change by: 1) supporting a
faculty-­led initiative to implement substantive changes in introductory STEM
classrooms, 2) by deepening knowledge about evidence-­based practice among the
faculty, and by 3)improving student learning and retention in first year STEM
courses.

This project capitalizes on several strengths of Berea College, including its
well­-established Labor Program, a collegial and collaborative environment for
teaching, and the faculty's commitment to providing a high-­quality education to
underserved students from Appalachia and beyond. Because of its historic mission
to serve groups traditionally under-­represented in higher education and STEM,
Berea College is ideally placed to gauge the effectiveness of this model on the
retention and success of economically disadvantaged students in STEM
disciplines. In addition, as a member of the Work Colleges Consortium, Berea is
serving as a national exemplar for the implementation of studio-­based
introductory STEM courses using undergraduate Teaching Associates to maintain a
low student-­teacher ratio.
