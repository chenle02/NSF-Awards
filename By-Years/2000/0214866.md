This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research
passive components in electronic circuits increases, new interconnect
technologies, such as embedded passives, are under development to optimize
utilization of board real estate. For embedded passives, dimensional accuracy
translates into control over component values, and so there is a need for high-
precision fabrication processes. TPL has developed soft lithography micro-
contact printing, an additive process that can fabricate near-net-shape
structures with features between 100 microns and the sub-micron scale. The
innovation exploits the compositional flexibility of sol-gel chemistry to
synthesize powder-free inks with a wide range of materials properties that can
be patterned with high resolution using the novel micro-contact printing
technology.

Potential commercial applications effort will demonstrate the feasibility of
micro-contact printing for application to high-density interconnects solutions,
and could be an enabling technology for high-precision embedded passives. The PI
has pioneered the use of micro-contact printing as a novel interconnect
technology while TPL has extensive experience in developing packaging solutions
for the electronics industry.
