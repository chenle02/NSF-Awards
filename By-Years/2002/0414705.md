Prof. Robert Hinde of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville is supported by an
award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for a theoretical
study of parahydrogen solids containing a variety of chemical impurities which
introduce new features in the infrared absorption spectrum of the host matrix.
The research combines quantum Monte Carlo simulations with highly-correlated ab
initio quantum calculations in an effort to simulate the positions and line
shapes of these dopant-induced spectral features. The research is having a
broader impact on the study of quantum molecular solids and is related to the
development of enhanced propellants.
