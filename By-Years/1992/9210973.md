The techniques of computational chemistry have found wide interdisciplinary
application in fields as diverse as polymer science and solid state theory. The
purpose of this preliminary study is to adapt the methodology of Quantum
Chemistry to investigate electronic properties of zero- dimensional quantum well
(quantum dot) array structures.
