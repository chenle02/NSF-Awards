Title: Conservation laws with partial dissipation in continuum mechanics

This project is concerned with systems of conservation laws (balance laws), a
broad class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) arising from
continuum mechanics. Of special interest are equations with partial dissipation,
including hyperbolic-parabolic systems, hyperbolic systems with fading memory,
and hyperbolic systems with relaxation. The purpose of the research is to obtain
a better understanding of the underlying physical phenomena through the study of
the qualitative behavior of the solutions of the PDEs. The first objective is to
obtain the nonlinear stability of shock profiles for hyperbolic systems with
relaxation, including fully dissipative systems and those containing one non-
decaying wave in a linearly degenerate field (systems of composite type). The
second objective is to obtain a similar stability result for initial boundary-
value problems for hyperbolic-parabolic systems, especially to understand the
effect of the boundary. The third objective is to extend the study to contact
discontinuities and rarefaction waves.

The research conducted under this award is relevant for the study of
compressible viscous flows, the motion of viscoelastic materials, gas dynamics
in thermal nonequilibrium, and magnetohydrodynamics. By including viscosity,
heat conduction, electrical resistivity, excited internal structures of
molecules, chemical reactions, and so on we focus on mathematical models that
are closer to the real world than the traditional ideal ones. The project has
three specific objectives. The first objective is to understand the stability
properties of shock profiles in, for example, high-temperature gas flows when
the internal structure of molecules and chemical reactions are no longer
negligible. This problem arises, for example, at the reentry of a space shuttle
into the atmosphere and is quite different from the traditional supersonic
flight of an airplane. The second objective is to better understand gas flows
near a solid surface. The third objective is to study more complete wave
patterns in several cases.
