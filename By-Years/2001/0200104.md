This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Chloroplast gene experssion studies
on the toxic bloom-forming organism Heterosigma akashiwo during resting cell
formation and activation." Massive blooms of the toxic golden-brown alga
Heterosigma akashiwo negatively impact all levels of the food web. It can form a
resting stage which allows it to withstand stressful environmental conditions.
This research examines chloroplast genes involved in environmental recognition
and the regulatory processes that enable Heterosigma to enter and escape
dormancy.
