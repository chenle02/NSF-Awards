This research project seeks to develop a novel reference-free part encapsulation
fixturing technology by extending and further developing the existing phase-
change based fixturing technologies. Several key research issues are addressed
for successful development and implementation of this new fixturing technology.
First, analyses and experiments will be performed for a better understanding of
the mechanical and metallurgical behavior of the filler block which fixes the
part. Second, technologies for dispensing the filler material, controlling
temperatures in casting and handling the filler block will be developed. Third,
the developed technologies will be assembled for automating the machining of
general three-dimensional components that require multiple setups. The
reference-free part encapsulation technology presents some novelty. There exist
many fundamental research issues which need to be addressed before this
technology can be successfully adopted by industry. This investigation will
address these fundamental issues in the development of this technology.
