This project is facilitating the development of major curriculum innovations in
Computational Biology and Computational Chemistry for advanced undergraduates by
providing training in the application of computational methods to experimental
sciences. The purchase of computer workstations with advanced graphics
capability enable the teaching of molecular dynamics and modeling, the addition
of a fluorescence detector to an extant HPLC System allow expansion of the types
of molecules that can be analyzed, and a computer-based digitizer and image
processing system are used for the acquisition of DNA sequence data.
