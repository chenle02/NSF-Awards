An electrophysiology laboratory consisting of a patch-clamp set-up and a
Xenopus oocyte recording set-up will be purchased. These instruments will be
used studying the flux of ions through channels on the cell surface. Among the
systems to be explored are: signaling of the cannabinoid receptor ion channels,
regulation of enterotoxin in the intestinal chloride channel, angiotensin II
action on the paraventriculo-spinal system and the potassium channels and
insulin secretion in transgenic mice.
