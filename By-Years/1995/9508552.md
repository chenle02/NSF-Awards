This proposal includes a thorough exploration of the linear instability
spectrum, using both eigenmode and initial-value methods, and the two
dimensional turbulence that results from the nonlinear growth of these
instabilities. The PI will use measured density and electric field profiles. He
will attempt to clarify the role of short-wavelength instabilities in the
presence of dominant kilometer-scale structures, the distinctions in turbulent
characteristics between the upper electrojet in daytime as well as nighttime.
Finally, he will ascertain (1) the role of velocity shear, much more effective
in damping short-wavelength instabilities than long-wavelength ones, and (2) the
self- regulatory role of velocity shear, not only driven by the ambient electric
fields and neutral wind, but also possibly generated by a dynamo effect due to
the turbulent Reynolds stress at short wavelengths.***
