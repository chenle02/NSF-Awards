The long-term goal of this project is to increase the performance and
functionality of database systems, with a special emphasis on parallel database
systems. Three specific topics currently being addressed are
clustering/declustering of data on secondary storage, probabilistic methods in
query cost estimation and query evaluation, and transparent checkpointing
techniques in parallel persistent programming environments. The research
consists of theoretical studies to gain an understanding of the key problems
involved, followed by analytic studies to compare and contrast alternative
solutions to these key problems, followed by prototype implementations of the
most promising solutions.
