Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project implements an
integrated laboratory experience in the signal and systems area in the
electrical engineering curriculum. The development is based on prior work at
Georgia Tech and uses the telecommunication instructional modeling system (TIMS)
developed there. The project is developing a set of experiments that use the
same laboratory platform in a four-course sequence. Evaluation includes both
quantitative measurements and interviews with two groups of students: one that
completed the new experiments and one that did not. The PI plans to disseminate
their experiments and their assessment results using their web pages and
publications in the education journals. The PI also intends to use the equipment
in two on-campus programs for high school students with diverse backgrounds.
