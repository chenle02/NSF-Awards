9452481 French The project enhances and integrates facilities in the biology and
psychology departments and improves the laboratory experiences of non-biology
and psychology students enrolled in general-education (biology and psychology)
and upper division (psychology) courses. Two laboratories and two learning
centers, connected via the campus network, have been outfitted with computer
controlled laboratory equipment (spectrophotometers, oxygen probes, image
analyzers, A/D converters to allow students to engage in computer-assisted
experimentation and to review exercises. Extensive use of interactive multimedia
(digitized video and audio and videodiscs), virtual instruments, simulations and
on-line access to textbooks supplement all laboratories. The equipment provides
for improved exercises for a general-education biology course, with its unusual
and perhaps unique curriculum of ecology, genetics and evolution, and allowed
the investigators to introduce laboratory experiences into the psychology
courses that lacked them.
