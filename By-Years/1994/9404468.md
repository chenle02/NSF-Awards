9404468 Segert The scope of research entails studying the geometry and analysis
of Yang-Mills fields in mathematical physics in particular the nature of the
non-self-dual fields and their topological significance. It is also proposed to
consider the existence of locally almost complex structures on the six-
dimensional sphere. This research has potential applications to gauge field
theory in mathematical physics. ***
