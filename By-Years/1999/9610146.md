Dr. Robert H. Crabtree, Department of Chemistry, Yale University, is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry
Division for a study of novel types of hydrogen bonding that occur between a
conventional proton donor, an OH or NH group, and an unconventional acceptor, an
M-H or B-H bond (M = Re, Ir). Preliminary data show that these bonds are short,
strong, and bent at the MH or BH unit. During this project examples of inter-
and intramolecular M-H...H-M' and M-H...M' complexes will be synthesized and the
hydrogen bonding in them analyzed using spectroscopic and kinetic data. Specific
issues that will be addressed target include the stabilization of HF complexes,
restricting rotation in dihydrogen complexes by inducing H-bond formation,
perturbing the fluxionality rates of polyhydrides, and increasing the rate of
nucleophilic attack at CO. A solvatochromic method will be evaluated for
characterizing outer sphere H-bonding interactions. Interactions between atoms
and molecules are the most important phenomena that determine the properties of
matter. One type of interaction is called 'hydrogen bonding.' Hydrogen bonding
has been known for many years and is responsible, for example, for many of the
properties of ice and liquid water. Recently, new types of hydrogen bonds that
involve metal-hydrogen units have been discovered. This project aims at
discovering general trends in these new types of hydrogen bonds and at
developing novel hydrogen bonding situations in order to effect useful chemical
transformations.
