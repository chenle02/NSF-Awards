The calling of owls is commonly performed in population studies but nowhere in
the literature is this calling performed through the use of cellular telephone.
This project explores signal processing and audio input/output technologies
coupled with cellular telephones for remote broadcasting, recording and analysis
of Owl vocalizations. The broadcast and record methods are evaluated by the
frequency of Owl responses and the machine recognition rate on labeled
transcriptions of telephone recordings.

This project seeks to demonstrate that signal processing technologies using
cellular telephone transport are a flexible and viable alternative to
conventional call and response methods. Insights gained in this project will
greatly facilitate surveys not only on Great Horned Owls, but on other species
which can be studied by similar methods, such as the Spotted Owls and the
Marbled Murrelet, both of which are federally listed endangered species. Results
will be disseminated in signal processing, sensor applications and biological
science publication venues.
