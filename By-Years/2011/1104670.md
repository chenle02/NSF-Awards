Abstract

Award: DMS-1104670 Principal Investigator: Eduardo Gonzalez

The principal investigator will investigate, using symplectic geometry
techniques, invariants associated to Hamiltonian group actions. The first
project will study (joint with A. Ott, C. Woodward and F. Ziltener) the
construction of gauged Gromov-Witten invariants on punctured surfaces with fixed
holonomies. The PI will also investigate the particular case of toric actions on
affine complex spaces. Our second project is on the study of the invariance of
gauged Gromov-Witten potentials for toric actions on affine spaces. We will use
established formulae to show that for Calabi-Yau wall-crossing the gauged
Gromov-Witten potentials do not change. After this project is finished we will
study the behaviour of the potential in the non-toric case. This will be done
jointly with C. Woodward. Our third proposed activity, joint with H. Iritani,
will explain the relation between Seidel elements and Mirror Transformations for
nef toric non-singular projective varieties. We will then try to apply our
methods to the non-nef case. Our last proposed project with A. Cotton-Clay will
attempt to resolve a conjecture due to M. Thaddeus relating Floer cohomology for
symplectomorphisms and orbifold (stacky) cohomology for global quotients by
finite groups.

Our research will advance the interplay of several subjects in mathematics and
physics where symmetries play a relevant role. The first project in this grant
will advance the understanding and applications of symplectic geometry and gauge
theory (the modern language of elementary particle physics) into physical
theories called "gauged sigma models". Our other projects will provide a
different approach to the Mirror Symmetry phenomena using symplectic geometry
invariants.
