NER: Energy Transport in Microtubules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt
;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microtubules are very important biological
polymers that support the structure and function of cells. They are about 25 nm
in diameter and often grow to many microns in length. However, microtubule
length is rarely constant. During growth a chemical reaction takes place that
releases energy. This energy is stored within the microtubule and contributes to
the sudden change to a disassembling state. Little is known about the energy
storage and possible energy transport along microtubules. The very regular
structure of the microtubule together with the fact that the small segments of
microtubules have an electric dipole moment suggest that energy transport
through dipole-dipole interactions is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We aim to
investigate the possibility of energy transfer by chemically attaching
artificial atoms (colloidal quantum dots) to bundles of microtubules. Using
light, dipoles can be induced inside the artificial atoms, thus providing a way
to initiate and read-out energy transport. Evidence of this type of energy
transport could have a major impact on the understanding of cell
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
