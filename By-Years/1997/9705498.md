9705498 Holtz This grant supports the creation of a new educational program
which leads to a Master's of Science Degree in Applied Physics. The novel
approach is to interweave two long-semester internships in the regional high-
tech semiconductor industry with courses in applied physics and outside
electives at Texas Tech. These are aimed at building on the undergraduate degree
and are focused toward basic principles of semiconductor materials, processes,
and fabrication. The program offers students training in some of the world's
most sophisticated laboratories with state-of- the-art equipment in subject
areas of national need. This provides them with a vital edge in a highly
competitive job market. This effort will assist in producing alternatives for
broadening the academic experience beyond traditional graduate training. %%%
This grant from the Division of Materials Research is one of the first awarded
in an attempt to find innovative methods to integrate research and education. It
is also cosponsored by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. ***
