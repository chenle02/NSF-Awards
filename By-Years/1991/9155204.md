Georgetown University seeks funding for a two year leadership program in
dynamical modeling for 15 District of Columbia area high school teachers. The
participants, four three-member teams from each of four area school districts
and one three-member team from the private schools, will be selected from
teachers who have participated in an existing program in dynamical modeling at
Georgetown University. The participants will meet several times during the first
school year further develop, implement and monitor progress of results from the
dynamical modeling project. They will then attend a two-week summer leadership
training workshop to develop an in-depth inservice course to be team-taught to
other teachers in their school system in the succeeding two years. During the
intervening summer, participants and PI's will attend a one-week evaluation
seminar. Four follow-up seminars will be held during each of the two academic
years to monitor progress of the inservice courses. Cost sharing by the
university and the schools constitutes 27% of the award.
