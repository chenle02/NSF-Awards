This project consists of research and education in economic theory at
Northwestern University. The research is an extension of my recent work on
repeated games with private monitoring. This is an active area of research among
game theorists with many open questions and few generally useful sets of
analytical techniques. These are important games to analyze because they have
many economically important applications. An often cited, but as yet unsolved,
example is the secret price cutting game introduced by Stigler. While it is
well-known how oligopolistic firms can sustain collusion when there is available
a publicly observable statistic of past performance, it is an open question
whether this sort of behavior survives as an equilibrium when information is
private as in Stigler's model.

In a recent paper, Juuso Valimaki and I have proven a version of the notorious
"folk theorem" for the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game with private monitoring.
This result states that collusive outcomes can be sustained in equilibrium when
the players are sufficiently patient and monitoring is good enough. In this
proposal I show how the techniques used in that paper can be generalized to
other games, including a standard model of duopoly. The collusive result extends
to this duopoly model. This shows that our techniques have the potential to
provide a general approach to repeated games. The research I propose is to
develop these techniques and apply them to economic problems: One such problem
is the Stigler model. Another set of problems is described in the proposal under
the heading "Bad Reputations."

The educational activities I propose are designed to promote graduate research
in economic theory at Northwestern by stimulating student participation in the
theory seminar series. I would like to organize and run a weekly research
seminar in which students are required to critically read papers to be presented
in the week's workshop, meet as a group to discuss the paper and prepare to be
an informed participant in the actual seminar.
