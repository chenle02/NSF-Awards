This NSF CAREER project represents an effort towards the development of embedded
control software that is correct by design. The pursuit of this ambitious
objective relies on novel ideas fostering a paradigm shift in embedded software
design by integrating control with software design. In particular, through the
use of finite abstractions of continuous control systems, control theoretic
ideas are being applied to the design of software enforcing dynamic constraints
(control), software constraints (e.g., shared resources, real-time properties)
and hardware constraints (e.g., power consumption, execution times). In addition
to alleviating the need for testing and formal verification this research is
also developing automated synthesis methods allowing for faster design cycles
and an increase in functionality and complexity of embedded applications. This
correct by construction approach to embedded control software design has
immediate technological, economical and societal consequences triggered by a
reduction in software development time and cost. Furthermore, the research
outcome of this project is also contributing to the advancement in
functionality, robustness and dependability of the large networks of embedded
systems that are becoming essential infrastructures of our society. Important
contributions to graduate and undergraduate education complement the research
component of the project. A new graduate course on verification and synthesis of
embedded control systems is being offered at Notre Dame. The lecture notes
supporting this course will be published to further disseminate the novel ideas
developed in the context of this project and to promote the creation of similar
courses in other universities. Undergraduate education at Notre Dame is being
improved through the participation of undergraduate students in research and by
revising the laboratorial component of the introductory course to electrical
networks in order to familiarize second year electrical engineering students
with embedded systems and basic skills in embedded programming.
