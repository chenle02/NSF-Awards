Holy Cross has recently established a Psychobiology/ Neuroscience concentration.
The goal of this program is to provide a structured approach towards studying
brain (nervous system and behavior relationships). The current proposal asks for
equipment to establish a Neuroscience Lab course that would focus on teaching
neuroanatomy and cell physiology. In addition to the Neuroscience course, this
equipment would be used by students in research projects and would integrate
into a number of related courses and labs in both the Biology and Psychology
Departments.
