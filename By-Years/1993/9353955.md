9353955 Cassidy This project is designed to enhance the ability of experienced
faculty members to teach polymer chemistry, an area which has become an integral
factor in electronics, space exploration and medical applications. The two-year
project includes (1) a two-week intensive residential seminar at Southwest Texas
State for twenty faculty members selected from colleges throughout central
Texas, (2) a two-semester internship at Southwest Texas State for four of those
faculty members, selected on the basis of interest and aptitude, (3) trips to
national and regional meetings for the Project Director and as many as fourteen
participants, and (4) an ongoing advisory group of thirteen regional colleges
and SWT staff, for continued support. ***
