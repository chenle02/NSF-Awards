This work will combine geometric problems with Fourier analysis in a concerted
effort to exploit the symmetry structure of manifolds in determining that basic
analytic inequalities for natural operators such as convolution, Fourier
transforms, fractional integration, Poisson integrals and their generators.
These are the mathematical instruments which characterize analysis on function
spaces over a manifold. The thrust of the research will be to understand
analysis on global manifolds defined by the classical Lie groups and their
associated symmetric spaces, especially the rank one non-compact symmetric
spaces with hyperbolic geometry, defined over real, complex or quaterionic
numbers. Using conformal transformations such as the Cayley transform and
stereographic projection, one shows that problems on these non-compact domains
have equivalent realizations on compact domains associated with the rotation and
unitary groups as well as boundary manifolds such as the Heisenberg group. The
main tool in this work is the use of the underlying symmetry structure of the
manifolds to prove sharp fractional integral inequalities. Such results provide
as immediate consequences sharp Sobolev estimates for differential operators and
other infinitesimal generators associated with differentiability. These
inequalities have wide application to problems in differential geometry, non-
linear partial differential equations, mathematical physics and probability. In
addition, connections may be made to variational problems in string theory
associated with conformal metrics.
