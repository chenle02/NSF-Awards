9603138 Zeng This award supports a three year cooperative program on fluid
nucleation between Xiao Zeng, University of Nebraska, and Wang Wenchuan and Gu
Guangtu, Beijing University of Chemical Technology. The project involves
participation of two graduate students from Nebraska, who will visit China to
participate in the computation component of the research. This project proposes
to advance work funded under CTS 9413301 to develop a nucleation theory based on
statistical mechanics which would agree with the experimental facts previously
unexplained by other nucleation theories. The nucleation theory to be developed
in this project has relevance to the formation of hazardous aerosols,
photochemical smog, acid rain and in other areas of environmental science. The
proposed collaboration involves work on the theoretical aspects of the program
at Nebraska, and work on the computation component of the research in Beijing.
The project will be supported on the Chinese side by the National Natural
Science Foundation of China.
