9409439 Kiasaleh Although fiber-optics systems are known to be quite reliable in
terms of probability of bit error, multiple-access systems such as fiber-optic
code-division multiple-access (FO-CDMA) systems suffer from user-induced
interference. Other optical channels, such as free-space optical channels, are
impaired by other adverse link conditions, such as pointing error, turbulence,
small received signal power, etc. Error control coding is an important means of
achieving the needed improvement in the performance of photon channels. In
particular, convolutional codes have been recognized as the suitable coding
scheme for high bit rate photon channels. The focus of this research is on the
introduction and performance evaluation of a recently proposed jointly optimal
synchronizer/decoder receiver structures, known as Joint Viterbi Decoder
(JVD)and Enhanced Viterbi Decoder (EVD), for convolutionally-encoded pulse-
position modulation (PPM) and overlapping PPM (OPPM) systems. The objective here
is to introduce compact, implementable decoders that can achieve near optimum
performances. A very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) implementation of the
proposed decoder will also be attempted. ***
