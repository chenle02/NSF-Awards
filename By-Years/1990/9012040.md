A theory of judgmental illusions proposed by the investigator in his recent
book, "Patterns, Thinking, and Cognition," will be tested experimentally. The
theory claims that people evaluate decision situations by calling to mind
familiar scenarios. Such scenarios are often stored in related pairs in a
person's memory. The theory claims that many judgmental errors occur when
situational cues summon the inappropriate scenario from the relevant pair. A
series of experiments will be conducted to manipulate the salience of specific
scenarios. This work will add to our understanding of the way people make
decisions, and suggest ways of improving decision making by generating clues for
how people can select the most appropriate scenario for the current problem
situation.
