This research is on performance driven partitioning for high speed and high
density circuit design. Tools for an automatic partitioning system which divides
circuits from the system level to basic layout modules are being developed. For
systems of several million gates, a technique, called the ratio cut, is used to
define the hierarchy of the system. The ratio cut is used to identify the
cluster structure and thus organize the system into a tree structure. A
heuristic ratio cut algorithm is being explored for use in hierarchal
partitioning of the design. Once a partition has been made there is an
optimization problem. Solutions to this problem are being investigated using
neural nets, partitioning on special graphs and other methods.
