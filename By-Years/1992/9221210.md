9221210 Swanson Fundamental aspects of point defects and self-compensation
phenomena in II-VI semiconductors will be studied using perturbed angular
correlation(PAC) measurements, and relating the data to optical, electrical and
magnetic properties. The atomic configurations, stabilities, defect mobilities
and ionization energies of various charge- compensated donor-defect complexes
will be determined. By studying these defects as a function of temperature and
annealing treatments it is sought 1)to understand in detail their structure and
behavior, 2)to determine the influence of such complexes on bulk properties, and
3)to determine the optimum conditions for minimizing the formation of
undesirable charge-compensated defects, and maximizing the activation of donor
impurities. Both bulk and thin film materials will be studied. %%% By
correlating microscopic PAC observations with bulk electrical and optical
properties, it is anticipated that the specific information gained on the nature
and significance of defects and defect interactions in wide- and narrow-gap II-
VI semiconductors will provide broad insight into the behavior of defects
systems in general. This deeper understanding will enable scientists and
technologists greater facility in the design and synthesis of devices using
these materials, such as infrared sensors, lightemitting diodes, and
semiconductor lasers, which, in turn, may yield improvements in integrated
circuits used in computing, information processing, and telecommunications. ***
