This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like humans, ground-dwelling birds
(ostriches, emus, chickens, guineafowl, etc.) move by alternate motion of their
two legs. Avian bipedal locomotion is well described in two dimensions (from
side view), but the movements of the limb bones in three dimensions have never
been characterized. This study will use two x-ray systems to record high-speed
video of the hind limb skeleton of guineafowl as they stand, move forward at
different speeds, and turn. These extremely accurate motion data will provide
the first complete description of 3-D hip, knee, and ankle rotations.
Simultaneously, a highly sensitive scale will measure the foot's push against
the ground. Combining accurate motion (kinematics) and ground force data will
allow calculation of the joint forces and torques (kinetics) that bones,
muscles, and ligaments must produce/resist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's
goal is to understand the contribution of non-planar movement and loading to
bipedal locomotion in birds. These results will illuminate aspects of limb
design among today?s avian diversity, enhance the functional interpretation of
fossils, and potentially fundamentally change the scientific community's vision
of running vertebrates. Understanding the mechanisms of 3-D limb movements in
birds could lead to advances in therapies/prosthetics for human gait disorders.
The proposed research will have broader impacts in graduate and undergraduate
student training, enhancement of research infrastructure through biplanar x-ray
motion analysis, and broadening participation by including local high-school
science teachers in summer lab experience.&lt;br/&gt;
