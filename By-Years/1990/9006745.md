This project provides resources to procure equipment to enhance research in the
active control of vibrations and normal mode localization. Specifically, the
research entails (1) understanding the phenomenon of mode localization in both
periodic and non periodic structures, (2) active control of structural
vibrations based on mode localization, and (3) the experimental validation of a
recently developed frequency domain design. The equipment will be used to
instrument two experimental facilities associated with this research. One
facility is a long compliant truss structure dedicated to normal mode
localization studies in periodic structures, and the other is a simply supported
thin flexible beam for localization studies in non periodic structures. The
equipment comprises a portable digital storage oscilloscope, brushless DC torque
motors, power supplies and amplifiers for the torque motors, a non contacting
displacement measuring system, and modal analysis equipment.
