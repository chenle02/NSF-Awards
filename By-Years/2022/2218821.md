The Gordon Research Conference on Correlated Electron Systems provides an
opportunity for scientists, especially graduate students and postdoctoral
students, to learn and to be exposed to the latest developments in correlated
electron materials. The biannual occurrence of these meetings is well-suited to
the rapid pace of discovery in the physics of quantum and strongly correlated
materials. The unique climate of Gordon Research Conferences, which encourage
the presentation of unpublished, cutting-edge developments, while also promoting
an informal, friendly atmosphere in which attendees, particularly students and
postdocs, can gain ready access to world experts in the field, make this a very
attractive meeting. Moreover, the low-cost accommodation at Mount Holyoke
college, and the close vicinity of the meeting to institutions in the North-East
and Mid-west, make this a meeting that is geographically and financially
accessible to a large number of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
