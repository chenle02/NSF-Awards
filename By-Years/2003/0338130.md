This collaborative project (with the Naval Postgraduate School) is a study of
heat, momentum, and salinity exchange in the upper ocean as a component of the
German Antarctic Program's Ice Station Polarstern (ISPOL) project, a planned
fifty-day drift in the western Weddell Sea in November-December 2004. Two
instrument clusters will measure the three-dimensional current, temperature, and
salinity structure, to characterize the ambient oceanic turbulence structure.
&lt;br/&gt;These data will provide the quantitative estimates of the eddy
viscosity and diffusivity profiles in the upper ocean necessary for realistic
modeling of scalar distributions and fluxes in the ice/upper ocean system,
including fluxes of nutrients. In the event that the drift of Polarstern
encounters the continental shelf, the turbulence measuring system, designed for
depths in excess of 500 m, may be used for limited studies of the bottom
boundary layer. This would add a useful dimension to the experiment, by making
direct flux measurements in a density flow transporting cold bottom water off of
the eastern Antarctic Peninsula shelf. The work continues a collaboration with
scientists from the international community interested in the Southern Ocean
south of 60 deg South that began with planning for Ice Station Weddell in 1990.
It provides an opportunity for American participation in a German-led experiment
with good potential for cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques for
understanding high latitude air-sea-ice interaction. It includes partial support
for a postdoctoral researcher and the opportunity to advise postgraduate thesis
work.&lt;br/&gt;
