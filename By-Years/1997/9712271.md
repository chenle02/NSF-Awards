9712271 Kydd *** This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project seeks
to develop an innovative new chemistry for printing metallic conductors on
temperature-sensitive substrates. The university partner has pioneered in the
creation of Thin Film Transistors (TFTs) for Active Matrix Liquid Crystal
Displays (AMLCDs) by printing technology. The small firm and university research
groups have joined to demonstrate a new technology for printing the
metallization on large arrays of TFTS. This will eliminate most or all of the
expensive photolithography required to produce AMLCDs and reduce the cost of
manufacturing the displays by as much as half. Preliminary work has identified
bonding between the printed metallization and the silicon or glass substrates as
the key technical barrier. The objective of this proposed program is to identify
solutions to the bonding problem and demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost
printed TFT arrays. The work proposed will make AMLCDs that are bigger, cheaper
and much easier to produce. This will result in really large, low cost displays
that can be used for picture-on-the- wall HDTV. ***
