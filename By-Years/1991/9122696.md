In cognitive psychology, theoretical models of the mental processes underlying
cognitive abilities are proposed, tested and revised on the basis of patterns of
performance over a range of cognitive tasks in single-case and group studies
involving subjects with varying degrees of brain damage. A theory of cognition
is a modular functional architecture that provides a computationally explicit,
information-processing account of how the mental representations required to
perform these cognitive tasks are produced. Professor Bub is continuing his
research applying Dr. Clark Glymour's `bootstrapping' account of relevant
evidence to a current methodological controversy in cognitive neuropsychology,
concerning the relation between theory and evidence from single-case and group
studies on brain-damaged and normal subjects. Professor Bub has reformulated the
original project as an aspect of the general problem of how to reliably infer
causal relations (representing a model of cognition) from probability relations
(representing performance data from normal and brain-damaged subjects). This new
investigation concerns the status of some of the assumptions that guarantee the
existence of a reliable methodology for cognitive neuropsychology, as well as
the single-case versus group studies problem that motivated the original
inquiry.
