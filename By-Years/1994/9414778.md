9414778 Trumper The award is for research to analyze, construct, and test a
precision magnetically-suspended six degree-of-freedom motion control stage with
25 angstrom resolution. The workspace is 25 mm by 25 mm by 100 micrometers. The
stage will have a repeatability of 5 nanometers, and an accuracy of 20
nanometers. The stage uses a hybrid magnetic/fluid bearing structure, the oil
providing mechanical damping and the electromagnetic actuators imposing control
forces. Integrated circuit capacitance displacement probes will be developed as
will a multipass laser interferometer with enhanced resolution. Mechanical
designs and electromagnetic actuator topologies to achieve the desired travel
and actuator goals will also de developed. System integration and control issues
will also be addressed. The stage will enable imaging of groups of atoms in
conjunction with probed microscopes. In addition, it would be useful for
measurements associated with present and future generations of integrated
circuits, photo-masks, and micromechaical actuators.
