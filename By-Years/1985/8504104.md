This project will focus on the development of computer algorithms for
daylighting effectiveness and energy performance impacts for lightshelves and
atriums based primarily on building characteristics and configuration aspects.
Both direct sun and diffuse sky conditions will be utilized. A rigorously based
experimental model testing program will be conducted in the existing skydome
facility to complement full-scale studies with existing buildings. The end
products will be achieved through correlational studies and building performance
simulations utilizing available computer facilities. The research will lead to a
more rational building design procedure for energy utilization and daylighting.
