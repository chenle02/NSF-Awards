By 2030, according to the World Health Organization, 6 out of 10 human beings
will live in cities. A century ago, only 2 out of 10 did. To understand the
wide-ranging implications and challenges of this rapid transformation of the
typical human habitat, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program funds scientific
research on contemporary urban environments. The focus of this project is the
changing nature of urban public space. In parks, squares, and sidewalks, city
dwellers encounter each other and engage in public activities that help forge
the bonds of community and citizenship. Historically, access to such spaces has
been uneven across urban populations. This research project seeks to understand
the changing functions of urban public space today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Julian B. Brash of Montclair State University will carry out the research in New
York City. Many American cities have seen restrictions on the use of public
spaces and the conversion of public spaces into private ones. However, recently
a number of new, high profile urban public spaces with more open access have
been constructed. A particularly prominent example is a mile-long linear park
built on an abandoned, elevated spur of the New York Central Railway. Using this
new space as a case example, the researcher will investigate who uses such
spaces, for what purposes, and how they relate to broader political, economic,
social, and cultural changes in the urban environment. The researcher employs a
mixed-methods scientific strategy. He and his team will conduct a formal survey
of park users; carry out systematic behavioral observation scans; sample and
analyze de-identified social media communications generated at the park; and
carry out archival and other secondary source research. This project will
generate knowledge about the changing functions and meanings of urban public
space that will help build a new social scientific science of contemporary human
environments.
