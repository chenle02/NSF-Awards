The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University will conduct a study of the
evaluations done on EHR science and mathematics education projects. The purpose
of this study is to describe the current state of practice and to compare this
with the Standards for Educational Evaluation that represent the accepted goals
for evaluation in the education field. The study by Western Michigan University
has three elements. The first is a metaevaluation of the evaluations done for 40
EHR projects as well as generating example materials of interest to the field.
Second, WMU will conduct training in evaluation through two institutes, two
conferences will introduce the issue of internships. The conferences will
introduce the issue of evaluation at NSF to a broad audience and provide a forum
for discussion of the study findings. Institutes will provide month-long, in-
depth training in NSF educational evaluations. Internships will be an extension
of the institute, providing continuing opportunities for evaluation experience
with NSF projects. The third element in the study is providing support services
for the first two activities, including electronic dissemination of the results,
technical assistance to projects base on the findings, and development of a
directory of science and mathematics education evaluators.
