0233810&lt;br/&gt;Heineman&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation enhancement award
supports a graduate student from William Heineman's lab at the University of
Cincinnati during here two-month tenure in the lab of Gunther Wittstock in the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Oldenburg, Germany. The goal of the
research is to develop an ultrasensitive and miniaturized immunoassy applicable
to clinical diagnostics and detection of biowarfare agents. The goal will be met
using scanning electrochemical microscopy in to perform and detect the
immunoassay. Using microbeads as a mobile solid phase for immounoassay increases
the surface area to volume ratio, since they can be dispersed without solution,
which minimizes diffusion distances. This research could lead to new
technologies for high-density chip-based testing systems and could benefit in
the detection of biowarfare agents such as toxins, bacteria, spores, and
viruses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has a clear educational
objective. The project will allow a graduate student to benefit from performing
research in another country. She will develop a heightened appreciation of the
world while also learning important new technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;
