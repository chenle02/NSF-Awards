This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing research of
Professor Nicholas J. Turro at Columbia University. Results from this research
will provide fundamental information about the behavior of reactive
intermediates in restricted spaces. The research includes studies of excited
molecules and reactive intermediates on organized molecular surfaces and
cavities. One aspect of this study is the interaction of excited state molecules
that are complexed to DNA. There are several general areas to which attention
will be given in this project: (1) development of new techniques to detect and
study reactive species that are produced by photolysis of molecules; (2) a study
of radical pairs adsorbed on surfaces: (3) an investigation of flexible
biradicals in homogeneous solution and in restricted spaces; (4) metal complexes
as probes of binding of DNA structure and photoelectron transfer processes on
DNA; and (5) research on photoinduced electron transfer on starburst dendrimers.
