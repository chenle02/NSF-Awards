Although Energy Management and Control Systems have contributed significantly to
the reduction (20-40%) of energy use in buildings without sacrificing occupants'
comfort, their full capabilities have not been completely realized. This is
primarily due to their inability to quickly detect and compensate for failures
in the Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. In fact, no
matter how good the control scheme for the HVAC system might be, the presence of
undetected faults can completely wipe out any expected savings. This research
focuses on the problem of fault detection and diagnosis of HVAC systems. The
primary goal of this project is to develop an efficient methodology based on
extended Kalman filtering and Maximum Likelihood system identification for the
detection and diagnosis of faults in HVAC systems and to demonstrate its
effectiveness through application to an air handler system. The methodology is
to be powerful enough to permit rapid on-line fault detection and diagnosis and
yet be implementable on a personal computer. Also, color graphic display
capability is to be incorporated to aid the operator in monitoring the state of
the system. To enhance the Phase III commercialization effort that will follow,
a prototype system will be developed and tested.
