9627814 Barnes Magmatic intrusion is commonly assumed to play a role in
continual extension but the casual relationships between extension and intrusion
are poorly understood. This project aims to establish the relationship between
intrusion and deformation in deep-seated exposures in a Cordilleran metamorphic
core complex by study of a sequence of intrusion emplaced in the Northern Basin
Range, Nevada, a highly extended area. In this setting, exposures in the
Lamoille Canyon, Northern Ruby Mountains provides a combination of excellent
exposure, abundant syn extensional intrusions and a significant base of
geochronological and structural data. This work involves petrologic, geochemical
and isotopic study of granites to track the temporal compositional variations
and to use these data to estimate the evolution's of the mid-crustal magmas
during and after extensional episodes. Results are expected to help establish
the changing conditions of melt generations and emplacement during crustal
stretching, and to help test the role that magmatism plays in deep crustal
deformation.
