This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a method
of fabricating integrated optical circuits (IOCs) using alternate waveguide
materials (AWMs). Currently, IOCs comprise silica glass waveguides, and are
patterned using an expensive, multi-step photolithography process in conjunction
with high temperature deposition techniques. However, AWMs are associated with
lower glass transition temperatures, and have the potential of patterning
optical circuits through alternate printing methods, bypassing the
photolithography process. This will dramatically reduce the complexity and hence
the cost of photonic device manufacture. Another important advantage of AWMs is
lower minimum attenuation levels, possibly one to two orders of magnitude lower
than that of silica glass. This is critical for long waveguide applications such
as integrated optic delay lines for telecommunications, integrated optic
gyroscopes, and more sensitive chemical sensors. In addition, because some
alternate materials can host rare earth elements, the development of AWMs has
further applications for improved optical switches, amplifiers, and solid-state
blue lasers. This project will establish the feasibility of fabricating optical
circuits comprising AWMs. Improved fabrication of optical waveguide circuits has
the immediate potential for integrated optic amplifiers, lossless splitters, and
up conversion blue fiber lasers, essential to numerous commercial applications
in optical storage, color printing, and projection, up converters, isolators and
fluorescent coolers, as well as convenient, low-cost solid-state laser sources
for the laboratory.
