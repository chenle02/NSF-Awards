McClean OCE-9633049 Observations from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE) will be compared with the output of a very realistic high resolution
global ocean circulation model by extracting model fields co-located in both
time and space with the observations and conducting identical analyses the
statistics of the ocean circulation. In regions where the model simulation
behaves with an acceptable degree of realism as determined by these comparisons,
a conceptual synthesis of model output and observations will be used for
interpretative and dynamical studies and to extend the temporal and spatial
coverage of the WOCE observations. In particular, seasonal, interannual and some
aspect of decadal variability will be examined using the validated fields. In
cases where the model is found to be lacking, explanations for the deficiencies
will be determined and improvements suggested for implementation in future
simulations.
