9503487 ARNOSTI The rates at which organic macromolecules are mineralized, and
variations in degradation rates with location, depth, and season are critical
aspects in calculating the turnover rates of oceanic organic carbon. Recent
studies have suggested that large dissolved polymers, particularly
polysaccharides, may be rapidly cycled within the upper ocean. There are
currently few methods, however, to directly measure the hydrolysis of organic
macromolecules in marine environments. The objective of this pilot project is to
test and apply a new method to measure hydrolysis rates of polysaccharides in
marine environments. The method is based on synthesis of fluorescent-labeled
polysaccharides (FLA- polysaccharides) which can be added to seawater or
sediments. Enzymatic hydrolysis of FLA-polysaccharides yields labeled fragments
of lower molecular weight. The molecular weight changes of FLA-polysaccharide
are determined using gel permeation chromatography. The end result is a profile
showing changes in FLA- polysaccharides molecular weight vs. time.
