This award provides supplemental funding to EAR 9204563 for the collaborative
study with Chinese scientists of high-grade metamorphic rocks in central China.
The objectives are to map several metamorphic belts, to study the mineralogy of
the high pressure rocks there, to delineate mineral parageneses and to establish
geologic ages for several critical rock units. The study will lead to a better
understanding of how continental crust was subjected to mantle depths, and later
exhumed.
