AST-0138942&lt;br/&gt;University of Arkansas at
Fayetteville&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sears is awarded funds to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in space and planetary sciences at
the recently established Arkansas-Oklahoma Center for Space and Planetary
Sciences, jointly run by the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville and the
Oklahoma State University, Stillwater. Twelve students from regional schools
will be placed into research groups. The research groups at the Center involve
chemists, biologists, geologists, physicists and mechanical engineers who are
interested in the biological and geological processes occurring on Mars, the
geological evolution of asteroids, and the design and construction of equipment
to be placed on missions. Most of the research projects will make use of the
Andromeda planetary environmental chamber recently donated by NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to the University of Arkansas. In addition to
participating in research projects, the students will meet weekly with students
from the other campus, visit a local aerospace company, and take a field trip to
NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston.&lt;br/&gt;
