Work continues on efforts to elucidate the flow characteristics of viscoelastic
fluids through complex geometries, using experimental results coupled with
detailed mathematical models. The research examines the problems caused when
elastic effects are comparable to or greater than viscous effects. Flow through
a sudden contraction and flow around a sphere are analyzed with a two-color
laser-Doppler velocimeter. This project is the first successful effort to model
such non-Newtonian fluid flow that incorporates shear and elongation in the
finite difference numerical solutions.
