Dr. David B. Rozema has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Rozema received the doctoral degree from the University of
Wisconsin at Madison under the supervision of Professor Samuel H. Gellman. Dr.
Rozema will continue research at the University of Utah under the sponsorship of
Professor Dale Poulter. The postdoctoral research investigates of the mechanism
of the enzyme, protein farnesyl transferase, a member of the general family of
protein isoprenyl transferases that catalyze the posttranslation modification of
many membrane-bound proteins. The research focuses on the role of zinc in
substrate binding, the nature of the interaction between zinc and peptide
substrate, and the participation of zinc in the transition state of the
reaction. The enzyme is a target for anticancer therapies. The Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
