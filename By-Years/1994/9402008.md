9402008 Davis This grant will support a unique combination of laboratory and
numerical modeling of the tectonic behavior of thick sediment sequences in
accretionary prisms. Three directions of research will be pursued: mechanical
behavior and stability of deforming wedges and the conditions under which both
thrust and normal faults can co-occur; interactions of mechanical deformation
and fluid flow and how shallow structures are controlled by conditions at depth;
deformation of highly porous sediments at the toe of the wedge. ***
