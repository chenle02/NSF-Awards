The stratospheric ozone layer has been diminished as a consequence of
anthropogenic release of chlorofluorocarbons. The thinning ozone results in
increased levels of harmful ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation relative to less
harmful ultraviolet A (UV-A) and visible light (VIS). Ultraviolet damage to
marine phytoplankton cells have been limited to bulk calculations which do not
take into consideration variability of damage between individual cells. The
single cell gel (SSG) comet assay is capable of measuring DNA damage and repair
in individual cells. We propose to use this technique to measure the effects of
UV-B radiation on DNA damage in marine phytoplankton species and in their
capacity to repair. Phytoplankton growing under culture conditions will be
exposed in the laboratory to ambient irradiance levels of UV-B, UV-A and VIS to
stimulate present and enhanced UV radiation. The ability of phytoplankton cells
to repair DNA will be estimated to subsequent exposure to white light, to induce
repair; and yellow light, to suppress repair. Results of these experiments will
make an important contribution regarding the usefulness of a novel method to
measure UV-induced DNA damage and repair in phytoplankton.
