Dr. Daniel Young will be studying the fire-colored beetles of the genus
Pseudopyrochroa. This is a diverse group whose species-level taxonomy and
evolution are poorly understood. Dr. Young will be studying museum collections,
and amassing a unique database concerning larval and adult traits. These data
will lead to significant advances in our understanding of their evolutionary and
biogeographic history. Basic "alpha-level" studies such as this one are the
essential first steps in understanding the biodiversity of an organismal group.
Without such fundamental research, subsequent studies of physiology, behavior,
ecology, and evolution cannot proceed. This study will be a significant
contribution to our understanding of the beetles, which are the most diverse
living group on earth.
