9504764 Goldman The proposal deals with various classical geometries and their
discrete automorphism groups: complex hyperbolic geometry, spherical Cauchy-
Riemann geometry, flat Lorentzian geometry, conformal geometry and real
projective geometry are to be studied. These geometries are all generalizations
of the geometry of the hyperbolic plane, yet they lack totally geodesic
hypersurfaces making it difficult to build fundamental polyhedra - one can
construct discrete automorphism groups directly from fundamental polyhedra. A
related topic dealing with representation spaces of surface groups is also
contained in the proposal: these spaces can be identified with moduli spaces of
holomorphic vector bundles over Riemann surfaces, hence have ramifications in
algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. Hyperbolic geometry is the oldest
known non-Euclidean geometry, and possesses many interesting properties not
encountered in Euclidean geometry. Discrete automorphism groups are closely
related to regular polyhedra, and finding them in a non-Euclidean geometry can
often be difficult. Collections of these groups are also related to certain
gauge theories arising in mathematical physics.
