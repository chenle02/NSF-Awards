This Minority Research Center of Excellence (MRCE) project at Clark Atlanta
University represents the establishment of a Center for Theoretical Studies of
Physical Systems (CTSPS). The Center will consolidate and expand existing
research capabilities in physics through the development of interdisciplinary
research clusters in: (1) atomic and molecular theory; (2) quantum few/many body
problems; and (3) mathematical physics and applied mathematics. The clusters
will strengthen ties with several national and international scientific
institutions. This MRCE is located within an area that has the largest
consortium of private minority institutions in this nation. The CTSPS will play
a major role in increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in
science and engineering. The Center will mount a comprehensive mentoring and
tutoring program to encourage more precollege and undergraduate students to
pursue doctoral degrees in the physical sciences. Researchers at the Center
will: (1) conduct a science academy in mathematics; (2) involve capable high
school students in research; and (3) work with precollege physics teachers
through workshops, seminars, and visually appealing scientific demonstrations.
The CTSPS faculty members are well respected in the scientific community because
of their publications in refereed journals and their participation in national
and international professional conferences. Because of this record, the Center
will conduct a feasibility study for a Ph.D. program in physics during the
fourth year of existence. Collaborations will be strengthened with the physics
departments of MIT, Georgia Tech, Stanford, and the University of Wisconsin. In
addition, ties will be maintained with the Center for Theoretical Physics in
Trieste, Italy.
