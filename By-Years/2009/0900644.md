This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The objective of this research award is to assemble conjugated, interpenetrating
networks in fibers by freeze-drying nanoparticles in the fibers and gain a
fundamental understanding of the mechanism for creating such networks. The
research approach is three-fold, 1) assemble nanoparticles into a forest of thin
fibers; 2) investigate the unidirectional growth of these thin fibers in-situ
and in 3D; and 3) establish a fundamental understanding of the role of surface
tension in the assembly process.

The ability to engineer nanoparticles and allow them to form rarely observed
nanofibers will add significantly to the body of knowledge regarding to material
processing and manufacturing. More importantly, when these nanoparticles are
made of conjugated polymers, the thin fibers are expected to be a novel building
block for organic photovoltaic cells with superior photon-to-electron conversion
efficiency unachievable in current technology. Graduate and undergraduate
engineering students and high school teachers will benefit through classroom
instruction and summer research involvement.
