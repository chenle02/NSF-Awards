The educational goal of the experiments to be carried out with this system is
to provide the student with a quantitative approach to vacuum technology and
serve as an introduction to surface physics phenomena. The facility will enable
experiments that investigate the physics of producing and measuring a vacuum,
the interaction of atoms with solid surfaces, and electron beam experiments.
