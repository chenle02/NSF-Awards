The objective of the proposed research is to identify and quantify the
conditions that lead to carbide oxidation and to investigate the use of
promoters and promoted supports to improve the stability of these catalysts.
Because of its widespread use in other applications, the project will focus only
on molybdenum carbide catalysts. Since it is likely that catalyst stability is
highly dependent on redox chemistry, the first stage of the proposed research
will focus on determining the effects of reactant/product compositions on the
oxidation kinetics of bulk molybdenum carbide catalysts synthesized by various
methods to produce relatively high surface areas per unit mass. Since excess
synthesis carbon can lead to subsequent coking problems, the catalyst synthesis
protocol will be carried out so that excess carbon can be controlled or
eliminated. The methodology will consist of dynamic x-ray diffraction and TGA/MS
experiments (at reforming conditions), combined with appropriate catalyst
characterization techniques (FTIR, XPS, SEM/TEM). In the second stage of the
proposed work, the PI will investigate methods to increase the range of catalyst
stability through the use of supported molybdenum carbide catalysts, promoted
with an in oxygen buffer (curia). Parameters to be investigated in this phase of
the project will include the characteristics of the support (surface area,
acidity), the catalyst synthesis methodology and the catalyst/promoter loading.
This project has the potential to provide a more efficient route for making
hydrogen for fuel cells.
