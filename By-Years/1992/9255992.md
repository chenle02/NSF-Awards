Northern Arizona University will initiate a five-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in ecology and environmental science for 45 students entering
the 10th and 11th grades. This summer year program will offer training in
ancillary skills needed to do substantive research and a research experience in
one of two long-term ecological research sites: (1) in the Chuska Mountains (AZ)
or (2) in a salt- marsh ecosystem in Massachusetts. The long-term research sites
were developed for the project and will continue as student-teacher research
areas.
