This investigation will be carried out with very sensitive radio receivers that
will be installed at South Pole Station, Antarctica and in one of the Automatic
Geophysical Observatories (AGO) that are being built for remote sites in
Antarctica. The receivers will operate in the low, middle and high frequency
bands (150 kHz to 9.6 MHz). Waves with these frequencies are known to be
produced by auroral activity, and have often been observed by rocket and
satellite borne instruments. Theoretical studies have indicated that some of
these emissions should be able to penetrate the ionosphere and be detectable at
ground level, while other emissions would not. The purpose of this project is to
test the theoretical predictions and to provide insight into auroral emissions
and wave propagation processes. It is necessary to do these measurements in
Antarctica because only there would the receivers be sufficiently isolated from
manmade radio interference.
