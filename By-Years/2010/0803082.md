Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry may be thought of as studying
solutions of many equations in many unknowns when, typically, the solution is
not unique. The set of solutions can then be viewed geometrically, but it is
often best encoded into a family of functions defined on this set. The abstract
version of such families of functions are called commutative rings. Homological
algebra brings to the study of rings methods of algebraic topology, developed to
study geometric structures. Methods for decomposing complicated structures into
primitive building blocks are developed as part of a different branch of
algebra, known as representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avramov will
investigate problems arising at a crossroads of commutative algebra, homological
algebra, and representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;The combination of different
points of view allows for a fruitful transfer of techniques and intuition
between fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties of commutative noetherian rings
will be studied through numerical, algebraic, and geometric invariants generated
by homological constructions. These include free resolutions, Hochschild
cohomology, stable cohomology, cohomological support varieties, derived
categories of modules and of differential modules. Special attention will be
paid to developing finitistic recognition criteria for geometrically important
properties of families of commutative rings. Connections through homological
algebra with representation theory of finite dimensional algebra will be
studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
