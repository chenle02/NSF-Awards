This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant Biology.
The applicant received her Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in molecular
biology studying a gene family involved in self-incompatibility in Arabidopsis.
She plans to carry out her postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of
Dr. Gerd Jurgens at the University of Munich in Germany. Her research entitled
"Genetic analysis of pattern formation in the Arabidopsis embryo: establishment
of cotyledon position" will broaden her scientific training into developmental
biology.
