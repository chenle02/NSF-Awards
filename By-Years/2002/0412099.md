Research shows that people usually act to maintain their image of themselves in
social identities that they occupy- identities like father or son, boss or
employee, friend or adversary. Current theories of identity assume that people
only see themselves in one identity in each social situation, and that their
behavior is guided by attempts to support that identity. Recently, the PIs have
begun to consider more complex situations where people see themselves in two or
more identities at the same time. For example, a policeman who stops a speeder
who turns out to be his uncle is in a situation where he is simultaneously a law
enforcement officer and a nephew. In this research the investigators will extend
their research to examine what kinds of social systems make people more or less
likely to have many identities. They will develop a theory to answer this
question using computer simulations and principles about how groups and networks
are related in social systems. They also investigate what kinds of situations
lead people to enact more than one identity at a time, and how these situations
affect how they feel. A data set that samples the situations in which University
of Arizona students, faculty and staff found themselves will be used to test
predictions that multiple-identity occupancy causes stress and the experience of
mixed emotions.
