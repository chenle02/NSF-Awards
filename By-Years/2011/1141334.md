This Black Hills State University project builds on previously successful
efforts to decrease attrition in pre-STEM mathematics courses and positions the
university to investigate those variables in the teaching and learning process
that are most influential in successful remediation within a developmental
mathematics sequence. The goal is to determine what works in learning
developmental mathematics by analyzing the results obtained after restructuring
basic and intermediate algebra courses at Black Hills State University.
Beneficial applications are translatable to all STEM disciplines, and especially
to projects serving underrepresented students. This potential is underscored and
expected as there already have been increases in student success achieved by the
program in key pre-university level mathematics courses.
