0201891 Bellamkonda Inability to successfully target chemotherapeutic agents to
tumors, specifically gliomas of the brain, has been a major obstacle for
successful treatment and prognosis. While liposomal delivery to gliomas has been
promising, non-specific delivery of chemotherapeutic agent(s) remains high. The
investigators propose a novel, multiple-ligand approach to target drug-laden
liposomes to brain tumors in an efficient manner while minimizing non-specific
uptake at the same time. The approach is based on the following hypotheses: A)
The overall affinity between receptor targeted drug delivery vehicle and tumors
can be increased by using multiple weak interactions generated by multiple
targeting ligands on the delivery vehicle that target multiple differentially
(but not exclusively) expressed receptors on tumors, and B) Specificity of
targeting can be achieved by delivery vehicles presenting sub-optimal levels of
each ligand (with optimal being maximum possible affinity for a given ligand),
so that non-specific uptake by healthy cells is reduced because they do not
coincidently over-express all of the targeted receptors that are differentially
expressed on gliomas.

Based on these hypotheses, the specific aims are to: 1) Design and fabricate
multiple-ligand presenting liposomal vehicles; 2) Determine doxorubicin loaded
multiple ligand vehicles' targeting capacity when tumor and non-tumor cells are
co-cultured; and 3) Determine the in vivo performance of these vehicles in a
rodent model of glioma.
