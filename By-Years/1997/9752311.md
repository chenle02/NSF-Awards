The objective of this proposal is the development of a series of novel
computer-based instructional units in key areas of engineering mechanics that
serve as a national model for the development of similar materials throughout
engineering and science. The units are centered on instructional programs
written in the universally compatible Java programming language, and are made
available to all engineering students and educators over the World Wide Web.
They are focused, self-contained and independent so that they can be easily
integrated into a broad range of engineering courses and curricula. The units
are designed to have a significant impact on engineering students, providing
them additional materials that promote their understanding of central concepts
over a medium that allows independent learning at an individual pace from
anywhere in the world. A broadly advertised site on the World Wide Web will
contain these peer-reviewed instructional units and similar reviewed materials
developed by others. Stimulating the development of similar materials by other
instructors is a crucial goal to be accomplished by direct contact with
educators at Virginia Tech and its many sister institutions as well as by
providing supplementary information over the Web and through scholarly
publications and meetings. Evaluation of the educational effectiveness of the
units is an integral part of the project. Formative evaluation are used to
improve and modify the units based on the responses of users. Both quantitative
and qualitative evaluations are performed to assess the effectiveness of the
units in terms of the cognitive gains of students who use them.
