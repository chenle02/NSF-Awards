This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for a DS-3 connection to the Very High Performance Backbone Network
Service (vBNS) for Iowa State University and the University of Iowa for two
years. Among the applications are nondestructive evaluation modeling,
computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, virtual environments,
scalable computing, nuclear magnetic resonance microimaging, and distributed
adaptive search systems. Collaborating sites could include the Cornell Theory
Center, Maui High Performance Computing Center, NASA Lewis and Langley Research
Centers, and the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Center.
