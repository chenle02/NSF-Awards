9628238 Lasaga This project is a continuation of theoretical and experimental
work on the atomic description of geochemical processes and the development of
kinetic theory in geochemistry. particular emphasis is placed on advancing the
molecular theory of water-rock kinetics including effects of solution
composition, temperature, pH, and inorganic molecules. This project will also
study the bonding and energetics related to hydration and complex formation of
silicon, aluminum and metals in solution. A new Monte Carlo program is being
developed that incorporates the details of the mineral structure directly in
models of the dissolution and growth of minerals. These Monte Carlo simulations
will provide a linkage between the atomic level results of ab initio and the
observables of the experiments.
