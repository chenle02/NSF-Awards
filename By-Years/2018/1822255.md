This National Science Foundation award supports the semi-annual Wasatch Topology
Conference for the next three years. The conference is typically held in mid-
August and mid-December at a location near the University of Utah. The next one
in the series will be held August 15-17, 2018, in Midway, UT. The conference has
a long tradition, running continuously for almost twenty-five years. The blend
of the tradition, the range of mathematics represented, and an informal setting
make it a unique experience to participate and interact with other
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trend in mathematics, for many years now,
is to use methods from different areas to solve problems at hand. The Wasatch
Topology Conference prides itself in covering topics from dynamical systems,
geometric group theory, geometric topology, Kleinian groups, Teichmuller theory,
and geometric structures on two- and three-dimensional manifolds. Many times the
conference will represent a mix of the above topics, to bring researches from
different fields together where they can share ideas in an informal
environment.The web page for the conference is

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
