9453170 Oakey The Community Partners for Project-Based Teaching and Learning are
planning for the development of an initiative that will: (1) demonstrate that
students whose teachers use project-based learning as a strategy for teaching
math, science, and technology education will show improved academic achievement,
(2) develop the means for connecting the work of discrete enhancement projects
nationwide so that the maximum number of teachers and students can benefit from
these exemplary, ongoing efforts, and (3) impact preservice teachers so that
these improvements become the norm, rather than the reform of classroom
practice. This planning grant will result in an implementation plan for the
Community Partners initiative. ***
