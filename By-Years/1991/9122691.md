This is a collaborative research project (with McPhail) on the media coverage
of demonstrations in Washington DC in 1982 and 1991. Newspaper stories and
television news have become a common source of evidence for describing and
interpreting the intensity, duration and political content of public protest.
There is wide suspicion, however, that media coverage of such events are a non-
random selection of all demonstrations taking place. It therefore becomes
important to understand how media institutions select from the vast range of
actual events. This study will compare data from the demonstration permit
application records of all police agencies that require protestors to obtain
permits with local and national print and electronic news stories about
demonstrations. The study will focus on demonstrations in Washington DC. This
study is important for two reasons. It will improve our understanding of how and
what newspapers and television news select to cover in the news, and it will
provide researchers with much better knowledge about the potential bias of
evidence based on newspaper and television sources.
