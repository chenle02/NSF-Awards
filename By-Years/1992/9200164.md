This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at the University
of Kentucky. The funds provide support for eight undergraduate students selected
from candidates from nine colleges in Kentucky. Students participate in weekly
seminars to discuss progress in their research, receive information of career
opportunities, be exposed to recent advances in the literature in their fields
of research. Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to attend
professional conferences in their respective fields throughout the year, and
will be encouraged to participate in the annual Regional Undergraduate Chemistry
Research Poster Competition. Students participate in graduate research
supervised by one of seven participating professors on various topics in the
general area of membrane science. Students are selected for participation on the
basis of grade point average, nomination by their home institution, and an essay
on interest in the program and career goals. Emphasis is placed on recruitment
from under- represented groups, for example, minorities, women, and handicapped
persons.
