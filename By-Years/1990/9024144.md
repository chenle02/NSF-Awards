The research concerns developing effective analytical performance modelling
techniques for parallel systems. The project concentrates on three directions:
1. Workload characterization for future parallel systems. 2. Analysis of future
parallel system design questions. 3. Advancing the state-of-the-art in modelling
techniques, incorporating techniques from disciplines other than queuing theory
into the modelling process.
