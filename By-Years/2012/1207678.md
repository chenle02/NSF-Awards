This project addresses a number of basic questions concerning the low
temperature behavior of short-range spin glasses and other models of materials
with quenched disorder. Rigorous and heuristic mathematical methods will be
applied to analyze the multiplicity, structure and organization of pure phases
and ground states; non-equilibrium dynamics; and the presence or absence of a
thermodynamic phase transition. The relations between spin glasses and problems
in combinatorial optimization, biology, and other areas will also be
investigated.

This award will support the development of mathematical techniques to be applied
to investigations of an important class of magnetic materials known as spin
glasses. Understanding their behavior is essential to filling a gap in our
knowledge of how materials behave when their structure is dominated by
randomness and disorder. The techniques developed will also have potential
applications to a wide range of complex problems in other areas, such as
computer science and biology. Examples of such problems are route scheduling of
airlines and predicting the geometric structure (and hence biological function)
of proteins. Some of the research done under this award will be carried out by
Ph.D. students as a central part of their graduate training.
