Experiments and analysis are used in an investigation of some troublesome
correlations between both velocity and species mass fraction against pressure
gradient which occur in second order closure methods for turbulent reacting
flows. Simultaneous two-point measurements are carried out for pressure,
velocity, and density (and, equivalently, mass fraction and temperatures). A
premixed turbulent flame facility is used for these measurements. The techniques
of laser velocimetry and continuous Rayleigh molecular scattering are used along
with dynamic Pitot barometry. Analysis consists of development of a new theory
for the correlations in question and comparison with experiment. In addition,
past models, heavily weighted by questionable incompressibility considerations,
are compared with the experimental results.
