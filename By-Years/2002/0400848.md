This project supports research by Buss and his graduate&lt;br/&gt;students on
computational complexity, proof complexity,&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and numerical
methods. Buss investigates proof theory&lt;br/&gt;and proof complexity,
especially aspects that are closely connected&lt;br/&gt;to open problems in
computational complexity including the&lt;br/&gt;P versus NP problem. The
relevant proof systems include&lt;br/&gt;bounded arithmetics, which are first-
order theories tailored to have&lt;br/&gt;logical strength related to feasible
computability, and&lt;br/&gt;propositional proof systems, which have rich
connections to bounded&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic and circuit complexity. Buss will
work to establish&lt;br/&gt;lower bounds on proof complexity based on complexity
assumptions&lt;br/&gt;such as the existence of provably secure cryptographic
systems.&lt;br/&gt;He will work to prove new independence results and
separation&lt;br/&gt;results for weak proof systems. He will investigate what
kinds&lt;br/&gt;of computational content can be extracted from
proofs.&lt;br/&gt;Buss will investigate the proof complexity of propositional
systems such as&lt;br/&gt;Frege systems, cutting planes systems, Nullstellensatz
proof systems,&lt;br/&gt;counting axioms, the polynomial calculus, and
intuitionistic proof systems.&lt;br/&gt;Buss also works on numerical and
geometric algorithms arising&lt;br/&gt;from computer graphics. He will work on
simulation methods for&lt;br/&gt;rigid multibodies using higher-order
approximation methods over&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, on symplectic algorithms and
other energy-conserving&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for physical simulations, and on
collision response&lt;br/&gt;algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main part of
this research lies at the interface between &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and computer
science and is motivated by open questions &lt;br/&gt;concerning the fundamental
limits of computation. These open &lt;br/&gt;questions include the P versus NP
problem, the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;feasibility of secure cryptographic coding,
and the optimality&lt;br/&gt;of particular algorithms and circuits for solving
combinatorial problems.&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these questions by
investigating computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity and proof complexity. Lower and
upper bounds on&lt;br/&gt;proof complexity are closely related to upper and
lower bounds&lt;br/&gt;on the hardness of computation. This in turn is
closely&lt;br/&gt;related to the mathematical underpinnings of
crytography.&lt;br/&gt;
