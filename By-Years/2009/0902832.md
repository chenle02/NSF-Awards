This project will develop a model of the spatial and temporal variation of
electron precipitation in the diffuse aurora. The project will utilize an
existing, physics-based model of Earth's ring current and add electron losses
due to pitch-angle scattering. The existing model will be improved to include a
realistic magnetic field model as opposed to a simple dipole model and to have a
self-consistent description of the electric field. The modeled electron
precipitation will be used to calculate the ionospheric conductivity tensor for
different magnetic conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model will be made
available to the space science community and will be useful in developing a
Geospace General Circulation Model (GGCM) which is one of the main goals of the
Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) program. The ability to calculate
ionospheric conductances will be useful in understanding the coupling of the
magnetosphere to the ionosphere. The project will improve our predictive space
weather capabilities, which will have societal and economic benefits.
