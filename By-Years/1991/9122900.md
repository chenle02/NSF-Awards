The main goal of population biology is to determine the casual basis for species
distribution and local abundance. Rare species represent an extreme situation,
hence they are a useful system for studying factors that influence abundance.
Increasing awareness of conservation issues has generated additional motivation
to study cases of rarity and appropriate management practices for rare species,
but there is currently no coherent theoretical genetic or ecological framework
to address these issues. Eupatorium resinosum (rare) and E. perfoliatum (common)
will be used in this study examining ecological and genetic characteristics
associated with rarity. Low genetic variation is expected in rare species due to
genetic drift. Genetic variation within and among populations will be evaluated
by using starch gel electrophoresis. Inbreeding depression and limited range of
environmental tolerance are also expected in rare species. A field experiment
will be used to evaluate the extent of inbreeding depression. A greenhouse
experiment will be used to measure the extent of phenotypic plasticity which in
turn influences a species environmental tolerance. Due to the comprehensive
design of this study, the information obtained will provide insights into both
evolutionary and management aspects of rarity.
