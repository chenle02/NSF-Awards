Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis from adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)
and inorganic phosphate (Pi) is catalyzed by closely related enzymes in the
energy transducing membranes of chloroplasts, mitochondria and some bacteria.
Electron transport generates electrochemical proton gradients across the
coupling membranes and the flow of protons down these gradients through the ATP
synthase drives ATP synthesis. The chloroplast ATP synthase contains nine
different polypeptides and a total of about twenty polypeptide chains. The
enzyme may be separated into two parts: CF1 and CFo. CF1 contains the nucleotide
binding sites of the enzyme and is catalytic. CFo anchors CF1 to the membrane
and translocates protons. Interactions among the polypeptide subunits of CF1 and
CFo will be studied, with emphasis on the smaller subunits of CF1 (gamma, delta
and epsilon) and the regulation of activity. This project will examine roles of
the binding of nucleotides in regulation. The location of the C-terminal domain
of the e subunit within CF1 and its roles in ATP synthesis, regulation and
proton gating will be evaluated making extensive use of site-directed
mutagenesis. Whether the position of the C-terminal portion of the g subunit in
CF1 differs from that in mitochondrial F1 will be investigated. The ease of
preparation of large amounts of CF1, ability to manipulate its subunit
composition and nucleotide content, and the high ATP synthesis activity of
thylakoids, make the chloroplast ATP synthase an excellent subject for this
research. The results of this work will be applicable to all ATP synthases and
to protein-protein interactions, in general.
