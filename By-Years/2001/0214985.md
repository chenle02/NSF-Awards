0214985&lt;br/&gt;Heyduk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research Phase I project will develop a new general platform for preparing
biosensors for a large number of target molecules. The target molecules for
these biosensors will be the compounds (ligands) which regulate DNA binding
activity of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. A large number of such
highly-selective ligand-dependent DNA binding proteins has evolved in nature to
regulate&lt;br/&gt;gene expression. Many of the ligands for these proteins are
compounds of interest in environmental, forensic, toxicological and biomedical
analysis. This project proposes a general strategy to prepare biosensors that
can detect these ligands and that take advantage of the outstanding specificity
of DNA binding proteins. The presence of the target molecule will be reported by
a change of fluorescence intensity of the sensor. The overall objective of the
Phase I project is to provide experimental verification of the biosensor design.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are expected
to span a number of different markets requiring detection of many target
molecules. The new biosensors to be developed in this project will find
commercial use as detectors of environmental pollutants, of toxic compounds in
food and of regulatory molecules in biological and biomedical research.
