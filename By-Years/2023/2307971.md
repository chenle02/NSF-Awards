Machine learning algorithms have grown increasingly powerful and integral to our
society in recent years. However, our understanding of how and why these
algorithms work remains incomplete, especially in terms of their robustness and
reliability. On the other hand, there has been a significant effort in the past
century to mathematically understand theoretical properties of variational
problems stemming from physics and engineering, and many related data science
tasks that utilize machine learning algorithms can be cast in terms of
optimization or variational problems. This project will study theoretical
properties of machine learning algorithms by understanding their variational
structure, and by doing so will develop novel mathematical techniques. Graduate
and undergraduate students will also be trained as part of this project.

This award focuses on two classes of anisotropic, non-local variational problems
that have arisen in data science tasks. The first is a data-adapted, non-local
perimeter which appears naturally in the context of adversarial learning, and
the second is a non-local Dirichlet energy used in graph-based learning methods.
This work will deepen our understanding of the regularity associated with these
energies and corresponding evolution equations and will provide a new avenue for
understanding classical elliptic regularity theory. Doing so will improve upon
the current work in the machine learning community on the theory of these
algorithms, helping to aid in rigorous choices for interpretable and
computationally efficient algorithm design. Finally, the expected results will
expand the types of tasks and questions that are computationally tractable, for
example by permitting efficient exploration of the effect of adversarial power
and its effect on topology and accuracy, or by permitting the accurate inclusion
of boundary constraints in non-local Laplacian problems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
