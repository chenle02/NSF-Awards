This award supports cooperative research between Dr. Lynne Billard of the
University of Georgia and Dr. Sukumar Chakraborty of the Australian CSIRO's
Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures (St. Lucia, Queensland) on the interface
between statistical analysis and plant growth. Over a period of three years, the
researchers will undertake mutual short-term visits to each other's
laboratories. The focus of the research is deterministic modelling of the
progress of anthracnose disease in stylosanthes, a pasture crop grown both in
Australia and in many parts of the United States, especially in the South. The
researchers, using data collected in Australia, will investigate multivariate
and regression models concerning the disease's spread in relation to other
environmental variables, especially weather, for which data have been collected.
Adapting techniques devised to study diseases in humans, they will also
investigate the stochastic process related to disease spread. The research may
lead to better management and control of this disease in legumes.
