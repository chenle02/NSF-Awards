Oxygen isotope ratios provide critical climatic information in polar research. A
major use of this technique is in ice core research where the isotopes ratios of
stored accumulated water provide climate and elevation signatures. A large
number of samples collected for Antarctic glaciological projects will have to be
analyzed for 18O content. Analysis can be done at the Quaternary Isotope
Laboratory of the University of Washington, where an oxygen isotope facility was
constructed for this purpose.
