NCR-9502725 David B. Johnson The availability of powerful mobile computing
devices and wireless networking products and services is increasing
dramatically, making it natural for users to expect to be able to access network
resources and to utilize the growing global internetwork at any time and from
any where. However, existing internetworking protocols such as IP, ISO CLNP,
NetWare IPX, and AppleTalk cannot currently support this type of host mobility.
Network applications generally must be reconfigured and restarted when
connecting to the network at a different point, making host movement difficult,
time consuming, and error prone. The objective of this research is to develop
scalable and robust protocols for providing seamless support of transparent
internetworking for wireless and mobile hosts. This research addresses a number
of areas in which new support is needed for this goal, including internetwork
routing to mobile hosts; routing among mobile hosts in an ad hoc wireless
network; internetwork multicasting to and from mobile hosts; and protocol
support to allow higher-layer protocols and applications to adapt their behavior
in response to mobility. The work in this project will consist of designing new
protocols, implementing each protocol, and evaluating each protocol using
performance measurement and simulation studies over a range of environments and
alternative design choices.
