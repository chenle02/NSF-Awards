Galaxies can grow bigger by accreting smaller, neighboring galaxies. The debris
from such events leaves trails of stars in the outskirts of the growing galaxy.
By analyzing the debris, scientists hope to reconstruct how these tumultuous
events unfolded. The starlight from the debris is extremely faint at optical
wavelengths. Observations of such low-surface-brightness debris have been
possible only recently. The team will use cutting-edge theory and simulations to
catalog the kinds of structures expected for the debris. The team's statistician
will isolate the structures that help the most with the reconstructions.
Observers will then look for such telltale structures. Senior team members will
train junior members. During her colloquium visits nation-wide, the PI will
discuss barriers facing minorities in science. Through a partnership with a non-
profit, the team will engage with underserved high school students in New York
City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will study debris structures left in galaxy
halos by the destruction of small, accreted galaxies. The goals of the team are
to (1) make theoretical estimates of the expected structures, (2) create
libraries of synthetic surveys of simulated galaxy halos, and (3) develop and
test statistical measures of various properties of the structures.
