9416748 Wheless This project consists of a study of physical processes related
to buoyant estuarine discharges using the Mellor- Blumberg three-dimensional
primitive equation model. The numerical simulations are designed to examine the
response of an estuarine coastal plume and the associated inner shelf
circulation to external forcing and the effects of mixing and turbulence. Three
model scenarios will be used, the first representing the wide estuary-broad
shelf system of Chesapeake Bay, the second representing the large river- shallow
shelf system of the Mississippi River, and the third representing the large
river-steep shelf system of the Columbia River.
