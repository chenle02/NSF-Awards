a previous award, plantations dominated by mixtures of fast growing trees were
established in degraded tropical forests sites in Costa Rica. Experiments were
run to compare resource use and site quality maintenance, both key aspects of
restoration of ecosystem function, under different treatment regimes. In this
bridging grant, resources will be used to maintain data collection and site
monitoring activities. The results of this long term research project should
lead to sound understanding of the ecological underpinning of ecosystem
function, and to the design of sustainable land use systems so badly needed to
complete the conservation equation for tropical rain forests.
