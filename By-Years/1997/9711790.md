This project will develop a new methodology for studies of deformation at mid-
ocean ridges using restoration of pre- faulted seafloor topography from digital
elevation models. High-resolution bathymetry data, together with side-scan sonar
imagery from the Lucky Strike area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and from the
southern East Pacific Rise will be used.
