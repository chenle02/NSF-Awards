Funded through an SBIR Phase I grant, a concept for the removal of particles
from liquid effluent and process streams is to be explored. The concept is
claimed to hold the potential for greater efficiency and economy of particle
removal. Both experiments and process modeling are to be utilized. The concept
involves a combination of flow swirl and porous tube filtration. Particle
separation from flow streams is of great importance in a large variety of
manufacturing and processing systems.
