The main goals of the project are to offer to 70 elementary and middle school
teachers over a sixteen state region and at schools that service primarily
American Indian students an inservice program that has been piloted on a much
smaller scale on funds contributed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). It is
intended to build up a cadre of 70 mathematics and science teacher-leaders for
the BIA operated elementary and junior high schools across the country. These
leaders are to take on various roles, such as providing demonstration lessons,
conducting inservice sessions, coordinating curriculum development and working
with local agencies to plan improvements at the school or regional levels. The
activities are centered around workshops and their extensions that were
developed in the pilot studies over the past three years. The initial summer
workshop covers a period of eight weeks and emphasizes these activities: 1)
there are to be mathematics courses taught by the PI according to the methods
developed from the pilot experience; 2) one of the senior faculty members, with
assistance from the staff and participants of the pilot, emphasizes diagnostic
and remediation methods for mathematics skills; and 3) applications of science
and mathematics teaching are to be developed for the American Indian setting by
two of the staff members who have experience in this area and are assisted by a
teacher from a reservation who has applied these methods in her teaching.
Graduate college credit is available to the participants upon request. There are
to be extensive science and mathematics laboratories and field trips under the
direction of the instructors. The BIA plans to contribute significantly to the
project as well as to provide input to the project plan and selection of
teachers. The BIA, for example, will fund the development of a curriculum kit at
one of the target schools and will build on the previous work to help in the
implementation of the cadres' contributions in the local regions.
