In this CAREER award, co-funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division and the Astronomy Division, Prof. Benjamin J. McCall
of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and his graduate and
undergraduate research students will study the spectroscopy of gas-phase
carbocations. The main goal of this research effort is to obtain detailed
structural and dynamical information for a family of simple carbocations. These
molecular ions are ubiquitous in organic chemistry, serve as interesting test-
cases for the study non-classical chemical bonding and complex intramolecular
dynamics, and are suspected of being important chemical species in combustion
and astrochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the broader impact of the
proposed research to other scientific fields, Prof. McCall will develop a
multifaceted, interdisciplinary educational program in astrochemistry. Prof.
McCall will develop a new course in astrochemistry that will target students in
both Astronomy and Chemistry Departments. In addition, he will develop a seminar
series in astrochemistry, and he will co-organize a Midwest astrochemistry
consortium.&lt;br/&gt;
