They propose a broad-based program for theoretical study of problems of current
interest in condensed matter physics. The major focal points of this program are
phase transitions, random systems, and structure of complex surfaces. Particular
problems to be addressed include 1) Statistics of fluctuating liquid and solid
surfaces including their relevance to properties of complex fluids, 2)
Properties of diluted Heisenberg and x-y magnets, 3) Phase transitions in spin
glasses, 4) New phases in liquid crystals, and 5) quantum phase transitions.
These problems pose questions which are not only of fundamental theroretical
interest, but also are related to materials and systems of current experimental
interest, including micoremulsions, high temperature superconductors, liquid
crystals, spin glasses, helical magnets, and nitrogen adsorbed on graphite.
