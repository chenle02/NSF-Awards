Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), governments, and businesses increasingly
aim to form networks to address issues such as hunger, poverty, disease, and
environmental degradation. Interorganizational networks enable constituencies to
transcend some limitations and work toward common goals.

This research combines social network analysis methods with intensive assessment
to (a) produce a reliable and valid measure of NGO capacity, and (b) test the
common presumption that an NGO's capacity to address problems of disease and
development is dependent on its local network of relationships with other NGOs,
businesses, and government organizations.

The results of this study will include an important new outcome measure for NGO
research. In addition, this project will identify the types of collaboration
associated with increasing an NGO's scope of services, leadership strength,
human resource capacity, financial stability, and research and advocacy
capacity. This should have practical implications for better management of NGOs
in context.
