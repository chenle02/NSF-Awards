9322424 The Black Sea is a region of great scientific interest in the U.S.
However, historical data on the Black Sea are rare in the west, though such data
are essential for improving our understanding of processes in the region. In
particular, modelers and chemists are interested in the hydrography to establish
a climatology and to examine long term changes in the Black Sea. Moscow State
University now has offered to make available their data base on Black Sea
hydrography, consisting of nearly 90,000 hydrographic stations extending from
1920 to 1991. These data have been quality controlled internally, and averaged
into 303 different Black Sea bins to provide climatological averages. This
present effort is to work with Moscow State University to complete the quality
control of the data, to bring the data bank to Woods Hole to make it available
to the U.S. scientific community and S b - to publish a technical report
describing the data and its quality control procedures.
