The long term goal of this project is to determine the crystal structures of
heme containing enzymes. New structural information is expected to broaden our
data base on two fundamental mechanistic questions: first, the mechanism by
which heme enzymes activate molecular oxygen and/or hydroperoxides and; second,
the mechanism by which electrons transfer between proteins in intermolecular
complexes. Structural information derived by x-ray diffraction techniques is
essential to address these questions. Therefore, the main tools to be employed
in this work are those of protein x-ray crystallography. The project focuses on
the crystal structure determination of lignin peroxidase (or ligninase) and
mutant forms of cytochrome c peroxidase.
