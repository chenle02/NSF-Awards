This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will expand
manufacturing technology research into the limits of employing Metal Injection
Molding (MIM) materials for fuel cell metal bipolar plates. The objective is to
determine the design limits of a MIM bipolar plate, based on minimal thickness
and widths. By working with various MIM materials and processes, a limitation
based on manufacturing data will provide support for future MIM bipolar plate
designs. This research is important since minimizing the MIM materials will
drive the economic success of future fuel cells by significantly reducing costs.

The successful outcome of this project will expand the knowledge base of metal
injection molding processing which efficiently avoids metal waste by eliminating
machining operations. The MIM process in bipolar plates will also augment the
economic viability of fuel cells by reducing their cost, increasing reliability,
and improving performance. As fuel cells continue to grow in volume, more
efficient use of our fuels will result. Fuel cells are 40% to 60% efficient
versus other power sources using various fuels (e.g. automobiles at 25%). Thus,
the consequence of growing hydrogen based fuel cells is a reduction in green
house gases which will reduce or avoid global warming issues.
