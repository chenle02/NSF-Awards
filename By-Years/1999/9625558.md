This project is exploring the cluster approach to symmetric multiprocessing, in
which bus-based multiprocessors are interconnected using a more scalable
network. Using the Tempest parallel programming substrate, the project is
building clusters that extend the shared memory model with fast references to
recently used locations across a cluster. The key issue is achieving good
performance without resorting to extensive custom hardware. The project
encompasses design and some implementation of a high-speed Tempest system that
can: provide shared memory across a cluster; use cacheable control registers and
queues for communication among processors and I/O devices; and provide hardware
acceleration of protocols. The project includes the development of programming
tools and compilers that facilitate specification and verification of custom
protocols, and use these protocols to hide latency.
