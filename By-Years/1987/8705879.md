A MRG focussing on the structure, electronic properties and kinetics of
molecular beam epitaxy grown III-V compounds, particularly gallium arsenide is
to be established. The program will use probes such as photoemission and energy
loss studies to determine the electronic structure of the surfaces of interest.
It will also use direct structural probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy
and low energy electron diffraction to elucidate the geometry and nature of the
chemical bonding. A good deal of effort will be placed on study of the kinetics
of the growth process. Theoretical modeling of surface kinetics via time-
dependent Monte-Carlo calculations will be conducted. III-V compounds are a
technologically important and interesting class of materials which are not
sufficiently understood at a fundamental level, and it is the goal of this
program to improve that understanding.
