The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable next-generation lithium battery
technologies that are integral in transitioning toward increased renewable
energy deployment. In particular, the project has the potential to overcome
obstacles to widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption including battery
capacity limitations, high battery cost, and supply chain issues. EVs currently
account for a significant majority of the lithium battery market and this market
share will likely increase dramatically as deployment of EVs increases in coming
years. The aforementioned issues with lithium battery technologies must be
addressed for EVs to reach their envisioned potential. This STTR project seeks
to advance a novel process for the production of a critical battery component â€“
the battery cathode. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to
advance lithium sulfide (Li-S) battery viability using a novel approach to
cathode production. Lithium sulfide batteries can provide more than double the
gravimetric energy density of current lithium batteries, but Li-S batteries
suffer from a short cycle life due to the poor retention of polysulfide species
which are formed at the cathode during cycling. If these polysulfide species are
able to diffuse away from the cathode, they participate in several detrimental
reactions and interactions with both the electrolyte and anode, and the battery
is damaged. This project seeks to retain the sulfur and polysulfides within the
cathode using encapsulation within a carbon scaffold. Specific research will
include assessments of the maximum sulfur loading that can be achieved in the
carbon scaffold, the extent to which the carbon scaffold can be rendered
electrically conductive, construction of cathodes from the sulfur-loaded carbon
scaffold, and tests of the performance of batteries constructed from these
cathodes. In addition, a technoeconomic analysis of the cathode technology will
be performed to assess its potential in the context of current lithium battery
technology. Expected outcomes include demonstrated technical and economic
viability of the cathode technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
