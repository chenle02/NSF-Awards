9305930 Goldstein The investigator intends to continue his analysis of Bohmian
mechanics, which defines a deterministic dynamical system involving a novel
combination of ordinary and partial differential equations having remarkable
properties. The proposed research involves the analysis of several rather
distinct components: 1) the basic mathematical properties of the system itself,
such as existence and uniqueness of the dynamics; 2) phenomenology, such as the
emergence of the quantum formalism and of the classical limit; and 3) extensions
to relativity and covariant gravitation. %%% The importance of the proposed
research lies in the following observations. 1) The foundations of quantum
theory continue to be mired in confusion and incoherence some sixty five years
after its inception. 2) Bohmian mechanics is the natural embedding of
Schroedinger's equation -- the mathematical core of almost all interpretations
of quantum theory -- into a clear, precise physical theory, emerging if one
merely insists that the Schroedinger wave function be relevant to the motion of
particles. 3) An appreciation of Bohmian mechanics can be the source of
flexibility and clarity when one attempts to apply quantum theory in new
directions -- for example, to understand the implications of macroscopic
interference effects -- and to new domains, such as quantum gravity. ***
