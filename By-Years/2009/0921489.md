0921489&lt;br/&gt;Harland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced
Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department
of Energy (DOE), will take place on November 2 through 11, 2010, at the
Pontifica Universidad Catolica de Chile in Santiago, Chile. Organized by Dr.
Richard Harland of the University of California, Berkeley, the PASI will address
the topic of concepts and model organisms in regenerative biology by exposing
participants to the fundamental concepts, questions, model organisms and
research tools used in regenerative and developmental biology. Laboratory
workshops will provide hands-on experience to students working with different
organisms that exhibit regenerative properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
activity will train students before entering the pathway of becoming future
researchers and educators in biology and related areas. Expected outcomes in
this PASI will be to: foster cooperation between senior and junior investigators
and provide an open forum for discussion of current topics relevant to science
policy and education in the Americas. Results of the PASI will be disseminated
through a website and a digital library. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
