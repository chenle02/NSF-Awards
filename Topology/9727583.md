9727583 Bleiler This award will provide partial support for speakers and others
at semiannual conferences in the series known as the ``Cascade Topology
Seminar,'' over a three-year period beginning in 1998. These conferences will be
held at various universities in the northwestern United States and southwestern
Canada. Among institutions currently active are the University of British
Columbia, University of California-Berkeley, University of Nevada-Reno,
University of Oregon, University of Puget Sound, University of Washington, Boise
State University, Oregon State University, and Portland State University.
Typically there will be half a dozen principal speakers on topics ranging widely
over geometry and topology, both algebraic and geometric, the majority from
outside these institutions, and more than fifty participants altogether, roughly
half of them faculty and half of them graduate students, as well as an
occasional undergraduate student. Participation by younger mathematicians, by
women, and by underrepresented minorities is encouraged, the first two with
notable success. Other sources of financial support include the host
institutions in each case and, in the case of the conferences held in Canada,
Canadian sources, which entirely supplant the National Science Foundation. ***
