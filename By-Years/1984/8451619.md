A design can be described in a number of different contexts or languages.
Typically, an engineer describes a product in terms of a set of performance
specifications and constraints. These constitute a functional description of the
product. The mechanical designer or draftsman uses a set of drawings to describe
the form of the product. The manufacturing engineer uses a process sheet to
describe the product in terms of the means for fabrication. The design task is
to specify a form of the product to best satisfy constraints or objectives on
function and fabrication. The relationships among function, form, and
fabrication are studied. These relationships are the basis for design decisions
and are essential when considering design scaling, design modifications to
accommodate restrictions on materials, machinery, or tooling or in the
consideration of standards and tolerancing. Currently, these relationships are
poorly understood. Without a better understanding, designers will continue to
use empiricism and heuristics to design.
