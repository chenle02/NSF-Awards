The research goal of this CAREER project is the formal specification and
verification of algorithms that support the implementation of programming
languages. Such formal systems can aid the development of new languages and
efficient implementation of these languages. This support arises from both the
verification of algorithms, which increases confidence in the correctness of a
compiler, and from the improved understanding of compilation techniques allowed
by formal specification. Recent work has focused on using logical frameworks and
mechanized proof assistants to specify deductive systems representing aspects of
compilation and to verify the correctness of these specifications. This research
project extends these results by considering advanced, state-of-the-art
algorithms found in current compilers, formalizing theories for these
algorithms, and verifying the correctness of these algorithms. One specific
problem area to be addressed involves closure conversion algorithms and the
concept of `safe-for-space complexity.` An important aspect of this project is
extending the use of mechanized proof assistants to support the verification of
complex flow analyses and optimizations of programs. The goal of the education
plan is to provide both a general, but rigorous, introduction to the study of
programming languages at the undergraduate level and would introduce, at both
the undergraduate and graduate level, the recently emerging field of logic and
computation which studies the relationship between constructive logics and typed
lambda calculi. Although this is typically considered advanced material and not
suitable for undergraduates, it can be made accessible to students.
