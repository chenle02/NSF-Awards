This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project is in the general area
of chemical synthesis in the subfield of chemical catalysis. Ethylene glycol is
an important commodity chemical with a world market valued at over $3 billion
per year. Ethylene glycol is currently synthesized by the epoxidation of
ethylene to ethylene oxide followed by hydration. For a process of such large
scale, there are significant incentives to developing a more economical
synthesis based on cheaper raw materials and a less capital intensive process.
In this Phase I proposal a route for the synthesis of ethylene glycol based on
ethane is outlined. This work elaborates on active research at Catalytica aimed
at the discovery of novel systems that allow the conversion of methane to
methanol with high selectivity via two consecutive selective oxidations of each
methyl group, to the formation of ethylene glycol. The phase I research
objectives are to study factors that influence the regiospecificity in the
consecutive oxidation reactions from ethane to ethylene glycol.
