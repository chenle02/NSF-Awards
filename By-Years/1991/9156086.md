Mathematics educators, through the NCTM Standards and MAA Professional Standards
for Teachers of Mathematics, call for more active learning at all levels of
mathematics education. This project is developing a teaching approach for the
finite mathematics course, taken by elementary education and business majors,
which implements the goals of these standards in both curriculum and
instruction. The course materials incorporate active and collaborative learning
techniques, writing, and a problem-solving approach which emphasizes critical
thinking. The software keep the structure of SEEN, an award-winning humanities
software program, with tutorials that teach mathematical strategies plus a
bulletin board that encourages peer collaboration. The SEEN-MATH software is
being written so that the tutorial inculcates Polya's problem-solving model with
tools such as graphing and calculator capabilities. In addition, to train and
retrain mathematics teachers, thus affecting the educational infrastructure,
SEEN-MATH is being used with elementary education and secondary mathematics
education majors, and presented in an in-service workshops for teachers,
allowing them to use the Polya tutorial and also adapt the software (in its
author mode) to their students and classes as a model of active learning.
