Meta-computing was implemented by many projects among which GLOBUS is the most
widely known. Experiments with large configurations and real applications have
shown that the latency of wide area networks is prohibitively high and that
substantial bandwidth can hardly be achieved. Our recent research on efficient
algorithms for the meta-computing of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) has
shown that it is feasible to design efficient algorithm for meta-computing of
unsteady combustion problems or elliptic solvers on three dimensional Cartesian
grids. The development of such algorithms is (very)&lt;br/&gt;difficult. For
Poisson or Helmholtz operators, the speed of propagation of information in the
spatial domain is infinite. However, (1) information that propagates at infinite
speed can be damped in space relatively quickly according to Green function
properties and (2) more than 90 per cent of the information carried in a
practical computation is noise. We are designing a family of domain
decomposition methods that can rigorously take advantage of both
factors.&lt;br/&gt;
