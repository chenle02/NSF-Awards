Research will be carried out on basic experimental atomic physics which has
direct applications to plasmas and to laboratory astrophysics. This work will
probe the basic physical processes which control electron-ion interactions. It
will extend and improve the atomic data available for use in plasma modeling by
measuring absolute electron-impact excitation and ionization cross sections for
specific ions. It will enhance our understanding of the physical mechanisms
involved in the excitation and ionization processes. And it will address the
present discrepancy between theoretical calculations and measurements in the
simplest systems where calculations and measurements should agree--but do not.
