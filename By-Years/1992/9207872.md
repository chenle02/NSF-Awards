This project offers potential for advancing the state-of-the-art in the
development of new affinity agents for separations and therapy. First, it would
demonstrate the applicability of phage-based screening systems to a new class of
compounds. Second, it would extend the phage screening method to meet a new
goal, the isolation of conditional binding mutants allowing reversibility of
high affinity binding without the use of denaturing eluants. Third, there are
good prospects of isolating variants of Protein A with immediate application in
separations and immunotherapy.
