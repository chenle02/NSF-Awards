This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Site at the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Arizona. The
department is comprised of 35 faculty actively engaged in a variety of research
projects. The Department vigorously supports undergraduate research both through
its participation in the University Honors programs and through the requirement
of a senior research thesis for all its B.S. students. The participating faculty
have published or submitted 58 papers co-authored by undergraduates in the last
five years. During the summer of 1988 the Department developed a Summer
Undergraduate Research Program, funded from local resources. In conjunction with
the Undergraduate Biochemistry Club, sponsored by the Department, a forum has
been created which permits students to communicate their research results to
each other and to participating faculty. The current award is for year-long
support for 10 additional students. The rationale for supporting these 10
students during the summer and the academic year is two-fold: 1) It offers the
opportunity to attract minority students into a research experience by paying
them the money they may need to attend college; and 2) it provides an in depth
experience for highly qualified and motivated students. The Department plans to
capitalized on its unique location in the Southwest to target its minority
recruiting to women and Hispanics.
