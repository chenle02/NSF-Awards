CMS 9616429 Olson The twin earthquakes of September 19 and 20, 1985 that
devastated central zones of Mexico City remain one of the great urban
catastrophes of the late 20th century. One of the most significant
characteristics of the disaster was the breath, depth and duration of popular
response, especially the emergent organizations that focused on a variety of
post- earthquake problems. This project analyzes the life cycle of two sets of
such organizations. These include groups and organizations that transformed in
the years after the earthquake and survive to this day, and those that also
emerged out of the earthquake and were active during the emergency phase but
disappeared at various points during recovery and reconstruction. Aside from
being an interesting phenomenon for researchers to study, such groups represent
an important resource during the time of disaster. Thus a practical implication
of developing an improved understanding of the origin, nature and changes such
organizations undergo is that it will give emergency management practitioners in
the U.S. and elsewhere insight on how to more effectively incorporate them into
their disaster planning and subsequent emergency activities. The multiple data
sources for this study will include interviews, archival materials, and direct
observation.
