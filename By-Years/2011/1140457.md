This project, led by Lamar University, is increasing the knowledge base in how
people learn using mobile computing technology by investigating the use of
mobile technologies in an Engineering Economics course. The mobile technology
allows a ubiquitous learning environment suitable to student lifestyle
constraints. Specifically the project is studying the effectiveness of mobile
technology in promoting deep and lasting learning of content, practice, skills
and attitudes. Expected results include more student engagement and better
performance on in-class exams. Smart phone apps developed by the project include
role-playing games that allow students to interact with the app or with fellow
students. The project uses formative and summative assessment to continuously
guide the researchers in assessing the results. This study has application in a
number of STEM education areas and therefore will significantly improve STEM
education.
