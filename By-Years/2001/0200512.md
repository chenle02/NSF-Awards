This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Measuring activity and diversity of
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in estuarine sediments." This research focuses on
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria as a model system to study the relationship between
microbial diversity and community processes in estuarine sediments. It employs
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure
changes in the expression of the enzyme responsible for ammonia oxidation, that
is, ammonia monooxygenase (AMO).
