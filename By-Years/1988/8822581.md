A theoretical study will be performed of dynamical processes in strongly
coupled plasmas using a charged impurity as a probe. The plasma is characterized
through its total electric field at the impurity, rather than through particle
trajectories and cross-sections. The formulation is more appropriate for strong
coupling and focuses on electric field dynamics beyond linear responses. The
first part of the research involves a study of radiative and transport
properties of a highly charged ion in a one component plasma, developing
descriptions of electric field dynamics with applications to line shapes as a
diagnostic. The second part of the research involves a study of electron
diffusion, intended to provide understanding of a recently discovered
localization-delocalization transition.
