The investigators will study major heliospheric pickup ion sources in the solar
wind, their propagation and acceleration. Pickup ions are generated from neutral
atoms when they become ionized and begin to gyrate in a plasma's magnetic field.
In the case of the solar wind, pickup ions born from slowly moving neutrals
acquire an initial speed nearly equal to the solar wind speed as they are
transported out with the solar wind's magnetic field. The pickup process thereby
creates a more energetic and therefore more easily observed population of ions
that may be used to infer properties of the neutral environment from which they
were created. In the heliosphere, there are three main populations of pickup
ions: interstellar pickup ions from interstellar neutrals, inner source pickup
ions created by interactions between interplanetary dust and the solar wind, and
discrete source pickup ions from comets, planets, and other discrete sources.
The investigators will characterize near-solar pickup ion sources by modeling
distribution functions and hydrodynamic properties of pickup ions produced from
near-solar and interstellar sources. They will also study the relative
significance of near-solar source pickup ions, interstellar source pickup ions,
and solar wind particles as seed populations for energetic particles and
anomalous cosmic rays.
