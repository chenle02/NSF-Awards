This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a new
low cost electro- chemical fabrication method to produce flexible photovoltaic
cells based on the commercially important copper indium diselenide (CIS) films.
The project will develop an innovative n-CIS solar cell with fewer components
and processing steps. The cell will be constructed on a flexible foil to reduce
weight, fragility and balance-of-system costs. The project also develops a new
roll-to-roll electrodeposition technology for large volume manufacturing. Phase
I will synthesize CIS films and construct n/p heterojunction devices on metal
foils. It will evaluate the solar cell performance to validate the concepts. The
proposed n-CIS solar cell configuration and its fabrication are specially
designed to simplify manufacturing, reduce costs and increase production speed.
It will circumvent the complexity, expense, safety and scale-up issues of the
present p-CIS technology. Its commercialization will provide a timely solution
to the nation's escalating energy and environmental problems. It will avert
future power crises and help reduce global warming.

Applications for the copper indium diselenide technology range from the electric
utility to satellites. Flexible, lightweight, photovoltaic cells may be used in
non-utility applications such as electric vehicles, building integration, mobile
systems and new space systems. Lower costs, fewer components and easier
manufacturing could translate into a wider spectrum of commercial markets.
