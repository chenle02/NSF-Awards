Laskowski is continuing his research in model theory, which is a branch of
mathematical logic. The PI's research is in three areas. It is well known that
almost all of the basic notions of first-order model theory are absolute, i.e.,
their interpretation does not change depending on the model of set theory one is
working in. The situation is known to be much more complicated for similar
concepts in infinitary languages, where even simple concepts such as
categoricity in power can fail to be absolute, even for cardinal preserving
forcings. A few years ago, it was noted that if one places extremely strong
stability theoretic conditions on a theory, then these conditions limit the
quantifier complexity of the elementary diagram of any model of the theory.
These bounds immediately give upper bounds on the computable complexity of
definable subsets of such a theory. The model theoretic notion of definability
of types over finite sets is intimately related to the notion of a compression
scheme in computational learning theory. This connection has beein fruitful in
both directions. A number of examples of concept classes that posess compression
schemes have been identified, and conversely this connection has led to a deeper
model theoretic understanding of dependent theories.

Model theory is concerned with the interplay between theories, i.e., sets of
sentences in a very formal language, and the classes of algebraic structures
(models) that satisfy these sentences. There is a well established taxonomy of
theories, which is based on the embeddability or non-embeddability of certain
configurations of elements into models of the theory. Laskowski has identified
certain classes of theories that have direct connections to limitations on data
compression and computational learning theory, and will continue his examination
of these theories.
