The technique of balancing cross-sections is important in structural studies
because a "balanced" section indicates that the structure could have evolved by
a physically plausible sequence of events. Because data are commonly limited,
balanced sections are almost always under constrained and therefore several
different interpretations may meet the criteria of section balance, Moreover,
the finite element grids used limit the application and can be technically
demanding. This project will develop a computer program package to expand the
application to include the temporal sequences and progressive heterogeneous
displacement and strain. The intent is to provide structural geologists with a
tool to more easily construct a balanced cross- section from raw data, assess
the balance in space and time, and provide the ability to modify interpretative
parts of the section interactively. Results will also be applied to a number of
existing areas where sufficient structural data have been recorded.
