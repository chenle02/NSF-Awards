9526317 Kirkpatrick This research will focus on the atomic/molecular scale
structural environments and dynamic behavior of geochemically and
environmentally important minerals. The three major components of this research
program are: adsorbed inorganic cations, adsorbed and exchanged inorganic anions
and interlayer exchanged inorganic anions and interlayer exchanged organic
species. The research will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR),
spectroscopy to simultaneously probe structure and dynamics at a local
atomic/molecular level and in the relatively slow frequency range of Hz to 100's
MHz. NMR will also be used to investigate mineral/water systems in situ.
Adsorption/exchange will be studied for a number of important cations (Na, Cd,
Hg and Cs), anions (borate, nitrate and carbonate) and neutral organic species
(phenol and pyridine) on a variety of important minerals (kaolinite, illite,
boehmite, sodalite and hydrotalcite). NMR methods have the potential to provide
important new information about the molecular scale interaction in these orgono-
clay complexes. The results of this project will significantly improve our
understanding of the surface adsorption and internal exchange of species between
minerals and aqueous fluids and are important to the areas of nuclear and
chemical hazardous waste management.
