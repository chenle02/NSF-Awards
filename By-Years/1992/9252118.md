The Chemistry Department is purchasing equipment for CHEMTREK II, a second
generation, year-long, freshman chemistry majors program which combines small-
scale chemistry with computer- interfaced experiments and simulations, a new
type of small- scale quantitative spectrophotometric instrumentation, and video-
enhanced problem-solving techniques. The major equipment items are microplate
spectophotometric readers (for small-scale quantitative spectrophotometric
measurements), computers with interfaces, software and, printers, and a
microscope camera system for recording small-scale phenomena. This program
brings together students with common goals to develop new and innovative
experiments, maximizes faculty-beginning student interactions. The goal of the
program is to motivate beginning chemistry majors and to integrate theory,
practice, and applications of chemistry in the undergraduate curriculum.
