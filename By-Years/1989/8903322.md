This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of Dr. Richard Crew of
the University of Minnesota. His research will center on the study of
Kloosterman sums by geometric methods, and in particular, he will investigate
the monodromy groups arising from certain p-adic differential equations that
come from these sums. This research is work in the Algebraic Geometry of finite
characteristic. Although the field originated with notions of continuously
varying geometric structures like lines and planes, in this context the Discrete
takes over, and methods akin to those from the theory of whole numbers are most
useful. Reciprocally, the algebraic geometry of finite characteristic is now
having great influence on the Theory of Numbers, and is finding application in
Computer Science and Coding Theory.
