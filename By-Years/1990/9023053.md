This study uses the theory of information transmission over communication
channels to explain how supply and demand information is communicated to the
public by market prices. The stock market is chosen as a specific example.
Rising and falling stock prices should signal fundamental changes in the value
of the underlying stocks. Excess stock price volatility occurs when stock prices
change but the fundamental stock values do not. The theory of information
transmission is used to show that such false price signals can be detected and
thereby discounted by market traders. Successful detection leads to a more
efficient market and increased social welfare by making the allocation of
national resources more efficient. The theoretical market model proposed is
validated using New York Stock Exchange stock price and volume data covering the
historically most volatile period of this exchange. The study is important in
understanding the general nature of information transmission and content. In
that regard, this study explores the fundamental characteristics of information
by using an engineering communications theory to analyze information flows in
economic markets.
