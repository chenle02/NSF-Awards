This project examines diffusion of rumors and misinformation during unrest. The
context is a large city where the COVID-19 outbreak has happened amid a large-
scale collective action. By empirically examining how falsehoods feed and are
fed by collective behaviors in this situation, the project aims to understand
how misinformation and rumors both online and offline co-evolve during a period
of unrest. Understanding rumor diffusion during unrest contributes to
identifying challenges for consensus building in contemporary communication
ecology. By studying rumor diffusion in a large-scale context, the study adds
value in knowing how authorities use misinformation. The project will have
impact on training of future practitioners in terms of how to deal with news
about unrest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research questions concern variation in
rumors, misinformation, and the sharing of these; interpolation of COVID-19
rumors into collective action narratives; differences in the patterns of rumors
and rumor-debunking messages; and the association between beliefs in
misinformation and participation in collective action. Two methodological
approaches are taken. First, string-matching techniques are employed to identify
rumors and rumor-debunking messages from a large corpus of digital data, crawled
from social media platforms. Computational methods including structural topic
modeling and diffusion tree network analysis are used to infer coherent themes
across rumor messages and to examine rumor diffusion patterns in terms of depth,
width, and interlayer ratios. Second, online surveys are conducted in both
regions using a stratified sample of about 1,500 anonymous participants.
Regression modeling is performed to understand relationships among beliefs in
different types of rumors, institutional trust, and protest
support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
