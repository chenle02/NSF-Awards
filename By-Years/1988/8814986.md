Stars form in interstellar clouds of gas and dust that are extremely cool,
clumpy, and in a general state of turbulence. This turbulence is passed on to
newly formed stars in the form of stellar motions. The Principal Investigator
proposes to study the motions of newly formed stars in star forming regions,
using as a data base roughly 800 high-precision radial velocity measurements of
some 300 low-mass pre-main sequence stars. The aim of the investigation is to
determine the initial conditions and early evolution of stars.
