A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the
&lt;br/&gt;R/V Cape Hatteras, a 136-ft long research vessel owned by the
National Science Foundation and operated by the Duke/UNC Oceanographic
Consortium as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
(UNOLS) research fleet. Five items were submitted for review. In order of
priority they were:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Transmissometer $4,057&lt;br/&gt;2)
Ocean Instruments Multi-Corer 800 $ 35,845 &lt;br/&gt;3) Ocean Instruments Mark-
III Box Corer $ 34,980 &lt;br/&gt;4) pH sensor $1,455&lt;br/&gt;5) Fluorometers-
CTD &amp; Flow-through $ 29,733&lt;br/&gt; TOTAL $106,070&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present
proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists
to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-
funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate
review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance
and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from
any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
