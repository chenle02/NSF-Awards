The PIs will deploy an autonomous underwater hydrophone (AUH) network in
conjunction with OBSs in the Lau Basin. Since T-wave generation processes are
not well understood the PIs will use the AUH and the OBSs to compare and
establish how to integrate the datasets, allowing them to constrain the
tectonics of the region and monitor both earthquake activity and volcanism. The
comparison will allow future hydrophone data to be used to extract quantitative
information regarding earthquake source parameters and processes. Broader
impacts include collecting both the seismically-generated signals and whale
songs which will be used in the proposed development of a K-12 curriculum module
that includes the building of a hydrophone. There is also graduate and
undergraduate student participation and continued public outreach by the PIs at
local, national, and international levels.
