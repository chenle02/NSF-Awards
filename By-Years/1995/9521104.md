9521104 COWEN It is widely appreciated that coral reef fish larvae are
transported to reef habitats by ocean currents. However, little is known about
the behaviors that larval fishes perform to ensure their return to adult
habitats. This study will employ an interdisciplinary approach to examine how
circulation patterns influence retention and recruitment. Specifically, three-
dimensional surveys of larval fish distributions, periodic monitoring of
recruitment and detailed measurements of the water flow regime will be conducted
in the vicinity of an isolated island (Barbados). Larval fishes will be
collected with MOCNESS net tows. Local flow and water column structure will be
mapped with ADCP, CTD, current meters and satellite imagery. Data from these
tows and instruments will provide a basis for understanding linkages between the
intra- and interannual variability of local flow, as well as relationships to
the frequency and duration of mesoscale events. ***
