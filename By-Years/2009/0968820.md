This award funds the research activities of Professors Ira Wasserman, Eanna
Flanagan, and Rachel Bean at Cornell University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has
been more than a decade since the first hints that the expansion of the Universe
is accelerating were inferred from observations of Type Ia supernovae at
cosmological distances. This unexpected observation could be explained if the
Universe is pervaded by dark energy, which could be in the form of a
cosmological constant. Although particle theories, including string theory, can
accommodate a cosmological constant, they generally require a much larger value
than is compatible with the nature of the Universe revealed by cosmological
observations. As a result, the ultimate cause of the acceleration of the
Universe remains obscure, and other theoretical possibilities exist. The
research of Wasserman, Flanagan, and Bean will examine these important issues in
various different studies. One study will examine how accurately it can be
established that the dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant. The PI's
will also investigate phenomenological implications of higher dimensions for the
expansion of the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will also have
broader impacts, primarily via the training of Cornell Ph.D. students. The
proposed research is multidisciplinary in nature, and will further develop
already-existing ties between the particle physics, string theory and relativity
groups at Cornell. In addition to disseminating their work via conventional
academic channels (journal publications, seminars, conferences), the three
investigators are deeply involved in programs aimed at communicating the latest
scientific results to the general public.
