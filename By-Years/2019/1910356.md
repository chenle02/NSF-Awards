With recent advances in computer vision and widespread availability of capable
hardware, augmented reality has become a consumer-grade technology. It has
enabled a new paradigm of digital interaction using camera-based devices,
presenting novel ways to interact with the real world. Simultaneously, another
emerging trend is the prevalence of data exploration in the real world. One
challenge in exploring real-world data is that it is often found in isolation,
lacking any contextual information. Further, such data is commonly found in ad-
hoc formats, making it hard to combine with digital data. Building on these
trends, this project aims to enable augmented reality (AR)-driven discovery and
decision making over ad-hoc real-world data. This approach towards data
exploration and enrichment using AR-based interaction will open up possibilities
in a wide variety of domains, including education, healthcare, architecture
design, and emergency services. AR broadens the scope of participation for
groups who would otherwise be unable to use traditional computing interfaces
such as keyboards, addressing challenges of literacy and motor
abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a principled framework
for exploration and understanding of real-world data using AR. The primary goals
of this project are as follows. As a first step, the project will design a new
grammar and visual encoding that allows for both querying and layering of
structured data results in AR space. Secondly, it will devise methods to enrich
real-world images and video streams with schema-rich information using cloud-
based data stores by considering not just optical character recognition, but
also visual features and context. Third, the project will develop a data storage
and query processing backend that is optimized specifically for highly
interactive, AR-specific workloads. The outcomes of this research will not only
advance the understanding of building data exploration systems for AR, but it
will additionally help reduce the barrier to entry for software developers to
build data-rich AR applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
