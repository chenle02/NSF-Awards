This project will develop new applications of DNA in polymer physics, in fields
as diverse as adhesion, polymer brushes, reptation, low dimensional systems,
confined geometries, and topological statistical mechanics. It is expected that
this research will provide significant new progress towards the resolution of
open questions in these fields. Specific experiments that will be performed
include the following. The kinetics of adhesive fracture will be studied by
measuring the dynamic forces as two entangled polymers are separated. The static
and dynamic behavior of a DNA brush will be measured, thus testing the
predictions of various theories by providing a direct measurement of single
molecule configurations and dynamics. The theory of reptation will be critically
examined by searching for correlated motion of polymers in a melt. Low
dimensional statistical mechanics will be studied by confining DNA in
microfabricated structures. Finally, the effects of topological knots on the
statistical mechanical behavior of DNA will be investigated by directed knot
tying. This research will be integrated with educational activities on many
levels. Graduate students will be trained with an interdisciplinary range of
skills. An upper level undergraduate/first year graduate course on `The
Biophysics of DNA` will also be developed, that will serve to provide an
integrated curricula knitting together the various theoretical and experimental
applications of DNA to biophysics, and vice versa. This grant is made under the
NSF `CAREER` Program. Support is provided jointly by the MPS Division of
Physics, the MPS office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the BIO Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.
