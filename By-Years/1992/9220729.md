The program focuses on the thermodynamic properties of films (one to several
layers thick) of the so-called "quantum fluids and solids" (molecular hydrogens;
atomic heliums and their mixtures), formed on the solid surface of clean, very
well characterized substrates. Specific topics addressed include solidification
of molecular hydrogen in a monolayer, to search for a low-temperature liquid
phase and possible superfluidity; liquid condensation of helium 4 adsorbed on
hydrogen in a monolayer; fluid behavior of helium 3 on a substrate of square
symmetry; interfacial melting in porous media; and the development of new
substrates. %%% This program studies the phenomenon of adsorption as it applies
to quantum fluids and the modification of the fluid properties occasioned by
constraining them to thin layers. Beyond advancing their understanding of these
very unusual fluids, the work offers the possibility of discovering new
phenomena in the area of superfluids.
