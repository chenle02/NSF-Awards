9413527 Przybycien The Raman Spectrometer is to be dedicated to support research
in biotechnology. In particular, the spectrometer is to be use for the
structural characterization of protein samples obtained from bioprocessing
environments. The primary mode of operation will be conventional spectral
acquisition for protein structural estimation as well as more fundamental
research into the use of low-frequency Raman spectra for more refined estimates
of protein structure. the spectrometer is to support research projects in the
chemical engineering, chemistry, and physics departments at Rensselaer as well
as faculty at Princeton University and the University of Texas at Austin. ***
