The objective of this research project is the development of new methods for the
analysis of systems described by partial differential equations, in the presence
of a noisy (random) perturbation and small parameters. We are interested in the
description of the different behaviors of such systems, when the parameters are
vanishing, and of the interplay between different limiting regimes. In
particular, we will study new mathematical problems which are important for
applications, as well as new effects in classical problems. The treatment of
these problems for systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom is a
relatively new field of investigation, which has already stirred up a vivid
interest in many fields, also because these are very complex objects and any
effort that goes in the direction of their simplification is important for a
deeper understanding of the main features of the models and for a better
effectiveness in applications. Our analysis requires the development of new
methods and the substantial introduction of new techniques which have to range
over many fields in mathematics. Our goal in this proposal is studying small
deterministic and stochastic perturbations of a wide class of systems described
by stochastic partial differential equations. As a matter of fact, small
perturbations, which are negligible on one time scale, can become crucial on a
larger time scale. The long-time influence of small perturbations has been
considered in a number of our previous papers, and the present project has to be
considered as a continuation of this program. Limit theorems, especially the
large deviation theory, the averaging principle and the interplay between them,
as well as several generalizations of the Smoluchowskii-Kramers approximation
are our main tools. Systems with many/infinite degrees of freedom often have
perturbations of different origin and different order. Long-time behavior of
such perturbed systems should be described by a hierarchy of approximations. On
the other hand, long-time behavior of pure deterministic systems with
instabilities, under certain conditions, should be described by a stochastic
process. Therefore, the natural generality for the problem is in considering
both deterministic and stochastic perturbations of stochastic systems (not
necessarily deterministic dynamical systems).
