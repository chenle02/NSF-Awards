A high field (200 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is being
used to introduce students in organic chemistry courses to NMR. They receive
"hands on" experience in the use of the instrument and direct experience in
obtaining information on the structures of compounds they have synthesized.
Student are introduced to the NMR technique early in the introductory organic
course in both lecture and laboratory. They will gain first hand experience in
the use of this powerful tool for structure elucidation of organic and certain
inorganic compounds. They will have access to the instrument during most of the
15 laboratories in the two semester sequence of organic courses. The instrument
is also used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis by students in
undergraduate research, quantitative analysis, and environmental science
courses. *
