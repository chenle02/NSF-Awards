9503827 Pan This award supports the collaboration of Dr. Austin Pan, School of
Civil Engineering, Purdue University and Mr. Mitsuo Miyazaki, Sumitomo
Construction Company, Tokyo, Japan. Project funding will enable Dr. Pan to spend
six months in Japan, resident at the Sumitomo Construction Company, in order to
learn about viscous-damping walls from the inventor of this technology, Mr.
Miyazaki. Working together, they will share their knowledge and experience to
expedite the development of viscous-damping walls and its application for
earthquake resistant construction. This project brings together research
scientists from two countries working in the area of earthquake engineering. The
U. S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar with research
techniques, equipment, and facilities at Sumitomo Construction Company while
contributing to the overall research effort. This collaboration will not only be
mutually beneficial to the U.S. and Japan, it will also benefit all countries
where earthquakes offer a prevailing threat. Therefore, this proposal fulfills
the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific
knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
