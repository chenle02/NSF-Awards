Intellectual Merit The proposed work is to produce a high resolution image of
the upper mantle velocity anomalies for a large area of the Gulf of
California/Baja region. These images will define the extent of the subducted
slab beneath the Baja California Peninsula and define where the mantle is
upwelling beneath the Gulf of California. This region is of high interest to the
MARGINS community and results from the study will be relevant to those studying
the spatial and temporal variations in volcanism in the Gulf of California, and
those trying to understand the tectonic history of Baja California. Broader
Impacts The broader impacts include support of a graduate student and
involvement of an undergraduate during the summer months. The results will be of
interest to a broad community of geologists and geophysicists.
