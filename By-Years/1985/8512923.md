Paints and surface coatings are suspensions consisting of colloidal polymer
particles dispersed in an aqueous phase (also called latexes). These suspensions
are produced via emulsion polymerization, a heterogeneous process in which
polymers grow in an oily phase into which initiators and monomers diffuse from
the aqueous phase. The suspension is applied to a surface and dries, initially
forming a weak latex film. After a few days these increase in strength and
become tough and leathery. In this research, it will be proved that this film
formation occurs because the polymer layers form monolithic colids by
interdiffusion of individual chains across initial bundaries--i.e., the polymer
chains, once freed from the confines of the latex, expand and try to attain
their random coil configurations. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used
to look at how these high molecular weight polymers behave both during their
formation and during the setting stage after drying. Knowledge of this behavior
can then be used to design other high strength polymers such as liquid crystals.
