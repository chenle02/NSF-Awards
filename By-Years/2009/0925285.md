The objective of this research is to develop epitaxial GaN and related alloy
based nanowires and investigate their magnetic, optical and electrical
properties for nanoelectronic device applications. The approach will utilize a
controlled catalyst deposition followed by chemical vapor deposition methods.

Intellectual Merit: The new technology involves controlled deposition of Ni
catalyst nanoparticles with small dimensions followed by chemical vapor
deposition leading to the production of GaN epitaxial nanowire networks on the
substrate. The crystal structure of the new kind of GaN nanowires is of the
cubic zinc blende type, technologically more significant than typically grown
wurtzite GaN. Growth procedure for such epitaxial GaN nanowire networks and the
related alloys will be optimized in this project; magnetic properties of GaMnN
nanowires will be studied by means of magnetization and magnetic force
microscopy; optical properties such as photoluminescence, Raman spectra will be
investigated; electrical properties: FET characteristics and LED characteristics
will be investigated.

Broad Impact: The epitaxial configuration of the nanowires is perfectly suited
for device fabrication - the technology is high-throughput, easily scalable to
wafer-sizes and compatible with advanced micro and nanoengineering processes.
The technique allows for complete control and flexibility over tailoring the
structure, optical and transport properties. From a fundamental aspect, the
project will enhance research and discovery in the technologically important
field of GaN-based nanowire systems. The research will provide students
(graduate, undergraduate and high school students) with interdisciplinary
educational experience through an ongoing nanotechnology course, a newly
proposed laboratory-based nanotechnology course and also through additional
laboratory facilities. The project will contribute to the professional
development of students through publications in refereed journals and conference
presentations.
