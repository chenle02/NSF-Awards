9306758 Vogt This research addresses effects of wood decomposition on ecosystem
processes in stream, riparian, and upslope locations in a tropical rainforest
ecosystem. Manipulation of woody debris (removal and addition, as well as
natural amounts of wood) will indicate the role of wood in vegetation growth,
aquatic and terrestrial community structure, and nutrient cycling processes.
Carbon and nutrient pools, mineralization and retention, plant growth, and
community composition will be measured and compared among the treated plots. The
five-year project will indicate the length of time wood continues to influence
ecosystem processes. %%% Little is known about ecosystem responses to large
inputs of woody debris following disturbances, especially in tropical
ecosystems. Large woody debris decomposes relatively slowly and provides
substrates and nutrients for a variety of organisms. Therefore, the large inputs
of woody material following disturbances can influence ecosystem processes
significantly over long time periods. This research will indicate the magnitude
of effect of manipulated levels of woody debris in stream, riparian and upslope
ecosystems in a tropical rainforest. ***
