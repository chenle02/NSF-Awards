9753227 Parks This project seeks new knowledge and understanding of materials
that are at the forefront of condensed matter physics research through the use
of terahertz spectroscopy. Materials of interest include, for example, a new
compound recently discovered that contains clusters of twelve manganese atoms
with a total spin of 10. Quantum tunneling of the spin was observed, and because
the spin-split levels are separated by energies of 1.2 THz, terahertz
spectroscopy is well suited to characterizing these levels. Capability for doing
this spectroscopy at temperatures well below the measurement frequency is
important for studying other systems as well, such as vibrational modes of
semiconductor nanocrystals, quasiparticle scattering rates in high temperature
superconductors, and Drude peaks in materials with extremely high electronic
effective masses. %%% This is a research enhancement grant made under the
Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program.
The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
level. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and
education through undergraduate student participation in research. ***
