The purpose of this project is to develop a laboratory- scale, prototype
intelligent sheet metal stamping die. The motivation for this effort is the need
to reduce part failures during drawing and improve final product quality.
Failure occurs typically by either tearing or wrinkling of the sheet. Conditions
leading to part failure include either excessive or insufficient restraining
force in the blank holder region. The intelligent die is intended to sense these
conditions, and to take corrective action. Such action would consist of altering
the level of the restraining force by adjustment of the drawbead penetration
and/or the blank holder pressure. The creation of a real-time process control
system for the intelligent stamping die involves several issues: Detailed,
quantitative descriptions of the local tool-sheet interface forces acting in the
relevant regions of tool-workpiece contact must be produced; the deformation of
the unsupported sheet between the punch and die shoulder must be sensed and
characterized; the deformation of the sheet by punch, die shoulder, and drawbead
must be described. The failure of sheet metal forming processes industry is
somewhat unpredictable, with many adjustments by technicians required before
acceptable parts are produced. The project promises to automate this adjustment
process and allow the die configuration to be varied while the part is being
formed.
