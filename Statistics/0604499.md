The wavelet method is widely used in many applications, such as signal
processing, medical imaging, pattern recognition, and many others. In this
project, the investigator focuses on applications of wavelet methods to analyze
censored data and estimate non-parametric curves with long range dependence
data. The project is to establish asymptotically optimal and robust estimators
for nonparametric function estimations with censored data and long memory data.
It extends beyond the standard Gaussian error assumption to non-Gaussian error
structures, with long memory.

This project studies a class of important statistical tools called 'wavelet
methods' for censored and long memory data. It has wide range of applications in
signal process, medical imaging, pattern recognition and many others. It will
provide more reliable and flexible methods to examine unknown structures of the
underlying functional relationship between different features encountered in
many applications.
