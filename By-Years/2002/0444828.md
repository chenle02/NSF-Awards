This award provides funding to support student and postdoc travel to participate
in the 2005 Quantum Information Science Gordon Conference. The conference is
being held during the period between 27 February and 4 March 2005 and will
sponsor a broad program that touches upon a wide breadth of research activities
related to the fundamental understanding of quantum information as well as
potential experimental realizations of quantum logic systems. Students will
participate through presentation of posters and through formal and informal
interactions with leading scientists across the spectrum of disciplines that
contribute to the study of quantum information.
