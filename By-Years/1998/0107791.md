The main goals of this project are concerned with the study of
the&lt;br/&gt;regularity properties of the solutions of the nonlinear wave
equations&lt;br/&gt;that arise in connection with the Einstein equations and
more general&lt;br/&gt;quasilinear wave equations. In particular, we address the
questions of&lt;br/&gt;local well posedness for the above equations. This
project also&lt;br/&gt;investigates the global dispersive effects for the linear
Schroedinger&lt;br/&gt;equation with variable
coefficients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Einstein equations is one of
the cornerstones of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;relativity. They play a fundamental
role in the description of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of the universe. Since the
equations can not be solved&lt;br/&gt;explicitly with exception of a few very
special cases, we need to&lt;br/&gt;understand the qualitative properties of its
solutions. We try to&lt;br/&gt;understand whether the solutions persist in time
without exhibiting&lt;br/&gt;an abnormal behavior. To gain insight we do it for
the more general&lt;br/&gt;class of equations. We also interested in
understanding the connections&lt;br/&gt;between the classical and quantum
behavior of particles. This leads&lt;br/&gt;us to the study of the behavior of
solutions of the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;equation of the quantum mechanics, the
Schroedinger equation.&lt;br/&gt;
