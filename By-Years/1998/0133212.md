An approach in which students become teachers by using algorithm visualization
technology not only to construct their own visualizations, but also to present
those visualizations to their instructor and peers for feedback and discussion
will be studied within the context of a third-year, undergraduate computer
science course on computer algorithms. This approach will be used to develop a
studio-based algorithms course in which the construction and discussion of
visualizations are the central activities of the course. Specifically, students
will use algorithm visualization technology to construct their own visual
solutions to algorithm design and analysis problems. In a variety of regularly
scheduled review sessions, they will present their solutions to instructors and
peers for feedback, discussion, and evaluation. This research will yield several
products and outcomes from which science educators, educational researchers,
visualization technologists, and cognitive anthropologists stand to benefit.
