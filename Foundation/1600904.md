This project aims to address several problems in the areas of descriptive
combinatorics and orbit equivalence. These topics lie at the interface of
descriptive set theory, measured group theory, graph theory, ergodic theory,
probability theory, and operator algebras. In recent years, mathematicians in
these fields have come to realize that problems concerning algebraic, dynamical,
and descriptive structural complexity of countable group and equivalence
relations can be fruitfully studied via descriptive combinatorial and graph
theoretic means. The principal investigator and collaborators have employed this
combinatorial perspective to create new tools used to answer several open
problems in these fields. In addition to a combinatorial perspective, research
in these fields is also facilitated by a global perspective, from which problems
in ergodic theory, for example, may be seen as topological-dynamical and
descriptive problems concerning actions of the group of automorphisms of a
standard probability space. This research project aims to generate more new
general tools and to promote fruitful interactions among these fields.

Measured group theory seeks to understand countably infinite groups through
ergodic theoretic properties of their measurable actions on standard probability
spaces, and particularly through structural properties of the orbit equivalence
relations generated by these actions. The motivating phenomenon is that
algebraic properties of an acting group are often expressed through measurable
properties of the associated equivalence relation. An extreme form of this
phenomenon is seen in orbit equivalence and cocycle rigidity and superrigidity
theorems, which state that in certain settings an equivalence relation
completely remembers the group from which it was generated. At the other extreme
are what might be called orbit equivalence anti-rigidity theorems, stating that
certain groups and actions cannot be distinguished by looking at the equivalence
relations they generate. This research project touches upon phenomena at both of
these extremes. The questions are motivated by rigidity/anti-rigidity results
established by the principal investigator and collaborators, which have led to
new questions addressed in this project. The project will address problems
concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of
countable groups and equivalence relations, specifically in the areas of orbit
equivalence, treeability, cocycle superrigidity, weak equivalence rigidity, and
measurable combinatorial properties and parameters of graphs and group actions.
The project pursues a descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic approach to
these problems.
