It has been known since the early 1980s that knot and link complements decompose
into pieces admitting a geometric structure, with the most common geometry being
hyperbolic. However, the connection between hyperbolic geometry and other knot
and link invariants is still not well understood. The investigator will use
recent developments and techniques in 3-manifold geometry and topology to make
connections between hyperbolic geometry and link invariants, focusing on
problems in two areas. First, she will relate hyperbolic geometry to quantum
invariants, in particular continuing her recent work to find connections between
hyperbolic geometry and the colored Jones polynomial. Second, she will obtain
bounds on hyperbolic quantities based on diagrammatical and topological
invariants of knots and links, for example bounding volume and cusp volume, and
finding isotopy classes of geodesics. As part of the educational portion of this
work, she will organize two conferences on connections of hyperbolic geometry,
and continue her work with undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students.

This project concerns the study of 3-dimensional spaces called 3-manifolds,
which include the space of our universe (with three spatial dimensions). These
spaces appear in physics, mechanics, microbiology, and chemistry, and so we wish
to better understand their mathematical properties. One way to study 3-manifolds
is to drill out tubes around circles from a 3-dimensional sphere, and then
reattach the tubes in a different manner. The space of drilled tubes about
circles is called a link complement, or knot complement if there is just one
circle. In this way, knot and link complements are building blocks for
3-manifolds. The investigator will study the geometry of knot and link
complements, with the hope of finding new results on the properties of broader
classes of 3-manifolds. This project includes many provisions for training
students. Much of the research will be carried out with the assistance of
undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, as part of this project the
investigator will run two research conferences, during which several graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers will be invited to present their related
work. Finally, the investigator will continue to run mathematical workshops for
children throughout the school year.
