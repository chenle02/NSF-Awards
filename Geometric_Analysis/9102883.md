The concept of a bundle, be it a vector bundle, a principal bundle, or an
associated fiber bundle,has been and continues to be a central tool in
differential geometry. Questions in geometry can be analyzed via bundles using
the theory of connections. Moreover, the geometry becomes even richer with the
addition of holomorphic ideas. Various topics to be addressed in this conference
are the study of Einstein-Hermitian structures on holomorphic vector bundles,
the concept of a harmonic metric on a complex bundle, and the action of the
gauge group of a principal G-bundle on the space of connections. This grant will
partially support a conference entitled "Bundles in Complex Differential
Geometry" to be held March 14-16, 1991 at Idaho State University. The
organization of the talks will involve a modified forum wherein the speakers
will field questions from the participants on the more detailed nature of their
particular topic. Graduate students and junior researchers should be able to
profit greatly from this format.
