This is a technical proposal to replace the existing 400 Mbyte capacity
recording system in the thirty ONR ocean bottom seismometer instruments with new
systems with a capacity in excess of 2 gigabytes. The ONR instruments are
operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution as a facility for the US academic community. Thus this improved
recording capacity can potentially benefit a side range of marine seismic
experiments.
