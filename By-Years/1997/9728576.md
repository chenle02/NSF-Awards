9728576 Dvorak Salinity is an environmental condition in many natural
situations. Salinization is also a major hazard to irrigated agriculture.
Therefore, the understanding of the mechanisms by which plants adapt to saline
environmental conditions is important both for the sake of the basic knowledge
and for practical reasons. In the previous phase of this project, an amphiploid
(a stable hybrid) from a cross between Lophopyrum elongatum, a highly salt-
tolerant relative of wheat, and wheat was shown to be salt-tolerant. Wheat lines
carrying individually each of the seven L. elongatum chromosomes were developed
and used to identify Lophopyrum elongatum chromosomes controlling salt
tolerance. Each L. elongatum chromosome was found to enhance salinity tolerance
of wheat. Chromosomes 1E, 3E, 6E, and 7E were found to be enhance salinity
tolerance by controlling potassium/sodium ion selectivity. In this phase of the
project these for chromosomes will be recombined with specific wheat
chromosomes. Genes controlling salt tolerance via enhancing potassium/sodium ion
selectivity on these four chromosomes will be identified and mapped.
