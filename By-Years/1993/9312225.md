9312225 Kukuk Ecological, behavioral, and genetic approaches will be used to
explore the origin and maintenance of cooperation among non-relatives in the
group-living halictine bee species Lasioglossum hemichalceum. Field studies of
nest parasitism, ant predation, and nest availability will address the question
of why living in groups is advantageous. Field studies of individual survival
and reproductive success will provide data to test a mathematical model of how
this form of cooperation works. This model uses state-of-the-art methods to
predict the number of individuals that will perform risky tasks (such as
foraging) for any given group size. Genetic studies, using DNA fingerprinting,
will allow Dr. Kukuk to establish genealogies for groups to precisely assess the
reproductive success of group members. This multifaceted research project
represents a significant advance in the study of cooperation among non-
relatives. The importance of sociality as an evolutionary innovation cannot be
overemphasized. Cooperation among groups of individuals led to the success of
Homo sapiens, and is paramount in nature. Social insects are ecologically
dominant in most terrestrial habitats in terms of both energy consumption and
biomass. Social innovation and diversity have evolved in many insect lineages.
The halictine bees are of central importance in the study of social evolution
because of the enormous diversity of social organization found in this
subfamily. In addition, the form of cooperation found in the halictine species
L. hemichalceum is not well studied, even though it is common. Answering the how
and why questions about the evolution of cooperation among non-relatives will
challenge currently held theories that emphasize the importance of genealogical
relationships among group members, and will provide insights into alternative
forms of social organization.
