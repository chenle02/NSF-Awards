9361195 Halverson A device called the Bucky Grid is widely used for enhancing
X-ray images. The Grid allows primary X-ray radiation to pass through unimpeded
while stopping scattered radiation from reaching the X- ray film and fogging the
image. The Bucky Grid is limited in its use to diagnostic radiology applications
for "spots" larger than one millimeter, making it unsuitable for mammography
procedures. The proposed investigation would determine the feasibility of using
ion beam etching and photolithography to create high- definition, high
transmission grids with line widths less than 0.1 mm. Successful results from
this investigation would lead to the development of a medical device that would
reduce the level of X-ray power required to produce clinically usable images and
offering the potential of use in mammagrapy procedures. ***
