This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic environment and its
role in global change which is promoted by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.
It is a three year pilot study for management of data required for and produced
by the Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions element of the ARCSS Program. The goal
of the project is to provide a central access point for archival and
distribution of data resulting from ARCSS research. The data management project
will include the following products: 1) development of a matrix inventory of
data required for process and modeling studies; 2) coordination and facilitation
of data exchange among PIs, including development of guidelines on data set
formats and documentation for data exchange and archival; 3) development of
plans to interface ARCSS data sets with existing national and international data
centers and research programs; and 4) presentation to ARCSS Project Management
of a plan for distribution of data directories and key data sets on appropriate
media.
