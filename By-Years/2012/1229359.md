The protein purification system that is requested with this proposal is an
essential piece of equipment for research characterizing and bioengineering
light sensitive proteins from cyanobacteria. It is necessary to separate
proteins from the E.coli expression system that are used for bioengineering
proteins. The focus of The Spiller Lab is to engineer a small, bright red
fluorescent protein tag for in vivo microscopy. Undergraduate, post
baccalaureate and glide-year students at Mills College are engaged in the
laboratory work.
