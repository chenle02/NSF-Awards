During the 1930's, the United States Government sponsored large Work Projects
Administration (WPA) archaeological research projects in Eastern and
Southeastern Texas. Many of the excavated sites were extensive and yielded large
numbers of artifacts. These are currently housed at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), a unit of the University of Texas at Austin.
Unfortunately, these important materials are poorly stored. They are difficult
to use for research purposes and in danger of losing their scientific value.
With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Hester and his colleagues will
continue to upgrade collection storage and documentation. They will reinventory
the materials and check them against item-by-item lists compiled at WPA central
laboratories. The artifacts will then be reclassified and repackaged to prevent
damage. The data will then be entered into TARL's computerized collections
management data base. Accompanying documents will also be properly stored and
assessed for possible conservation. This project is important for several
reasons. The WPA collections constitute an extremely important archaeological
resource which can shed light on the prehistory of the southern United States.
However, because of their poor state of curation, they are extremely difficult
to use. The planned work by Dr. Hester and staff will remedy this situation.
