9728242 Mykles A one-day symposium on the cellular and molecular aspects of
crustacean molting and development has been organized by Dr. Mykles. Leaders in
the field have been invited to summarize and discuss recent findings on gene
structure and expression, peptide and steroid hormone synthesis; structure and
function; limb regenerated, and exoskeletal and muscle protein metabolism. It is
anticipated that cross-communication will take place between the junior and
senior scientists and that the proceedings will be published in a journal that
is available to the public.
