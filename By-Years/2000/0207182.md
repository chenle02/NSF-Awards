The PI will coordinate field work at the Pipe Creek Sinkhole, a recently
discovered site in Grant County, Indiana, which preserves unconsolidated
sediments containing a diverse late Tertiary assemblage of animals and plants.
The study will be a collaborative effort between Indiana-Purdue University, Fort
Wayne and the Indiana State Museum (the repository for specimens). Field work
will comprise on-site wet-sieving and concentration of sediments (some sediment
samples will be bagged for later sieving in the lab). Sieve concentrate will
then be picked for small fossils in the lab. The PI will create a database in
which each identifiable specimen will be associated with records about the
sample and size fraction of sediment from which it came. This will eventually be
used to analyze the paleoecology of the site. In addition, the PI will set up a
lab for preparing thin sections of lower vertebrate bones from the assemblage
for osteohistological/skeletochronological analysis relevant to reconstructing
the late Tertiary paleoclimate in the region of the Pipe Creek Sinkhole.
