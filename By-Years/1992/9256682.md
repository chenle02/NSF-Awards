9256682 Brown The principal objective of the National Science Foundation
Graduate Research Traineeship Program is to increase the numbers of talented
U.S. undergraduates enrolling in doctoral programs in critical and emerging
areas of science and engineering. Proposals were solicited from institutions
whose existing facilities and staff could accommodate additional graduate
students in Ph.D. programs of high quality. The program is also intended to
contribute to strengthening the Nation's human resource base across all
geographic sectors and among all under- represented groups. Graduate Research
Traineeship awards are packages of student support. The colleges and
universities that receive the awards are responsible for the selection of
trainees, retention of trainees, and administration of traineeships. Cornell
University plans to increase the number of U.S. Ph.D. statisticians through a
program of interdisciplinary training. The objective of the program will be to
produce students with the skills and desire to (a) conduct cross- disciplinary
research in science and engineering and (b) foster undergraduate education in
the mathematical sciences, particularly probability and statistics, from a
broad, interdisciplinary perspective. Students will attend a weekly
workshop/minicourse program to introduce them to the applications of statistics.
As their study progresses they will attend more specialized courses both in
statistics and other fields of science and proceed to interdisciplinary
statistical research.
