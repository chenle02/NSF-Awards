This award supports cooperative research on predatory vertebrates to be
performed by Peter Feinsinger of the University of Florida and F. M. Jaksic of
the Catholic University of Chile in Santiago. They will study the interaction of
mammalian carnivores based on hunting habitats, times and prey. Counts of
predators and prey and information on the predator diets will be used to
investigate avoidance or tolerance of predators for each other. These
interactions affect the use of the habitat landscape by each predator species.
Such information will help predator species conservation through habitat
protection. This project is a particularly good example of increased research
productivity through collaboration. Feinsinger has developed statistical
analysis techniques for large data sets which will broaden Jaksic's capabilities
in research and in the teaching of ecology. Feinsinger's research on mechanisms
of competition closely parallels Jaksic's work on guilds of carnivorous
vertebrates. This research on vertebrate predators consuming vertebrate prey
will broaden Feinsinger's perspective on guild structure and dynamics. The
collaboration will aid the new program in ecology at the Catholic University
which will train graduate students from Chile and other South American
countries. On the other hand, Jaksic's presence at Florida will enhance the
ecological content of the program there.
