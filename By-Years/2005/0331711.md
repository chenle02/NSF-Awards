-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;Workshop
on medical imaging and inverse problems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop, to
be held August 4-9, 2003 in Vancouver, Canada, will focus on recent developments
in medical imaging, in particularly the advances in mathematics which have
allowed for significant enhancement of widely used imaging techniques such as
X-ray tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonic imaging.
Mathematical developments in emerging medical imaging modalities like electrical
impedance tomography and optical tomography will also be surveyed. The aim of
the workshop is to bring together investigators working on different aspects of
these fields and to encourage interaction between mathematicians, physicists and
physicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be jointly sponsored by the
Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) and NSF. Another aim of the
workshop is to foster international collaboration between US and Canadian
mathematicians and scientists. The invited speakers are mathematicians working
on applications of inverse problems to medical imaging and scientists and
physicians dealing directly with the applications. The grant will allow junior
researchers and members of underrepresented groups in Mathematics to participate
in this workshop and learn about new mathematical developments in medical
imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
