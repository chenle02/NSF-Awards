In this project funded by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Stevens will develop a method of saccharide
conformational analysis from chiroptical measurements. The calculational model
relates saccharide optical rotation to geometry-dependent interactions among
bond-localized electronic transitions. The technique will be used in studies of
geometry and conformational energy of a variety of saccharides including
mannose, agarose, carrageenan, and subsequently extended to include some
C-disaccharides. %%% Complex sugars have fundamental biological significance and
are also useful in technology because of their physical and chemical properties.
The ability to predict such properties by molecular modeling is developing
rapidly, but further develop- ment requires guidance by experiment interpreted
by advanced theoretical methods. Stevens will develop a procedure for
interpreting measurements of the rotation of the plane of polarized light in
terms of the geometrical conformation of the sugar molecule responsible for the
effect. The experiments can then be more broadly used to evaluate saccharide
force fields for use in the modeling procedures.
