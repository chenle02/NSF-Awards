Knyazev 0208773 In many application areas, there is a pressing and increasing
need for novel numerical techniques for solving very large algebraic eigenvalue
problems. They arise naturally as discretization of continuous models described
by systems of partial differential equations and pose new numerical challenges.
The problem matrix may be available only implicitly through a function that
computes the corresponding vector-matrix product for a given vector, which thus
calls for matrix-free eigenvalue solvers. The growth of the problem size often
leads to badly conditioned problems, which require improved algorithm stability
and new tools to estimate the accuracy of computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Classical eigenvalue solvers that do not scale linearly with the problem size
are very expensive for modern practical problems. The focus of the present
project is on an alternative technique, called preconditioning. While the
mainstream research in the area introduces preconditioning for eigenvalue
problems by using preconditioned inner iterations for solving linear systems
with shift-and-invert matrices, the approach of the present project is to
incorporate preconditioning directly into Krylov-based solvers such as the
locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The
preconditioned iterative methods of this kind are specially designed for large-
scale ill-conditioned matrix-free problems and can be effective and
parallelizable. The investigator studies preconditioning for singular values
computations, an adaptation of the preconditioned eigensolvers to some problems
with nonlinear dependence on the spectral parameter, and an efficient solution
of eigenproblems resuling from partial differential equations with large jumps
in coefficients. The investigator develops fast, reliable methods to solve very
large eigenvalue problems. Numerical simulations are performed on modern
parallel computing systems, e.g., on a Beowulf cluster. The targeted
applications for a joint investigation with engineers include structural
dynamics finite element models associated with re-entry vehicles and their
complex aerospace and electronic systems, and evolution of the error covariances
in Kalman filter equations for chemistry-transport atmospheric models.
