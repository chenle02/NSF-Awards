Simpson will continue his axiomatic studies of ordinary mathematics in the
context of subsystems of second order arithmetic. Aspects of the research
include: (1) Hilbert's program and functional analysis; (2) a variant of
Hilbert's program based on polynomial time computability; (3) reverse
mathematics in the context of countable algebra and countable combinatorics.
Such studies illuminate the theoretical limits of computability and other
foundational matters.
