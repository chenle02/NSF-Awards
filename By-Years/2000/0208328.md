This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Influence of
mating system on patterns of parentage and fitness correlates in a garter snake
model, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis." This research explores the role of kin
recognition in the mating system by asking whether parental relatedness
influences paternal contribution and, in turn, maternal fitness in natural
populations of the red-sided garter snake. This constitutes the first test for
the presence of kin recognition and first rigorous study of inbreeding
depression in any snake species.
