This two year plan of postdoctoral study will allow Dr. Kirkus the opportunity
to develop an important independent research program toward understanding
prejudice in subtle and overt forms so that we may have a better knowledge of
the situational constraints that promote positive cross-ethnic relations. The
plan has four components: (1) conducting a project examining the effects of
self-disclosure of personalized information on intergroup relations, (2)
receiving training in psychophysiological measurement, including the use of
facial electromyography (EMG), (3) visiting appropriate laboratories in Europe
to develop collaborative research, and (4) being an active member of the
Intergroup Relations Laboratory at USC.
