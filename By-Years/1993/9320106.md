Many decision tasks induce stress, either because of cognitive demands or
because of emotional factors. To what extent are people able to compensate for
cognitive and emotional stressors by adapting their decision processes? The
research will focus on how information processing strategies are adapted to
variations in time pressure and emotional stress. The proposed research uses an
integrated methodology involving computer simulation and experiments utilizing
process-tracing methods to investigate decision making under stress at a
detailed information-processing level. Computer simulation will be used to
estimate the performance of various decision strategies under stressful
conditions; then several experiments will examine whether individuals adapt to
stress by changing processing in ways consistent with the simulation results.
The studies focus on a new opportunity-cost manipulation of time pressure and
two new manipulations of emotional stress, one altering the salience and
vividness of the consequences of actions and one altering the difficulty of the
tradeoffs involved in the choice task. ! ! F ^ ^ ( Times New Roman Symbol &amp;
