Dr. James Neff (College of Charleston, South Carolina) and Dr. Douglas O'Neal
(Keystone College, Pennsylvania) will lead an effort to understand the physical
conditions in starspots. Analogous to spots on the Sun, starspots are regions in
the atmospheres of other stars that are cooler than the rest of the stellar
surface. The goals of this project are to use recent advances in atmospheric
modeling codes to determine starspot properties, re-analyze extensive databases
of existing spectra using the new techniques, expand observational surveys to
include cooler stars, and combine various techniques to yield a better
understanding of the observational signatures of starspots.

Magnetic activity on the Sun is perhaps the most dramatic way in which astronomy
impacts our daily lives. By measuring the properties and distribution of
starspots on a wide range of active stars, it might be possible to uncover the
fundamental nature of the solar dynamo. Photometric light curve modeling,
Doppler imaging, and the spectroscopic properties of molecular bands (which are
formed only in starspots, not in the warmer unspotted atmosphere) all yield
important information about the distribution, temperature, and fractional
coverage of starspots.
