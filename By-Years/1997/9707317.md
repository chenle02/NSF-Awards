This research is on automating the extraction of behavioral models from natural
language descriptions of digital systems such as specifications, proposals and
U.S. patents. The behavioral models are necessary for simulation in new system
design and test generation on legacy system replacement. Often, only the natural
language descriptions are available. An information extraction approach is being
taken to develop an interactive system to help the modeler. The system will scan
source documents, perform syntactic and semantic analysis to identify behavioral
elements (actions, states, events) and their relationships, and instantiate
conceptual templates from which augmented control dataflow graph models may be
generated. A central research issue is the correct selection and filling of
behavioral templates. Performance of the system is being evaluated on how much
of the behavioral information is discovered automatically and how accurately the
information is inserted into the templates.
