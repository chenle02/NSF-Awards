Intellectual Merit This project will aid in the understanding of advanced
computing architectures, characterize the interplay between scientific
applications and the hardware, and result in the development of formal methods,
tools and techniques for implementing applications on advanced architectures.

Broader Impact The project will enable scientists to effectively use new
computing technologies to increase their ability to carry out their own
computational science; foster research, education, training, and industrial
collaboration on next-generation cyber-resource architectures; educate the
scientific applications community, researchers, and students on the use of next-
generation architectures; and assist the computational science community to
implement applications that enable new science by employing next-generation
cyber-resources.
