This project will use data from the THEMIS spacecraft and the GLD360 global
lightning detection network to determine the extent to which plasmaspheric hiss
is generated by lightning. In addition, observations from the DEMETER satellite
will be used to determine to what extent the plasmaspheric hiss resembles
magnetospheric chorus emissions. This data will be used to examine the
hypothesis that chorus is a major source of plasmaspheric hiss. The project will
also use a 10-year data set of gournd-based chorus from Palmer Station,
Antarctica to examine the role of magnetospheric chorus waves on the phase-space
density of energentic electrons in Earth's radiation belts.

The research is related to the Geospace Environment Modeling program focus group
on the radiation belts and magnetospheric waves. It has societal benefits
because of the importance of understanding the radiation belts where high energy
particles can damage spacecraft. The project also has education and training
benefits because it funds a postdoctoral scholar.
