The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) program
is very much concerned with both the development of modern optical instruments
and detectors and the quality and analysis of the atmospheric data that they
produce. This project will employ a commercially available spectrometer to
monitor the near ultraviolet wavelength region ( 3000 - 5000 A) to augment the
instruments already available for optical spectroscopic studies at the
Sondrestrom Fjord, Greenland Observatory. This complement of instruments will
permit the study of emissions from the airglow and aurora covering the
wavelength region 3000A to 1.7 microns. These studies will lead to new insight
on excitation mechanisms, variations in atmospheric constituents, dynamics and
coupling between various regions of the atmosphere.
