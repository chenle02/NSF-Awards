Title: Secure Peer-to-Peer Overlay Networks

PIs: Baruch Awerbuch and Christian Scheideler, Johns Hopkins University

ABSTRACT

Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have recently become extremely popular for a variety
of reasons. For example, the fact that peer-to-peer systems do not need a
central server means that individuals can cooperate without fees or an
investment in additional high-performance hardware. Also, peer-to-peer systems
enable the use of computations and storage resources that otherwise sit idle on
individual computers. Furthermore, the decentralized and distributed nature of
peer-to-peer systems makes them robust against accidental faults.

Unfortunately, the architecture of many current and proposed P2P systems assumes
that the nodes can be trusted not to behave maliciously. While this may be
possible to achieve with the help of a central certification authority, in many
situations it is not desirable to constrain the membership of a P2P system.
Consequently, the system must be able to withstand a variety of security
attacks. Many of the existing systems are quite vulnerable security against very
mild attacks that we call unlucky-input attacks. There is no need to do anything
malicious to execute a major denial of service. Even if all processors follow
the protocol to the letter, it is possible for the system to run into a
situation with extremely poor connectivity (and therefore performance) or a
memory overflow at some sites. Furthermore, if users leave the network at
inopportune times, they may permanently remove data or disconnect some sites.
Although these bad luck events may rarely happen, an adversary can significantly
reduce the time required for such events without doing anything illegal such as
altering the protocol or sniffing at communication between other peers. These
anomalies exploit "minor theoretical glitches" in the existing approaches, and
but they could serve as a platform for major DOS attacks.

The goal of this work is to develop a sound theoretical foundation for peer-to-
peer systems that will allow fixing these problems in existing systems.
