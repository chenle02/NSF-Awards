FOCUS is a new Physics Frontiers Center devoted to Frontiers in
Optical&lt;br/&gt;Coherent and Ultrafast Science. The FOCUS mission is to
provide national leadership in the areas of coherent control, ultrafast, and
high field physics. The work of FOCUS will include three frontier "Major
Research Components" in High Field Control; Ultrafast Control; and Quantum
Control. FOCUS will extend the frontiers of its discipline: the production,
control and utilization of light pulses shorter than one thousandth of one
trillionth of a second; physics of ultrahigh intensity laser fields, exceeding
ten billion trillion watts per square centimeter; coherent manipulation of
molecular bonds and molecular motion; and the control of quantum mechanics in
ultracold atoms and ions. The coherent field strengths under direct control will
span 18 orders of magnitude, from ultra-relativistic laser-driven plasmas
(TV/cm) to control fields in cooled ion traps (uV/cm). Much of the coherent
control physics developed in one area is applicable
toanother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Science and society depend on these novel and
rapid advances in coherent and ultrafast optical science now as never before.
The coherent and ultrafast optical physics developed by the FOCUS center will be
at the forefront of some of the most ambitious and exciting advances in physics
in the next two decades. Examples extend across the&lt;br/&gt;fields of matter-
wave precision devices, gravitational wave detectors, x-ray free electron
lasers, quantum encryption and computing, coherent control of chemistry, laser-
driven particle acceleration, as well as others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This
award is jointly funded by the Division of Physics and the Office of
Multidiscipliary Activities in the MPS Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;
