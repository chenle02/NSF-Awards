0124271&lt;br/&gt;Wyneken&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Jeanette Wyneken of
Florida Atlantic University and primarily junior researchers from various U.S.
universities to participate participation in an international symposium on
turtle research in Jena, Germany. The goals of the symposium include identifying
important integrative directions in the field, exchanging ideas among experts
with varying perspectives, facilitating contacts between those early in their
careers and experienced researchers, and enhancing the opportunities for
researchers on both sides of the Atlantic to engage in longer-term
collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;
