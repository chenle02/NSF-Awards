The proposal provides support to a group of graduate students from the
University of Notre Dame to organize and conduct a symposium on biocatalysis at
the 249th American Chemical Society National Meeting in Denver, Colorado in the
spring of 2015. Not only will this symposium bring together a group of inter-
disciplinary experts in the emerging field of biocatalysis, but it will also
provide valuable experience to the graduate students in exploring an area of
research beyond their immediate thesis research topic and will serve as a magnet
in attracting students and younger researchers to this field. This activity has
been conducted since 2005 under the guidance of the Graduate Student Symposium
Planning Committee of the American Chemical Society (ACS), typically with base
funding from ACS supplemented by funding from other organizations.
