The Protoclassic period in the Mayan region of Peten, Guatemala has longed
posed problems for Mayan archaeologists because of poor site preservation. While
several archaeologists have hypothesized that the abrupt appearance of the
distinctive ceramic complex that identifies the Protoclassic is the result of
contacts with other Mayan groups living in highland El Salvador, sufficient
evidence is lacking. In order to test this hypothesis, the principal
investigator will excavate the large Mayan ceremonial cave site of Naj Tunich in
Peten, Guatemala. The ceramics for this site are in an excellent state of
preservation within good stratigraphic context. Thus the ceramic data from Naj
Tunich represents a rare opportunity to better define and understand the
Protoclassic era and the development of state societies in Mesoamerica.
