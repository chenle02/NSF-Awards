This conference features lectures by Professor Harold S. Shapiro on the
progress made in the last twenty-five years in the study of the Schwarz function
and its applications to complex analysis, potential theory, and geometry.
Students and young faculty are especially urged to attend, as well as experts on
the Schwarz function. The Schwarz function, introduced in the nineteenth
century, provides a unified approach to various problems in different branches
of applied mathematics, uncovering deep interaction between apparently disjoint
areas.
