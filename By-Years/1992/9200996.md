This is a Phase II project under the Small Business Innovation Research
Program. It addresses an understanding of the factors controlling the
morphology, capacitance, and resistance of ionomer-coated, carbon-supported,
highly dispersed particles of ruthenium oxide. In Phase I, the use of this
system for high-capacitance electrical storage systems was demonstrated. The
present effort aims to increase the energy density by controlling the
dispersions and ionomer coating of the particulates. The goal is a capacitance
of 3 farads per square centimeter. High-energy density electrochemical
capacitors are attractive for many applications including backup power for
electronic memories (they are smaller and have longer lifetimes than
rechargeable batteries.), electric vehicles (in conjunction with batteries;
batteries do better at delivering constant power, but capacitors are much better
at delivering bursts of high power on demand, such as for starting.),
electromechanical actuators (for robotic and space systems), and other high
power short-pulse situations including laser weapons.
