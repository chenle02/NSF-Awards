This research develops a new experimental method using the well known J integral
to characterize the energy involved in crack extension and measure fracture
rersistance parameters in mortar and concrete. The measurement of J is made
using compliance methods which involve measurement of crack opening displacement
at the load line and the crack tip on a compact tension specimen. Early success
on mortar with this experimental method has been demonstrated and the research
extends the application to concrete and short fiber reinforced concrete.
