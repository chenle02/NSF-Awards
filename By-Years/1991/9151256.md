Introduction of UV-VIS Diode Array Spectrophotometry in the Chemistry
Curriculum A UV-VIS diode array spectrophotometer with a temperature controlled
cell compartment, PC, monitor, printer and two software packages will be used in
general chemistry and organic chemistry courses. This will upgrade the quality
and quantity of spectroscopy based experiments in the laboratories. The
instrument will also be extensively used in upper division courses. Theory and
practice of UV-VIS diode array analysis will be introduced in Analytical
Chemistry and more fully developed in Instrumental Methods, Advanced Laboratory
Techniques, Advanced Inorganic, and student research courses. The grantee will
match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
