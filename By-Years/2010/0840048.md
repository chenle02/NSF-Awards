This interdisciplinary project consists of a series of climate model experiments
that explore the impacts of arctic land-surface changes on large-scale features
of climate. The project addresses the two primary categories of known
vegetation-climate feedbacks: impacts on carbon cycling, and impacts on surface
and lower atmosphere energy exchange. Existing work has been largely with simple
conceptual models of impact assessment - this project endeavors to take the next
step by isolating and assessing the remote impact of arctic land-surface change
in a global climate model framework. The research first involves model
development to improve the representation of biological processes in boreal
ecosystems in a coupled climate-dynamic vegetation model system. This is
followed by model simulations to assess the regional and global impacts of
CO2-induced high-latitude warming and subsequent changes in boreal vegetation. A
graduate student will be supported, and applicable results will be incorporated
into the PI's teaching curriculum. Broader impacts may also result from bridging
the Arctic terrestrial and global climate communities, and potential input to
the ongoing international climate change detection and assessment process.
