The University of North Carolina in Charlotte is making the necessary changes in
the calculus curriculum to take advantage of the newer curriculums as they
mature and to better teach the concepts of mathematics with workstations to help
reinforce the numerical and graphical part of mathematics. This project is using
up-to-date computing equipment that will run the software that they have chosen
to use in their mathematics curriculum. The College of Engineering has
implemented a Sun workstation network for all of their students, and this
project allows mathematics students to work with the same materials. They are
running Maple and other visualization programs for many mathematics classes.
This lets the department better serve the engineering, mathematics, and science
students that they teach by offering them the same type of hardware that they
use in their other courses.
