The main goal of this research is to address several main challenges in the
realization of practical phononic crystal (PnC)-based devices for wireless
signal processing at RF frequencies by 1) relaxing the extreme geometry and
fabrication constrains, 2) developing practical PnC devices based on surface
acoustic-waves that eliminate the need for thin film and undercutting, and with
the broad impact of 3) developing efficient low-impedance electro-statically
tunable PnC crystals devices that can potentially eliminate the need for
piezoelectric materials. To achieve these goals we will develop a new PnC
material platform based on an array of pillar structure on a thin slab material
or on an infinite substrate (for surface waves) that also constitute the
intellectual merits of this effort. The proposed material platform will be used
to demonstrate chip-scale spectral analysis at the L band (i.e., 1 -2 GHz)
frequencies.
