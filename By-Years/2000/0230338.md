This award supports a comprehensive study of land-based polar ice cliffs.
Through field measurements, modeling, and remote sensing, the physics underlying
the formation of ice cliffs at the margin of Taylor Glacier in the McMurdo Dry
Valleys will be investigated. At three sites, measurements of ice deformation
and temperature fields near the cliff face will be combined with existing energy
balance data to quantify ice-cliff evolution over one full seasonal cycle. In
addition, a small seismic network will monitor local "ice quakes" associated
with calving events. Numerical modeling, validated by the field data, will
enable determination of the sensitivity of ice cliff evolution to environmental
variables. There are both local and global motivations for studying the ice
cliffs of Taylor Glacier. On a global scale, this work will provide insight into
the fundamental processes of calving and glacier terminus A better grasp of ice
cliff processes will also improve boundary conditions required for predicting
glaciers' response to climate change. Locally, the Taylor Glacier is an
important component of the McMurdo Dry Valleys landscape and the results of this
study will aid in defining ecologically-important sources of glacial meltwater
and will lead to a better understanding of moraine formation at polar ice
cliffs. This study will help launch the career of a female scientist, will
support one graduate student, and provide experiential learning experiences for
two undergraduates. The post-doctoral researcher will also use this research in
the curriculum of a wilderness science experiential education program for high
school girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
