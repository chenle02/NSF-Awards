Understanding the process of evolution by natural selection hinges on
mechanistic understanding of two component processes: 1) differential survival
and/or fecundity of individuals associated with the traits they possess and 2)
the extent to which these traits are inherited. Inheritance is the process by
which an individual receives two copies of each gene as well as the extent to
which the genes affect the expression of a trait. Maternal inheritance is the
special case when the mother via her own genes can directly affect the
expression of a trait in her offspring. This maternal effect is independent of
the genes she passes on to her offspring. This research is novel in that it will
investigate the extent to which juvenile traits are not only determined by the
genes an individual possesses, but also by the genes which its mother possesses.
This phenotypic connection between generation is common in many organisms and
can include parental provisioning and parental care. This non-standard form of
inheritance can alter direction and rate of adaptive evolution. The goal of this
research is to quantify the magnitude of this effect and examine how it might
change the outcome of selection as it is observed in a natural population. At
the most basic level this research will provide an alternative mechanism for the
evolution of juvenile and maternal traits in natural plant populations. Breeders
have developed a variety of breeding programs to enhance their ability to alter
juvenile and maternal traits such as seed weight, emergence date and seed
dispersal in plants and birth weight, gestation length and milk production in
animals. These programs maximize the change in the trait of interest by
selection at the individual, sibling group, or family level depending on the
nature of inheritance. This research is an outgrowth of these applied problems
in plant and animal breeding, but it will also make a contribution to this
applied field by providing a mechanistic understanding of these non-standard
forms of inheritance in plants.
