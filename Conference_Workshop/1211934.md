This award will provide support to defray expenses of participants, especially
junior investigators, women and mathematicians from under-represented groups in
the sciences to attend the conference ``The Central Region Conference on
Numerical Analysis and Dynamical Systems'' from May 3 to May 4, 2013 on the
campus of the University of Kansas. The conference is motivated by the increased
interaction and collaboration between numerical analysis and dynamical systems
in the last decades. Numerical analysis is at the core of scientific computing
and involves the study, development, and analysis of algorithms for obtaining
numerical solutions to various mathematical models of real world problems. It is
often cost effective to employ simulations to narrow down where expensive
experimental procedures should be applied and to provide insight into the
principles behind observed experimental phenomena. Dynamical systems theory is
an area of applied mathematics where the behavior of complex dynamical systems
is studied and qualitative methods are typically employed. Qualitative analysis
has been found to be extremely useful in the development of robust and reliable
numerical algorithms and in justifying numerical results, and numerical
simulation has increasingly become a powerful tool in dynamical systems and has
been used extensively to gain quantitative characterization of complex dynamic
systems, provide necessary motivations, and verify theoretical findings.

The conference will serve several goals. In addition to facilitating greater
interaction between researchers in numerical analysis and dynamical systems, The
Central Region Conference on Numerical Analysis and Dynamical Systems will
provide a forum in which young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows in the Central region of the United States can acquaint themselves with
current issues at the forefront of research, present their own work, and
interact with senior mathematicians in the field. Furthermore, the conference
will provide strong motivation for interdisciplinary collaboration between
numerical analysis and dynamical systems. Finally, the conference will play an
active role in motivating applied mathematics and strengthening applied
mathematics groups at universities in the region.
