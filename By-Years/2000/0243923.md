A ten-week summer program will be conducted for the next three years at the
Montana State University in Bozeman. The program consists of independent
research projects carried out with a faculty mentor, a lecture series on solar
physics, lectures by visiting scholars, an IDL (Interactive Data Language)
primer course, a selection of social activities, and web-publication of final
reports. The program will accept six participants each summer, targeting
undergraduates based in physics, mathematics and computer science, and it
specifically encourages the participation of women and minorities. This effort
will run in parallel with a similar NSF REU program in solid state physics, and
the American Indian Research Opportunities (AIRO) program for Native American
high school students and teachers. Since solar physics is being taught at
relatively few colleges and universities, this program, with its strong Space
Weather component, has the double benefit to society of adding to our
understanding of the subject while training potential future researchers.
