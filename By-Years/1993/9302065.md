9302065 Reich A series of experiments are proposed to explore the ground state
properties and excitations of low-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials that
exhibit novel cooperative quantum effects. A zero- temperature phase transition
will be explored by varying the parameters in the Hamiltonian of spin-1 chain
through the application of pressure. A field-induced incommensurate soft mode in
the spin-1/2 chain will be studied in detail. The properties of quantum systems
with competing interactions will be examined through experiments on one-
dimensional chains with next-nearest neighbor infractions and two-dimensional
systems with geometrical frustration. The research will involve crystal growth
and characterization, low-temperature thermodynamic measurements, and detailed
studies of dynamical properties via inelastic neutron scattering. %%% This
research involves the growth and characterization of materials which have
magnetic properties largely constrained to occur along one- or two-dimensions.
The magnetic properties become pronounced at low temperatures, and are also
influenced by application of hydrostatic pressure. The research will provide
fundamental information relevant to magnetism, and to the field of high-Tc
superconducting materials. The materials will be investigated using magnetic
measurements and by the technique of neutron scattering which reflects dynamical
aspects of the atomic magnets in the various materials. ***
