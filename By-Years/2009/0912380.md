This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to investigate an
innovative structure for improving the efficiency of amorphous silicon based
solar cells. Amorphous silicon has a short minority carrier diffusion length and
the innovative structure reduces the distance necessary to collect
photogenerated electrons.

Increasing the efficiency of solar cells can significantly reduce the cost per
unit energy output. Amorphous silicon solar cells also use less silicon than do
crystalline based cells. Reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of
solar cells will positively impact the adoption rate of photovoltaic power
systems.
