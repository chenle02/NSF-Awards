This award provides funds to test the use of scanning electron microscopy for
detection of minute quantities of the types of macromolecules (DNA, RNA,
protein) found in all living organisms. The proposed test will use basic
blotting techniques that involve adsorption of the macromolecule to a
nitrocellulose or nylon membrane which is then exposed to antibodies or other,
highly specific detector macromolecules that are themselves labelled with gold
particles. Even a single particle of gold is readily visualized in the
microscope. In principle, the successful development of the proposed technique
would permit detection of a small number, possibly as few as one or two,
molecules of the target macromolecule in a single cell. The use of general, but
highly specific, readily quantitated assays for particular proteins, RNAs and
DNAs has been crucial to the astounding progress of molecular biology in the
last two decades. As now applied, most of these assays are applied to material
extracted from large numbers of cells either grown in culture or present in a
tissue, organ or even an entire organism. As yet, only a few, highly specialized
tests are able to detect the minute quantities of such molecules present in
single cells. The extension of more general techniques to permit analysis of low
levels of unique molecules in single cells appears crucial to progress in
understanding the control of development of well- differentiated multicellular
organisms. Although not without risk, the approach to be undertaken has the
potential of providing such an extension.
