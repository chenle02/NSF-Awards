9734343 Naeem This proposal outlines an integrated program of research,
teaching, and training designed to promote cross-cutting and multidisciplinary
approaches in basic biology and ecology. The research component fills an
important gap in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning studies. The proposed work
is a long-term, multi-trophic level investigation of the interaction between
variation in trophic structure and plant diversity, and its impacts on
fundamental ecosystem processes among plants, animals and microbes. The study
system is the Cedar Creek Natural History Area LTER site. The educational
component breaks traditional disciplinary boundaries by focusing on interfaces
between biota and biogeochemistry, rather than the cell to ecosystem hierarchy.
Training of students will occur by involving undergraduates in hands-on research
opportunities. For students with some biological background and research
experience, further training will include hypothesis testing, statistical
approaches, ethics, and peer review. Collectively, this project will provide a
foundation for a long-term academic career devoted to the development of
pluralistic and synthetic approaches in ecological research and education.
