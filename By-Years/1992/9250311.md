Molecular science is a unifying concept for biology, chemistry, and
physiological psychology. A molecular science laboratory for computer assisted
three-dimensional imaging of molecular structure and dynamics to support
lecture, laboratory, and independent study instruction is being established. Two
dimensional images, whether they be on the printed page or the blackboard, limit
the student to a passive form of learning that obscures the dynamic nature of
the subject; students learn to think of molecules as rigid structures with at
most a few conformations, rather than systems which continually change according
to the conditions of their environments. Making use of the laboratory and three-
dimensional computer-aided visualization students develop a better understanding
of structures and phenomena at the molecular level.
