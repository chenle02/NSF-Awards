Professor Kleppner and his group will pursue three major goals: (1) to
interpret the laser spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms in magnetic fields in terms of
classical chaos and to trace the relationship between the classical and quantal
description of the electron motion, (2) determine the ground-state Lamb shift by
making the world's most precise measurement of the Rydberg constant, using
millimeter wave spectroscopy, (3) perform a precision measurement of the 1S-2S
transition in hydrogen where the width of the line due to kinetic motion of the
atoms has been vastly reduced by evaporatively cooling the sample.
