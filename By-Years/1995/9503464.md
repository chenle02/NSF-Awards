9503464 Whitworth In this project, the PIs will measure near-bottom velocities
across the Argentine continental slope near 42 deg S. during 1996 and 1997. Nine
moorings at nine different depths, ranging from 200m to 5200m will be deployed,
using a newly-developed expendable vector-averaging current meter, with
temperature and pressure sensors at a height of 50m from the bottom on each
mooring. Data will be retrieved by an ARGOS transmitter released after one
year's deployment. A second set of instruments will be deployed after the first
year. Ship support will be provided by Dr. A. Piola and the Argentine Naval
Hydrographic Service, and hydrographic surveys will be conducted during each
deployment cruise. This is a collaborative study, and in this award the PI will
provide a small amount of scientific support during the logistics planning in
year 1, and will collaborate in the scientific oversight and analysis during
years 2 and 3.
