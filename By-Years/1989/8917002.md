Detailed analysis of tidal and residual flow around headlands will be continued
on closely-spaced data obtained with an acoustic Doppler current profiler near
Gay Head, Martha,s Vineyard. These data will be combined with a model to
investigate the complex frictional and advective effects generated at a headland
in a shallow water regime.
