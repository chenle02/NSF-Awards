Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: International Workshop
on the Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0122676&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Andra Michl&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
Electric Power Research Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop, jointly
sponsored with EPRI, will be held at the NSF on May 3 - 4. Eleven speakers will
be invited to lead the discussion on topics that will include new methods for
enhancing the activity and selectivity of catalytic processes. In particular,
enhancements due to the passage of small electric currents passed through
catalysts deposited on ionically conducting supports will be discussed. This
discovery is called the non-faradaic electrochemical modification of catalytic
activity (NEMCA). This phenomenon has been observed empirically to promote
industrially important reactions such as oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide
on supported silver catalysts, oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons on Pt, Pd, and
Rh, and the isomerization of butene on Pd. The objectives of this workshop will
be to address the fundamental issues regarding the basis for the phenomenon and
to target specific systems of particular industrial interest, which might
include ammonia synthesis, SO2 oxidation, and NOx reduction. A workshop report
detailing the recommendations will be issued in August.&lt;br/&gt;
