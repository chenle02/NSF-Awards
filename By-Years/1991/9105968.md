The primary aim of this research is to investigate how the RNA degrading
machinery of a model plant is controlled. Specifically, the compartmentalization
of ribonucleases (RNase in Arabidopsis, and the temporal and spacial constrains
on RNase activity will be studied. Our initial experiments have identified 15
RNase activities from Arabidopsis using a substrate-based gel assay. We plan to
investigate the compartmentalization of these enzymes by gradient fractionation
and organellar purification. RNases associated with vacuoles, nuclei,
chloroplasts, and polysomes will be identified. For one or more selected RNases,
protein purification will be performed and antiserum will be raised and used for
further analyses. Preliminary studies indicate that some RNases accumulate
differentially in Arabidopsis. THerefore, the RNase profiles in different organs
will be compared at different stages of development, and under different
environmental conditions. Beyond it contribution to basic knowledge, this
research should enhance the potential use of Arabidopsis as a genetic model to
study the functions of individual RNases in the future.//
