This planning grant to Louisiana State University (LSU) aims to reform the
Chemical Engineering Curriculum by adding Manufacturing/Process Dynamics/Process
Control Emphasis to the undergraduate curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LSU
intends to revamp the curriculum to emphasize problem-based learning using
industrial process simulation, control and optimization packages. Some of these
will be based on seven new pilot-plant facilities, and some will be based on two
LSU cogeneration facilities (one existing, one now under construction), which
are located adjacent to Chemical Engineering. The new type of lab experience
will pair senior-level students with more inexperienced students in open-ended
assignments based on process simulation, dynamics and control. The seniors can
help introduce the newcomers to the software packages; the newcomers will have
to implement new operating strategies or control systems developed by the
seniors. There will be benefits to both groups: training in communication and
networking for the seniors, and a better grasp of the software for the novice
students prior to entering the classes where they must program using the
software.&lt;br/&gt;
