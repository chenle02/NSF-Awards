This interdisciplinary Chemistry of Life Processes (COLP) project draws upon
both synthetic organic chemistry and biophysics to investigate the mechanism of
transmembrane proton transport. In a synergistic collaborative effort, David S.
Cafiso and Glenn J. Garvey of the Chemistry Department and Mark S. Braiman of
the Biochemistry Department of the University of Virginia will synthesize well-
defined molecular arrays of both hydrocarbon- and peptide-based materials,
characterize them, and incorporate them into model biomembranes to determine the
role of hydrogen-bonded networks on transmembrane proton conduction. This
research draws upon demanding synthetic chemistry, careful structural biology
and chemistry, and state-of-the-art spectroscopy to address a question of
fundamental importance in biological membrane science. This activity affords a
strong interdisciplinary learning environment for graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows. The results of this collaborative effort could impact
broadly in both the chemical and biological sciences.
