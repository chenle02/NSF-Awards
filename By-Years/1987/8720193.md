This research will investigate the feeding rates, trophic relationships, and
impact of the benthic boundary layer (BBL) zooplankton in deep-sea near-bottom
communities. In the collaborative investigations, Drs. Gowing and Wishner will
obtain indicators of zooplankton activity in the deep sea and estimate of their
impact as particle modifiers and energy consumers. The new methods for measuring
in situ zooplankton ingestion rates, with the use of fluorescent particles as
unambiguous tracers of ingestion, will allow documentation of gut passage time
and the ability of these zooplankters to respond to the presence of food.
Examination of the gut contents of the zooplankton, along with similar analyses
of water column particulates, will enable them to determine specific trophic
pathways in the deep-sea BBL. Electron microscopy will make it possible to
resolve material often labeled amorphous, determine the ultrastructural
condition (living or detrital) of the gut contents, and recognize organisms such
as metal-precipitating bacteria. Since zooplankton ingest particulate material
and repackage it as fecal pellets, they alter the size, density, and composition
of the near-bottom particulates, and thus may affect benthic and pelagic
communitydynamics and BBL chemical and particulate fluxes.
