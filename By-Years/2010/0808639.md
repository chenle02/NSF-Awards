The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications is convening a workshop with
expert participants to develop a consensus on the best methods for selecting the
most important outcomes of NSF?s funding of mathematics and science education
projects over the last few decades and for assessing the impacts of these
outcomes. Specifically, the workshop addresses the following issues.&lt;br/&gt;
How to select the specific NSF programs to be assessed.&lt;br/&gt; How to select
the persons to be interviewed.&lt;br/&gt; Which methodologies will be used to
assess program impact.&lt;br/&gt; How data will be gathered, organized,
reported, and disseminated.&lt;br/&gt; How such data can be acquired by NSF
going forward.
