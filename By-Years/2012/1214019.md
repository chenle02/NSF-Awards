TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

With this award the National Science Foundation is funding studies at the
University of Nebraska, under the direction of Professor Stephen G. DiMagno
(substitute PI for Professor David Berkowitz), to develop new enzyme-based
methods for catalyst screening. This approach involves the use of enzymatic
reporting enzymes operating in tandem with the organic/organometallic catalysts
being screened, with the former in an aqueous reporting layer, and the latter in
an organic solvent layer within the same vessel. This arrangement permits for
the assessment of key variables including relative reaction rate and
enantioselectivity, in real time, and is thus termed "In Situ Enzymatic
Screening" (ISES). Particular focus here is on the identification of new
screening enzymes/conditions that will permit the experimentalist to examine new
leaving groups and new transformations and to move from ambient to elevated
temperatures. Transformations being targeted include those of particular
interest to bioorganic and medicinal chemists, such as catalytic routes to
enantio-enriched, quaternary, alpha-vinyl amino acids as potential mechanism-
based enzyme inhibitors.

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

This research project is inherently interdisciplinary, at the interface between
organic chemistry and biology, as Nature's catalysts are exploited to assist
with the development of useful human-made catalysts for chemical synthesis.
Scientists working on the project will gain hands-on experience with both
frontline asymmetric catalyst development and with modern preparative
enzymology. The research is expected to have broader scientific impact on the
areas of organic synthesis, green chemistry, biocatalysis, and process
chemistry. The PI will continue to provide cross-disciplinary training to
postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students, and the group will continue to
reach out to high school students through Chemistry Day.
