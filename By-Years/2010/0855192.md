The objective of this project is to build a state-of-the-art Human Motion
Acquisition Facility capable of capturing human motion data using an array of
synchronized multiple sensors. It includes hardware and software necessary to
capture simultaneously multi-modal aspects of human performance including human
movement, ground reaction forces, video data, muscle activation patterns, heart
rate, temperature, eye movement, etc. Importantly, all the data is synchronized
with each other.

The facility enables researchers to explore new frontiers in human motion
synthesis. In particular, the captured data is used to study novel compact
representations of human motions and to develop new algorithms to efficiently
synthesize detailed realistic motions of a single character and crowds. The data
is also used to build, animate and populate virtual worlds. The facility also
greatly benefits existing computer graphics degree programs at UPenn (Ph.D,
Masters, Undergraduate, and summer high school students). The use of the
facility is an integral part of the curriculum in these programs.

Currently, there are no extensive, publicly available, high quality databases of
human motion data synchronized with data from other sensors. All the data we
obtain in this project will be made publicly available. The facility will
therefore enable new research ranging from human motion synthesis in computer
animation to medical studies of people with disabilities to researching novel
simulators. As a result, it will foster inter-disciplinary research. The
facility will also make computer graphics programs at UPenn even more exciting
and will help in attracting more women to computer science.
