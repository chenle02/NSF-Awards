The goal of this project is to integrate the study of ethics into the existing
undergraduate life science curriculum at Purdue University. The strategy is to
teach basic moral concepts and principles to life science faculty members,
equipping them to lead discussions of moral issues in their classrooms and labs.
The outcome will be coherent life science classes and labs revitalized by the
study of ethics. The training will occur primarily during a series of summer
Bioethics Institutes. Graduates of each institute will be required to attend a
series of reunion meetings during the next three years. The last reunion meeting
of the 1998 cohort, therefore, will occur in 2001. The goals of the project are
to integrate philosophy, ethics, and comparative religion into courses in
biology, biochemistry, agriculture, and veterinary science; to improve the
quality of undergraduate education in a broad range of life sciences by helping
undergraduate students to achieve a broader understanding of themselves and the
world; to assist faculty in explaining to students the underlying assumptions
and values of research in the life sciences; to enrich and promote coherence in
fields traditionally devoted to narrow specialization; and finally, to provide a
template to be utilized by other universities and colleges.
