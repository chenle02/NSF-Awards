Groups are fundamental mathematical objects that encode symmetries; for
instance, those of a crystalline material. They arise in many fields including
geometry, arithmetic, and even mathematical physics. They provide a bridge
between algebraic and geometric properties of a mathematical object. The
principal investigator will study problems that traverse this bridge in both
directions, applying algebra to uncover geometric properties of low-dimensional
spaces and using geometry to shed light on problems that appear to be strictly
algebraic. An important theme is the concept of cohomology, which roughly
speaking measures high-dimensional holes that exist in both geometric and
algebraic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will study
the topology of arithmetic groups, the mapping class group, and the automorphism
groups of free groups. The planned research has two parts. In the first, the
investigator will study duality properties of these groups, which will be used
to perform a series of cohomological calculations. In the second part, the
investigator will study the topology and geometry of the Torelli group. Foci of
these projects include finiteness properties of the Torelli group, the theory of
representation stability, and relationships with invariants of homology
3-spheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
