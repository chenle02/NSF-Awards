9320478 Miller This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing
Program in the support of the research of Professor Joel Miller. Support is
provided by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research. The focus of the
research is the development of structure-property relationships for a family of
magnetic polymeric manganese porphyrin/tetracyanoethylene complexes. Emphasis
will be on porphyrin ligand substitution including the design and synthesis of
macrocyclic ligands with unpaired spins on their periphiry. Magnetic materials
with other macrocyclic ligands such as phthalocyanines, tetraazaporphyrins and
dibenzotetraaza- 14 annulenes will also be prepared. In concert with new
ligands, complexes with other metals having unpaired spins such as
vanadium(III), chromium(III) and iron(III) will also be prepared and
characterized for their magnetic properties. Professor Miller will complement
his synthetic studies with computational studies and advanced characterization
techniques. Magnets are ubiquitous in technology. This research program will
offer the possibility of engineering desired properties such as processibility,
transparency, compatibility with other polymers, solubility and control of
magnetic properties into polymeric molecular magnets.
