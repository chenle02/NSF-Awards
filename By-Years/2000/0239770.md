This project will organize and host a Workshop for all Principal Investigators
on NSF-supported network research and infrastructure projects. The ultimate goal
of the Workshop is to foster a sense of community and collaboration among NSF-
supported network research and infrastructure development Principal
Investigators (PI-participants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will be held
in Washington D.C. during the fourth quarter of 2002 and will feature three main
components: plenary session presentations on current issues and topics in
network research, discussion groups on these same topics and poster session
presentations. The PI will develop and maintain a Workshop website to provide
attendees with up-to-date information about the Workshop and to also serve as
the final presentation archive for all talks and papers presented at the
Workshop. This PI will also be responsible for handling all aspects of setting
up the workshop, communicating with the PI-participants, and reimbursing the PI-
participants.&lt;br/&gt;
