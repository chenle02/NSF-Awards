This action funds Clint Duncan Frye of Kansas State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Developing materials to convert directly heat into
electricity," during the summer of 2012 at the National Institute for Materials
Science in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. The host scientist is Takao Mori.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the investigation of the
thermoelectric properties of various boron compounds. Materials prepared at
Kansas State University will be characterized at the National Institute of
Materials Science to assess their potential to convert heat into electricity and
produce cutting-edge knowledge about the synthesis of new compounds and
crystals.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
