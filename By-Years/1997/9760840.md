*** 9760840 Leaskey This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will explore self-lubricating ceramics. Silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic
composites, containing two different lubricating phases, will be evaluated for
current as well as potential new applications. An innovative processing
technique will be examined for: (1) low cost processing; (2) attaining high
densities without pressure-assisted sintering; (3) near-net-shape fabrication of
parts to accurate dimensions; and (4) flexibility to tailor composition to
specific applications. Two different SiC-based systems with potentially self-
lubricating properties will be investigated. Characterization of composites will
include evaluation of microstructure and measurement of strength and
tribological properties. Friction and wear screening will be performed by a
major equipment manufacturer. Phase II would pursue comprehensive testing of
prototype diesel engine components in a single cylinder research engine.
Potential applications include high-temperature wear parts, such as machine tool
components, bearings, chemical processing equipment including mechanical seals,
and valve guides and seats. ***
