The 2016 JSM Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program will take place during the
Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM), July 31 - Aug 3, in Chicago, Illinois. It will
consist of a series of interactive career development sessions and small group
and 1-1 mentoring sessions. The goals are to establish critical mentoring and
networking relationships for minority statisticians at early- to mid-career
levels, to motivate students to pursue careers and graduate study in the
statistical sciences, to share best practices for recruiting and retention of
minority students, faculties, and non-academic professionals, and to increase
the active participation of minorities in the American Statistical Association
and other professional statistics societies or
organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the workshop and mentoring
program include underrepresented minority graduate students in statistics or
biostatistics programs; top minority undergraduates in statistics, mathematics,
or related disciplines; minority statisticians in academia, government, and the
private sector; key faculty from minority-serving institutions who advise and
mentor undergraduates in math and related disciplines; and faculty influential
in the faculty and/or student recruitment processes at their home institutions.
This program is unique in that it does not limit its focus to students, but also
includes early career professionals in its scope. It is further unique in its
holistic approach which allows individuals to mentor more junior colleagues
while themselves being mentored by more senior colleagues. These elements help
create a community of support and accountability for the career success of all
involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop's website is located at:
