The NSF and other Federal agencies will require further understanding of
concepts, methods, and means for Exascale computing systems before formulation
of future programs in enabling technologies, architectures, and methodologies.
NSF supports a targeted two-year program of investigation, The Exascale Point-
design Study, to provide sufficient depth and detail of understanding of the
interrelationships among possible enabling technologies, implementation
architectures and operating system software, and programming interfaces and
methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working in consultation with LSU, USC, UIUC,
UD, and Sandia National Laboratory (under DOE sponsorship), UT-Austin team
focuses on energy efficiency as a key driver for Exascale systems. The PIs plan
to investigate processor, memory system, and interconnect architectures that
enable the exploitation of temporal and spatial locality, even when traditional
memory hierarchies perform poorly. They plan to further investigate the use of
hardware specialization as a means to accelerate critical components of
applications in an energy-efficient fashion. UT-Austin plans to devise an
Exascale architecture derived from prior research conducted under NSF, DOE, and
DARPA sponsorship, reflecting some of the best-known principles and practices
envisioned for hardware and software at the Exaflops scale.&lt;br/&gt;
