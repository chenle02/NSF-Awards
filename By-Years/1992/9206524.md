Many areas of large-scale crustal extension, such as the Basin and Range
province of western USA, have exposed inactive detachment fault surfaces with
very shallow dips (&lt;10o). However, fault-plane analysis of present-day
earthquakes worldwide shows that faults with such shallow dips are not usually
seismically active. Thus much controversy has arisen over the original angle of
dip of these faults at their initiation. This project will test the hypotheses
that (1) the faults initiated at dips of 10o or less and remained in t hat
orientation, and (2) they initiated at dips of 30o to 60o and were subsequently
tilted. Paleomagnetic analysis of selected rock units from the footwall of one
such detachment fault in South Mountains, Arizona, will provide the test. The
results will have substantial significance for the tectonic evolution of large
areas of extended continental crust.
