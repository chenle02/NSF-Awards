With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship Program, the University of Texas at Austin will continue to prepare
secondary science and mathematics teachers through the project, UTeach Noyce
scholarships and Stipends: Making Teachers. This Phase 2 project will support 24
juniors/seniors/post-baccalaureate students who are majoring in mathematics,
computer science, or a science discipline (or who have completed such a major)
and preparing to teach secondary mathematics or science in a high-need district.
Each Noyce Scholar will receive up to 2 years of scholarship support. New in
this Phase 2 project will be an emphasis on Maker Movement features, including
having students make things they might ordinarily buy, such as electronic
circuits built from components or utensils created by a 3-d
printer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using systematic observations, surveys, and test
scores, the project will address research questions such as: (1) How well do the
qualifications used to select Noyce Scholars correlate with their teaching
practices in their first two years? (2) Which student attributes and
dispositions on entering a UTeach program are most predictive of deciding to
teach? (3a) Does introduction of a Maker Education strand into teacher
preparation coursework influence engagement and retention of teacher preparation
candidates? (3b) Does introduction of a Maker Education strand into teacher
preparation coursework lead to measurable changes in teaching practices in early
years of teaching? (4) How do learning gains of high school students in Algebra
and Biology whose teachers have three years of experience or less depend on the
teacher's preparation route?
