Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;The Rural Information Technology Education
(RITE) project at Montana State &lt;br/&gt;University-Great Falls College of
Technology (GFCOT), a two-year postsecondary technical college, is designed to
increase Montanan's pool of qualified information technology (IT) workers by
achieving the following program goals: (1) provision of a 2+2+2 seamless
academic pathway to IT employment; (2) secondary and postsecondary faculty
development focusing on the integration of educational technology into curricula
and instruction; and (3) improving IT student recruitment, retention, and job
placement with a special focus on attracting women, Native Americans, and place-
bound rural Montanans into IT careers. GFCOT builds upon its existing
relationships with the Central Montana Tech Prep Consortium, Montana State
University (Bozeman and Northern), and other Montana postsecondary institutions
to create a 2+2+2 seamless IT pathway for students beginning their junior year
in high school, continuing through an associate degree at a two-year college and
ending with a Bachelor of Science degree at a four-year college or university.
Faculty development activities include a series of workshops, summer institutes,
ongoing peer mentoring, and an online course teaching faculty how to employ
educational technologies effectively. Recruitment activities include development
of an information media package promoting IT programs at Montana's two-year
colleges; increasing the number of high school students enrolling in Tech Prep,
Cisco, and dual-credit IT courses; visits to high schools, reservation schools,
and tribal colleges; workshops for IT teachers and counselors to address
female/American Indian barriers to IT education; and provision of an online IT
degree program. Retention activities include development of an IT scholarship
program, implementation of a face-to-face/online mentoring program for female IT
students, internships with Montana businesses, and development of a new
retention program targeting IT students. &lt;br/&gt;
