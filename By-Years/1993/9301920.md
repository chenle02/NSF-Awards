The phase II Research Project will encompass a series of imagine tests at 248nm
with the catadioptric lens, using thin coatings of deep-UV resists to obtain
maximum resolution. We will then fabricate a 193nm version of the lens and test
it with the same criteria used at 248nm. In parallel with this task we will
fabricate a step-and-repeat imagine platform and integrate a 3- motion (x,y,z)
state system, viewing optics, CRT monitor, lens and delivery optics. Prior to
running tests with the imagine platform, we will test two different homogenizer
designs, selecting the best one for final tests. We will also run an optics
damage threshold test on the critical optical surfaces to determine the maximum
energy we can deliver through the system to the wafer substrates. Finally, the
integration of the delivery optics with the selected homogenizer will take
place, completing the imaging platform; we will mount the operator viewing
optics above the x, y, and z stages, connect a CRT monitor and run a series of
193nm maximum resolution and maximum energy tests. The most advanced deep-UV
resists will be used for samples, and data taken on field resolution, field
uniformity, and energy transmission efficiency of the complete optical train.
Data will be generated on both the lithographic properties of the entire system,
as well as the capabilities for photoablation reactions. This data will identify
the potential of the technology for commercial applications. ***
