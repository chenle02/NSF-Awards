This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Clemson University purchase an automated single-
crystal diffractometer. The instrument will enhance research programs which are
pursuing the development of new inorganic materials, such as multifunctional
fluorinated ionomers and their lamellar and zeolite-like metal derivatives,
soluble zintl anions, mixed valence metallopolymers, and liquid clathrates and
host molecules for inclusion compounds. %%% Single crystal x-ray crystallography
is the most powerful analytical method for structures determination of solids.
In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic chemistry,
single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool to characterize molecular
structure. The information gained from the knowledge of the molecular
composition and structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general
interest in catalysis or synthesis.
