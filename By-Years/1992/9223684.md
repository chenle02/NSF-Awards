9223684 First The objective of this project is to understand the evolution of
magnetism, from adatoms to clusters to thin films. Emphasis is placed on
clusters and adatoms. Of interest is the minimum size required for cooperative
magnetic properties. Also of interst are interparticle magnetic interactions.
The result will be relevant to development of magnetic cluster media, magnetic
thin-film technology, and theories of low-dimensional magnetism. Scanning
tunneling microscopy and spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy will be
used in the investigations. %%% This project will study magnetic interactions
between magnetic atoms on surfaces. Groups of atoms will be built up to form
clusters, and the variation of the magnetic properties of the cluster with size
will be studied with atomically sensitive microscopies. The results will be
relevant to the development of new magnetic media for thin film recording and
general information technology. ***
