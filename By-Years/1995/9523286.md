In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Patrick Vaccaro of Yale University will perform a series of
experiments which combine the methods of Degenerate -Four-Wave-Mixing and
Stimulated-Emission-Pumping. The chemistry of isomerization will be studied on
disulfur monoxide and isocyanogen. A state-specific study of the proton transfer
in malonaldehyde will also be carried out. Emphasis will be placed upon the
identification and characterization of any vibrational mode selectivity that
accompanies intramolecular rearrangement of chemical bonds. This research is in
the broad area of molecular structure and dynamics. Its purpose is to explore
the underlying impetus for chemical transformations. Information obtained from
these experiments on vibrationally excited polyatomic species will provide
insight into unimolecular processes which play a critical role in chemistry,
including isomerization and hydrogen migration.
