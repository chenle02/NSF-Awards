The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Science Research Institute (SUMSRI) is a
program conducted under the guidance of Miami University's Department of
Mathematics and Statistics. We seek talented undergraduate students in the
mathematical sciences who are interested in pursuing advanced degrees. Because
of the shortage of minorities and women mathematical scientists, we are
especially interested in, but not limited to, African Americans and other
underrepresented minorities and women.

The main goals of SUMSRI are:

-Address the shortage of minority mathematical scientists by encouraging
minority students and women to become mathematical research scientists.

-Provide the students with a research environment and improve their research
abilities.

-Improve the students' ability to work in groups and give them a long term
support group.

-Provide professional role models.

-Improve the students' technical writing skills.

-Give the participants an opportunity to write a technical research paper and
present a talk at a mathematics conference.

-Inform the participants of available financial aid and opportunities for
graduate school.

-Make the students aware of career opportunities in the mathematical sciences.

-Prepare the students for the GRE.

To accomplish these goals, SUMSRI will run from June 2 to July 19, 2002, on
Miami University's campus in Oxford, Ohio. During these seven weeks, students
will participate in problem seminars in mathematics, statistics, or computer
science. The program will also include a technical writing seminar, a GRE
preparation workshop, two short courses on algebra and real analysis, and
colloquium talks given by well known mathematical scientists.

There will also be panel discussions to present information on graduate school
and career opportunities in the mathematical sciences. SUMSRI will pay for the
students travel, room, board, and supplies. Each student will also be given a
$2,500 stipend. Funds may also be available for travel and support to some
selected national meetings.

The ideal candidate will have completed the calculus series and at least one
proof-based mathematics or statistics course with distinction. The candidate
should be entering their junior or senior year after attending SUMSRI. All
candidates must be returning to their home institutions as undergraduates after
the SUMSRI experience. SUMSRI is not currently funded to support international
students.
