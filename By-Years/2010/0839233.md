With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), Christopher A. Makaroff and colleagues Michael W.
Crowder, Ann E. Hagerman, Christopher S. Hartley, Gary A. Lorigan from Miami
University Oxford Campus will acquire a matrix assisted laser
desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometer with TOF/TOF capability
(MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). This instrument will support research from five primary
researchers as well as at least nine additional researchers from the departments
of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Botany, Zoology and Microbiology. Major research
projects will study membrane proteins and peptides, biological antioxidants,
ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in zinc transport, protein interactions
as well as graphene nanoribbons.

MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate
molecular weights for very large molecules, with extremely high sensitivity. Use
of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique,
especially in studies involving biomolecules. This research will have a
significant impact in a number of areas, especially chemistry and biochemistry.
This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
