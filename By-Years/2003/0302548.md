The National Center for Telecommunications Technologies (NCTT) continues as a
Resource Center to expand the model of partner schools developed in the
Northeast to ten regional partners for telecommunications technologies
throughout the United States. NCTT activities are designed to support the
deployment of rapidly changing telecommunications applications from industry-
development to classroom and laboratory delivery in schools and colleges. The
Center has forged partnerships with international telecommunications industry
leaders and academic institutions. Goals for the next four years include
developing the national consortium; creation of additional texts in the
telecommunications technologies series, including accompanying hands-on
laboratory manuals; dissemination of content through faculty workshops and
corporate training programs; a national conference on telecommunications; and
the continued development of telecommunications skill standards. The Center
focuses on new methods to manage and educate workers in light wave and wireless
telecommunications and in networking, keeping up with the needs of the industry
as it emerges from the present underemployment. The Center evaluation documents
these goals.
