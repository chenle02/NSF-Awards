This award will support a residential doctoral and postdoctoral mentoring
program at the American Bar Foundation (ABF). Over the three-year grant period,
the ABF will award four two-year doctoral fellowships and one three-year
postdoctoral fellowship to young social scientists studying interdisciplinary
topics at the intersection of law and inequality. This program offers the
mentoring, networking, and professional development activities necessary to help
young researchers excel in their respective career paths.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fellowship program has two broad objectives: (1) to
foster cutting edge research on law and inequality and (2) to support emerging
scholars in interdisciplinary and disciplinary departments studying law and
inequality. It is designed to address both the financial burdens of graduate
education and the need for mentoring and networking that is crucial for junior
scholar success, and that can be so elusive in interdisciplinary fields. The
fellowship program will enhance the diversity of research and researchers in the
field of law and social science, and enrich scientific study and knowledge of
law and inequality.
