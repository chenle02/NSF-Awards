This proposal is a request for funds to defray travel cost for a number of
investigators to attend the International Workshop on Hydra and Hydractinia
Development. The Workshop will be held in Gunzburg, West Germany, September
21-25, 1987. Hydra is a significant model organism for studying pattern
formation and cell determination. There are relatively few groups exploiting
this organism and they are located in Europe, Asia and the United States. This
international workshop will enable representatives of most of these groups to
meet and exchange ideas.
