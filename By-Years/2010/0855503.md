This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). When a small black hole orbits a much larger one, it emits
gravitational waves and slowly spirals inward. This award supports a research
program focused on the rate of inspiral of such systems and related features
which are imprinted into the gravitational waves. Careful theoretical
understanding provides valuable insight into the nature of gravitational wave
sources. When combined with the ongoing effort to detect gravitational waves,
this will generate detailed tests of our knowledge both of gravitation and of
the fundamental astronomical processes ongoing in the Universe.

Research in the fundamental areas of physics has historically led to unexpected
benefits of unforeseen consequences and broad impact. Future scientists are
particularly fascinated by relativity and astrophysics. A definite benefit of
this effort includes educating and training students in scientific approaches to
the solution of difficult theoretical and technical problems.
