9612326 Carley The aim of this Dissertation Improvement research is to examine
how individuals actively restructure their social networks in response to a life
stressor, in this case an HIV diagnosis. A theory of network restructuring is
proposed that is based on work in sociology and psychology on network evolution,
in psychology and sociology on stress, and in social psychology on social
support. According to this theory, it is predicted that in response to a life
stressor: (1) the social support network becomes smaller; (2) the social support
network becomes more dense (i.e., there are a greater proportion of
relationships among the members of the network); and (3) informational and
social support networks become more similar (i.e., the number of individuals who
co-occur in both networks increases). The research investigates these hypotheses
using data collected from individuals who will be gathered on a voluntary basis
from a subject pool of more than 3000 men who are at high risk of infection or
are already infected with HIV. A semi-structured interview will be conducted
with participants to solicit information on their different types of networks
(i.e., positive socio-emotional support, negative socio-emotional support,
informational support, and the informed). Multivariate statistical techniques
will be used to analyze the interview data. ***
