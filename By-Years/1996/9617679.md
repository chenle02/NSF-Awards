9617679 Lacy A substantial body of research on mass political behavior assumes
that individuals have "separable preferences." This assumption requires that a
person's preference on one issue does not depend on preference on other issues.
The assumption is so prevalent that public opinion surveys typically ask a
respondent her opinion on one issue after another without links across issues.
What if a persons wants the federal government to prohibit abortions, but only
if the government also increases spending on sexual education, public day care,
and aid to families with dependent children? Or what if a person wants a tax cut
only if spending cuts come from the defense budget, not from social welfare? If
a person's opinion on one issue depends on the outcome of or the options
available on another issue, her preferences are "nonseparable." This project
investigates the extent and impact of nonseparable preferences in public opinion
and voting behavior. Small-group experiments assist the principal investigator
in formulating new survey questions to determine the impact nonseparable
preferences have on survey responses. The investigator uses new survey questions
in a random sample telephone survey of 400 residents of Columbus, Ohio. Data
from the survey enables social scientists to judge whether nonseparable
preferences explain some common empirical problems in public opinion, including
question-order effects, over-time instability in preferences, and the apparently
minimal impact of issues on voter choice in elections. With new survey
instruments available to capture nonseparable preferences, political scientists
are better equipped to investigate voting behavior and public opinion, and
policymakers have a clearer view of what people actually want on important
public policy issues. ***
