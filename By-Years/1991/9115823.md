This is a proposal for instrumentation t perform measurements of fluorescent
lifetimes using both the established technique single photon counting (SPU) and
a new and novel method which we termed 'Time-Resolved Fluorescence Lifetime
Imaging' (TRFLI). The system consists of a Ultrafast CW Nd: YAG pumped dye laser
and a mode-locker, second and third harmonic generator units; an inverted epi-
fluorescence microscope with infinity-corrected optic; microchannel-plate
photomultipler tube; high-speed, gated image intensifier coupled fiberoptically
to an integrating CCD camera, with necessary control units; digital delay pulse
generator, delay units, time-to-amplitude converter with bias amplifier and
multichannel analyzer; and on-stage specimen controllers for temperature and
atmospheric gases ( O 2 &amp; CO2). The requested laser has a minimum 1.3 ps
pulse width, a repetition rate of 76 MHz and usable excitation wavelengths from
350-846 nm. Primary uses of this system will be to measure fluorescent lifetimes
in living cells of fluorophores or fluorophore conjugated cellular components on
the living cells. This information will then be used to determine with temporal
and spatial resolution molecular interactions amongst cellular constituents,
using resonance energy transfer and time resolved emission spectra, monitor
membrane lipid order (fluidity) using time resolved emission anisotropy,
detection of pathogenic organisms in clinical specimens and measurement of
cytosolic free Ca2+ using Fura-2, Fluo-3, or Rhod-2 lifetime analysis. The use
of Fluo-3 or Rhod-2 will also allow the use of caged compounds and laser
scanning confocal microscopy. The TRFLI System will be a unique instrument
integrating state-of-the-art advances in optical microscopy, low-light video
detection and 2-dimensional lifetime image analysis and which does not exit
anywhere else in the country.
