This project will combine research on the management of large, real-time, data
streams with research on algorithms for deriving rainfall estimates from raw
radar data, to develop an information technology framework for use in the
analysis of rainfall data from the NEXRAD radar network. It includes research on
and the development of metadata for the NEXRAD raw data feed, archived NEXRAD
data and derived data products, client libraries for retrieving metadata and
data, and client applications for quality control, data preparation, and the
generation of rainfall maps. If successful, the results should greatly reduce
the time and effort required to locate relevant NEXRAD data and to convert it to
rainfall fields that can be used to drive hydrologic models. The project will
also help standardize the process of rainfall field generation, increasing the
comparability of results from different hydrological modeling groups. The
framework will include a browser for radar data, a map display of rainfall
products, and an analyzer that permits the overlaying of geo-referenced rainfall
fields, digital elevation models, and surface channel networks. Standard and
customizable methods will be available for quality control and rainfall field
generation by users of the system. Included in the tools planned for development
is software to create merged rainfall products when more than one radar covers a
region. If successful, the project will have a potential impact on hydrological
science by providing the data that is the primary driver of dynamic hydrology in
a fashion similar to the way weather data is available to weather researchers.
This, in turn, will facilitate better prediction of soil erosion, flooding and
landslides as well as improve environmental resource management. Because
metadata is being included in THREDDS catalogs, NEXRAD data will become
accessible through DLESE, the Digital Library for Earth Science Education.
