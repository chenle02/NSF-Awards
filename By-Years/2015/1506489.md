It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made
up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program
supported by this grant is to study of the quark structure of nucleons. More
information is needed about the details of this quark structure. One aspect that
is particularly interesting is the existence of anti-quarks in the proton, which
is a consequence of quantum mechanics. An experiment called Seaquest uses high-
energy protons from the Fermilab accelerator to study these anti-quark
distributions in the nucleon and in nuclei. This experiment will achieve
unprecedented accuracy in the determination of the anti-quark distributions.
Beyond the field of particle physics, these distributions are useful in
cosmology as they seek to understand matter at the galactic scale. Beyond the
scientific goals, the proposed detector commissioning, data acquisition and
analysis activities will continue to offer education and research experience to
undergraduates and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year
research program will study the ratio of anti-down quarks to anti-up quarks in
the nucleon and in nuclei using the Drell-Yan reaction at Fermilab. At high
momentum fraction these poorly known anti-quark distributions may provide a
partonic understanding of the well known "pion cloud" model of classical nuclear
physics. The reaction in nuclear targets will also be used to study quark energy
loss. The Colorado group has nearly completed a new tracking detector for the
Seaquest spectrometer, providing a larger acceptance and higher rate
capabilities, and plans to complete, install, and commission this detector.
