This project involves laboratory experiments designed to quantify the mantle
melting processes that lead to the generation of mid- ocean ridge basalts. The
overall goals of the work are to understand the range of depths, the extents of
melting and the melting mechanisms that operate in the earth's upper mantle to
produce magmas under the mid-ocean ridges. Two projects will be conducted: (1)
melting experiments on basalt-analog compositions carried out over the pressure
range of 10 to 25 kbar, and (2) diffusion experiments at 15 to 20 kbar.
