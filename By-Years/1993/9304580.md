9304580 Langlands The School of Mathematics of the Institute for Advanced Study
(IAS) was formed in 1930 at the founding of the IAS. The initial goal of the
School was to provide a haven for scholars where scholars could work in an
environment that was exceptionally favorable for conducting research. Over the
years, other roles have emerged and the School has tried to accomplish two
complementary purposes, to foster mathematical research and to educate
mathematicians who are at various levels of maturity beyond the doctorate.
Although it has functioned in a clearly international context, the main impact
of the Institute has been on the U.S. mathematical community, with a majority of
its visitors having come from or been absorbed by it. The Institute frequently
conducts programs in special areas of mathematics. Recent topics have included
the theory of turbulence in fluid dynamics, computational number theory, and
differential geometry. This project will support postdoctoral and other visiting
researchers at the School of Mathematics of the Institute for Advanced Study
with the goal of supporting a wide spectrum of mathematical research at the
highest level. The primary component of the project will support postdoctoral
researchers and the remainder will support mid-career mathematicians whose
presence at the Institute provides postdoctoral Members unique opportunities for
consultation and collaboration.
