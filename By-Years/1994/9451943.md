9451943 White Molecular biology is one of the fastest growing fields in modern
biology. Recombinant DNA technology has provided revolutionary insight into a
vast array of studies ranging from evolutionary biology to medicine.
Understanding the concepts of molecular biology is a requisite for understanding
current research in many disciplines of biology and biochemistry. It is also
critical for an understanding of a variety of issues that will become more and
more important for students growing up in a world increasingly affected by
biotechnology. Courses at Southeastern Louisiana University include discussions
of molecular aspects of genetics, cell biology, embryology, microbiology and
biochemistry. Unfortunately practical experience in these subjects has been
limited by lack of equipment. We propose establishing a teaching laboratory to
provide students with opportunities to gain hands-on experience in molecular
biology as relates to a variety of disciplines in biology and biochemistry.
Students will gain experience with techniques such as isolation and analysis of
nucleic acids and proteins, DNA sequencing, DNA fingerprinting and others. These
techniques will be presented where appropriate in established lab courses
including embryology, genetics, biochemistry, microbiology, and virology.
Practical lab experience will reinforce concepts taught in the lecture portion
of these courses. Exposure to theories and techniques of molecular biology
offers an important advantage to students. This field has among the best
prospects for employment in the biological sciences. Students with a practical
knowledge of molecular biology will be at an advantage when applying for
advanced degree programs or seeking jobs in industry.
