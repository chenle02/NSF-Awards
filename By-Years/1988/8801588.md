This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research of Professor Stephen Nelsen, University of Wisconsin, whose work
focuses on the chemistry of organic radical cations. Such species are thought to
be important intermediates in a number of oxidation processes. A full
understanding of oxidation processes has important practical implications in
controlling a variety of oxidations, particularly ones that are destructive to
organic molecules. Changes in nuclear and electronic structure upon electron
removal from unsaturated hydrocarbon derivatives will be probed by optical and
ESR spectroscopy, PE spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Energy differences in
the gas phase and in solution between the neutral and ionic state will be
determined. Semiempirical calculations will also be carried out. A series of
sesquibicyclic alkenes, which will change the amount of pyramidalization which
occurs upon electron loss, will be prepared. Comparison of compounds with C=C+.
as the formal charge-bearing center with other compounds having the same alkyl
groups but NN+. bearing the charge will reveal differences in sigma, pi
interactions. Chemistry initiated by irradiation into the sigma, pi transition
of these compounds will also be surveyed. Studies of CO bond formation upon
chain reaction of dioxygen with these compounds (initiated by their cation
radicals) will continue. Unusual selectivities result from the peroxyl-
carbocation and peroxide cation radical intermediates, and four, five, and six-
membered ring peroxides (dioxetanes, dioxolanes, and endoperoxides), many of
which are not available by other methods, have been shown to be formed.
Extensions of this Cation Radical Chain Catalyzed (CRCC) chemistry to additions
of carbon monoxide, isonitriles, nitrous oxide, and acetylenes will be explored.
