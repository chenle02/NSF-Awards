The Department of Chemistry is equipping a scientific graphics laboratory for
the study of computational chemistry in upper division biochemical, inorganic,
and physical chemistry courses. The laboratory is having a significant impact on
student understanding of quantum chemistry and molecular interactions. The
visualization capabilities afford the students in biochemistry the opportunity
to examine structure:function relationships to an extent which was not possible
previously.
