The investigator plans to investigate several questions linked by the common
themes of local Tb Theorems, and the interplay between singular integral
estimates, Poisson kernel estimates, square function estimates, and the
regularity of boundaries. Among the main directions of the proposed research
are: 1. To investigate the relationships among boundedness of layer potentials,
properties of harmonic measure, and uniform rectifiability. 2. To investigate
the structure of uniformly rectifiable sets. 3. To develop and apply "local" Tb
theorems to study the regularity of free boundaries and the solvability of
elliptic boundary value problems. 4. To develop techniques to study the
solvability of boundary value problems for complex elliptic equations, or more
generally, for strongly elliptic systems, with bounded measurable coefficients.

The project lies within the field of harmonic analysis and its application to,
and interaction with, geometric measure theory and the theory of elliptic
partial differential equations. Roughly speaking, in harmonic analysis one
investigates properties of functions and "operators" (i.e., mappings which
transform one function into another) by decomposing them into smaller,
constituent pieces, which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the
pieces. The name itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound
into its various frequency components ("harmonics"). Geometric measure theory
involves the study of the relationship between geometric properties of sets, and
their "measures" (the latter are generalizations of the notions of length, area,
and volume). Partial differential equations and systems of elliptic type
describe a wide variety of phenoma in the real world, including electrostatics,
and steady-state temperature distributions and elastic deformations. A
particular focus of the present proposal is to explore further the relationship
between geometry and properties of "harmonic measure." The latter area of
investigation has already found application in recent work in acoustical
engineering, in particular in the design of a room with desirable acoustic
properties. Progress on the problems to be considered would in all likelihood
open up further avenues of investigation. All such progress will be disseminated
by the investigator via lectures at conferences, seminars and graduate courses,
and via electronic preprints posted on his website and on the ArXiv web site.
The investigator will involve Ph.D. students and a postdoc on problems related
to the proposed work. Two former postdocs are already involved in the project.
