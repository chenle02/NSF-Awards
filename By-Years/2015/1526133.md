The network neutrality debate has raised many issues of fair competition,
revenue generation, &#8232;and the role of emerging technology. In the current
public-commodity, data-networking marketplace, different competing Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) presently have the option to act neutrally with respect
to content and application-services &#8232;from remote 'content providers'
(CPs). Also, competition and cooperation issues not directly&#8232; related to
neutrality need to be addressed, e.g., roaming charges for small entrant
cellular-wireless ISPs. These issues have direct bearing on availability and
prices that ordinary consumers face. To better understand these important
issues, this project aims to investigate models of competition and cooperation
that integrate economic, regulatory and networking factors, particularly those
of the still growing cellular-wireless context with its complex channel quality
dynamics.

One research thrust is to assess if there are any real economic advantages for
an ISP when acting non-neutrally for different models of interaction between
ISPs and CPs. To this end, this project will jointly consider different types of
cellular wireless data-plans typically involving some type of quota,
subscription frameworks and advertising revenues of CPs, side-payments between
ISPs and remote CPs manifest through service-level agreements at gateways to the
(last-mile) ISP, and the physical-layer controls (e.g., transmission power)
enacted by the ISP to service the wireless traffic according to different
priorities and quality-of-service requirements. It will also consider the
problem of promotion of competition between like providers to reduce consumer
costs, particularly how to regulate roaming charges to encourage entrant
cellular-wireless access providers. In addition, the project aims to investigate
how best to leverage available types of real-world operational data, both
econometric and workload (packet-traffic), to inform the investigators' models.
