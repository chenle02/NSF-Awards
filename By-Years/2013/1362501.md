In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Anthony Chianese of Colgate University is developing new
catalysts to enable the chemical storage of solar energy and the more
environmentally benign synthesis of important industrial materials. This project
has potential significance in increasing the atom efficiency and sustainability
of redox transformations of polar bonds. As the research is conducted entirely
by undergraduate students, the project will facilitate the training of future
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is directed at the development and
mechanistic characterization of ruthenium- and iron-pincer catalysts for the
hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of polar bonds. In particular, the project
focuses on using the highly abundant metal iron as a replacement for rarer and
more expensive ruthenium. The primary goal is to pursue the development of iron
catalysts for currently unknown transformations, such as the hydrogenation of
esters and amides and the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to give methanol, as
well as the corresponding dehydrogenation reactions.
