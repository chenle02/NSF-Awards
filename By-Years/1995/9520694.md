9520694 Arnold Research will focus on how an individual's growth rate affects
its age of maturation, its longevity and its offspring's survival. The
investigators will also examine the costs to growth, costs associated with an
individual's lifespan, the health of its offspring, and the environmental and
genetic influences on variation among and within populations of Thamonophis
elegans. Three approaches will be used: experiments in nature, experiments in
the laboratory, and mathematical modeling. Ultimately, the answers to these
research questions will contribute to an understanding of how the environment
combines with an individual's genetic makeup to shape its growth, maturation,
ald survival.
