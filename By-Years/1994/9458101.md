9458101 Berger-Sweeney The proposed studies will examine mechanisms that
underlie sexual dimorphism of cerebral cortical structure and cognitive
functions in mice. More specifically, the studies will focus on how cortically-
projecting neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) influence the developing cortex
and cognition in the two sexes. A BF lesion model will grow to adulthood.
Previous studies show that a neonatal BF lesion leads to persistent alterations
in cortical morphology and to cognitive deficits in adulthood. Recent studies
show that lesion-induced structural and functional deficits are more pronounced
in male than in female mice. For the proposed studies, a combination of
neurochemical, anatomical and behavioral methods will be used to examine
mechanisms that underlie these sex differences. Critical questions to be
addressed include: Does the BF influence cortical maturation at different times
in males and females? What neurotransmitters are responsible for morphological
and behavioral differences between the sexes? Do gonadal hormones differentially
interact with the developing BF system in the two sexes? Answers to these
questions will provide exciting insights into how sex differences in cortical
maturation may relate to sex-specific cognitive development.
