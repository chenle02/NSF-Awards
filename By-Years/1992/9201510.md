This proposal will enable the principal investigator to determine the extent of
scientific illustration techniques in non-illustration courses make a
contribution to helping students and researchers develop their ability to see,
record and understand the world around them. The United States faces a crisis in
science and mathematics education. Although many causes have been suggested for
the crisis, methods for instruction are high on most lists. The University of
Arizona has developed highly innovative ways to helping students visualize
scientific and mathematical concepts and to discover things for themselves.
Visual methods are especially important in the biological sciences where
concepts, structures and principles are often inherently visual. These changes
improve the quality of all instruction and make it more assessable to those at a
disadvantage with normal instructional methods.
