The goal of the project is to provide a secure foundation for a transportation
system that increasingly relies on the cooperation, connectedness, and
automation of vehicles to achieve increases in safety, efficiency, and capacity.
The financial losses attributable to congestion in America's transportation
infrastructure are more than $1 trillion annually and the parallel loss of life
in vehicle collisions is 40,000 deaths per year. Cooperative, autonomous
vehicles are expected to increase the throughput of vehicles; reduce emissions,
fuel consumption, and injuries; extend personal transportation to the disabled
and elderly; and lessen the number and size of
roadways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages a multi-disciplinary
group, composed of security, transportation, control, and communication
researchers to secure an automated transportation system that is available to
all vehicles, trusted or not, that may experience impaired connectivity. The
team is (1) developing a secure and resilient control regime for automated
vehicles, (2) building a framework based on the physical layer to enable
vehicles to establish peer trust, and (3) providing a trusted infrastructure the
ability to securely gather and disseminate traffic and environmental data to
vehicles for optimal route planning and accident avoidance using Bayesian
inference on Markov models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will
advance the knowledge in many fields: secure and resilient control, VANET
security, trust establishment and management, physical-layer security, decision
theory, and secure protocol design. Results from this research will be
disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. The research will
provide opportunities for research training for underrepresented students at
undergraduate and graduate levels.
