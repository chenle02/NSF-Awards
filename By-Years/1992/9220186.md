The long-range goal of this project is to define the interactions in the
transcription complex that cause arrest and termination by RNA polymerase II in
higher eukaryotes. Transcriptional arrest or termination contributes to gene
regulation in eukaryotes, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. To
understand these mechanisms, a much better appreciation of the structure of RNA
polymerase II transcription elongation complexes, both at arrest sites where
elongation normally is efficient, will be required. Methods will be developed to
produce defined elongation complexes that contain either pure RNA polymerase II
or RNA polymerase II that carries the modifications and auxiliary factors it
acquires during initiation at a promoter. Both types of defined elongation
complexes will be isolated and their structures probed using a variety of agents
that can reveal the configuration of RNA and DNA strands within them.
Experiments will be performed to test two models for transcriptional arrest; 1)
that altered configuration of the transcript produces arrest and 2) that arrest
is caused by bent, or conformationally altered, DNA molecules. %%% This study
will produce new insight into how RNA polymerase transcribes the information in
genes (DNA) to an RNA product which is required to express genetic information.
