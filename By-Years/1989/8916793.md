The occurrence of multiple RNA polymerase specificity determinants (sigma
factors) within a single organism represents a powerful mechanism for gene
control. The substitution of one for another of these proteins on the core
transcriptase could turn on or suppress a large number of genes by a single
regulatory event. At least nine unique sigma-like proteins are present in the
bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Five of these proteins are present during
vegetative growth while four of them are found only during a simple form of
differentiation (sporulation) that the bacterium undergoes as a consequence of
nutritional stress. We propose to investigate the function and regulation of two
(sigma B, Sigma E) of these sigma factors. Sigma B and Sigma E differ in their
abundance, time of appearance during growth and development, and the method by
which they participate in the activation of their respective regulons. We will
analyze the function of Sigma B as well as the factors which influence its
activity by characterizing by genetic and physiological means a collection of
previously isolated mutations which enhance transcription form a Sigma
B-dependent promoter, map proximal to the Sigma B structural gene (sigB), and
confer an aberrant morphology on cells that carry them. We will investigate the
regions of the Sigma E structural gene (sigE) which influence its activity and
synthesis by analyzing mutations which alter these properties. We will explore
in depth the phenomenon of "processing" of Sigma E from an inactive precursor
molecule. This will involve a "suppression analysis" of a number of mutations in
elements of the "processing machinery" as well as sigE itself. The basis of the
suppressions will be characterized genetically, immunologically and
biochemically.
