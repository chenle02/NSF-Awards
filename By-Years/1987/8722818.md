The objectives of this work are to develop a reliable three- dimensional (3-D)
slope stability analysis method capable of deal with inhomogeneous problems, and
to study the 3-D stability of some typical inhomogeneous earth structures such
as dams confined in a V-shape valley. This work is based on the variational
limiting equilibrium approach developed by the principal investigator for
homogeneous problems. The results of the project will enhance the geotechnical
knowledge base and will offer to users and practitioners a powerful tool to
address soil slope stability problems.
