9211914 Turner Ocean science has a critical role in understanding the
biogeochemical processes involved in global change, and long- range autonomous
underwater vehicles (LRAUVs) are one of ocean scientists' most promising tools.
However, the state of the art in intelligent control has not seen application in
real physical devices; that which has, been used in highly-constrained
environments. This research is aimed at studying the problem of designing and
building an embedded, intelligent, reactive controller for long- range AUVs.
This program, called ORCA, will be developed to control the Marine Systems
Engineering Laboratory's (MSELs) long- range AUV, currently under development.
ORCA will build on existing work in intelligent control, primarily drawing on
the artificial intelligence subfield of reactive planning. The investigator's
previous work in schema-based reasoning, a reactive planning method, will be
augmented by other work in planning, reasoning under uncertainty, and
intelligent control. ORAC will be able to create and follow mission plans to
achieve users' (scientist') goals, revising its plans and taking actions as
needed to cope with unanticipated events and the other effects of incomplete
knowledge, uncertainty, and interacting with a changing world.
