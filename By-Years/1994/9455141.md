There is now a substantial (though still inadequate) body of cases that can be
used in the teaching of engineering ethics. Virtually none of the cases,
however, have a numerical component. This project includes a workshop to develop
numerical problems to accompany existing cases and newly developed cases in
engineering ethics. The development of numerical problems promotes the
introduction of issues in engineering professionalism and ethics into required
undergraduate engineering courses in several ways: * It provides an added
inducement to engineering instructors, who are always looking for new problems,
to use the cases. * It appeals to students, because it provides a human and
social dimension to their technical work. * It mitigates the objection of
instructors that there is insufficient time to introduce sections on
professionalism and ethics, since there is a directly relevant numerical
component in the cases themselves. * It helps to integrate ethics components
into technical courses, since the ethics components are more clearly linked to
the technical work. * It could provide a model that is more compelling than
free-standing ethics cases for introducing ethics sections into engineering
textbooks. A workshop develops such numerical problems; and their classroom use
is evaluated a year later.
