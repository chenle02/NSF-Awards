9353009 Kaltofen Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will initiate a three week
summer residential program in mathematics and computer science for 25 students
entering the 12th grade. Using Mathematica, Derive, and Maple students create
visualizations of objects such as functions of complex numbers and algebraic
curves over the reals. Other research activities include primality testing using
parallel processors, exploration of algebraic extension fields and the
manipulation of graphs/directed graphs. Career exploration activities include
visits to the IBM research center and the GE research facility. Careers in pre-
college teaching are also highlighted. Issues on the ethics of science are
considered using small group and round table discussions. Use of videotapes,
e-mail, and symbolic computation software in the follow up activities allow the
participants to share their experiences with their teachers and classmates. A
formal presentation at the participants school concludes the program. ***
