Elser 9725878 Ecologists have been increasingly aware of the fundamental
importance of differences in the elemental composition of organisms that
comprise the food webs of ecosystems. Elser, the PI on this proposal, has been
one of the leaders in developing this field termed ecological stoichiometry. The
work supported by this project will combine modeling investigations with
experiments in field and artificial enclosures to examine the joint effects of
light and nutrient availability on the organization of aquatic communities in
pelagic habitats. Specifically it will test whether different light and nutrient
conditions can shift pelagic communities into fundamentally different states by
altering the ecological stoichiometry of dominant interactions. Modeling studies
will evaluate the potential for alternate states in which one is dominated by
quantity effects such as where low algal biomass limits growth by grazers and
the alternate is driven by nutritional effects where poor algal food quality can
limit grazer growth. Modeling results will be tested in field manipulations
conducted at the Experimental Lakes Area in Canada and in artificial mesocosms
at new, state-of-the-art facility at Kyoto University in Japan. Experiments will
involve manipulations of light and starting grazer conditions to test
predictions from the model on these alternate ecosystem states. This work will
contribute to the understanding of the interface between population dynamics and
ecosystem function. It has substantial theoretical and practical implications.
