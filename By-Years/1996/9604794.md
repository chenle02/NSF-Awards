Funds are requested to purchase a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope system to
establish a multiple user confocal facility. This system best fits the needs of
the user group and the diverse projects and approaches proposed here. The user
group represents a cross section of the Salk faculty and departmental
representation. The11 listed users of the requested confocal system include
faculty representatives of 5 departments of the Salk Institute. The 7 major
users include faculty representatives of 4 departments, and the 4 minor users
listed include faculty representatives of 3 departments. The research projects
contained within this proposal emphasize cellular and molecular approaches to
study a broad range of issues in experimental biology, including chromosome
replication and segregation, regulators of DNA replication, the trafficking of
macromolecules from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, localization of
neurotransmitter receptors and ion channel in the brain, and fundamental events
in neural development such as neural induction, cell fate and differentiation,
neuronal migration and axon guidance, and the development of neural circuits.
