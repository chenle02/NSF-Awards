Substitutional dopants in silicon diffuse via interactions with point defects
(interstitials and vacancies). Simulators which model the fabrication of two
dimensional integrated circuit structures and explicitly consider point defects
have recently been developed (i.e., SUPREM IV), but in order for them to
accurately predict device structures, a great deal of work remains in developing
and quantifying models. The goal of this work is to develop basic quantitative
physical models of substitutional dopant diffusion and precipitation/clustering
for such simulators which can consistently predict the redistribution of dopants
over the full range of fabrication conditions: in lightly and heavily doped
materials, enhanced and retarded diffusion under conditions of point defect
injection and extraction. We will analyze existing experimental observations of
dopant diffusion under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions and also
conduct new experiments to produce models which can be incorporated into future
fabrication simulators.
