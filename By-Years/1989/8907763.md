This award will support Dr. David M. Bodily of the University of Utah to conduct
collaborative research for nine months with Dr. Yosuke Maekawa of the Government
Industrial Development Laboratory, Hokkaido and Dr. Yoshiki Sato of the National
Research Institute for Pollution and Resources in Tsukuba, Japan. They will
investigate the action of metal sulfides and halides in catalyzing coal
liquefaction. Combinations of hydrogenation and cracking catalysts under
different conditions of temperature, pressure, concentration, donor solvent, and
nature of the gas phase, will be studied as they affect the design of a real
coal liquefaction plant in Japan. If coal liquefaction processes which operate
at lower temperatures and pressures than are now possible were to be developed,
the economic feasibility of using coal as an energy source would be greatly
increased. The effectiveness of metal sulfides and halides in improving coal
liquefaction without requiring the use of very high pressures or temperatures
will be studied. In this work, the strong research groups in Hokkaido and
Tsukuba will complement the experience of the Principal Investigator.
