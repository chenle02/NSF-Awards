Professor Lane A. Baker of Indiana University is supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry CAREER Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the
mechanisms for gating synthetic conical nanopore membranes, and to develop a
sensing paradigm based on pore blocking by nanoparticles with specifically
designed surface chemistries. The idea is that analytes bound to the
nanoparticles will be coupled with magnetic particles and magnetic fields will
be used to dislodge the entire particle assembly from the nanopores, resulting
in flow of electrolytes and change in the current, thereby providing the basis
for analyte detection. Accurate, rapid and sensitive detection and quantization
of small, often transient, concentrations of chemical and biochemical species in
a dynamic environment is a challenge in analytical chemistry. Developing new
strategies for detection of analytes at low concentrations is an important
contribution to the fields of analytical chemistry, electrochemistry,
nanotechnology and biotechnology. Graduate and undergraduate students will be
trained in state-of-the-art analytical techniques, and an outreach program will
be implemented involving visual learning concepts and information dissemination
using video conferencing in coordination with podcasting technology.
