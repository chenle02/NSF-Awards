This study will address the process by which organic substances of pollutional
significance are removed from wastewater using biologically active films that
form on solid surfaces that rotate partially submerged in the wastewater. The
particular compounds that will be studied include several chlorinated phenols,
phthalates and 2-nitrophenol.
