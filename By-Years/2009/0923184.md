This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

Funding was provided to acquire a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization
Tandem Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (MALDI TOF/TOF MS) equipped with a LC-
MALDI spotting system for general user access for research, education, and
training. The instrument supports multiple disciplines and will be applied to a
wide range of materials including biomolecules (proteins, peptides,
carbohydrates, oligonucleotides, lipids), large organic molecules (synthetic
polymers) and inorganic materials (nanoparticles). The main research efforts
involve the adaptation of tandem MALDI MS analyses to a number of research
projects including the characterization of nucleic acid radical precursors and
the resultant DNA and RNA damage products; the facile and high-throughput
sequencing of hemoglobin and vertebrate band 3 protein; to enhance the knowledge
of crystallographic methods for metalloprotein structural analyses by evaluating
the radiation-induced degradative effects of X-rays on various metalloprotein
crystals; to develop techniques/methodologies for applying MALDI MS to imaging
of single cells; to facilitate of analyses of macromolecular assemblies
associated with DNA replication and repair; and for the detailed
characterization of the structure of lignocellulosic materials, which is
unattainable by other analytical means. These projects will foster collaboration
with the surrounding scientific community. Details of outcomes of all projects
will be available through University of Toledo webpages for each PI/Co-PI, and
in peer-reviewed journals.
