The investigator proposes to continue his project on several topics in number
theory, automorphic forms and arithmetic geometry. With various collaborators,
the PI will investigate the Gan-Gross-Prasad periods, the generalized
Waldspurger formula for unitary groups conjectured by Ichino--Ikeda and N.
Harris, as well as the representation theoretical formulation of Gross--Zagier
formula to higher dimensional Shimura varieties by S. Zhang. The PI will also
pursue the arithmetic fundamental lemma, a relevant conjectural identity between
a certain orbital integral and a certain intersection number on Rapoport--Zink
space. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research concerns a special type of
mathematical object defined by algebraic equations, known as algebraic cycles,
which contain important information about geometry and arithmetic. They have
applications to the arithmetic of elliptic curves, particularly the Birch--
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems of the
Clay Mathematics Institute. The study of elliptic curve is crucial in many areas
such as cryptography and information security.
