This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the international
conference "Dynamics, Measures, and Dimensions" held at the Stefan Banach
International Mathematical Center in Bedlewo, Poland, April 7-12, 2019. The
conference focuses on recent developments and breakthroughs in dynamical
systems, ergodic theory, and geometric measure theory. The goal is to bring
together international experts in these fields, to foster exchange of ideas and
collaborations, and to introduce junior scientists to very active areas of
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference aims to continue the tradition of
US-Polish collaboration in dynamical systems and neighboring areas, as it will
allow the fostering of face-to-face collaborations that might not occur as
readily otherwise. The topics will include but are not limited to: conformal and
holomorphic dynamical systems, rational functions and transcendental iteration,
thermodynamic formalism, fractal geometry, random dynamical systems, infinite
ergodic theory, one dimensional dynamics, orbit counting and Diophantine
approximation. The versatile program of plenary talks is complemented by several
shorter talks by young researchers, a poster session, a panel for advancing
women's career in dynamics, and two crash courses, intended for graduate
students and postdocs, that will take place the weekend before the conference.
