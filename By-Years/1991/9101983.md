We request funds for a beta-scanner with the capability to quantitatively
analyze radioactively labelled (P32, S35, and C14) nucleic acid and protein
blots. We will establish a joint facility that will primarily serve seven
laboratories, five in the Biology department and two in the Biochemistry
department. The requested instrumentation will be used to accomplish goals of
currently funded projects. The research effort in all laboratories has a very
strong molecular methodology component. Major research efforts involve
elucidation of recombination mechanisms in yeast and E.coli, transcriptional
regulation in Drosophila, and in immunoglobulin genes, control of DNA
replication in Xenopus, molecular-genetics of Drosophila neurodevelopment, and
development of methodology for gene isolation. Several projects have a special
emphasis o protein- nucleic acid interactions. The proposed instrument will
enhance the quantitative precision of the ongoing work, and will make possible
experiments that are too time consuming with existing instruments. Equally
important, the proposed instrument will enable us to plan experiments that were
previously unrealistic because of the high degree of precision necessary in the
interpretation of data.
