The quality of the products of modern biotechnology often are limited by the
effectiveness of the separation operations. The effectiveness of the separations
technology is central to the biological activity, purity and safety of the
products. Since biological materials must be concentrated and separated in their
natural environment, special techniques must be developed for their processing
and treatment. This program addresses one such need and focuses on a multiphase
extraction system consisting of two aqueous (water) phases in which the proteins
of interest are handled gently without denaturation. The research will explore
how the protein can be segregated into one of the two phases and could be
purified by settling under the influence of gravity. Thus no special machinery
would be needed in the separation step.
