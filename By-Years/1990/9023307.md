This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Jolie A.
Cizewski of the Physics Department, Rutgers University. Dr. Cizewski will
continue investigations of the structure of medium- and heavy-mass nuclei by
studying the complete spectrum of excitations of low and moderate angular
momentum. The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of the
awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as potential for continued
significant contributions to scientific research, the academic profession, and
the education of future scientists. Particularly noteworthy achievements are Dr.
Cizewski's teaching achievements, her encouragement of graduate research, and
her own research in nuclear physics.
