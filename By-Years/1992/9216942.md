This research is directed toward the problem of extracting three- dimensional
circuit models from microcircuit and packaging layout descriptions by using the
newly developed Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) technique to develop
interconnect models in an efficient manner. Several features of AWE make this
approach attractive: a large speed-up over traditional interconnect extraction
and simulation methods; the ability to perform efficient time-domain sensitivity
analysis; the capability to handle distributed elements without making a lumped
model; an efficient strategy for building macromodels of linear interconnect;
and the ease with which three-dimensional electromagnetic problems (involving
distributed resistance, capacitance, inductance, as well as retardation effects)
can be handled. AWE sensitivity analysis helps to identify "critical" nets which
must be extracted with detailed models; this should improve efficiency by
allowing the remaining nets to be treated more simply. The first task in this
work is the efficient simulation of nonlinear circuits which contain high-speed
interconnect by development of a simulation strategy which combines the benefits
of AWE for the linear portion of the circuit (interconnect) with the generality
of existing simulation algorithms for the nonlinear circuit elements (such as
transistors). The second task is the efficient extraction of accurate circuit
models from three- dimensional interconnect geometry. This is done in such a way
that the subsequent circuit simulation remains efficient. Greater simulation
efficiency is achieved by eliminating the detailed interconnect models and
replacing them by macromodels.
