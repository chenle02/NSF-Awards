The project involves 10 undergraduate students from both NJIT and associated
institutions. The research involves thermodynamics, enzyme kinetics computer
modeling, corrosion science, and synthesis. Seven faculty members act as project
supervisors. The research experience is conducted in the summer on a full-time
basis and continues during the academic year. The project involves weekly
seminar/discussion sessions where students are able to gain experience in oral
communication. Technical reports are to be submitted upon completion of the
project.
