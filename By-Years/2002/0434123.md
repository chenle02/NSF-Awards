An interdisciplinary, graduate student-oriented, symposium will serve as a
unique forum&lt;br/&gt;for the American Chemical Society (ACS) Division of
Polymer Chemistry, Inc. (POLY) and the ACS Younger Chemists Committee (YCC). The
symposium will provide an opportunity for fundamental scientific exchange at the
graduate level and aid in developing the careers of these future leaders in the
field of macromolecular science and engineering. Moreover, this forum will
result in the advancement of fundamental, interdisciplinary, macro-molecular
science and engineering for the discovery of high performance materials.
Selected research presentations will cover interdisciplinary topics in materials
science&lt;br/&gt;ranging from novel synthetic strategies and property
evaluation to performance in rapidly&lt;br/&gt;emerging technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
