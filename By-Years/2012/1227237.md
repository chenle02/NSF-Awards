This award provides continued funding for an innovative effort to gather data
about prices and incomes for many goods across many countries and across a very
long time span. The PIs and their collaborators in the US work with a global
group of scholars to assemble data on the prices of staple goods and on the
distribution of income. They make extensive searches of a variety of archival
data sources to assemble this information. The result is publicly available data
that can be used to make comparsions about per capita incomes and living
standards across time and across distance. The PIs will continue previous effort
with expanded data collection in China, Russia and Latin America. They will
collect a new fiscal history data set that will compare certain indicators of
government revenues and expenditures over the past centuries. The PIs plan
research into whether relative prices are a cause of class-specific lifestyles
and the structural determinants of fiscal capacity and fiscal choice. The PIs
will also add this historical data to the Penn World Tables, which provide
similar data for the period since 1950. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts
include training both undergraduate and graduate students in the necessary
research methods. The data are also useful for policy makers who want to
understand the historic roots of modern economic systems.
