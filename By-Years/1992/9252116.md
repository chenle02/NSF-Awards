The Science Department is purchasing a Fourier transform infrared
spectrophotometer for use in the sophomore organic chemistry courses. As a
result of the acquisition, the laboratory is undergoing a revision to include
experiments involving both qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses. The
changes in the laboratory are smoothing the transition for students transferring
to science programs at four year institutions.
