This research will extend previous work developing a computer simulation model
of human memory. The project includes two kinds of activities. First, the
research will use simulation to explore interesting properties of the model in
greater depth and to apply the model to human memory phenomena that were not
considered in its initial development. Second, the research will include
experiments on human memory, in order to better understand the reasons behind
several of the model's apparent predictive failures. These experiments will
focus on how information is retrieved from memory and how judgments regarding
remembered events are based on the retrieved information. The questions to which
the experiments are addressed are general ones, not model-specific, so that the
experimental results will be of broad relevance to theories of human memory.
Although this work is unlikely to have immediate practical application, it will
further our understanding of the properties of human memory and its role in
cognition, and so will contribute in the long run to applications in such areas
as education and training, brain damage and amnesia, and biases in human
judgment and decision making.
