This research is on the use of partial scan for system test. The goal is to find
solutions that do not sacrifice fault coverage. The main problem addressed is:
given a sequential circuit, find the minimal set of flip-flops that are to be
included in the scan chain while maintaining complete or 100% fault coverage.
The approach is to define a metric, "profit", for a particular scan chain
configuration. This metric is equal to the probability that the required states
for testing the target faults will be obtained using deterministic test
generation techniques. Various optimization techniques are being used to find
the scan chain configuration that has large profit. Algorithms for using this
technique are being developed into a test tool.
