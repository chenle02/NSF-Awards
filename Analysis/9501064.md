9501064 Helton Most of the proposed research falls into three areas: 1.
OPTIMIZATION OVER SPACES OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS Qualitative theory, computer
algorithms based on this theory, analysis of such algorithms. Connections of
this work with other branches of mathematics.The engineering motivation here is
strong; these are the key optimization problems which arise il design of systems
and amplifiers where there are competing constraints, time as well as frequency
domain constraints, or uncertainty in the math model of the physical system one
is trying to control. 2. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS The point here is to find canonical
nonlinear operator theory which extends the classical linear theory of
Nevanlinna-Pick and many followers. That theory is the core of linear control
theory. Many systems which people wish to control are nonlinear (e.g., jet
engines), so there is a big demand for an effective nonlinear theory.
Unfortunately, the mathematical theory is new and primitive. More general
problems need to be solved and special cases need to be understood in greater
detail. 3. COMPUTER OPERATOR ALGEBRA Linear engineering systems theory and
operator theory are rife with calculations in a noncommuting algebra. Thus it is
likely that someday there will be a branch of these subjects devoted to their
symbolic computational aspects. Helton's group have, support, and are upgrading
extensive software, called NCAlgebra, for performing noncommuting calculations
in Mathematica. The software is currently at the level of a very powerful
`yellow pad'. The main issue now is what `intelligence' should go in
noncommuting packages. For example, calculations with energy conserving systems
produce polynomials in matrices satisfying certain relations. Thus it is natural
to find a list of rules for simplifying such polynomials tailored to this
particular situation. The goal is to find and understand `complete' lists of
simplifying rules. Helton and collaborat ors have successfully studied several
situations of this type and more are in progress. ***
