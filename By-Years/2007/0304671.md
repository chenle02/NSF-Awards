ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This project will use the Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) and
various electro-optical and x-ray characterization techniques to develop a novel
processing method for producing ultra-thin single-crystal films of
conducting/semi-conducting organic compounds and nanoparticle films. The new
method is based on preliminary results in which applying pressure, rolling and
shear to confined organic-liquid films and nanoparticles dispersed in various
organic solvents resulted in highly uniform well-ordered nano-thin layers over
large areas. Various parameters will be investigated during this new type of
mechanical processing in comparison to conventional wet (self-assembly) methods.
The SFA allows one to perform simultaneous mechanical and opto-electronic
characterization of thin films in situ. The aim will be to adapt this new
processing method for efficient large-scale production of high area displays,
organic thin film transistors (OTFT), and high area pressure-sensitive QD
displays such as touch panels and new light emitting applications.
