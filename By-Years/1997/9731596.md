9731596&lt;br/&gt;Leventhal&lt;br/&gt;This research at an RUI institution
focuses on experiments to probe the internal structure of atoms with the aim of
revealing correlations between classical and quantum physics. Photoionization of
laser-excited atoms and an accurate determination of quantum defect parameters
will be pursued. An expansion of recently initiated work on the creation and
detection of coherent states will also be undertaken. The research projects will
involve undergraduate students, high school students, and high school
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
