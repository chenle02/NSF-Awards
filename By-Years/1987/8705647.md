This research project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
designed to provide deeper understanding of molecular structure and reactivity
in organic compounds. This new knowledge is to be gained through preparation and
study of new molecules representative of polyfunctional types encountered among
natural products. Several projects will be pursued in the areas of natural
products chemistry. New cyclization reactions which will lead to key
intermediates for entry into the nogalamycin class of anti-tumor antibiotics,
the cervinomycins (a new class of antibiotic polyketide alkaloids), and
hormothamnione (a polyoxygenated chromone which exhibits impressive antitumor
activity) will be investigated. The specific synthetic methods to be developed
involve the use of aryl radicals in carbohydrate chemistry and directed aldol
condensation reactions in unsymmetrical polyketide synthesis.
