This application requests funds for the acquisition of biophysical
instrumentation for molecular recognition studies. The instrument is an
isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal). Isothermal titration calorimetry
directly measures the thermodynamics of protein-ligand interaction. The systems
currently under study are: protein- protein interactions in ferredoxin-linked
chloroplast enzymes; cAMP receptor protein (CRP) interacting with cAMP and
double stranded DNA; cold shock protein interacting with the specific single-
stranded DNA sequences; interactions of sterol and sterol derivatives with
(S)-adenosyl-L- methionine;24(25)-sterol methyl transferase (SMT); interactions
of metallo--lactamases with -lactam antibiotics. Direct determination of the
thermodynamics of binding in these systems, characterization of conformational
changes upon binding, and their analysis will complement and extend previous
biochemical results.
