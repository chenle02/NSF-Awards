The quality of undergraduate instruction in organic chemistry and general
chemistry is being improved through the acquisition and upgrading of equipment.
Major instruments being added are a gas chromatograph (GC) system, a high-
pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC) system, and Apple IIgs computer system and
an interactive microware (IMI) data acquisition system. The instruments are
enhancing the implementation of the microscale laboratory program and are
complementing each other in analytical capabilities, increasing student access
to modern equipment, familiarizing them with computer acquisition, storage and
manipulation of data, and introducing them to HPLC. Chemical instrumentation is
being treated as a an integral part of the laboratory work, thereby
strengthening the quality of the learning. Laboratory activities such as kinetic
studies, competitive reactions, ad determination of product distribution ratios
is allowing students to actually collect data instead of only seeing it in a
text book. The project is significantly impacting the quality of science
education for a group of students in a community college that serves not only as
a lower division program, but also to educate employees in a 10-mile circle of
science based corporate neighbors. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
