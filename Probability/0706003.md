In many scientific areas, an extensively used technique for the fast simulation
of rare events is importance sampling [IS]. The basic idea of IS to simulate the
system under a different probability distribution, and correct for biasedness
via the likelihood ratio. During the last three decades, most of the IS schemes
that were developed were based on heuristics, and led to algorithms with
questionable performance. In contrast, this research project develops a
systematic methodology for the construction of simple, efficient IS schemes for
broad classes of process models. This approach capitalizes on the intimate
connection between IS and a related differential game. It turns out that
subsolutions to the Isaacs equation associated with the game can be used to
build IS schemes whose performance can be rigorously characterized. The
investigators are particularly interested in developing both theoretical and
practical aspects of importance sampling in the areas of stochastic networks,
metastability analysis, systems with discontinuous dynamics, small noise
diffusions, counting problems, analysis of higher-order moments of IS
estimators, and heavy-tailed distributions. The project will also study the use
of subsolutions for the construction and analysis of fast simulation methods
based on branching processes, such as splitting and RESTART.

Rare events, such as transitions between stable wells in a model from chemical
physics, data loss in a highly reliable communication system, or unexpectedly
large payouts in insurance claims, are often key quantitative measures of a
system's overall behavior. They also play a central role in risk assessment and
management. Reliable numerical methods are required in order to design systems
and protocols that can minimize and mitigate the negative effects of rare
events. The main technique for the fast simulation of rare events is importance
sampling. Importance sampling algorithms have been developed over the last
thirty years for many different application areas. However, the development to
date has been largely ad hoc and without a proper theoretical foundation.
Practitioners have relied on a few rudimentary heuristics in constructing
importance sampling algorithms. The performance of these schemes was supported
by limited numerical evidence, and unfortunately recent work has shown that
these heuristics are in general unreliable. This project brings new ideas from
probability theory and tools from game theory and partial differential equations
to the problem of design and analysis of importance sampling schemes. The work
aims to develop systematic methods for the construction and rigorous analysis of
reliable algorithms.
