Research progress in computer-aided engineering has brought the construction
research community to a significant front. A most compelling issue on this front
is representation of and reasoning on geometric information. Such geometric
reasoning underlies the dominant intellectual issues of representation,
reasoning, planning, and action in the construction domain. In spite of
importance of geometric reasoning to many computer-integrated construction
functions, it has until very recently received only fragmentary attention,
insufficient to meet current demands. This research will develop a body of
theory for geometric reasoning in the area of computer-integrated construction
and will implement a series of geometric reasoning programs to demonstrate that
body of theory. Specifically supported by these reasoning programs will be the
planning, design and construction of building systems. Technically supporting
the research is an architecture for geometric reasoning. Included in this
architecture are capabilities for decomposition of geometric objects to their
composing features, for representation at multiple levels of abstraction, for
class based representation and reasoning and for reasoning based upon constraint
satisfaction.
