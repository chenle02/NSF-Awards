With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI award, the
Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division is supporting the research
and teaching activities of Dr. Amir H. Hoveyda of the Department of Chemistry at
Boston College. The focus of Professor Hoveyda's research will be the design and
development of selective chemical transformations which are subject to catalysis
by inexpensive and non-toxic transition metals. He will also develop effective
and general strategies in asymmetric synthesis. Dr. Hoveyda's teaching
activities will focus on curriculum development at the undergraduate level in
organic chemistry and the establishment of an annual research symposium with
both undergraduate and graduate students as active participants.
