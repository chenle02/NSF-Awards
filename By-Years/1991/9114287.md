This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic environment and its
role in global change promoted by NSF's Arctic System Science Program. It is a
two year project to investigate the role of arctic sediments in denitrification
processes. The proposal addresses a fundamental problem in marine
chemistry/geochemistry - the long-term balance of the fixed nitrogen content of
the oceans. As there is good evidence that the fixed nitrogen content of the
oceans is not presently balanced and knowing that availability of 'N' can
control marine productivity, this is an issue that is fundamental to the study
of global ocean fluxes and the linkages between ocean chemical cycles and
climate.
