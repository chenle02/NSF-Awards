9223725 Maling This project explores the hypothesis that the syntactic cases
form a Case Tier which is mapped onto a hierarchy or grammatical functions,
consisting roughly of SUBJECT &gt; OBJECT &gt; ADVERB. This approach contrasts
clearly with much current work on Case Theory, which assumes that Nominative and
Accusative are "structural" cases (or Cases) assigned to particular
configurational positions. The widespread occurrence of VP-internal nominatives
and/or "nominative objects" constitutes a serious problem for structural
theories of case assignment, but is entirely expected under the Case Tier model.
The project will explore the limits of cross-linguistic variation within the
Case Tier model, focusing on the assignment of nominative or absolutive case to
verbal complements and various kinds of adverbial adjuncts, and the casemarking
of ditransitive verbs. Basic questions to be addressed include: - What are the
formal principles controlling the mapping, and parameters that allow for
variation? - Is there a basic distinction between arguments and adjuncts? What
kinds of adverbials may participate in the hierarchy? - How does syntactic case
interact with oblique case assigned structurally to particular configuration
positions? - How do predicate nominals get case-marked? - How do expletives get
case-marked? - What are the implications of this approach for GB Case Theory,
particularly the Case Filter and Burzio's Generalization? When are passive verbs
accusative case assigners? Data will be drawn from a wide variety of case
systems, including Finnish, Greek, Icelandic, Korean, Quechua and various
Australian, Philippine, Slavic and South Asian languages. ***
