9708966 Shaw The micro-tribological properties of carbon nanotubes will be
investigated. Short lengths od tube will be attached to the tip of an atomic
force microscope and used as the slider in contact with surfaces of MoS2, mica
and other materials, as well as monolayers of carbon tubes deposited on these
surfaces. Testing will be conducted with the nanotubes filled with various
lubricants and other liquids. It is expected that the technique will allow
determination of the effects on lubrication performance of certain molecular
properties of the lubricants, such as diffusivity and relaxation time. The
potentially low- friction, nanometer thick boundary lubrication film produced in
this way has a number of possible applications in MEMS systems and hard disk
drives. ***
