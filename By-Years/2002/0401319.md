The Principal Investigator will conduct research in two areas that will lead to
new results in number theory and arithmetic geometry. The first is concerned
with several questions that are centerd around conjectures of Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer type. These questions involve arithmetic Galois module
structure, Iwasawa theory and Arakelov theory. The second topic deals with the
study of relative Galois structure invariants using techniques from relative
algebraic K-theory.

The research described in this proposal lies in the field of arithmetic
algebraic geometry. This is a subject that blends two of the oldest branches of
mathematics, namely number theory and geometry. It has now blossomed to a point
where it has resolved problems that have stood for centuries--the most famous
recent example of this is the resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew
Wiles. In addition to its central importance within mathematics, this area has
far-reaching concrete applications in fields as diverse as physics, robotics,
data processing and information theory.
