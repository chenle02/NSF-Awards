This is a proposal to develop bioerodible polymer matrices for the growth of
osteoblasts and their precursors. A two-dimensional model system will be
developed to determine cell attachment, growth, and DNA expression as a function
of the physical and chemical nature of the polymeric material. The research will
provide insight into the design of three-dimensional systems that may be useful
for bone grafting, prosthetic implants and coatings.
