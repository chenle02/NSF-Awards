This investigation will determine the modulatory actions of zinc in the
vertebrate retina, where the presence of this important trace element has been
established. The goals of this project will be achieved using a
multidisciplinary approach involving measurement of changes to
electrophysiological responses which result from application of appropriate
pharmacological agents and development of quantitative measurements of zinc
release from retinal cells. The results will reveal mechanisms by which zinc
released from photoreceptor terminals feeds-back to reduce the calcium entry
involved in glutamate release, thereby reducing unnecessary glutamate release in
the dark. Results will also provide increased understanding of the ways in which
zinc affects hemi-channels, the constituents of gap junctions between retinal
neurons. These affects will influence interactions involved in contrast
sensitivity and/or the spread of cell death from injured neurons. Knowledge of
these mechanisms will be greatly enhance our understanding of the neural
mechanisms mediating early events of visual processing in the retina as well as
protection from glutamate cytotoxicity in the retina and elsewhere in the
central nervous system. While advancing discovery and understanding in the
stated scientific problems, the project will have broader impacts through its
role in promoting teaching, training and learning in an environment that offers
significant educational opportunities to underrepresented minority students.
