On-line problems arise in many important, practical settings, such as operating
systems, programming language implementations, and robotics. These problems
involve sequences of requests that must be processed on the fly. The goal of the
project is to find fast algorithms and to prove lower bounds for on-line
problems in sets and graphs, two fundamental mathematical objects that are used
to model a myriad of computer applications. The project will investigate
problems which arise in logic programming and that involve varying sets of
variables. It will also study problems of maintaining information about graphs
that are changing on-line. Such changing graphs model applications in circuit
simulation, networks, and distributed computing. Solving on-line problems
involves the development of dynamic data structures, which are sophisticated
tools for quickly accessing and modifying stored information. Dynamic data
structures often have uses in other areas of computer science. A final goal of
the project is to investigate whether certain on-line problems in sets and
graphs are inherently difficult. The project will improve the understanding of
theoretical issues relevant to practical problems, and hopefully give better
solutions to those problems.
