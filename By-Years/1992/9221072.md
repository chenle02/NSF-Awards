Numerous examples exist in the literature documenting the importance of electron
tunneling in enzymatic processes. Although much larger than the electron,
protium possesses a de Brogile wave length which is similar to the expected
dimension of the reaction coordinate in simple H transfer reactions. This
property has led to the recognition that the behavior of protium is poised
between classical and quantum mechanical behavior. Published studies from this
laboratory have demonstrated that quantum effects contribute significantly to
several enzyme catalyzed H transfer reactions at room temperature. Ongoing
experiments suggest that this phenomenon will be a general one for enzyme
catalyzed reactions. A major difficulty in the unambiguous demonstration of
tunneling has been the absence of suitable experimental probes. A series of
protocols have been developed toward this end: these include the comparative
study of H/T and D/T isotope effects and their temperature dependences.
Investigations during the next funding period will include the following areas:
(1) A number of new enzyme catalyzed H transfer reactions will be examined for
tunneling, in order to establish a data base for this phenomenon. In particular,
the PI plans to focus on the flavin containing enzymes, monoamine oxidase and
glucose oxidase: (2) Studies of the influence on tunneling of specific protein
substrate interactions will be pursued through the use of site-specific
mutagenesis; and (3) Computational work will be continued, with the goal of
reproducing experimental data and providing suitable models for the mechanism of
tunneling in enzyme reactions. %%% Although electron tunneling in proteins has
been extensively studied, little attention has been paid to nuclear (hydrogen)
tunneling. Dr. Klinman's elegant work has shown that nuclear tunneling
contributes significantly to certain enzymatic reaction rates under biologically
relevant conditions. This project builds and expands upon these groundbreaking
observations.
