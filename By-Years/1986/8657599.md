This investigator was nominated for a Presidential Young Investigator award.
His research involves a new theory of hybrid control for robotics, which will be
tested for effectiveness in assembly and other manufacturing processes. The
basic theory will also be extended to the robust control of robots near
singularity configurations, and the active control of multiple robots in
contact. Further theoretical work will also be done on path planning for
obstacle avoidance, extensions of screw theory and the application of Clifford
algebras to problems in robotics. The program of research will integrate
experimental and analytical work. The PI is interested in working closely with
industry on important problems which have the potential for making a
significantly contribution towards increasing manufacturing productivity. In the
first year, this award will be supplemented for support of two undergraduate
students who will participate in the research. Their role will involve the
design of six-degree-of-freedom joysticks for robot control.
