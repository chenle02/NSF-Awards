The Twenty-Second Fungal Genetics Conference will be held at the Asilomar
Conference Center at Asilomar, California, on March 18-23, 2003. Approximately
750 scientists and students from around the world will attend. The conference
focuses on the molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology of
filamentous fungi. This is considered by many to be the preeminent meeting in
this area. It promotes interaction between researchers interested in medical
pathogens, plant pathogens, saprobic fungi, and symbiotic fungi. The meeting
will consist of four plenary sessions, four sessions devoted to concurrent
workshops in specialized areas, three poster sessions, and informal discussions.
Topics to be covered in the plenary sessions are fungal cell biology, fungal-
host interactions, signaling and silencing, and genomes and evolution.
Specialized concurrent sessions are planned to cover the following diverse array
of subjects: fungal genomics, regulation of primary metabolism, evolution of
gene clusters, mating and sexual development, signal transduction, DNA
repair/genome dynamics, secondary metabolism and mycotoxins, stress responses,
targeting and secretion of proteins, epigenetics, transposable elements, prions,
the fungal cytoskeleton, fungal-plant interactions, photobiology and clocks,
fungal population genetics, teaching fungal biology and genetics, medical
mycology, experimental evolution and selection, spores, sporulation and hyphal
morphogenesis, parasitic interactions with insects, nematodes and other fungi,
and membrane transporters. In this meeting strong emphasis is placed on the
participation of young scientists and students, particularly those from
underrepresented groups. This award will help defray the travel and
participation costs of students, postdoctoral researchers and beginning faculty.
Funds will be distributed on a need basis to those who apply for financial aid.
