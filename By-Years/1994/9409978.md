9409978 Cahay This grant supports the participation of graduate students at the
Second International Symposium on Quantum Confinement (Physics and Applications)
to be held as a part of the 185th Meeting of the Electrochemical Society in San
Francisco (May 22-27, 1994). The symposium is dedicated to recent research in
hot electron and quantum transport in mesoscopic structures, specifically
quantum wires and dots. Novel optical phenomena in wires and dots (including
research in light emission mechanisms of porous silicon) is also of interest. Of
particular importance are cooperative phenomena in coupled dot and wires
(including both linear arrays and lateral surface supperlattices) and exchange
mediated artificially engineering many body ground states in such systems. The
symposium will address all aspects of fabrication, characterization and
modelling of both semiconductor and superconductor mesoscopic structures and
coupled systems. This is a field which continues to burgeon and promises vastly
improved for the next century. ***
