The principal investigator will study how the so-called "lambda-scheme" for
integrating Euler's equations can be extended from two-dimensional problems to
three-dimensional problems. This technique will be complemented by a three-
dimensional extension of shock-fitting methods. Both the lambda-scheme and the
shock-fitting methods have proved to be efficient, accurate and reliable in a
variety of two-dimensional problems. Internal and external flow problems will be
analyzed in the course of the research. This will require the study of novel
types of grids, generated by conformal mapping, which are interesting on their
own rights. Evaluation of the accuracy of the numerical technique by comparison
with exact solutions will be made, whenever possible. Particular emphasis will
be given to the numerical interpretation of the physics of shock interactions.
