This award supports the research of Professor J. Beck to work in combinatorics.
He intends to find an algorithmic version of the local Lovasz lemma and if so,
to apply this result to various problems in graph theory and combinatorics. The
research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find
efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized.
And, so it is extremely important to modern communications, for example the
design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in
computer science.
