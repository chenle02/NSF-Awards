The Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) is designed to operate in the
200-900 GHz band. Future high-sensitivity studies of both star-formation regions
and galaxies will require a spectral-line detector array. The technological
development of most of the required elements, such as detectors and
preamplifiers is reasonably well-advanced, but no convenient solution exists for
a flexible, wide-band spectrometer with low power-dissipation, volume, cost and
high reliability, suitable for replicating to 25 or more elements. This award
will support the development of a custom-Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)
correlator of at least 1 GHz bandwidth and 200 independent channels. It will
have roughly 10 times the performance of existing designs due to the high
packing-density and high speed of the proposed custom-VLSI technology. Most of
the correlator components will be on one integrated circuit, and therefore the
multi-element replication process will be much simpler and cheaper than with
alternative designs. The anticipated volume and power consumption are a factor
of 10 less than for the best available alternatives. This factor makes the
spectrometer array feasible. This project makes use of the DARPA/NSF MOSIS
Facility.
