This project supports this institution's Mechanical Engineering Technology
program and a new program in Manufacturing and Design. Students of manufacturing
and design, mechanical, industrial automation and electronic engineering
technology study the concepts and techniques of computer-integrated processing
and the interfacing necessary for computer-assisted functions. Utilizing
workcells, students experiment with production operations in the laboratory. The
laboratory supporting this project includes the following equipment: three CNC
machine tools (one mill and two lathes) linked to the CADAM system for CAD/CAM
production, integrated with robots, microprocessors and programmable logic
controllers. Manufacturing precision is verified with an optical comparator and
manual gages. Students are trained as technologists in this state-of-the-art
laboratory to serve a critical need in the Nation. This award is matched by an
equal amount from this institution.
