9525907 Aziz This research project aims for fundamental understanding of solid
phase processes related to nucleation and epitaxial growth, and pursues this
goal using a high pressure methodology for studying atomic diffusion in
semiconductors and the effects of non-hydrostatic stresses on solid phase
epitaxial growth processes. The theme of the research is to use high pressure as
a thermodynamic parameter in order to obtain information on the activation
volume of crystal growth or diffusion processes. The basic approach is to
measure a growth rate or impurity diffusion rate as a function of pressure and
to use this information to obtain the activation volume for the process. The
magnitude and sign of the activation volume provide constraints on the physical
models used to describe growth or diffusion processes. %%% The primary goal of
this research project is to establish greater basic understanding of particular
phenomena relevant to thin film synthesis and processing of two key electronic
materials, silicon and germanium, and to relate this understanding to the
development of advanced microelectronics devices through modifications in
processing methods. Additionally, an important feature of the program is the
training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area. The knowledge and understanding gained from
this research project is expected to contribute generally to improving the
performance of advanced devices used in computing, information processing, and
telecommunications. ***
