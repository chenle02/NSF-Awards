In this proposal, theoretical models will be used to study heavy
&lt;br/&gt;collisions at various energies as well as nuclear reactions induced
by &lt;br/&gt;photons and other elementary particles. Using an improved
&lt;br/&gt;isospin-dependent transport model, that includes different dynamics
for &lt;br/&gt;protons and neutrons, collisions of rare isotopes at current
&lt;br/&gt;accelerators and the proposed Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) will be
&lt;br/&gt;studied in order to find the dependence of experimental observables,
&lt;br/&gt;such as the two-nucleon correlation functions and the yield of light
&lt;br/&gt;clusters, on the properties of nuclear matter with different proton
and &lt;br/&gt;neutron numbers. With a refined multi-phase transport model, that
&lt;br/&gt;includes both initial interactions among quarks and gluons and final
&lt;br/&gt;interactions among ordinary hadrons as well as the transition between
&lt;br/&gt;these two phases of matters, ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions
at &lt;br/&gt;the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) will be studied in
order to &lt;br/&gt;identify the signatures of the produced quark-gluon plasma
and to study &lt;br/&gt;its properties through observables such as the
collective dynamics of &lt;br/&gt;produced particles, the electromagnetic
radiations, the abundance of hadrons consisting of &lt;br/&gt;multi-strange or
heavy charm quarks, the suppressed production of &lt;br/&gt;energetic particles,
and the even-by-event fluctuations. Also, &lt;br/&gt;effective hadronic models
will be extended to study exotic pentaquark&lt;br/&gt;baryons from photo- and
hadron-nucleon reactions in the experiments &lt;br/&gt;carried out at the
Jefferson National Laboratory (JLAB) and elsewhere &lt;br/&gt;in order to
determine their properties and structures. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;research will
not only have direct impact on the research&lt;br/&gt;programs at RIA, RHIC, and
JLAB but also adds greatly to our &lt;br/&gt;understanding of astrophysical
phenomena such as supernova explosions, &lt;br/&gt;neutron star properties, and
of how matter is formed from the &lt;br/&gt;primordial quark-gluon plasma during
the evolution of the early &lt;br/&gt;universe. It further offers young students
and postdoctoral researchers &lt;br/&gt;a broad research experience that
includes methods ranging from quantum &lt;br/&gt;field theory to statistical
mechanics and involving both analytical &lt;br/&gt;work and numerical
computation. These experiences will prepare them &lt;br/&gt;well for careers in
either nuclear science or other areas to continue &lt;br/&gt;their contributions
to the scientific and technological advance in our
&lt;br/&gt;society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
