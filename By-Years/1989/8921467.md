This is a sound, well-considered dissertation proposal to study children's
decision-making in social situations. The general goals of this investigation
are to understand children's social decision- making processes and to evaluate
the relation between these processes and behavioral outcomes. The task itself,
reactions to provocation in everyday situations, is socially important to both
children and adults. Neither the problem nor the approach have received much
consideration in the judgment-decision field or in the developmental-personality
field. This work should give useful results at both basic and applied levels. In
sum, this project is significant because it is the first attempt to construct
and test empirically a specific, process-oriented theory of children's social
decision making in an ecologically relevant behavioral situation.
