The object of this project is to analyze the dynamics and control of a number
of mathematical systems of practical interest. In the first place the dynamics
and control of rotating systems will be studied using recently developed Energy-
Momentum methods. A new approach to stabilizing unstable control systems by the
Energy-Casimir method will be considered. Finite dimensional reductions and
transit from stability to unstability will be studied. Finally, the principal
investigator will try to extend his recent work on Toda lattice to further
understanding of certain gradient and Hamiltonian systems.
