Dr. Dedman is interested in the molecular mechanism of the action of
calmodulin, a calcium binding protein, in modulating electrical activity in
excitable cells. The electric organ of the eel contains large amounts of
calmodulin, has large cells and has been used to study electrical activity. In
this pilot project, Dr. Dedman will develop techniques to perform whole cell
perfusions while monitoring the potential differences across the anterior and
posterior electrocyte membranes. The size of the electrocyte (2mm x 0.15mm), is
ideal to apply whole cell perfusion techniques. The perfusion micropipettes will
be made with an opening of about 0.02mm OD. The cell after identification with
Hoffman modulation contrast optics will be impaled at each lateral surface, and
the flow of the internal perfusion system controlled by hydrostatic difference
in the affluent/effluent reservoirs. The perfusate will be passed through
mellitin (an inhibitor of calmodulin) sepharose and calmodulin sepharose columns
to remove calmodulin and calmodulin target proteins. This solution will be
repleted with calmodulin and calmodulin target proteins, or antibodies to
calmodulin or the target proteins. During the perfusions, the resting membrane
potential differences and the action potentials will be measured. This pilot
project will determine whether whole cell perfusion can bridge molecular biology
with a defined physiological event.
