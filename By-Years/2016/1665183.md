In quantum mechanics, or in the microscopical physical world, an observable may
be modeled by a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space. A system of such
operators forms a C*-algebra. In the finite dimensional cases, these operators
are just matrices. In more general cases, these operators may be represented by
infinite matrices, or matrices on infinite dimensional Hilbert space. In the
mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, a pair of self-adjoint operators
representing observables are typically non-commutative which corresponds to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The study of C*-algebra is often viewed as the
study of non-commutative analogues of the algebra of continuous functions on a
topological space. There are many C*-algebras that come from different fields of
sciences and the study of C*-algebras has variety of applications. It is known
that C*-algebras with different appearance from different applications can be
the same. On the other hand, C*-algebras from the same source may look the same
but have essentially different structure. For application purposes as well as
the theoretical point of view, it is extremely important to determine the
structure of C*-algebras from their appearance. This project is an attempt to
use a small number of computable data to completely determine C*-algebras in
certain classes. In other words one may study the computable data to understand
the structure of C*-algebras. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a study of
classification of amenable C*-algebras using K-theory related invariants and
applications of the classification. The main part of this project is to search
for a broad classification of non-unital simple amenable C*-algebras. Part of
the strategy is to create new technical tools to deal with non-commutative
version of non-compact spaces. The goal is to establishe a new type of existence
theorem as well as a K-theoretic characterization of asymptotic unitary
equivalence for non-unital simple C*-algebras. A closely related topic is to
verify certain C*-algebras satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. The
research of this project will also provide a new passage to greatly simplify the
way in which the theory of C*-algebras is applied to various other related
research areas, notably, to non-commutative homotopy theory and the study of
dynamical systems. For example, it is proposed, using this broad classification
theory, to study a new relation among minimal homeomorphisms on a compact metric
space which is called asymptotic conjugacy, and ultimately characterize this
relation via K-theoretical data.
