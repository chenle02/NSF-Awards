This project is concerned with surfaces in 3-manifolds. Specifically, it
investigates the relationship between triangulations of Haken 3-manifolds and
the finiteness of the set of their Heegaard surfaces. It further explores the
rigidity phenomena and the numeric of surfaces in 3-manifolds. The basic tools
of this research will be an extension of the methods developed in the
investigator's book, "Computations in 3- manifolds". The geometry and topology
of 3-dimensional objects (3- manifolds) and surfaces lying in them is a natural
topic of study for the inhabitants of a 3-dimensional space.
