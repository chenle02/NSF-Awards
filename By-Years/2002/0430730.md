The understanding of geometric shapes in everyday life combines visual
impressions, tactile sensation, and their unification in the process of seeing
something and reaching out to touch it to determine its physical properties,
which may convey new information. Interactive computer graphics systems can be
combined with 3D-touch-responsive (haptic) interfaces to permit not only the
simulation of our familiar 3D world, but also the extension of our available
sensations to additional dimensions and unfamiliar geometric objects by using
the abstract power of computer modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
focuses on exploiting interactive graphics combined with haptics to develop new
methods for investigating geometric structures whose understanding is beyond the
normal capabilities of the unaided human. Results will be made available in the
form of pedagogical animations as well as the software environments used to
create them. Typical problems include the direct manipulation and study of
deformable volumes resulting when a 3D knot is removed from the solid block of
space it lives in, leaving the knot complement, and the exploration of the
intricate collision-free deformations of surfaces in 4D space that are essential
for studying the properties of functions of two complex
variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anticipated outcome of pursuing such
approaches will be to enhance human capabilities and intuition pertaining to
specific challenging geometric visualization problems, to provide methods
enabling the discovery of scientific questions related to complex geometric
structures that might not otherwise have been asked, and ultimately to advance
the entire concept of empowering human understanding using computer-based
technology.&lt;br/&gt;
