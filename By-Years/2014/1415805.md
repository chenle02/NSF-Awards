The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel high strength, surface porous layer
that can improve integration of non-metal orthopedic implants, resulting in
better clinical outcomes. This improvement to orthopedic implants is especially
important for lumbar fusion devices, which are used to alleviate chronic back
and leg pain in over 240,000 patients annually. Non-metal, polymer implants are
most commonly used for lumbar fusions because of their compatibility with
medical imaging. However, these devices have smooth surfaces that do not
integrate well with bone, which leads to a complication and revision surgery
rate of approximately 11 to 15%.

The proposed project will investigate the feasibility of the high strength,
surface porous layer for use on lumbar fusion cages. The research objectives are
to determine the effect the architecture of the surface porous layer has on the
mechanical properties and the biological response for improved bone integration.
The research will use standard mechanical tests to determine the static and
fatigue properties of different polymer constructs with the surface porous layer
and to determine the mechanical properties of the surface porous layer itself.
Additionally, the research will use cell studies to determine the effect the
porous layer architecture has on improving the osteoconductive response of cells
to the implant surface. Finally, devices with the surface layer will be
prototyped and tested under physiological conditions. It is anticipated that the
architecture will have a minimal effect on bulk mechanical properties while
significantly improving the osteoconductive response.
