This project describes a career development program that combines research in
the field of astroparticle physics with the development of a new course titled
Introductory Cosmology at the University of Utah with the potential of expanding
the work toward development of a new curriculum track for physics majors.
Astrophysics. Both research and teaching will utilize the unique capabilities of
the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, VERITAS, currently
under construction, to observe very high energy photons from astrophysicsl
objects. The specific program proposed will search for one of the candidates for
the Cold Dark Matter observed in the universe, Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles, or WIMPs. VERITAS has the capability to observe these hypothetical
particles through either their interactions with baryonic matter or through the
secondary products of their self-annihilation. Part of the study will involve
simulations to predict the WIMP densities in the Local Group Galaxies or in the
center of our Galaxy. The Cosmology course will utilize the information and data
from VERITAS, as well as its outreach program.
