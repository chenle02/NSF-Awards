This five year grant provides funds for travel by graduate students and
independent scholars to attend the annual meetings of the History of Science
Society, the Philosophy of Science Association, the Society for History of
Technology and the Society for Social Studies of Science. All four societies
have long prided themselves on their reputation as open organizations, eager to
embrace scholars from many fields of work who share an interest in historical,
philosophical, and social scientific studies of science and technology. This
attitude of openness has also extended to the societies' efforts to involve
junior scholars not only in the meetings as presenters but also in the
governance of the societies and in the honors bestowed by the societies. All
four societies have prizes and awards that specifically target graduate students
and junior scholars and include junior scholars as members of standing
committees. The efforts underscore the commitment of the membership to maintain
the vitality, openness, and inclusiveness of their organizations by passing
valued academic traditions to their younger colleagues. The major obstacle in
implementing these goals is the lack of travel funds to bring student and
independent scholars to meetings. With universities and colleges restricting
travel funs and the job market constricting, the opportunity of the most junior
members, graduate students, and independent scholars of the societies to obtain
necessary funding to attend meetings of the societies also constricts. These
travel grants will go a long way to provide support for participation of these
groups.
