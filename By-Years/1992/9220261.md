The proposed studies address the chemical mechanism of the excitatory serotonin
type-3 receptor as expressed in NIE-115 cells. Two rapid kinetic approaches will
be employed: (1) a cell-flow method, and (2) laser-pulse photolysis of labile
serotonin cage species. Transmembrane channel behavior will be investigated over
wide ranges of time and serotonin concentration. The effects of inhibitors will
be explored. %%% Neurotransmitter receptor-mediated reactions in specific cells
of the nervous system account for the initiation, regulation, and modulation of
signal transmission. These processes are all required for nervous system
function. The studies proposed are aimed at developing a complete kinetic
understanding of the interaction between a ligand (serotonin) and its receptor
in selected cell membranes. Depending on whether serotonin is bound to the
receptor and for how long, the receptor forms transient ion- conducting
transmembrane channels which provide the fundamental signal transmission event.
Careful time-dependence studies are required in order to develop useful models
of signal transmission. Development of such basic information is fundamental to
progress in understanding the nature of nervous system function and integration.
