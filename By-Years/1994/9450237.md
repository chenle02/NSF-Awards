9450237 Gregory Improvement of the decision-making skills of secondary school
students is an important component of the educational reform movement. It is
also a component in the education of workers for the competitive workforce. In a
previously-funded, exploratory grant, modules were developed for a variety of
disciplines in which the content was taught by also emphasizing decision skills.
This project builds upon that base to further develop, test and evaluate
content-specific modules which teach the eight decision skills. Decision skills
are interwoven with subject-based material. Students are placed in the role of
active decision makers, faced with problems confronting scientists: interpreting
conflicting outcomes, understanding sources of uncertainty, knowing when to go
ahead despite a lack of information and when it is necessary to seek out
additional information, distinguishing personal from professional values and
knowing how best to work with a team of colleagues, possessing diverse skills,
all of whom may see the world a little differently. The project is done with
teachers in Eugene, Oregon and other locations. Results to date indicate that
students and teachers find the materials engaging and that the learning of
science becomes more relevant. The materials include discipline-specific modules
which link decision-making skills, serving as an introduction to both the
science and the decision-making and a decision skills handbook and video for
teachers to see how to augment traditional science teaching. ***
