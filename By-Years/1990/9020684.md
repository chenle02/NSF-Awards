The growth of planktonic bacteria is generally assumed to be limited by
depletion of organic carbon substrate. In contrast to this assumption,
experimental work with natural bacterioplankton populations in Colorado lakes
over the past several years show that growth of bacteria in these lakes is
frequently limited by phosphorus. This proposal outlines a plan for testing the
hypothesis that phytoplankton possess greater phosphorus storage capacity than
bacteria, which offsets the kinetic superiority of bacteria under some
conditions. Experiments will document (1) the phosphorus inventory of bacteria
under nutrient-sufficient and nutrient-deficient conditions, (2) the uptake rate
of phosphorus through both inorganic and natural organic phosphorus fractions by
bacteria and by co-occurring phytoplankton assemblages, and (3) the phosphorus
usage of bacteria and phytoplankton components in mixed communities for which
organic phosphorus is the only phosphorus source, or for which inorganic
phosphorus is supplied in a pulse, as might occur through nutrient patchiness in
nature. The combined outcome of these three sets of experiments will demonstrate
the influence of phosphorus storage capacity on the outcome of phosphorus
competition between bacteria and phytoplankton.
