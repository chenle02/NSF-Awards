The PIs plan to (1) complete the November 1993 space weather study, (2) continue
geomagnetic storm analysis using the Assimilative Mapping Ionospheric
Electrodynamics (AMIE), and (2) improve the conductance and field-aligned
current mapping within the AMIE procedure. Completing the 1993 data study will
provide a first in-depth look at ionospheric and magnetospheric response to
forcing by a combination of transient and recurrent phenomena in the solar wind.
Emphasizing four coronal mass ejection events, the PI will continue her support
of the solar-terrestrial community at large. Finally, improving parameters
within the AMIE procedure will provide important information about the physical
ties between the ionosphere and magnetosphere.
