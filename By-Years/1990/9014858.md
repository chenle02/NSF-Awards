This research investigates the relation between the proportion of luminous and
dark matter in galaxies, and the environment of those galaxies. Both optical and
21 cm line spectra will be obtained from galaxies in both relatively dense and
sparse regions of space. In additon to using the rotation curves thus obtained
to study the mass distribution in these objects, the average velocity measured
will be utilized to study peculiar motions of systems of relatively nearby
clusters of galaxies.
