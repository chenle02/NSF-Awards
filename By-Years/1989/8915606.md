Dr. Clemens will study the radial dust distributions and magnetic field
configurations of small Bok globules using a combination of photometric and
polarimetric observations at optical and near- infrared wavelengths. Information
will be deduced about the distribution of mass within these small interstellar
clouds, how magnetic fields either help or hinder the formation of new stars,
and how the magnetic fields reveal the interaction of the Bok globules with
their surroundings. A serious gap in our understanding of the details of the
star formation process involves our knowledge of the physical conditions
existing in molecular clouds just prior to the onset of star formation. We know
neither the basic physical structures of the cores of these molecular clouds
before stars form, nor which physical variables have ordered the cores and will
control their evolution. Dr. Clemens has chosen a sample of small clouds which
are relatively simple structures, uncomplicated by active, multiple, or massive
star formation. He is interested in understanding how these Bok globules and
star formation within them is affected by embedded magnetic fields and large
scale gas motions, such as turbulence and rotation.
