The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to
revolutionize the medical coding process by increasing the efficiency, accuracy,
and explainability of artificially intelligence-driven computer-assisted coding
systems. The innovation has the potential to reduce human effort and errors,
streamline medical claims and billing processes, and integrate information
systems across healthcare providers, payers, and insurance companies. The
increased transparency and trustworthiness of artificially intelligent generated
codes, in turn, would lead to faster processing and resolution of medical bills
and claims with fewer rejections. As a result, healthcare providers will save
costs on providing quality healthcare services with better patient outcomes. The
projectâ€™s broader significance also lies in its applicability to information
systems in other industries that rely on coding and structured information, such
as pharmaceuticals, bio-medical, legal, and accounting.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of an innovative technology
that combines deep learning attention mechanisms with symbolic artificially
intelligent, specifically knowledge graphs, to improve the explainability of
computer-assisted coding models. The approach focuses on providing a deeper
understanding of the relationships between highlighted words and predicted
standard medical codes, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the
medical coding process. By addressing the need for increased transparency in
artificially intelligent-driven medical coding systems, the project aims to
advance the field of artificially intelligent explainability and contribute to
the scientific understanding of the subject. The technology has the potential to
pave the way for future advancements in artificially intelligent-driven coding
systems in various domains and industries reliant on highly structured knowledge
bases.
