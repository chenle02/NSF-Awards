This is a program of research on several topics in combinatorial optimization
with the objective of enhancing understanding of the underlying mathematics of
some combinatorial problems. The importance of the research lies in the fact
that a better understanding of the mathematics associated with these problems
(most of them belonging to the class of nonpolynomial- complete or hard
problems) can be used in the design of algorithms that solve and prove
optimality of medium to large instances that typically arise in real world
applications. The research includes investigation of the properties of 0, 1
matrices, whose associated set packing polytope has integer extreme points, and
the facial structure of some combinatorial polytopes associated with
connectivity and partitioning problems on graphs. The algorithmic issues
associated with the detection of violated constraints for such problems will be
investigated. The problem area of combinatorial optimization is very important,
a breakthrough in this area would be highly leveraged.
