The objective of this investigation is to address software architectural issues
which will facilitate the implementation of advanced finite element technology
for parallel and distributed computational processing systems and to produce a
prototype software system for use in demonstrating and benchmarking the
techniques investigated. The software architecture to be developed will permit
an evaluation of the applicability and feasibility of a variety of concepts
related to finite element methods for solid mechanics analysis which have shown
promise as a result of recent research in engineering, mathematics, and computer
science including: hp-version finite element methods, adaptive meshing using
non- conforming elements, solution of systems of simultaneous partial
differential equations for medium-grained distributed memory parallel processing
systems. A prototype implementation will utilize object-oriented software design
and programming methods and network and parallel computing methods to
demonstrate adaptive hp-version finite element technology for the solution of 3
dimensional linear static elastic problems. Techniques investigated will lead to
the development of new tools capable of solving more challenging non-linear
problems. These tools are important to the nation's ability to design and
produce safe, reliable, and cost-competitive products.
