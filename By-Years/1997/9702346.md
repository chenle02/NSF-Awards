This award supports an integrated multidisciplinary program of education and
research in computer engineering that addresses the real-time computational
requirements of multimedia systems. The approach is based on parallel, fine
grain hybrid analog-digital computing, using adaptation inspired by neuromorphic
engineering to compensate for inaccuracies in the analog implementation.
Research in this program is coordinated with classes, projects, and workshops in
the curriculum of the university. At the graduate level, projects will include
focal-plane arrays, speech classifiers, and A/D converters. At the advanced
undergraduate level, classes include experimental projects on a smaller scale.
