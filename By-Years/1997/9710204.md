9710204 Wight The research project will investigate the seismic response of
exterior frame connections in composite (steel-concrete) structures, with
emphasis on defining a "repairable damage" limit state and investigating the
effectiveness of standard repair methods for composite connections. Currently
such connection subassemblies are being subjected to reversed cyclic loading of
increasing displacement magnitudes, eventually reaching displacement levels
corresponding to approximately 5% interstory drift. This degree of interstory
drift is beyond the "life safety" limit state and approximately at the "collapse
prevention" limit state. Approximately four of the six specimens for repair will
be retested and two additional RCS exterior connections with designs similar to
two of the original specimens will be constructed for retesting. These specimens
will be subjected to reversed cyclic loading to increasing displacements,
stopping the testing at interstory drift level should be below the "life safety"
limit state, but beyond the "immediate occupancy" limit state. Post-test
analytical studies will be used to simulate the measured RCS connection behavior
during both its original and repaired behavior. The degree of stiffness and
strength retention, and amount of energy dissipation capacity at various
interstory drift levels, will be compared between all specimens, with special
emphasis on the comparison of the results for the same connection in its
"original" and "repaired" conditions. Analytical models will be developed for
use in trial designs of RCS frames structures. The analytical modeling and trial
designs will be coordinated with current U.S. research projects on RCS frames at
other U.S. universities and Japanese research institutions. This is a project
supported under the NSF initiative No. 94-154 "Composite and Hybrid Structures".
