Funding is provided for the acquisition of a Laser-Doppler Velocimeter and data
analysis system for the fluid dynamics laboratory in the Department of Physics
and Astronomy at the University of Southern Mississippi (USM). Fluid dynamic
research, will be conducted by undergraduate physics majors amd master level
graduate students and published in international, refereed journals of physics.
This instrumentation will allow the extension of research to projects in
collaboration with faculty in engineering disciplines, and strengthen the
ability of users to obtain outside support for additional research projects.
