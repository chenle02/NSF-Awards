The Rivers Project curriculum seeks to offer students and teachers the
opportunity to engage in an activity based program with real world implications
for the environment. Its goal is to develop a national rivers curriculum that
can cross the boundaries of traditional curricular areas to unite science,
social science and English. The curriculum will propel a student force of "River
Watchers" who will research and monitor rivers in their respective communities.
A set of teaching materials will be developed that will: be applicable to any
river; include chemistry, biology, and geology/geography units; be
interdisciplinary and incorporate English and social science elements into each
set of materials; focus on teaching data collection and interpretation; and use
a computer telecommunication network to transmit and evaluate river data and
writings. This curriculum development project will be a cooperative venture with
state and national agencies, as well as business and industry. The data that
will be collected can be used to solve problems and can contribute to
scientific, historical, and data bases. When a Rivers Project school collects
data, local state, and federal agencies will be able to access and assess the
information. Teachers and students will, in turn, devise and conduct workshops
for fellow River Watcher interns, creating a network of interested, involved and
learning educators and young scientists whose ultimate goal will be to work for
safe, clean rivers. Although the outcomes of the program target improved student
understandings of river-related science concepts and facts, the major thrust
will be to communicate a clearer view of the nature and processes of science and
to actively involve students in the development of environmentally responsible
behaviors.
