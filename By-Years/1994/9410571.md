9410571 Simon The research proposed in this application is the study of
poroelastic models based on experimental data. The arterial wall is viewed as a
deformable structure of solid components that is saturated by a mobile tissue
fluid and contains mobile species. A finite strain porohyperelastic model will
include history- dependent finite deformation, stress, and transural tissue
fluid flow. Finite strain isotropic and anisotropic porohyperelastic
constitutive laws will be developed based on a hyperelastic strain energy
density function and strain dependent permeability that will be quantified using
experimental data for aortic tissue. A two layer model will be developed to
quantify the hydraulic resistivity and transport properties of the arterial
intima and media. Finite element models based on the nonlinear porohyperelastic
theory and initial linear poroelastic transport theory will be developed in
order to accurately represent the complex structure and fluid-molecular
transport in the arterial wall. The research will provide the quantitative
methodology necessary for a better understanding of the physiology and mechanics
of the normal arterial wall as well as for consideration of abnormal states and
arterial diseases such as atherosclerosis. ***
