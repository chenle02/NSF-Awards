IEEE GLOBECOM is one of the two flagship conferences of the IEEE Communications
Society (ComSoc), together with IEEE International Conference on Communications
(ICC). IEEE GLOBECOM 2023 will take place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on December
4-8, 2023. This project funds undergraduate or graduate students from US
universities to attend IEEE GLOBECOM. Attending such a high-caliber technical
venue is extremely valuable for students. Not only will they be exposed to the
state-of-the-art research areas, but they also can have the opportunity to
interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers
from both industry and academia, and take part in discussions that may shape the
future of the field. For graduating senior students to be on the job market,
attending the conference may significantly benefit their career development.
Applications are invited from qualified full-time US-based graduate and
undergraduate students. Women and underrepresented groups will be encouraged to
apply for this travel grant, in order to promote participation in Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.

The requested support will cover 16 students, leading to a total of $20,000.
Applications are invited from qualified full-time US-based engineering graduate
and undergraduate students. Women and other underrepresented groups in STEM,
beginning graduate students, and first time IEEE GLOBECOM student attendees will
be especially encouraged to apply for this travel grant.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
