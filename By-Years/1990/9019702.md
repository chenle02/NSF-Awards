Until now species concept in lichens has necessarily been based solely upon
morphology and secondary-product chemistry. No parent/progeny information for
the lichens existed prior to our recent demonstration of reproductive isolation
and gene flow. Using the methodology developed in that study, we are examining
five chemotypes of the Ramalina siliquosa complex that are starkly zoned in
bands on seashore cliffs in western Europe. This group epitomizes a form of
variation widespread among the lichens: Chemical races with little or no
morphological differentiation have different ecologies where their geographic
ranges overlap. Are such chemotypes sibling species or polymorphisms within
morphological species? Since hybridization cannot yet be tested in lichen by
artificial crossing, we are culturing the progeny of different chemotypes that
grew side by side where zones overlap. If chemotypes are conspecific and freely
interbreed, then the progeny of these haploid organisms will often match a
chemotype different from the maternal one. The results of this study will offer
a guide to the interpretation of many hundreds of similar chemotypes of lichens
already will documented. Additionally, the methodologies developed here will
make possible a new dimension of experimental research in the systematics of the
lichen-forming fungi.
