The use of two dimensional finite element electromagnetic models to simulate the
electrical characteristic of both scattering and guided wave structures has
become commonplace due to the development of powerful and cheap computers.
Unfortunately, many geometries cannot be accurately modeled in two dimensions.
The step from two the three dimensions is both computationally expensive and
analytically complex. A traditional finite element formulation results in
spurious solutions in three dimensions. In addition, the vector nature of the
fields makes the task of grid truncation very difficult. The "bymoment" method
has shown itself to be an efficient technique for grid truncation in a two
dimensional finite element solution. It is believed that many of its advantages
can be translated to three dimensions. In this project the "bymoment" method
will be extended to solve the problem of electromagnetic scattering from three
dimensional complex objects. The development of such a technique will provide
solutions for many problems which are currently solved by approximate
techniques. In addition, the development of a three dimensional scheme can lead
to applications for guided wave structures.
