Since computer-based methods such as molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics,
Monte Carlo techniques, computational reaction dynamics and computational
quantum mechanics continue to grow in popularity among researchers both in
academia and industry, it is becoming more important to introduce these methods,
both in concept and in practice, at the undergraduate level. Acquisition of two
high-speed computer workstations is permitting an adjustment to the upper-
division chemistry curriculum so as to include introductions to these methods
for all chemistry majors. This project enhances the undergraduate chemistry
experience through (1) modification of existing courses, (2) development of a
suite of interconnected and computationally oriented independent study course
options, and (3) computational support for undergraduate research opportunities.
Implementation of this project is raising the appreciation of all chemistry
majors for the range of computational methods applicable to chemical problems.
Curricular enhancements developed in the course the project will be communicated
to the chemical education community through presentations at appropriate
meetings and publications. *
