This project aims to analyze imperative, object-oriented programs for type
signature information, which can help automate several programming tasks that
are currently performed manually. Type signatures summarize the behavior of a
program's methods, functions, or procedures; while such information has been
used to advantage in the functional programming language community, little has
been done to investigate how popular, object-oriented languages could benefit
from use of type signatures. The research will improve the quality and
efficiency of software navigation and reuse; software testing and demonstration;
and construction of graphical and non-graphical user interfaces. Novel aspects
include use of data flow analysis to refine and improve the precision of type
signatures extracted from imperative languages and analysis of method call-
sequences that accomplish or approximate a given type signature.
