At this time it is known that there are many propositions of mathematics
independent of the ordinary axioms of Zermelo-Frankel set theory. Foremost among
these is the continuum hypothesis. This has led investigators to pose stronger
axioms, known as large cardinal axioms to try to settle these problems.
Professor Foreman plans to investigate the relationship of strong axioms of set
theory to the continuum hypothesis. In particular he conjectures that ordinary
large cardinal axioms should imply that there are no definable or constructable
counterexamples to the continuum hypothesis. He has proven substantial partial
results in this direction and plans to continue work on this conjecture. Such
investigations reach to the most basic foundations of mathematics, clarifying
our understanding of the infinite.
