The project enables low-income students, who meet established academic criteria,
to obtain Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degrees in the biological
sciences, physical sciences, mathematical sciences, computer and information
sciences, geosciences, engineering, and technology areas associated with the
preceding science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. These
students will then transfer to an upper-division school or enter the workforce
directly in their chosen field. For each term, a minimum of 27 academically
promising students are provided with scholarships and a wide range of specially-
designed enrichment activities to ensure their success.
