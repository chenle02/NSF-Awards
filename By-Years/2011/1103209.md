This project seeks to better understand, generally, the extent to which proxies
can be used to infer signatures of past climate variability and, specifically,
how well proxies do with mid-Holocene precipitation variation over the tropical
South America/Atlantic region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on
three activities: (i) quantifying changes in the spatial distribution of
precipitation between mid-Holocene and preindustrial conditions; (ii)
identifying the principal drivers of South America/Atlantic region hydroclimatic
variability in the mid-Holocene as simulated by models; and (iii) examining the
causal agents and feedback processes responsible for the signatures of mid-
Holocene precipitation change and evaluate why the ensemble of current
generation paleoclimate models often diverge substantially at the scales
required to interpret paleoclimate proxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate
students and a postdoctoral researcher will be supported. Output from the
paleoclimate model simulations will be made accessible and incorporated into
undergraduate and graduate classes.
