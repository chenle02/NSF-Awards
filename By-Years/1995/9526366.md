9526366 Weingarten As part of its new architecture for NSFNET, NSF is funding
the creation of a very High Speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS). A major role
envisioned for the vBNS is to serve as a platform for research on very high
speed networking and networking applications. Now that the vBNS project is
underway, it is time for the research community and those responsible for the
vBNS to begin a closer dialog on what research can and will be done on the vBNS
and how the researchers will gain access to the infrastructure. The Computing
Research Association will sponsor a workshop to start that dialog. Approximately
thirty researchers in networking and applications, from academia and industry,
will meet in Washington DC on June 22 and 23, 1995. together with government
agency officials and vBNS designers and operators, they will discuss the current
and likely future research agendas in high speed networking and the implications
of those agendas for the vBNS as an experimental environment.
