*** 9508744 KAUFFMAN In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program, John Kauffman of the University of Missouri, Columbia will use
subpicosecond spectroscopic techniques to measure the Rotational Correlation
Times of anthracene and stilbene probe molecules in a variety of pure and mixed
supercritical fluids (SCF), including carbon dioxide, ethane, and carbon
dioxide-ethanol mixtures. These investigations will provide valuable information
concerning the solvation characteristics of the fluids. A second series of
experiments will use an anthracene-dimethylaniline exciplex as a model system
for reaction studies in supercritical fluids. Information from these studies
will be used to test current theories of SCF solvation and clustering, determine
the effects of solvent density, viscosity, polarity and inhomogeneities on
solvation, and provide insight on the chemical reactivities in supercritical
fluids. Supercritical Fluid carbon dioxide has tremendous potential as an
environmentally benign solvent in which to perform chemical processes such as
extractions and synthesis. In order to make use of this potential, a microscopic
understanding of the solvent environment around a solute molecule and the
influence of this solvation on chemical reactivities. Professor Kauffman's
research will provide detailed information on both these topics and will test
current theoretical models of supercritical fluid solvation. ***
