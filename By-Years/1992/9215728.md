The goal of the project is to develop a micro-constructive manufacturing
process that will allow a designer to specify parts of any geometry, any surface
texture, any material, local material composition and local microstructure. Such
a facbriation process would enable the manufacture of parts and assemblies that
can not be made by using existing processes. The project will build on the
success of the three dimensional (3D) printing concept, which builds up parts in
layers, from powders using ink-jet printing technology. A particular feature of
the work is the detailed understanding of the underlying physical behavior of
the powder and liquid phases during the 3D printing process, with the goal of
controlling the process sufficiently to give the desired level of flexibility.
The process will also be used to fabricate a number of demonstration parts, with
targeted applications, that can not be fabricated by any other means. These
prototypes may form the basis for the development of advanced tooling systems
for injection molding, thermoforming and die casting which have integrated
cooling passages, thermal isolation structures and engineered surface textures
and composite elements. ***
