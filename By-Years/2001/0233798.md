The objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to
determine whether a general theory of validation of engineering models can be
created. Much of engineering design is based on the validity of the design of an
artifact. Indeed, this faith in the validity of a model extends even to national
policy when tests - such as conducting nuclear explosions - are replaced by
studying consequences coming from models. But, do the models do what they
predict?
