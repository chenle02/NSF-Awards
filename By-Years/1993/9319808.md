9319808 Pindyck This project consists of two parts. The purpose of the first is
to extend the investigator's recent work on irreversible investment decisions
under uncertainty. The second part involves applying the ideas and methods
developed in the first part to the analysis and design of environmental policy
in the presence of irreversibilities. Models will be developed that combine both
economic uncertainty and ecological uncertainty with two kinds of
irreversibilities that are often inherent in the adoption of an environmental
policy. The first kind of irreversibility is the sunk cost to society resulting
from the environmental regulations themselves. The second is the sunk benefit in
the form of avoided environmental degradation that also results from the
regulations. The goal of this activity is to apply the models to the analysis of
policies directed at the problem of global warming. ***
