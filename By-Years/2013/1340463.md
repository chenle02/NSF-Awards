This engineering education research initiation grant involves a comprehensive
study to understand how students? experiences at an academic institution affect
students? interest in pursuing a degree in engineering. The study aims to
understand the role of classroom and out of classroom experiences in influencing
students? persistence in engineering. The project will generate new knowledge on
activities and experiences that promote retention and those that promote non-
persistence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of
this project is that it will help to identify events and experiences that
promote students? persistence in engineering. By understanding the role of the
environment in persistence, engineering programs can devise better interventions
to deal with the problem of attrition. This project overlaps with NSF's
strategic goals of educating and preparing a diverse, world class STEM
workforce.
