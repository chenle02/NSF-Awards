This research involves work in four areas of probability and statistics, the
bootstrap, large deviations, random fractals, and empirical processes indexed by
sets. Research in the bootstrap area will involve investigation of the large
sample properties of a general weighted bootstrap, which includes the
nonparametric and Bayesian bootstraps as special cases. The research in large
deviations will be centered around a notion of extended functional large
deviations for partial sums. Random fractals will be studied in empirical
increments of various random processes. The behavior of tail empirical processes
indexed by sets will be studied with an eye towards applications, the most
prominent being in establishing the consistency and asymptotic distribution of
various multivariate density and mode estimators. Probability theory provides a
basis for research in statistics. This research will include both the
development of new results in probability, as well as their application to
statistical theory.
