With the ever growing demand for ubiquitous connectivity and data access, there
is a driving need to deploy ever more extensive and higher capacity network
infrastructure---wired and wireless. With such increases in network density, the
propagation environments become increasingly challenging, and new communication
techniques, architectures, and protocols are needed to meet these critical
challenges. Examples include intersymbol (or self-), inter-channel, intra-
network, and extra-network interference. Over the years, the error-control
coding community has developed a wide range of codes for efficiently mitigating
the effects of noise in communication systems. Ultimately, the goal of this
research can be viewed as developing a signaling architecture that efficiently
and effectively transforms interference into standard, more benign noise from
the perspective of the underlying code.

To approach these challenges, this research develops the role of super-Nyquist
signaling formats in modern coded digital communication systems. In traditional
systems, the symbol rate is chosen to match the channel bandwidth. With this
classical approach, the transmit pulses can be designed to be orthogonal,
corresponding to signaling on independent degrees of freedom. However, in
systems with super-Nyquist signaling, the symbol rate is chosen to be
significantly higher than the channel bandwidth, resulting in a transmission
with self-interference, whose effects can be compensated through the use of
appropriate equalization. The investigation develops the role of super-Nyquist
coding in a range of network scenarios, starting from simple point-to-point
intersymbol-interference channel models, and progressing to richer multi-
input/multi-output, multiple-access, and interference channel models. The
research emphasizes the special role that such signaling plays in joint design
of the physical and link layers in the protocol stack. Dual problems in source
coding are also explored.
