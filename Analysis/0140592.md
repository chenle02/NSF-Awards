Abstract

Professor Simon will continue his research focusing on direct and inverse
spectral problems for Schrodinger operators and their discrete analogs. He plans
to explore the impact of sum rules for spectral theory both for Jacobi matrices
(where he and Killip recently solved several long open conjectures from the
Orthogonal Polynomial community using sum rules) and Schrodinger operators.
Other problems he expects to look at include the structure of the isospectral
manifold for problems with discrete spectrum, resonance counting in higher
dimensions, and the study of mixed singular continuous and point spectrum.

A fundamental problem in wide swaths of science is determining the relation
between some object that can only be observed indirectly and the information you
can observe indirectly. There are two sides of issue: determine what is
indirectly observed for a given state of the system, called the direct problem,
and trying to induce properties of the system from the indirect observations,
called the inverse problem. Professor Simon will study various aspects of direct
and inverse problems in quantum mechanics. While the focus will be on the
equations of quantum theory, there are potential spinoffs to tomography and
radar/sonar direct and inverse problems.
