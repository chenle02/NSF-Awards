This is a multi-university project to establish a coordinated research program
on the effective design and use of computers in physics instruction. The project
has three major components: (1) Extension and refinement of an instructional
theory grounded in the view that the development of validated mathematical
models for physical phenomena is the main activity of physics. (2) Application
of the theory to the design of a versatile Modeling Workstation for computer-
based instruction. (3) Development of techniques for using computers to enhance
instruction in large classes and integrate this with laboratory instruction. The
workstation will be equally applicable to classroom and laboratory instruction
as well as to independent use by individual students.
