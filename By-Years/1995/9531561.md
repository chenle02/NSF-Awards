9531561 Maki This REU site award will provide ten undergraduate mathematics
majors, recruited nationwide, with a research topic and a research environment
which is as close to that of a working mathematician as is possible, given the
student s background. Each student will work with a single faculty member.
Sample topics are: Root Systems and Weyl Groups, Modeling Uncertainty in
Economics, Topology of Planar Linkages, Logic with Diagrams, and Speech
Recognition by Computers. The students will meet privately with their faculty
advisors two to three times a week. Throughout the eight weeks the students will
give frequent progress reports to the group. One of the most important aspects
of the program is the interaction among the students themselves. For some this
will be their first opportunity to get to know other students of comparable
mathematical interest and ability. This interaction will be encouraged in a
number of ways. The students will be living together in a single dormitory and
eating in the same cafeteria. There will be a room in the Mathematics Department
in which students can gather to work. During the last week the students will
give lectures on the work they have done. They will also prepare written reports
on their work. These will be collected into a single bound volume.
