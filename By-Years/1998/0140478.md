With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor Josef Michl, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Colorado- Boulder, will work on three projects in the area of his traditional
interest, photophysics and photochemistry. One of the projects is a continuation
of a current effort to understand heavy atom effects, while two are new. In one
of the latter, it is proposed to take a fresh angle of attack on the venerable
problem of the molecular structure responsible for anomalous ("TICT") emission
from donor-acceptor compounds, and test the proposal that a twisted biradicaloid
excited state is responsible. In the other, it is proposed to separate and
evaluate the electronic spectral properties of individual conformers of
saturated linear chains in a complex conformer mixture. In addition, a fourth
project is proposed in a research subject that is relatively new to this
research group. This is a broad effort in the areas opened by the recent
synthesis of carborane anions and radicals of the type CB11(CH3)12-,
CB11(CH3)12., CB11(CF3)12-, etc., in the PI's laboratory, and the proposed
synthesis of the still unknown CB11(CF3)12.. In the previous grant period, these
compounds were shown to offer new avenues of access to inorganic and
organometallic reactive intermediates, and their lithium salts catalyze several
kinds of organic reactions. It is now proposed to explore the applicability of
these new tools in wide areas of organic and inorganic chemistry. These
fundamental studies of the synthesis and properties of reactive intermediates
may have applications in lithium batteries, fuel cell membranes, and catalysts
for olefin polymerization.
