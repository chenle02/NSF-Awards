The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Compact High
Performance Cooling Technologies will address research and development needs of
industries in the area of high-performance heat removal from compact spaces. All
product sectors in the electronics industry (High-Performance, Cost/Performance,
Telecommunications, Hand-held, Automotive, and Military/Avionics) face critical
electronics cooling challenges, and the Center brings together faculty from the
Schools of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering and
Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue University, and contribute complimentary
competencies in heart transfer, microfluidics, microfabrication, refrigeration,
computational techniques, mechatronics, controls, acoustics, sensing and
actuation and diagnostics and measurements.
