Structural safety evaluation is becoming a new area of interest because of the
aging of structures of all types. One method which holds promise is that of
System Identification, which is an emerging analytical approach. The
participation of American engineers in an International Workshop on Structural
Safety Evaluation based on System Identification Approaches is being supported
as very beneficial to the United States.
