9316831 Williams The PI and his collaborators have used a multi-faceted
approach, combining field observations with sophisticated chemical analysis and
laboratory modeling, to examine emplacement histories of silicic lava flows and
domes. In the proposed ABR, they will continue this line of research. A key
objective of their studies is assessment of the hazard associated with explosive
volcanic eruptions.
