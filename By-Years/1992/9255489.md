The capabilities of inexpensive computer systems have greatly increased
theimportance of computer graphics and its applications, such as visualization
and multimedia. This project will support two undergraduate faculty workshops on
Computer Graphics focusing on advanced techniques for image synthesis with the
objectives of helping faculty to upgrade their current computer graphics courses
and producing curriculum materials which they can use in their own courses.***//
