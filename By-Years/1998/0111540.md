The Electronic Field Guide Project will provide a web-accessible, distributed
object-oriented database for the identification of biological specimens and also
electronic methods to record field observations. The system uses Personal
Digital Assistants (PDAs), either alone or in conjunction with GPS units. The
data management and software technologies are extensible and can be used by
other developers for new applications or to add value. The user interface is
designed for communicating with humans, but the rest of the software is machine-
based. The components will enable users to discover and integrate biodiversity
data anywhere on the internet, convey information about quality of the data, and
deal with data that may be sensitive. Using XML, the components provide access
to a wide variety of biological collection data sources, as well as to much
government and museum data sources. Three communities of user partners are
involved in the development and testing, including field biologists, naturalist
educators, and community science projects.
