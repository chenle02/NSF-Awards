This award supports participation in the "Workshop on the Geometry and Analysis
of Fluid Flows" hosted at Stony Brook University during the week of January
16-20, 2023. The fundamental equations of fluid mechanics describe many natural
phenomena, including the motion of air in weather modeling, the lift of an
airplane, mixing of fluids with applications in industry, flow of liquids
through pipes, generation of electricity through wind and water, and the flow of
blood through the body. The full equations are too difficult to solve explicitly
or even by computer, hence mathematical attention focuses on properties of the
equations. Such properties include whether solutions for given initial
conditions exist for a long time or break down in finite time; whether solutions
are stable and can be predicted with small errors, or fundamentally unstable and
unpredictable; and the validity of simplifying approximations used to make the
equations more manageable. These questions are difficult and longstanding. For
instance, the question of long-time existence for the idealized three-
dimensional fluid equations has remained open for well over a century. Both
analysis and geometry have been used to study such questions, and the primary
goal of this conference is to bring together senior and junior researchers with
expertise in these two areas to share perspectives, techniques, and results, and
to train the new generation of mathematicians.

The workshop will feature a mathematically diverse group of speakers whose
expertise spans multiple relevant areas. Topics to be discussed at the workshop
include free boundary problems in fluid dynamics, the geometry of infinite-
dimensional groups, singular limits in fluid flows, well-posedness and
regularity of fluid equations, and differential geometric methods in mathematics
and physics. Some of the talks will focus on issues of global existence for the
three-dimensional Euler and Navier-Stokes equations; the limiting behavior as
viscosity, compressibility, or surface tension approaches zero; the infinite-
dimensional geometry describing fluid flows as geodesics; and well-posedness
results for free boundary problems. The organizers are currently writing a
textbook on geometric and analytic methods in fluid mechanics; a draft of this
book will be distributed during the workshop for the benefit of participants.
