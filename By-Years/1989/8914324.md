The development of molecular dynamics techniques and their application to
proteins has created demands for computing time that are demonstrably not being
met by presently available resources. Highly parallel computers offer an
opportunity to satisfy this need economically, but so far this potential has not
been realized. This work will develop software modifications for doing molecular
dynamics of peptides and proteins, optionally in solution, and specifically with
options for computing free energy differences. This development shall take place
on a 24-node parallel computer, the newly announced "Chemputer", a parallel
machine with hypercube architecture. The machine will be delivered with
efficient software for molecular dynamics. The plan is to adapt this software to
perform the most "modern" calculations. These extensions will be made generally
available.
