This project will lay the foundations for solving large multi-scale multi-
physics engineering problems using new computational frameworks on the next
decade's exascale computers. These frameworks will anticipate trends in proposed
future computer hardware by being adaptive, asynchronous, fault-tolerant, and
energy-aware and will address the possible billion-way parallelism of exascale
systems by both generating efficient specific code through a domain specific
language (DSL) and by efficiently scheduling that code through an Exascale Run
Time System, ERTS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's prototype computational
framework will use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to generate code in the DSL
that is specialized for multicore nodes and/or accelerators and it will also use
DAGS at the runtime system level in the ERTS. At a nodal multicore or
accelerator level the DSL will be a declarative, high-level, type-safe domain-
specific language for multi-scale, multi-physics simulations that will improve
productivity by automating the writing of optimized code that is executed by the
ERTS. In order to ensure that these activities produce relevant solutions for
important engineering applications with high impact such as, for example, the
design of new batteries and fuel cells or clean coal boilers, the project will
employ a multi-disciplinary approach that couples computer science advances to
the solution of such meaningful engineering problems.
