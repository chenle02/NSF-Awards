This award is for the development of an interdisciplinary curriculum for
undergraduate students in computer science, the natural sciences and
engineering. The curriculum will focus on massively parallel computing and will
use Boston University's 64-node CM-5. The courses will be project- oriented
emphasizing direct experience with computational problem-solving in the sciences
and with programming in a massively parallel environement. This award is for the
development of an interdisciplinary curriculum for undergraduate students in
computer science, the natural sciences and engineering. The six project oriented
courses that are proposed: one in fundamental methods and five in advanced
computational topics, will emphasize direct experience with computational
problem- solving in the sciences and with programming in a massively parallel
environment. The results of the curriculum and materials development will be
disseminated through summer workshops, publications, and presentations at
professional meetings.
