Recombinant DNA technology involves professionals from widely different
backgrounds. These professionals consist of molecular biologists, biochemists,
cell biologists, and other scientists who concern themselves with cloning,
culturing, and modifications of the genome of a cell, and engineers who are
concerned with bioprocessing, scale-up, large-scale facility design, and
manufacturing. Each group uses specific tools, terminology and jargon. Rapid
developments and the potential for commercialization of the technology demand
that both of these groups appreciate each others concerns and contributions.
This conference will provide a forum for vigorous and extensive exchange of
ideas between different groups of professionals. The make-up of the session
topics (ranging from molecular aspects to applied and technical issues),
discussion groups, and their order will ensure discussions between scientists
and engineers.
