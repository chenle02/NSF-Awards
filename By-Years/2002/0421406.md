This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will enable the
University of Southern Mississippi to purchase a transmission electron
microscope (TEM). The TEM will be configured with a bright CCD camera that is
visible in ambient lighting, allowing training for a full class of students,
rather than 1-2 at a time in a darkened room. The dynamic range linearity, and
the sensitivity of the CCD surpass photographic film. The instrument will serve
the Department of Polymer Science, NSF Materials Research Science and
Engineering Center (MRSEC), International Coatings and Formulations Institute,
NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Coatings, Mississippi
Polymer Institute, and Polymer Science Learning Center. The microscope can be
controlled remotely on a network and the image can be simultaneously broadcast
to numerous sites on the LAN. This will enhance the training and research of a
large number of undergraduate students who conduct summer research at USM via
the NSF REU and/or in-house summer programs. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award
