The biosynthesis of enzyme metallocenters is very poorly understand. This
proposal is aimed at understanding the general mechanism for incorporation of
the metal into the protein matrix using urease as a model. Urease, synthesized
as an apo-enzyme, requires an accessory factor for the formation of its novel,
bi- nickel active site. The nature of the accessory factor is unknown; however,
two newly identified genes appear to play a role in this process. Mutants of
these genes will be generated and the effects of the mutations on the apo-
protein will be determined. The accessory protein (s) will be isolated and
characterized for cellular location, Ni binding and interaction with apo-urease.
The research will increase our understanding of how metalloproteins are formed,
and our understanding of the biochemistry of nickel in living systems.
