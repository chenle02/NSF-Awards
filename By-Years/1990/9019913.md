Description: Under this project support is provided to ten U.S. scientists to
participate in an Indo-U.S. Workshop and Seminar on Zeolite Heterogeneous
Catalysis, planned for February 10-13, 1991 in Baroda, India. The focus of the
meeting will be on various aspects of zeolite catalysis, including zeolite
synthesis, characterization, adsorptive properties, and diffusion phenomena in
zeolites. Approximately 12 Indian scientists will participate and discuss recent
research results with the U.S. participants. Formal presentations will be
supplemented with time for informal discussions. Areas for research will be
identified where new initiatives may be jointly made. A report of the meeting
will be distributed to members of the Catalysis Society in the U.S. and Canada
and to the members of the Catalysis Society of India. Scope: The proposed
workshop is organized in India by Dr. T.S.R. Prasada Rao, Secretary of the
Catalysis Society of India, with support from the president of the society, Dr.
S.K. Patil of the Department of Chemistry at the Indian Institute of Technology
in Madras. The topic is of fundamental scientific importance and has significant
practical applications in the U.S. and India. The workshop is likely to enhance
U.S.-India scientific collaboration.
