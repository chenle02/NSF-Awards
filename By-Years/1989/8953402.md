The project provides training and materials for teachers K-12 to develop skills
and classroom materials including robot constructions, electronic assembly,
computer operations, applied mathematics and engineering design activities. The
hardware and software developed will be designed for classroom use and, through
at least one private partner, has the potential to be marketed nationally. The
program will be implemented as follows: 1. Museum staff will develop materials
and conduct workshops for elementary teachers during the school year. 2. Summer
workshops will be held for secondary teachers. 3. The teachers will be required
to use and evaluate and report on the use of the materials in their classrooms.
4. The museum will provide museum based activities for the general public
visitors. 5. The museum will maintain a center where teachers may send kits for
repair and replacement of parts. Cost sharing will equal 35% of amount requested
from National Science Foundation.
