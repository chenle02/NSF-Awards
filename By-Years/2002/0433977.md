A major limitation of current proteomics approaches is the reliance on
annotations that allow one to accurately determine the location of genes. This
labor-intensive process has severely lagged behind the acquisition of sequencing
data, and consequently, annotations exist for only a few organisms. In this SGER
project, a novel, annotation-independent technique will be used for the rapid
identification of genetic loci. The technique, known as Genome Fingerprint
Scanning (GFS) uses a database of peptide-mass fingerprints to identify genes in
an uninterpreted genomic sequence. The project will use the ciliate Tetrahymena
thermophila as a model for developing GFS as an annotation-independent method
for protein identification from databases of large genomes. The project will
develop a web-based server that will enable researchers to match mass
spectrometry data directly to the genome.
