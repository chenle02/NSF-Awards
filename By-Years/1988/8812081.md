The role of calcium ions as a second messenger in the control of flagellar beat
will be examined. The major objective of the proposed experiments is to
identify, using biochemical procedures, calcium- binding proteins in the
flagellar axoneme that may be involved in controlling the shape of flagellar
bends. Biochemical fractionation of axonemes isolated from Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii will be carried out to determine the sub-axonemal distribution of
calmodulin (CaM), which has been implicated in the control of flagellar beat.
The distribution of CaM-binding proteins in the axoneme will be monitored by gel
overlay procedures using 125-I-CaM or biotinylated CaM and avidin-peroxidase.
Outer doublet microtubules will be prepared from axonemes to determine whether
these structures contain CaM, CaM-binding proteins, or other calcium binding
proteins of interest. Finally, polyclonal antisera directed against a specific
CaM-binding protein will be prepared and used in immunolabelling studies to
examine the distribution of this "candidate" protein wthin the axoneme and the
outer doublet microtubules. These studies should clarify the mechanisms by which
calcium alters flagellar waveform by identifying key calcium-binding proteins
that may control flagellar shape, as well as generally broaden our understanding
of processes that involve calcium as a second messenger.
