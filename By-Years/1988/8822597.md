This award supports approximately twelve U.S. mathematicians to participate in
an international workshop on differential equations and their applications to be
held in June, 1989, near Graz, Austria. The workshop was co-organized by
Professors Jerome A. Goldstein of Tulane University and Franz Kappel and Wilhelm
Schappacher of the Institute for Mathematics of the University of Graz. The main
topics of the meeting are new directions and trends in the theory of
differential equations, and applications in biology, physics and engineering.
Approximately 40 mathematicians will participate, primarily from the U.S. and
Austria but also from several other European countries. Presentations will
include new research results and methods as well as concrete applications.
Differential equations form one of the most rapidly developing areas in
mathematical science. This is due mainly to the manifold applications of the
theory to other disciplines, including biology, physics, chemistry, engineering,
epidemiology, etc. This workshop should facilitate communication and foster
collaboration between U.S. and European mathematicians working in this general
area.
