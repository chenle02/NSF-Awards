Under this award, Dr. P. Frank Winkler (Middlebury College) will carry out a
program of research with the overarching theme of increasing our understanding
of how supernovae explode, how their prodigious energy release affects their
host galaxies, and how they contribute to the chemical evolution of the
Universe. For core-collapse supernovae, both models and observations indicate
that the explosions are not spherically symmetric. New measurements of proper
motions and Doppler velocities in the young Galactic remnants Puppis A and
G292.0+1.8 will provide three-dimensional models for asymmetries in the
surviving ejecta fragments. Furthermore, chemical abundances inferred from
spectra can tie present filaments to their origin in specific core layers of the
progenitor stars. The expansion of young Type Ia supernova remnants, including
Tycho (SN 1572) and RCW86 (SN 185), will be measured through proper motions of
Balmer filaments that delineate their shells. These will then be combined with
spectroscopic determination of the shock velocity to obtain reliable distances
for the first time.

The Magellanic Cloud Emission-Line Survey (MCELS) surveyed both the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds, our nearest neighbor galaxies, from the 0.6-meter
Schmidt telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. An important goal
early in the project will be to bring to publication MCELS-based catalogs of
planetary nebulae and supernovae remnants (SNRs), including the first
comprehensive flux measurements. All the MCELS image data will be made easily
available on-line. A final legacy project will be compilation of an Emission-
Line Atlas of Galactic SNRs, based on CCD images in lines of hydrogen, oxygen,
and sulfur, the first such images to be published in most cases.
