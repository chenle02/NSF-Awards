This project consists of excavation of a residential structure associated with a
burial/cremation pit feature, well-dated to 10,000 RCYBP (~11,500 calendar years
ago) found by our team last summer at Upward Sun River (Xaasaa Na?) (49XBD-298),
a multi-component site in the Tanana Basin, central Alaska. The feature is in
buried contexts, over 1 meter below surface, in deposits relatively undisturbed
by cryoturbation. After consultation with federal, state, and Native officials
(stipulated in the Section 106 MOA), all parties agreed to excavation of the
feature. Four additional features (to the burial/cremation pit) have been
observed to date, and all appear to be outdoor unlined firepits. This proposed
excavation is designed to excavate the residential structure, and collect
additional geoarchaeological samples to increase our knowledge of site
formation, post-depositional disturbance, technology, and subsistence, as well
as to specifically evaluate the child cremation to the rest of the structure. At
present, no burials have been found in Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene contexts
in Eastern Beringia, so our knowledge of an entire suite of mortuary-related
behaviors is essentially unknown. This excavation has the potential to
contribute transformative data to our understanding of this time period in the
Western Hemisphere.
