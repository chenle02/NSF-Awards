9623598 Clark Disequilibrium of dynamics of boreal permafrost peatlands during
transience to a warmer climate. Global general circulation models suggest that
the greatest future temperature increases of 4-8 C will occur in boreal and
tundra biomes. An understanding of the future dynamics of these systems is
important in determining their role as negative or positive feedbacks to the
global carbon cycle, especially in peatlands containing permafrost which may
undergo dramatic change with climate warming. Permafrost peatlands are a
potential example of systems that do not respond in equilibrium with climate.
The PIs suggest that both local and regional factors influence the dynamics of
boreal permafrost peatland systems and that the transient dynamics of these
landscapes will not correspond to climatic warming in an equilibrial fashion due
to local constraints serving as negative feedbacks to change. The goal of this
study is to identify the relative contributions of regional climatic versus
local autogenic processes to the successional dynamics in permafrost peatland
landscapes. With this information, spatial cellular automata models will be
developed to test the degree of landscape disequilibrium with climate by
sequentially adding local feedback responses. The peat accumulation potential of
permafrost peatlands versus melted peatlands will be measured to determine
carbon source-sink shifts as landscapes change.
