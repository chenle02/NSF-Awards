Baker's yeast is an important organism for producing ethanol and complex
bioproducts, but it can use only a limited number of carbon sources. A variety
of renewable and/or cheap carbon sources are currently available. Expanding the
capacity of baker's yeast to use these sources to produce bioproducts would be
beneficial. The investigators will attempt to discover the mechanisms that
control carbon utilization in yeast. Design principles will then be developed to
help expand the range of carbon sources that can be used. This will expand the
production of renewable fuels and chemicals. Graduate and undergraduate students
will participate in this research. They will also be engaged in community
outreach efforts to enhance the visibility of the work to the larger community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-native substrates represent a significant fraction of
renewable and inexpensive feedstocks. Little work has been done to explore the
benefits of integrating cellular regulatory control over heterologous
assimilation pathways. Therefore, goal of this work is to 1) demonstrate that
cellular decision-making when used to couple growth-related processes with non-
native substrate assimilation has significant benefits in generating strains of
baker?s yeast that can rapidly grow on any number of structurally diverse
substrates, and 2) that these insights can be leveraged to develop a universal
platform to engineer and optimize growth on non-native substrates. The platform
developed here will also enable functional genomics studies to identify
modulators of non-native substrate metabolism in a manner not possible in the
past. It is anticipated that the outcomes from the project will extend beyond
baker's yeast and the substrates that are the focus of this project since the
paradigm developed here is expected to aid similar efforts with other
industrially relevant microbes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
