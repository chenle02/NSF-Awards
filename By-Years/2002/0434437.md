Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Separations Research
Needs for the 21st Century&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0434437&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Richard
Noble&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed workshops
is to provide a forum to set out separations needs and a framework for research
focused towards solutions. A series of three workshops is planned. The initial
workshop will identify the priorities for separations needs based on impact
across different industries, short vs. long term impact, and perceived
investment risk. Two workshops will then be organized, one primarily for
chemists (ACS meeting, Philadelphia, PA, August 21, 2004) and one with chemical
engineers (AIChE meeting, Austin, TX, November 6, 2004). For each meeting, the
appropriate group (ACS Separation Science and Technology sub-division, AIChE
Separations Division) will help coordinate the logistics and assist in providing
attendance of a representative segment of their constituency. The purpose of
this meeting will be to identify research approaches that can address these
research needs. Recent materials and other chemical engineering advances provide
the potential for expanded opportunities in almost all the separation
technologies. A key issue is how separations technologies (and possibly others)
will address the separations needs for the future. These needs span a large
range in scale, operating conditions, chemical environments and lifetime
requirements. Future separations needs are related to the pharmaceutical,
biomedical, and other biotech industries, microelectronics, aerospace, and
alternative fuels (i.e. hydrogen) segments of the economy. In addition,
nanotechnology will impact separations in general with respect to scale and
materials. Environmental concerns, such as carbon dioxide levels in the
atmosphere, will continue to provide the impetus for improved separations
technologies. In terms of the broader impacts, the result of this series of
workshops will be a clearly identified set of research needs and some proposed
plans to address these needs.&lt;br/&gt;
