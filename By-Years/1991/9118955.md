This project is aimed at helping bioprocess monitoring, control, and
optimization by providing a novel technique for on-line process variable
estimation and optimization. Fermentation kinetic models seldom include the
influence of environmental factors, like pH and temperature. The development of
accurate quantitative models, which simulate how cells respond to various
environmental changes, will help in better utilizing the chemical synthesis
capabilities of cells. The proposed method will use environmental and
physiological information available from on-line sensors to estimate
concentration of species in a bioreactor. Based on these estimates, the
optimization scheme will provide the best environmental conditions which will
drive the cells to their maximum productivity.
