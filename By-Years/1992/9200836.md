This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at North Carolina
State University. The funds provide support for seventeen undergraduate students
selected from candidates from sixty five potential institutions in the
Southeastern United States. Participation consists of a summer session at North
Carolina State University. Special emphasis is placed upon recruitment from
under-represented groups such as females and minorities. Scholastic achievement
is the primary requirement for participation in the program, and recommendation
by a faculty member is a significant factor. The research under supervision of
faculty members will involve topics in the areas of super- resolution optical
spectroscopy, compound semiconductors, atomic collisions, x-ray absorption
spectroscopy, supernova remnants, and condensed matter theory. The professors
involved in this program have a strong record of interaction with undergraduate
students in research. The program has had considerable success in the past four
years, for example, more than 24 publications with undergraduate student co-
authors, several regional awards for student papers, and one winner of the Apker
Award by the American Institute of Physics for the outstanding undergraduate
research project in the nation, plus an additional Apker finalist in 1991.
