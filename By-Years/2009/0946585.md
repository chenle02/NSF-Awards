This RAPID award supports critical work related to the Lenape Tribe of
Pennsylvania. Their language, which is related to Delaware (SIL code: DEL), has
been considered extinct in Pennsylvania. Recently, however, elements of the
language retained by the descendants of the last speakers have become known to
researchers. This project includes interviews with community elders who retain
this language knowledge, specifically related to ceremonies, kinship terms,
flora and fauna, and thus contributes to our understanding of language loss
within this community. The intellectual merit of the project is seen in the
development of annotated texts and new dictionary materials, including
previously unavailable tables of verb paradigms which will be of particular
interest to scholars of Algonquian languages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts are impressive in that the project pairs Swarthmore college students,
who are learning the language in the school setting, with community members who
have a retained knowledge of parts of the language, in workshops where the
students' linguistic skills assist in the development of community language
materials. As such, the project offers a model for broadening participation
which could be replicated in similar university-community partnerships.
