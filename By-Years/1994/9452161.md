A new course in Environmental Water Quality has been developed in the
Agricultural Engineering Department at the University of Idaho. The course is
part of the Agricultural Engineering and the new Biological Systems Engineering
curricula. The laboratory component of the course covers non-point sources of
water contamination, such as leaching from agricultural land, erosion from
forestry land and effluent from livestock and fish production systems. The
course integrates physical experiments and demonstrations on chemical transport
processes with computer simulation of non-point source contamination processes.
Students from a number of academic departments with an interest in water and
environmental resources can enroll in this course.
