Many situations in society involve matchings. Workers are matched to jobs,
students to schools, conference papers to reviewers, patients to organ donors,
etc. Those involved have preferences which are often expressed as rankings of
their potential partners. An important goal of a centralized match-maker is to
produce a "good" matching that takes into account the preferences of all the
participants. Perhaps the most important example of a matchings-with-preferences
problem is the stable marriage problem. In some contexts, however, other kinds
of matchings are more meaningful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies
computational and structural issues that arise from matchings-with-preferences
problems. The first part investigates various ways of choosing a fair matching
-- an issue that comes up repeatedly as organizers of centralized matching
schemes need to ensure that none of the participants have an advantage. Three
criteria for fairness are considered. Let M consist of all valid matchings of an
instance. A matching is fair if it is (i) a median element of M whose elements
are ordered appropriately, if it is (ii) a winner of an election where
participants vote which matching in M they prefer, or if it is (iii) chosen
uniformly at random from M. In each case, the objective is to design provably
good algorithms for finding or approximating a fair matching. In practice,
participants' preferences are often allowed to contain ties and be incomplete.
As a result, surprising complexities arise. For example, two stable matchings
from the same instance do not necessarily have the same size. The second part of
this research seeks to develop efficient algorithms for finding "ideal" stable
matchings in these situations, and to analyze existing algorithms to determine
the quality of the stable matchings they produce. In addition to impacting the
way current centralized matching algorithms are designed, this research aims to
make connections between the area of matchings-with-preferences and the fields
of distributive lattices, voting theory and random sampling by viewing the
problems in a broader context.&lt;br/&gt;
