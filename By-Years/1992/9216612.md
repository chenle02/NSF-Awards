This proposal is a comparative study of the Guaja Indians of Maranhao state of
Brazil, a people who, until recently, have little to no contact with local
Brazilians. The doctoral candidate will study three different communities which
vary in their commitment to a n agricultural way of life. If successful, this
study will help us to better understand the costs and benefits (health, diet,
and resource usage) involved in the transition from a foraging way of life to a
settled agricultural mode of existence. In addition, the research will shed
important data on the stability and adaptiveness of a foraging mode of existence
in the tropics which has recently become a contentious topic in ecological
anthropology with important implications for our understanding of hominid
evolution.
