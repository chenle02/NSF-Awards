This proposal sets out a fundamental study that is focused on probing the link
between catalytic hydrodechlorination activity/selectivity and catalyst
structure. Previous work by the PI has established that nano-dispersed nickel on
amorphous silica in the presence of hydrogen is highly efficient in the
dechlorination of concentrated chlorinated gas streams; the chlorine that is
removed is solely in the form of HCl that is easy to trap. The existing catalyst
activity/selectivity database will be extended in a strategic fashion, focusing
on the treatment of chlorinated phenols as model reactants; the latter
represents a class of commercially significant and highly toxic industrial
waste. Preliminary results have revealed that chlorobenzene and chlorophenol
hydrodechlorination over Ni/SiO2 is structure sensitive in that larger Ni
particles (in the range 1-4 nm) exhibit higher specific dechlorination rates but
are more susceptible to deactivation. The issue of catalyst decay will be
addressed through a comprehensive program of catalyst characterization before
and after reaction. This will involve bulk structural studies (x-ray
diffraction), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), analytical
TEM including EDX and EELS, surface area/porosity measurements,
chemisorption/TPD/TPO studies and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe
changes in Ni electronic structure. Moreover, the nature of the
reactant(s)/product(s) interaction with the catalyst surface will be probed
using spectroscopic (FTIR-DRIFT) and chromatographic techniques. The presence of
chlorinated aromatics in industrial effluent is now established as a major
source of environmental pollution. This work may form the basis for a more
efficient pollution prevention method. The PI has previously worked with both
graduate and undergraduate students in an international context. In this project
he will also work with chemistry students and provide training in engineering
research.
