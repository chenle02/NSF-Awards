9504356 Stamnes Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the
Arctic Systems Sciences (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly
sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.
Work to be performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year
research project named SHEBA are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of
arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve simulations of
the present day arctic climate, including its variability, using General
Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the interpretation of satellite
remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate system and
provide reliable data for model input, model validation and climate monitoring.
This work is a collaborative effort between the University of Nevada, Dessert
Research Institute and the University of Alaska, Geophysical Institute. Several
key atmospheric measurements during the SHEBA field program will be made from
tethered balloons that will carry scientific instruments up to a kilometer above
the ice surface. Some of these instruments must be adapted and tested for Arctic
conditions. One group of measurements focus on cloud microphytsics and another
group involve radiative heat fluz measurements. The microphysics instruments
will provide characterizations of cloud particles at different altitudes as the
balloon moves vertically through cloud layers. The radiative instrument package
will consist of self-leveling up- and down- short-wave flux radiometers, cloud
liquid water instruments, and meteorological packages for pressure, temperature,
humidity, and wind. The collaborative effort will provide common operational and
data logging components. Partial support is also being provided by Dept. of
Energy.
