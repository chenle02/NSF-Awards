Lepton particle beam colliders (the International Linear Collider (ILC), Compact
Linear Collider (CLIC) and the Muon Collider) are among the priority projects
being considered by the International High Energy Physics Community to advance
the scientific knowledge of the field. This award provides partial support for
US students and post docs to attend the Eighth International Accelerator School
for Linear Colliders to be held in Antalya, Turkey, 4-8 December 2013. The
program of the school will cover a wide range of topics related to lepton
colliders, from beam dynamics to damping rings, from superconducting radio
frequency technologies to precise instrumentation, from room temperature radio
frequency technology to beam delivery systems. The broader impact of the school
is the opportunity for US students and post docs to interact with their
counterparts from other regions of the world and to form collaborations and
partnerships. The program is supported by NSF Division of Physics, through its
programs in Experimental Elementary Particle Physics and Accelerator Research.
