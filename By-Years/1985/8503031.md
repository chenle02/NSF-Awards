The primary goal of the proposed research project is to develop a general,
unified, dynamic theory of distributed, multiple access communication networks
which involve collision channels. Although the problem has been of interest for
quite some time, no methods for the analysis and design of these networks exist
which are general in nature, unified in methodology, and applicable to a wide
class of algorithms and conditions. Researchers have formulated a powerful
approach and put into place the rudiments of a fundamental theory. Further
effort is required to construct a mathematical description of a model of a
large-scale computer communication network and to use this model to dynamically
analyze important specific problem areas.
