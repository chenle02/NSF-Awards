Scientific collaboration is increasingly data driven. Large volumes of data are
generated, aggregated, archived, and shared?often with collaborators (and their
compute resources) spread across the globe - with subsequent analysis generating
still more data to archive and distribute. Scientists either become experts at
data transfer, storage, and management, or their ability to build on each
other?s work suffers. This project addresses this challenge, with an emphasis on
easing the burden on the user, building a solution that is sustainable over the
long term, and delivering performance that scales in the number of
collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's technical approach is to
deploy a general-purpose storage platform, called Syndicate, that harnesses a
collection of available storage components to provide a global, scalable, and
secure storage service. These include public and private cloud storage (for data
durability), network caches and content distribution networks (for scalable read
bandwidth), and local disks (for local reads/write performance). The project's
goal is to make it possible for applications to access data independent of where
it is stored, where Syndicate simultaneously: (1) minimizes the operational
burden imposed on users, (2) maximizes the use of commodity infrastructure; and
(3) maximizes aggregate I/O performance. At its core, Syndicate's value
proposition is to fully decouple storage semantics from infrastructure. This
lets users select infrastructure based on its cost/performance trade-off, while
ensuring that their domain-specific storage requirements are met. And to
demonstrate this value, the project is building a pilot deployment that spans
edge resources on nine campuses, and operating the capability on behalf of a
diverse set of application domains, ranging from biology to network analytics to
personalized medicine to retail and consumer analysis.
