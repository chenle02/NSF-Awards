IIP 0934373&lt;br/&gt;e-Design: IT-Enabled Design and Realization of Engineered
Products and Systems&lt;br/&gt;University of Central
Florida&lt;br/&gt;Geiger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to renew the
University of Central Florida's participation in the e-Design Center, an I/UCRC
center that was created in 2003. The multi-university center is currently
comprised of Virginia Tech (lead institute), University of Central Florida and
University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Carnegie Mellon University is slated to
join as a full partner in 2009. The mission and vision of the NSF Center for
e-Design is to serve as a national Center of Excellence in IT-enabled design and
realization of manufactured products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of
Central Florida's (UCF) participation is vital to the overall success of the
Center. Continued research efforts at UCF will contribute to the development of
a set of coordinated tools and practices that can support conceptual and
detailed design requirements specification, as well as the development of a
conceptual modeler that can be used to support iterative conceptual design. The
research efforts at UCF fully align with the Center?s long-term goal of serving
as a Center for Excellence in IT-enabled conceptualization, design and
realization of engineered products and systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed Center's renewal will enable UCF to continue its key research and
leadership role in the Center, as well as contribute significantly to the
successful development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students.
Benefits to students will include integration of resulting work into coursework
and engineering curricula, as well as internship opportunities. The center will
provide a unique experience to students who can interact and collaborate with
industrial researchers and engineers. Research and educational findings will
continue to be disseminated nationally and will have a significant impact on US
industry as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;
