Recent studies of ancient civilizations in Peru suggest that there were very
clear distinctions between the social organization of the highland Andean area
(Inka) and the coastal area (Chimu). These differences are linked to the nature
of resource distribution and canal irrigation along the coast. Following this
line of argument, archaeologists have examined the forces leading towards
political unification of the Lambayeque Valley Complex area along the North
Coast in a regional state pre-dating the Chimu. This dissertation research will
address the relation of economic organization and its interrelation with
political organization, based on multiple, independent lines of evidence
(regional survey results, workshop excavations, and stylistic and archaeometric
analyses).
