This Minority Research Planning Grant project is supported through the Office of
Special Projects and the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in Chemistry
and involves the use of layered, sheet-like, clays as selective adsorbants for
separations. The adsorption process takes place in spaces between clay plates
which act as molecular sieves. Clays where the aluminosilicate plates are
negatively charged and counter cations of sodium are inserted between the clay
layers will be studied. The sodium ions can be exchanged by larger cations in
order to expand the spacing of the layered clays and create void volumes where
permeation can occur. Clays that are modified in this manner will be designed
for use in size exclusion chromatography. %%% Minority Research Planning Grants
are intended to strengthen the proposal writing and planning capabilities of new
investigators and to facilitate preliminary studies and other planning
activities related to the research. This project will involve extensive
interaction with senior researchers at Michigan State University during the
formulation of research ideas and the preparation of the research proposal.
