Much of the chemical enrichment of pristine gas in galaxies is through stellar
mass loss and explosions. Principal Investigator (PI) Scudder will use data from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point (SDSS-
MaNGA) to measure the chemical composition of the gas in galaxies. This work
will further our understanding of the growth of galaxies through star formation.
The PI will offer academic year and summer research opportunities to
undergraduate students at Oberlin College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Scudder will
use archival integral field spectra from the SDSS-MaNGA survey of 10,000
galaxies to determine spatially resolved gas-phase metallicities. The
measurements will be assessed for contamination from emission from an active
galactic nucleus (AGN). To obtain a more accurate estimate of stellar enrichment
the PI will quantify metallicity indicator systematics and biases through a
comparison of different calibration methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
