This proposal requests funds to purchase a particle sensor and counter to be
used in research at the Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode
Island. The equipment is designed to determine the size distribution of
particles in the size range between 800 and 1 micron diameter. The NSF is asked
for 50% of the cost towards purchase, and the remainder is to come from the
institution. The particle counter-sensor is to be used primarily in NSF- funded
research projects dealing with the generation, dispersal and deposition of
volcanic ash from explosive eruptions.
