The project focuses on several crucial requirements of upcoming information
management systems: integrated access to heterogeneous sources, data
warehousing, and multimedia data. It also integrates education and research. As
part of the educational component of this project, UCSD's database curriculum is
being reshaped to provide students with hands-on experience, basic principles,
and exposure to research challenges in the above areas. The research enhances
the state of the art in two areas: the integration of very large numbers of
Internet sources and the extraction and querying of semantic information from
video data. In the area of data integration, query processing algorithms are
developed and integrated into the TSIMMIS mediator system; they use knowledge of
data replication to avoid retrieving redundant/replicated data and enhance the
availability and efficiency of the system. A new cost-based optimizer is
developed for high performance in browsing of partial results. The optimizer is
provided with probabilistic information on source data overlap and develops
plans for efficient delivery of partial answers. In the area of video data, the
COMIX system is developed. COMIX is customized by users with SQL-like actions
and queries that assist COMIX in extracting semantic information orders of
magnitude faster than by a brute-force approach. COMIX introduces novel query
processing optimizations which exploit the sequentiality, fuzziness and
continuity of the video data. In the upcoming era where the Web and the digital
TV signal will enter every living room, the proposed version of the TSIMMIS
mediator system will allow the user to search the vast volumes of Web data in a
manner that exploits redundancy and replication of Web data, rather than being
impeded by it (as is currently the case.) Then the COMIX system will be a step
towards "smart VCRs", which will be screening the digital TV signal and
extracting information of interest to the user. http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~yannis
