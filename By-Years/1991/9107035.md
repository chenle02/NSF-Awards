This collaborative award, made under the Materials Chemistry and Chemical
Processing Initiative, is supported by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials
Research. A series of new copper(I) compounds will be prepared and evaluated for
CVD based on criteria such as vapor pressure, deposition rate, deposit purity,
morphology and resistivity. Precursors which deposit high-purity copper films
will be the subject of surface studies to probe deposition mechanisms. These
studies will focus on understanding the fundamental mechanistic aspects of CVD
by means of Reactive Scattering and Thermal Desorption Mass Spectrometry, Auger
Electron Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. These techniques
will be used to identify reaction products, to study modes of adsorption,
binding energies and oxidation states of adsorbed species, and to examine
adsorption/desorption kinetics, film homogeneity and impurity levels. %%% New
methods of copper deposition are of great interest to the electronics industry.
Understanding the surface chemistry as a function of the nature of the copper
ligands will aid in the design of new molecular precursors that result in lower
decomposition temperatures and higher purity films.
