A week-long workshop in modern techniques in the chemistry of binuclear
organometallic compounds. In addition to synthetic laboratory experience, the
participants will rotate through their choice of four out of five technique-
oriented laboratory sessions offered on: 1) multi-nuclear and 2-D nuclear
magnetic resonance; 2) application of cyclic voltmetry; 3) infra-red
spectroscopy; 4) molecular orbital calculations; 5) X-ray crystallography; and,
6) organometallic synthesis. Date: Summer 1992Contact: David Stanbury,
