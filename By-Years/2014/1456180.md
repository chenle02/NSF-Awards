This project will help determine whether the adoption of drug and parole reforms
is indicative of a comprehensive shift away from the policies and practices that
led to mass incarceration. The findings will contribute to a variety of socio-
legal literatures, as well as more policy-oriented discussions regarding the
potential and limits of drug law reform as a means of reducing mass
incarceration and racial disproportionality in the U.S. criminal justice system.

This mixed methods study will analyze changing and potentially contradictory
criminal justice practices and policies and the discourse through which the
latter are legitimated. Analysis of National Corrections Reporting Program data
(2000-2012) will shed light on recent and potentially contradictory trends in
prison admissions, sentences, and time served. Compilation of a legislative
dataset drawn from the National Council on State Legislatures? Significant State
Corrections and Sentencing Legislation reports will identify potentially
contradictory trends in criminal justice policy-making. The informal mechanisms
that help to account for changing criminal justice outcomes will also be
identified through a case study of criminal case processing in King County,
Washington.
