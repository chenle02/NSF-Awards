The science and technology of advanced materials impacts a number of industries.
The fields of microelectronics, transportation, energy storage, power
production, biomedical, and environmental science and technology are typical
examples. Physics and chemistry form the basis for these technologies, and they
are applied in a number of engineering disciplines. the expertise needed to
impact the knowledge and expose the students to available opportunities in
materails science and technology is not commonly available in two and four year
colleges. In addition, high school students are essentially unaware of the
field, its importance, and the opportunities that exist for future employment
and contributions. The objective of this workshop are to introduce advanced
materials science and technology to teachers at the two and four year coleges
around the State of Florida and high schools throughout the region, with special
emphasis on predominantly minority institutions. The workshop will result in the
incorporation of materials science into their curricula. It is expected that
this incorporation of materials science into the physics, chemistry and
engineering curricula will enable students to understand fundamental principles.
It will also introduce them to the exciting hgiher educational opportunities and
professional careers available in the field of materials science and
engineering. Products resulting from this project will include lesson plans and
course materials for physics and chemistry at the high school and college levels
(4 courses).
