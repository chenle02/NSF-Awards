Research shows that direct experiences with nature have beneficial effects on
people's physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being. Yet what happens
psychologically when advanced technologies augment human/nature interactions?
Grounded in Value-Sensitive Design, this project represents an early, cohesive,
and rigorous effort to answer this question. At the heart of this project lies
five empirical studies. Study 1 involves a room with an augmented "window" view
(a video plasma display of a real-time local nature scene). Study 2 involves
whether it matters psychologically that an augmentation of a natural scene
occurs in real-time. Study 3 involves robot "pets" in the lives of children and
adolescents. Study 4 involves robot "pets" as possible companions for the
elderly. Study 5 involves a "telegarden" (a telerobotic installation that allows
Web users to garden by controlling a remote industrial robot arm). A diverse
range of physiological, behavioral, and social-cognitive data are collected over
short-term and longer-term conditions. In the coming years, augmented reality
will become part of our everyday lives, and pervasive across diverse fields,
such as architecture, education, gerontology, recreation, and ecommerce. This
project contributes proactively to the design and use - from an ethical stance -
of this emerging technology. &lt;br/&gt;
