Adaptations are important in computational neuroscience for their roles in
mediating phase response curves and further in affecting spike frequency
adaptation, however, their effects on coherent synchronization under different
nature of functional circuits are not understood. In this research, the
investigators adopt a simple neuron model with adaptation currents which mediate
phase response curves in qualitatively different ways, in studying neuronal
synchronization emerged from various functional circuits. These investigations
include study in stochastic synchrony induced from noise driven of non-
interacting neurons, in frequency locking responses resulted from periodically
forced entertainment, in coherent synchrony emerged from mutual interactions
with increasing intensity, and in coherent synchrony derived from randomly
connected networks.

These studies will bring important insights on how adaptations influence the
functional neuronal synchronizations in considered circuits, and further lead to
a better understanding in distinct biological functional features. Another
significant impact of this research is that it facilitates a realistically tuned
(via adaptations) yet computationally undemanding model to build networks, in
understanding the following coherent neural information coding, such as cortical
information processing in neocortex (induced various cognitive functions), or
synchronous responses in olfactory bulbs (lead to odor perceptions), visual
entrainment in thalamocortical relays (as an anesthetic used during surgery for
a relaxation aid), or heat-beat entrainment in respiratory system (used as the
foundation to the understanding and treatment of human respiratory problems),
selective attention and memory in the cortex, or coherent synchronization in
Parkinson and epilepsy diseases, and high connectivity in adjacent areas, and
decreased connectivity in increased distant areas among segregated areas of the
cortex, or low connectivity in local cortical circuits.
