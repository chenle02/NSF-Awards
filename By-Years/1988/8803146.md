This project will study the behavior of laminated glass, which consists of two
monolithic glass plates joined with an elastomeric interlayer, subjected to
lateral loads. Experimental tests will be carried out at two different
temperatures and various loads simulating wind, human contact or missiles. These
results will be used for the verification of two mathematical models which
incorporate the simile of the interactions between the interlayer and the glass
plates. Since laminated glass is used by the construction industry predominantly
as safety glazing and overhead glazing, the results of this project will help
designers, architects and engineers to better understand the performance of this
type of glass.
