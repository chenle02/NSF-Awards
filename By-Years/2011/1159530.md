1159530&lt;br/&gt;Dogariu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell motility is central to a
number of biological and pathological processes including cancer cell invasion
and metastasis, inflammation, angiogenesis, wound repair, and embryonic
development. Cell movement occurs via the concerted activities of cell adhesion
molecules, the actin cytoskeleton and an extensive network of signaling
molecules. Currently, the chemical, mechanical and electrical stimulation have
all been explored for guiding the motility of cells. However, these stimuli are
not universal in guiding a variety of cells and, sometimes, they may even cause
damage to certain cells. This program aims at developing a non-invasive method
for regulating cells motility. The main goal is to find means for promoting
cells migration along reconfigurable three-dimensional paths by using
irradiation with specially prepared coherent optical radiation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This transformative concept will overcome major
limitations of current approaches for directing and controlling cells motility.
The broader impact of this research will be the development of fundamental
knowledge about the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton and the possibility to
actively influence it in response to the action of optical fields. This
knowledge can steer further developments in controlling the cellular
biomechanics for further applications in tissue engineering, drug development,
and cellular biology studies. The results of this program will be broadly
disseminated not only through publications but also by extensive collaborative
efforts. Reaching across biology, biophysics, and biophotonics, the research is
truly interdisciplinary and offers possibilities for an integrated training of
students in engineering, optics, and biology and will also provide ample
opportunities for undergraduate research involving students from a variety of
backgrounds, including groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.
