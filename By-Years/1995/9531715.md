This award will support the participation of undergraduate students in the
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program offered by Northern Arizona
University. Students chosen for this program will be Native American, African
American and Hispanic students primarily; Caucasian students who are the first
generation for their family in college may be included as participants. Under
the guidance of scientists from the Department of Biological Sciences and the
Department of Psychology, students will conduct research in the neural and
behavioral sciences. The program is a year-long research internship that
integrates four major components. (1) Students receive formal training in
research design and statistics, reading complex scientific literature, and an
integrated lecture-discussion series that covers the range of research topics in
neural and behavioral sciences. (2) This training phase is combined with
research experience under the guidance of faculty mentors during the summer and
the academic year. (3) A seminar on professional issues held during the Fall
semester will assist students in clarifying their career goals, instruct them in
applying to graduate schools, and prepare them to make research presentations.
(4) An ethics component will include presentations on the ethical treatment of
animals in research, the ethical treatment of human subjects, the history of
science, and cultural issues in ethics. Both faculty and students will attend
presentations on Native American cultural restrictions around the handling of
certain animals and plants. This award will foster the continued education and
training of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic
researchers in neural and behavioral sciences. It will also help to inform young
citizens about ethical questions in science and aspects of management and
decision making for solving some societal/environmental problems. =~
