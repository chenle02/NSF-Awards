It is proposed to develop methods for ab initio calculations of electron impact
ionization at low and intermediate energies. Such a theory will be subject to
stringent comparisons with available experimental results. The effort here
involves a generalization of the R-matrix approach, matching an inside solution
to the scattering problem to an asymptotic solution. The latter is basically
known, though certain extensions will be necessary. The other principal task is
to match at the R-matrix boundary; the approach will be via a variational
principle with a Dirichlet boundary condition.
