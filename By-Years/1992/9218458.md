The principal objective of this research project is to understand isotopic
resetting processes for the U-Pb and Sm- Nd systems in minerals in the contact
aureole of the Laramie Anorthosite Complex. The time-temperature profile of the
aureole will be refined using conventional phase equilibria, oxygen isotope
thermometry and Ar-Ar biotite and hornblende cooling ages. The resulting profile
will then be used to place constraints on the closure temperatures and resetting
processes for the U-Pb and Sm-Nd systematics in minerals such as ilmenite,
sphene, apatite, garnet and monazite. Comparison of the temperatures at which
the U-Pb and Sm-Nd ages reset in minerals from reactive and non-reactive rock
types in the aureole will permit examination of the effects of mineral reactions
and volume diffusion on reequilibration of the various isotopic sytems.
