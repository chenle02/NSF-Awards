Eastern China is a seismically active interplate environment for which
extensive sets of seismic, structural and geophysical data are available. We
propose a multipurpose comparative study of seismicity and neotectonics in
eastern China and in the eastern United States with reference also to block
rotation in California, primarily directed at problems concerning earthquake
hazard and neotectonics in intraplate regions. This project is in collaboration
with Ma Zongjin and his group at the Center for Analysis and Prediction, State
Seismological Bureau, in Beijing, and has been approved by the State
Seismological Bureau. The project involves yearly one-month visits by each of
the collaborating groups to the counterpart institutes. The comparative study
will involve an extensive exchange of earthquake data, methodologies, results
and ideas. We will produce new data on the seismicity of northeastern China by
the application of an algorithm to obtain epicenters and magnitudes from
intensity data, by the determination of source parameters from waveform modeling
of moderate size earthquakes and by mapping Sn propagation characteristics.
