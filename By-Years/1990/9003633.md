This project will investigate the genesis of repetitive, self- organization
patterns of texture and composition in volcanic agates. These patterns are
believed to be interlinked. Self- organization of a non-equilibrium system
involves the spontaneous generation of a repetitive pattern without preexisting
structures or periodic outside causes. The main patterns to be explored are (a)
the systematic interlayering of bands made up of twisted chalcedony fibers with
bands consisting of non-twisted fibers, (b) the associated oscillatory minor-
element profile predicted by our present model and revealed by
cathodoluminescence, and (c) the systematically fibrous, length-fast habit of
agate quartz. The proposed research consists of quantitative dynamical modeling
of agate crystallization by an autocatalytic mechanism, morphological
instability analysis of the crystallization front, microscopic observations, and
trace- and minor-element analyses by ion probe. These analyses will be carried
out with the NSF-funded ion probe at MIT. This project will clarify the dynamics
of a self- organizing system with geochemical, crystallochemical, and
petrological significance, and geochemical factors controlling crystal
morphology and crystalline textures.
