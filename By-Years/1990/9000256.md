This award supports the research in automorphic forms and representation theory
of Professor Freydoon Shahidi of Purdue University. One of Dr. Shahidi's
projects is to study the possible equivalence, for a cusp form on a quasi-split
group over a number field, between having a non-zero Fourier coefficient with
respect to a generic character of a maximal unipotent subgroup, and having
generic local components everywhere. Another related project is to prove the
holomorphy of certain local L- functions related to tempered representations.
Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a
mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had
realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their
basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given
rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular
and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field is principally
concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and
analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots.
