This award supports the development of a microfluidic, turbulent rapid mixer,
capable of completely mixing two liquid solutions within microseconds. Targeted
applications are measurements of very fast kinetics of chemical and biological
reaction systems (e.g. protein and nucleic acid folding) that cannot be studied
by rapid single molecule measurements, or chemical relaxation techniques (e.g.
T- and P-jump). The instrument will have superior time resolution compared to
any other available mixing instrument, is sparing of valuable reactant
solutions, is compatible with biological molecules, can be modified for quench
flow operation, and the format is compatible with sophisticated spectroscopic
measurements. Other major considerations are the convenience of the operation,
the reliability and robustness of the measurements, the simultaneous measurement
of several experimental parameters (e.g. fluorescence intensity, lifetimes,
polarization and spectral dispersion). This instrument opens up opportunities
for kinetic experiments in a new time scale.
