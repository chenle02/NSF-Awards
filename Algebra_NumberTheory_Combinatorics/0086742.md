This award will fund a conference, in March 2001. This conference will deal
with a broad spectrum of the theory of quadratic forms, including algebraic
theory, arithmetic theory, K- theory and algebraic groups.

This is an important and broad research area in Number Theory.

There will be approximately eight one-hour survey lectures and between twenty-
five and thirty contributed talks by the participants.
