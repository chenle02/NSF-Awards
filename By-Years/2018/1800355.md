This award supports research into a number of striking connections between
algebra and several other quite diverse areas of mathematics. The discovery of a
connection between two different areas of mathematics holds a potential for
enriching both of them by making available new sets of techniques for attacking
old problems. This often yields striking results that even after many years
remain inaccessible by old techniques. For example, twenty-five years ago the
principal investigator solved a long standing open problem in algebra using
techniques from a very different area. That has initiated a period of fruitful
applications of those techniques to algebra. This award will support continuing
research into these and related questions. Advising students, mentoring
postdocs, and giving invited talks at conferences are going to be part of the
proposed activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at achieving a better
understanding of a number of interrelated problems such as the structure and
algorithmic computation of local cohomology modules, De Rham homology and
cohomology of algebraic varieties, the absolute integral closure of a local
domain in mixed characteristic, Matlis duals of local cohomology modules, tight
closure and some other. Local cohomology is the common thread that runs through
all these problems and connects them to each other. The principal methods to be
employed are D-modules and F-modules whose use in commutative algebra has been
pioneered by the investigator. Advising students, mentoring postdocs, and giving
invited talks at conferences are going to be part of the proposed
activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
