This study relates to a fundamental investigation of the behavior of thermal
plumes as a function of different ambient conditions. Of interest is the class
of problem involving natural convection transport from a heated body. Also of
interest is the interaction of the resulting natural convection wake with the
environment. This problem is important in several areas of technology, such as
the cooling of electronic equipment, positioning of heating elements in
furnaces, and safety considerations in enclosure fires.
