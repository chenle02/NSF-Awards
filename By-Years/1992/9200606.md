An SGER award will permit testing the feasibility of using buckminsterfullerene
(C60 and C70) ions in ion-assisted deposition of MgF2 antireflection optical
coatings at relatively low temperatures. It is anticipated that these ions may
provide suitable energy transfer to the optical films to force dense growth -
resulting in optimal wear and optical properties - at temperatures at which
plastic optical components are stable. It is also expected that the
buckminsterfullerene ions will leave minimal chemical residue and mechanical
damage in the film.
