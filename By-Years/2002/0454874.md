With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support of the work of Professor Paul G. Wenthold of the
Department of Chemistry at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. The research
will extend the PI's work on the gas phase chemistry of organic ions and
triradicals. Although radicals and diradicals have been well studied,
triradicals with three electrons in three orbitals of comparable energy have
received little attention. In these investigations, heats of formation of
triradicals as well as bond dissociation energies leading to these energetic
species will be measured. A second focus of the project is on the reactivity of
ionic systems. A systematic study of the scope of a recently discovered
electron-catalyzed cyclization reaction will be used to develop a predictive
reactivity model. These studies will be extended to gas-phase addition and
cycloaddition reactions of ions. Comparison of the gas-phase reactions with
those in solution will be used to gain insight into the factors that affect the
products and selectivity.

These studies are expected provide a wealth of thermodynamic and kinetic
information that will impact upon chemistry, material science, and engineering.
