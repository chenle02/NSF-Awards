The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop coatings for plastics, with
applications from sanitation to automotive displays. Few surface coatings on
plastics can resist fouling of bacteria and mineral deposits while also
achieving both liquid- and sludge-repellency. This project will develop a
slippery surface coating that repels liquid, sludge, bacteria, and mineral
deposits on common plastics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research Phase II project will advance translation of liquid-
entrenched smooth surface (LESS) coatings that can be directly applied to
various plastics. Functionalizing plastics with mechanically durable surface
coatings is challenging owing to the lack of reactive surface chemistry. LESS
demonstrates excellent liquid- and sludge-repellency with over 95% reduction in
bacteria accumulation and mineral deposits compared to untreated surfaces. This
project will investigate the optimal formulation and coating parameters to
enhance interfacial bonding strength of LESS onto plastics through combined
molecular dynamic simulations and experimental characterizations. The newly
developed LESS-on-plastics coatings will be systematically evaluated for their
mechanical and UV durability, liquid- and sludge-repellency as well as the anti-
bacterial and anti-scaling functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
