This project will develop an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) sputter source
for metal oxide thin film deposition employing solid metal oxide targets as a
material source. In Phase I, yttrium- barium-copper-oxide will be used as the
specific metal oxide in order to evaluate and eliminate the effects of film
damage by energetic particle bombardment ordinarily seen in conventional on-
axis sputtering experiments. Recent work by another group suggests a way to
develop a large area high rate ECR metal oxide deposition source which can
overcome previous difficulties with on-axis sputter magnetrons. Experiments will
be carried out on a suitably modified ECR test stand which will enable us to
characterize both the plasma formation through microwave ECR plasma production
and the RF sputtering of metal oxide targets. The technology would be compatible
with currently available semiconductor tools.
