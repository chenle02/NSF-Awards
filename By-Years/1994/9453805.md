traveling exhibit entitled "How Things Work, which will familiarize students and
the general public with the science and engineering behind 15-20 "gadgets" which
play vital roles in their everyday lives. A number of the exhibit elements will
be based on the work of Dr. Richard Crane. Ancillary materials will be developed
for classroom teachers as part of school outreach. An Exhibition Resource Guide
will be developed for use by other museum venues, as well as teachers, students
and others.
