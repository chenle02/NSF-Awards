This project is enhancing the instructional capabilities of the Farquhar
Laboratory by upgrading the global positioning system (GPS) hardware and
software. The department is adding two data collector kits, an educator's system
Pro XR receiver, and a community base station. These items allow greater numbers
of students to learn spatial mapping techniques more quickly and facilitate more
sophisticated analysis of increasingly complex databases. The project adds to a
curriculum containing a spatial literacy and mapping component that teaches
students to collect, process, and interpret original data. The department's
theory of curricular development is that the experiences of one instructor with
successive student groups diffuses to a wider group of faculty and students as
experimental efforts prove successful. For example, through in-house workshops
and demonstrations, increasing numbers of students and faculty are beginning to
see possible applications of GPS technology in their respective fields. *
