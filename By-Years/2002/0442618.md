(99) The Center for Sustainability Science and Engineering Education (SSEE),
which is a consortium of universities comprised of Carnegie Mellon, University
of Texas at Austin, and Arizona State University, is: (1) conducting workshops
for engineering faculty across the U.S. that are disseminating SSEE materials
and enhancing the educational process in this discipline; (2) developing a web
site of peer-reviewed educational material on this topic that can grow over time
as more materials are developed world-wide; and (3) assessing the educational
materials, workshops, and use of the web site to enable continual improvement.
All branches of engineering are both contributing educational materials and
using the materials in courses. Furthermore, a variety of schools, such as
research universities, community colleges, teaching institutions, and schools
with individuals of diverse backgrounds are benefiting from the infrastructure
developed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
