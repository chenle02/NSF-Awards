The increased use of nanomaterials is leading to advances in health and
medicine, energy, environmental remediation, and other applications. This
research seeks to identify the potential adverse effects of nanoparticle
exposure on human health and the environment. These concerns are becoming very
important issues in using nanotechnology. The work addresses the challenge of
building a common understanding of how nanoparticles affect biological cells.
Several classes of nanomaterials will be tested with a variety of biological
cells and models and with specific dose levels and exposure times. The research
will disentangle cytotoxic consequences, those originating solely from
nanoparticulate effects and those originating from molecular scale effects. It
will also identify appropriate metrics to represent the nanoparticulate effects.
The research is critical to understanding and using nanotechnology.
