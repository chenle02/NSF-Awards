9453918 Stevens UCLA Medical School Problem-Solving in Sciences: An Innovative
Software Approach This 48 month project introduces 240 first tier and 240 second
tier teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District to advanced problem
solving techniques and analysis using software developed for medical schools to
teach problem solving and monitor student and class strategies and mastery. The
project builds on existing software, IMMEX, and on the Science Education
Partnership the medical school has with the school district and community. First
tier teachers receive 200 hours of instruction over four weeks with follow up.
Teams of up to six teachers are selected from secondary schools in the district.
Each first tier teacher commits to approximately 10 hours to be used for
inservicing colleagues. Consequently, each school has access to up to 60 hours
of inservice instruction. The Windows based software system used allows teachers
to author problem solving scenarios without needing to know programming.
Included are diagnostic tools, many samples, and some experience with high
school teachers. IMMEX is intended to be used to supplement real world
experiences. Cost sharing on the project was estimated at 28% for the first
year. ***
