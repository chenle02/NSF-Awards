The ability to quantitatively define and measure how infective different strains
of viruses are towards live cells is critical for the development of antivirals.
Surprisingly, there exists no standardized way to measure and compare
infectivities across viral strains and under different experimental conditions.
This research will develop the quantitative framework needed and quantify
existing experimental measurements of infectivity. Most importantly, the models
and analysis tool will allow quantitative comparison of existing infectivity
data. Such comparisons will facilitate the development of antivirals that block
viral entry, or complex antibodies that neutralize virus particles. The research
is independent of the particular virus under consideration and may be feasibly
extended to bacterial pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first component of the
research will be to model, under typical experimental conditions, the physical
process of viral entry into cells. Specifically, the investigators aim to
understand the effects of (i) protocols such as centrifugation that bring virus
particles close to their target cells, (ii) the reporter system used to count
the number of cells infected, and (iii) the different parameters, such as
temperature, duration of exposure, and antiviral concentrations under which the
assays were performed. A model for how these variables affect the measured
infectivities will allow different experiments, performed in different
laboratories under different conditions, to be compared with each other. The
second component of the proposed research involves implementing the models for
viral entry into a web-based data analysis tool that will be constructed. It is
anticipated that this tool will aid virologists in their interpretation of large
scale infectivity data in terms of biological and mechanistic attributes of the
viruses.
