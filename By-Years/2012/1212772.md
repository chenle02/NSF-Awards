R/V New Horizon will be operating along the West Coast of the United States
during 2012, primarily in and out of San Diego. However, the vessel will transit
to Newport Oregon to support work funded by the Navy as well as NSF. NSF-funded
scientific objectives supported by cruises on R/V New Horizon in 2012 include:
Marine Geology and Geophysics in support of the Cascadia Initiative; Biological
Oceanography is support of the California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological
Research project; Instrumentation development in support of pressure sensors for
ocean observatories as well as a Carbon Flux Explorer Development project; and a
UNOLS training program for new chief scientists.

R/V New Horizon is well suited to support these programs in terms of equipment
and crew experience. This proposal represents year one of a five year renewed
cooperative agreement. The amount of the award in out-years on this agreement
will be negotiated yearly, and is dependent on the number of days at sea in
support of NSF funded research programs. Scripps Institution of Oceanography
executed the previous cooperative agreement (0505770) very well, meeting all
requirements for performance and reporting.

Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed work is indirect. It
derives from the intellectual merit of the individual research projects that
depend upon the shipboard work at sea. NSF-funded scientific investigations for
2012 operations include: marine geology; seismic hazard studies; climate
observations; and instrumentation development.

Broader Impacts: The mission of R/V Horizon includes the provision of
educational opportunities both to students of the marine sciences, and, through
educational outreach. R/V New Horizon operations also contribute significantly
to a wide diversity of scientific disciplines, the data from which benefit
oceanographic research beyond those studies directly funded to participate in
cruises.
