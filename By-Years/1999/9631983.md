This award supports a one-and-a-half day workshop to develop a policy framework
for deploying security technologies on the Internet. The workshop was
recommended at the Federal Networking Council Advisory Council meeting in
October, 1995 to provide guidance for Internet planners. This followed the
recommendation for such a workshop made by the Federal Networking Council
Security Working Group. Workshop participants include industry, Federal and user
community representatives. Specific topics addressed include: * Security
technologies now available and in development * Security requirements of
Federal, industrial, educational and foreign networks and users * Requirements
for creation or enhancement of existing institutions to handle crisis response,
public keys, etc. * Need for research in security techniques The result is a
report detailing the workshop conclusions, and is available in printed form and
on the Internet.
