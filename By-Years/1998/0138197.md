AST-0138197&lt;br/&gt;Harlander, John M.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique,
innovative Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) will be designed and built to
map the [O II] 3727 forbidden emission in the Galaxy. These data will be
combined with similar data recorded of longer wavelength emission lines to
determine the physical parameters of the hot interstellar medium. The results
will influence work in star formation, and galactic dynamics as well as work in
the hot interstellar medium. This innovative approach to instrumentation will
also have application to other areas of astronomy. This work will support one
graduate student and one undergraduate. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
