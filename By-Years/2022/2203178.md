This project is a multi-year research plan to develop new tools for the study of
the structure of transformation groups and mapping class groups. The
transformation groups such as diffeomorphism groups and homeomorphism groups of
a manifold describe all symmetries of the manifold. A manifold is a space that
is locally a Euclidean space. The surface of the earth, the surface of a donut
and our three or four dimensional universe are all examples of manifolds. The
mapping class group is a reduced form of the homeomorphism group of a manifold,
in which two transformations are identified if they can be connected by a path
of transformations. These objects have connections with many areas of
mathematics, including geometric topology, geometric group theory, dynamics,
number theory, quantum field theory, representation theory, and algebraic
geometry. This project studies a number of questions about the structure of
symmetries of manifolds. Broader impacts of these efforts include reading groups
for graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously, in a joint work with
Kathryn Mann, the principal investigator has proved Ghys' dimension conjecture
that given two manifolds M and N, if the homeomorphism group of M has a
nontrivial homomorphism to the homeomorphism group of N, then the dimension of M
must be less than or equal to the dimension of N. To prove this, an "Orbit
Classification Theorem" is developed, which says that every orbit of such a
homomorphism is homeomorphic to a cover of some configuration space of M. This
finding has a potential to give more results about classifying homomorphisms
between transformation groups. Since we have figured out all orbits, now the
challenge is to understand how to glue those orbits inside the manifold N.
Another line of work studies the projection map from the transformation group to
the mapping class group. In particular, we ask which subgroups of the mapping
class group have sections under the projection, where the existence of sections
implies that the surface bundle that the subgroup determines will admit a flat
structure. In previous work on this subgroup question the principal investigator
has proved several results using techniques of "hidden torsion" and rotation
number. More tools will be developed specifically to attack this question.
Another direction to explore concerns diffeomorphism groups of high dimensional
manifolds, specifically, whether there is an example of an infinite torsion
group that acts faithfully on some manifold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
