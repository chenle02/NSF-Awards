The objective of this research project is to develop a novel technology for
successful micro injection molding with respect to lower cycle time and better
replication as compared to the existing technology. This will be accomplished by
rapidly heating the mold surface so that the melt can fill the cavity
isothermally and yet be processed within the normal injection molding cycle
time. Plastics have so far played only a subordinate role in the multibillion-
dollar microsystem industry. A commercial breakthrough strongly depends on means
of low cost mass fabrication with dimensional accuracy and good part quality.
Widely used mass-production methods involving polymeric materials such as
injection molding, however, require significant modification to adapt to micro
molding applications. One of the hurdles limiting the current technical
capability in micro injection molding is that the molten polymer in a tiny
cavity instantaneously freezes upon contacting the relatively cold cavity wall.
The problem gets worse when micro features with higher aspect ratio are to be
molded. The three phase research plan includes an experimental component devoted
to creating a flexible micro molding fixture, the second phase will be to
conduct processing experiments with several thermoplastics, and the final phase
will be the characterization of micro scale flow behaviors for this micro
injection molding process. This research project will also yield much needed
experimental data regarding the effect of microscale phenomena on the flow
behavior of polymeric materials.

It is expected that development of the integrated technology will push the
current technical envelope of micro injection molding further into those areas
that have so far been predominated by etching- and lithography- based
fabrications. This can lead to 3-D microfabrication of structurally designed
parts.
