Proposal ID: CCF - 0939976 &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Design Automation Summer
School 2009&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Shang Li &lt;br/&gt;Title: University of Colorado
at Boulder &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of active researchers in the
field of Electronic Design Automation is organizing a summer school in the form
of a workshop for young researchers in the field. The summer school will be co-
located with the annual Design Automation Conference (DAC) to be held in San
Francisco in July 2009. DAC is the main annual event and a major conference in
the field that is to be expected to be attended by most active researchers in
the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop speakers will be mostly
established and prominent researchers in the field of microelectronic design
automation. The fact that the summer school is co-located will be an added
advantage in that the most speakers at the workshop will not need to spend
additional effort for their travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past similar
groups have organized very similar events that have been very successful in
bringing young generation of researchers up to speed with state of the art tools
and techniques in modern electronic design automation. &lt;br/&gt;This workshop
is expected to have a similar impact.&lt;br/&gt;
