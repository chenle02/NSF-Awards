This is a Research Planning Grant for a woman scientist. It is a study of
identity transformation in drug addiction, examining the impact of cultural,
social-structural, and personal factors. It extends the internal and external
validity, chiefly in conceptual coherence and scope, of an identity-based
etiological model of addiction that has earlier demonstrated success in
explaining the identity transformations of addicts following their movement into
drug addiction. A research instrument will be constructed and preliminary
analysis will be undertaken, including instrument refinement, using a stratified
probability sample of diverse individuals (whites and blacks, males and females)
seeking treatment for drug addiction in Michigan. The results of the ultimate
research project promise to produce a more culturally and structurally inclusive
identity-based etiological model of drug addiction and an increased
understanding of the link between maco-sociological and micro-sociological
processes in identity formation. %%% This project will contribute to solution of
a difficult social problem with extensive policy implications, and it will
extend an important scientific theory concerning the ways that personal and
social factors shape an individual's self-image. In addition, it will assist a
woman scientist in establishing a productive research career.
