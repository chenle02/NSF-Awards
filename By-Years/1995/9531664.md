*** Smith The Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the Rice Quantum
Institute of Rice University will be continued. The main objective of the
program is to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to observe and
participate in research in a highly-interdisciplinary university research
environment with strong faculty support. The program has, and will continue to
focus on active participation in research, but also strives to show the
participants how the research funding process works, give them insight into
applications of basic research, and provide them with an understanding of the
fundamental motivations for research activity. Each undergraduate becomes
affiliated with one of the 25 research groups at the Quantum Institute, and
works on an independent project that he/she can bring to completion in the
allotted ten-week time frame. In addition to research activities, a special
seminar series for the participants is organized in which invited speakers deal
with topics ranging from "hot" topics in research, commercial applications of
basic research, entrepreneurship, graduate schools, opportunities for
employment, and other topics. ***
