9601241 Liu This is a 24 month award proposed by Dr. Philip Liu, Cornell
University and Professor Ming-Kuang Hsu, Taiwan National Ocean University. It
requests funds for participation by a graduate student and for travel to Taiwan.
The primary objective of this project is to produce a tsunami inundation map for
the entire Taiwan coastline. The tasks include validation of the numerical model
and use of the numerical model to predict the effect of tsunami inundation along
the Taiwan coastline. An educational videotape will be produced to illustrate
the generation, propagation, and the coastal effect of tsunami. Tsunami are
among the most disastrous natural calamities on the shore of the Pacific. Recent
and older observations have demonstrated the suddenness of tsunami occurrence
along the Taiwan coast. This is a very practical and important project, which
not only can validate the P.I.'s tsunami inundation model, but also provide a
tool for future land use planning and for reducing potential damage from these
natural hazards. Furthermore, this project provides an excellent opportunity for
a graduate student to have a hands-on experience to carry out a project in an
environment significantly different from the U.S. The project is jointly
supported by the Taiwan National Science Council and the NSF.
