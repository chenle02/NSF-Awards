The Standard Model describes elementary particle interactions in terms of gauge
theories: Quantumchromodynamics (QCD) for the strong interactions and the
Glashow-Weinberg- Salam agreement with experiment. However, it does not
naturally explain the particle mass spectrum, the breaking of electroweak gauge
symmetry, or the different strengths of the QCD and GWS couplings: these
deficiencies strongly indicate the existence of a Higgs particle and possible
new interactions at energies which will become available in the near future.
Perturbation theory, a power series expansion, may be used to study QCD at high
energies. However, the expansion parameter is not small and higher-order
corrections are substantial. These corrections will be computed for various
lepton and hadron reactions to obtain reliable predictions of cross section
normalizations, and transverse momentum and other distributions. These
predictions will allow for more precise tests of QCD; they will aid in studying
non-perturbative effects due to strong quark-gluon forces in initial-state
hadrons and in hadron jets; and they will facilitate unambiguous identification
of signals of the electroweak and possible new interactions. Production of GWS
gauge bosons and of the Higgs boson will be studied: signals will be compared
with QCD backgrounds, and unusual signals which exhibit properties, such as
parity-violation, that are not shared by the background will be identified.
These results, to be obtained by a very highly-regarded and capable elementary
particle theorist, will enable precision tests of the Standard Model to be made
at accelerators presently in operation or under construction, and will aid in
the design and execution of experiments searching for new particles and
interactions at future super colliders.
