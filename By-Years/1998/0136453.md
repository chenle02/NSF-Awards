Sabre Kais of Purdue University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply the finite scaling method
in several related projects. First, the finite size scaling method will be
adapted for studying the critical behavior of a quantum Hamiltonian as a
function of a set of parameters. This method will be generalized using Gaussian
basis sets to search for new stable multiply-charged anions in the gas phase. As
well, methods will be developed to predict and calculate the formation of
resonances for atomic and molecular anions. Next, the Feynmann path integral
approach will be used to advance the finite size scaling method for mapping
quantum problems to effective classical lattice systems. The method will be
combined with other simulation techniques to obtain critical parameters for
molecular systems. Finally, finite size scaling will be explored to enable
correlation of structural and thermodynamic properties of small clusters with
their corresponding bulk matter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long-term goal of this
research is the creation of a single approach that will enable accurate
computational chemistry calculations for atomic, molecular, and cluster
properties at the lowest effective cost. Success in this area could obviate the
need to carry out mundane or even hazardous experiments to determine necessary
chemical information. This work could also permit the exploration of transient
chemical species that could otherwise be difficult or impossible to study
experimentally.
