This project continues mathematical work into qualitative and quantitative
properties of special functions. Although any class of functions can be termed
special, those of interest are those that appear as the solutions of certain
important problems. They arise as solutions of differential equations, matrix
elements of representations of quantum groups, tools in the analysis of birth
and death processes and as basic ingredients in approximation theory. Special
functions have different forms. Among the earliest studied are those represented
by series: polynomials for finite series and hypergeometric functions occurring
as infinite series. Perhaps the most outstanding mathematical question of the
day concerns the location of the roots of a particular special function, the
Riemann zeta function. In addition, the work of one of the world's most
remarkable mathematicians, Srinivasa Ramanujan, centered almost exclusively on
special functions. Work will be done combining advanced techniques of computer
graphics with past work on hypergeometric functions to seek out new and
unexpected properties which have been missed. Some progress has been made in
this direction through the observation that the maximum modulus of Legendre
polynomials increases with the degree of the polynomial. Further work will
concentrate on monotonicity properties of special functions as the degree or
other parameters change. These properties suggest other applications such as
area under curves and behavior of roots. One result of this type contributed the
key to resolving the famous Bieberbach conjecture several years ago.
