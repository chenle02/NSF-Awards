This project provides improved learning opportunities in mathematics, chemistry
and physics for engineering majors through the creation of a microcomputer
laboratory designed to support instruction in these courses.To demystify the
abstract nature of these courses, engineering majors need an environment in
which they can interact with one another in working complex experiments and in
solving problems with an increased interdisciplinary base. An instructor-
developed program to track both student time and their level of success on
computer assignments will become an integral part of these courses. Feedback
from the program will advise students of their progress toward skill development
in time to secure assistance, if necessary. Feedback to the instructor regarding
the nature and extent of student progress toward required skills will allow the
learning process to inform the teaching process on a cyclical basis.To implement
the proposed change in the instructional process within math and science
courses, a series of computer modules will be created to support the new
methodology. These modules will be based on existing course topics but designed
to provide students with the opportunity to: Practice with problem solving;
Discover underlying concepts and principles; Interrelate learning between
disciplines; Investigate complex and tedious problems; and, Compete effectively
in an increasingly technologically literate and student population.
