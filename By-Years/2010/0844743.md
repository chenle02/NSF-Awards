Some of the most important advances in the understanding of nervous system
function have been made by exploring animal species with particularly well-
developed senses and behaviors. For example, much of the understanding of neuron
function is based on studies of the giant axon of the squid. In the current
project, the neurobiology and behavior of the star-nosed mole will be
investigated with the goal of revealing general principles of nervous system
organization, function, and plasticity. Star-nosed moles have an exceptional
sense of touch, including mechanosensory organs that are used to make rapid
discriminations based on nearly microscopic textures. This species provides a
model for exploring the mammalian sense of touch, including simulation of
mechanoreceptor function and investigation of parallel processing of touch
information in the neocortex. Because the neocortex is a hallmark of the
mammalian nervous system and is especially large in humans, there is a
particular interest in understanding the basic organization across species and
how it evolved. These studies are also valuable for teaching because the animals
are unique and interesting to students and the public. The questions that must
be addressed will take the investigators and students through a journey of
discovery that ranges from the animal in its natural environment at one extreme
to the anatomy and physiology of single cells at the other extreme. The
investigations will include many different training opportunities for graduate
and undergraduate students. These include studies of neuroanatomy and
electrophysiology in a laboratory setting and studies of behavior and ecology in
the field.
