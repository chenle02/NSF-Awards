Geoffrey Coates, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell
University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program for his continued work on biodegradable and low environmental
impact polymers. Coates will use metal-based catalysts to prepare polymers and
copolymers with precise architectural control, imparting superior properties and
allowing important applications. More specifically, beta-diiminate zinc
complexes will be developed as catalysts for epoxide/carbon dioxide
copolymerization and lactone polymerization. Chiral catalysts based on hybrid
imine/oxazoline ligands will be developed, potentially leading to optically
active, tactic polycarbonates. The detailed mechanistic pathways of these
reactions will also be studied, which should increase the rate of discovery of
improved catalysts for these polymerizations.

The environmental impact of industrially important plastics can be minimized by
using renewable feedstocks and preparing biodegradable polymers. New catalysts
and new reactions will be used to contribute to sustainable development.
Students will be trained in catalyst synthesis, polymer synthesis and polymer
characterization. Public understanding of science and particularly plastics will
be enhanced through chemical demonstrations and mass media.
