The transition from fully limbed to limbless body plans has occurred repeatedly
in many unrelated groups of reptiles. This project will investigate the process
of limb reduction and loss, and how the patterns of limb changes are correlated
with genetic patterns of species relationships in burrowing lizards of the skink
genus Brachymeles from Southeast Asia. Species in this group exhibit a full
range of limb development, including fully limbed, intermediate, and limbless
forms. By integrating genetic data, measurements of body form, ecology, and
geography, this study will provide a basis for testable hypotheses in studies of
limb loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be the first study to investigate
fine-scale population genetic patterns associated with limb reduction and loss
related to a burrowing lifestyle. Fieldwork will involve Philippine students and
local communities. Collaborative efforts with the Philippine-American Education
Foundation will provide opportunities for Philippine-American and American
Fulbright Fellows. Results will be used to develop exhibits on evolution of limb
reduction at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum. Finally, this
project is expected to enhance the known reptile diversity in SE Asia, and
provide avenues for future collaborative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
