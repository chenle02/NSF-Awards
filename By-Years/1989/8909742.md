The project will develop beds of partially oriented, ion-exchange short fibers
for the chromagraphic separation of proteins. Theory predicts this configuration
has the potential for having both high adsorption capacity and high flow rates.
The fiber will be a cross linked polyethyleneimine on a magnetized macroporous
polysulfone support. The fibers will be packed in the presence of a magnetic
field. Studies will be performed to determine conditions under which the bed of
fibers is partially oriented. Once the desired packing is developed, separations
will be performed on six proteins to determine the relative advantages and
disadvantages of using partially oriented fibers. Realization of much of the
promise of biotechnology depends upon new separation processes. Large-scale
column chromatography is one of the most promising future technologies.
Conventional columns generally face a trade-off between high-capacity and large
pressure drops. If partially oriented, ion-exchange, short fiber beds can
simultaneously achieve low pressure drops and high-surface areas they will
undoubtedly find important applications in biotechnology.
