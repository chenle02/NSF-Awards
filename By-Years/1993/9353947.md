9353947 Russell The project will address the needs of community college faculty
in learning the latest in modern chemistry methods through a workshop involving
exposure to modern instrumental methods as well as computer simulation
techniques to allow instructional experience on equipment not readily available
to their students. Senior research faculty at UCLA will give lectures on
molecular modeling, computational chemistry, multinuclear NMR, GC-MS, Fourier
Transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy. The workshop
participants will solve typical student problems in these areas; they will learn
to use the instruments, and they will adapt existing UCLA freshman chemistry
instructional modules using these techniques to their own settings. ***
