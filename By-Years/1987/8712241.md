Background radiations which bathe the Universe provide important clues to the
history of the Universe and can even influence its evolution. A search for a
background of gravitational radiation in the mHz frequency range by observing
the normal modes of the earth shall be undertaken. The approximately two hundred
station-years of data collected by the Project IDA global network of
seismometers will be analyzed to look for any residual excitations of the
quadrupole modes of the earth. In addition a calculation of the level of
excitations of these modes by known terrestrial sources will facilitate the
evaluation of the ultimate usefulness of the earth as a gravitational wave
detector.
