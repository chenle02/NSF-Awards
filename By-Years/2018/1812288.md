The contemporary subject of Random Matrix Theory has emerged as a viable model
framework for the analysis of complex random systems comprised of many highly
correlated components. Such systems are ubiquitous in mathematics and nature,
ranging from complex number-theoretic functions, to atomic nuclei, to public
transit systems. This project will develop new techniques for the spectral
analysis of a broad class of random matrices whose distribution is immune to the
action of a continuous group of symmetries. The novel approach which will be
developed has the potential to dramatically expand our current understanding of
this important paradigm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
bring new methods from algebraic combinatorics and geometry (Weingarten
calculus, Hurwitz theory) to the study of invariant ensembles of random
matrices, developing a new approach to the spectral theory of these ensembles
which is very general and robust. Specifically, the goal of the project is to
develop an analogue of Wigner's moment method which specifically targets
invariant ensembles. This approach will be used to analyze spectral statistics
of invariant ensembles of random matrices, in both the single-matrix and more
general multi-matrix cases. The moment method developed is not limited to random
matrices with an absolutely continuous law; in particular, it is applicable to
discrete mixtures of orbital measures. This leads to important new connections
between random matrix theory and statistical
mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
