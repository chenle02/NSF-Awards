Experiments are a central methodology in political science. Scholars from every
subfield regularly turn to experiments. Practitioners rely on experimental
evidence in evaluating social programs, policies, institutions, and information
provision. It is thus not surprising that experiments constitute an integral
part of undergraduate and graduate curricula. Over the last five years,
approaches to social science experimentation have evolved greatly, due in part
to the "replication crisis" - that is, findings of low replication rates of
experiments. At the same time, political scientists have expanded the reach of
experiments by tapping new data sources (e.g., elite samples) and introducing
methods that had previously received scant attention in the discipline (e.g.,
conjoint experiments).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to ensure that the
discipline successfully navigates questions about the reliability and
replicability of experiments and fully exploits methodological advances, the
project would gather participants for a workshop, "Advances in Experimental
Political Science." The workshop papers will later be published in a volume by
the same name. This is a follow-up to a 2009 workshop on experimentation
supported by the National Science Foundation, and the resulting publication of
the widely-used Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science. That
workshop and volume came at a time when experiments were still an emergent
methodology in political science. The aforementioned debates and developments
mean that we are now at a crucial time to hold another workshop and publish a
new collected volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
