The Fellow will study the tectonic evolution of the northern East Humboldt
Range, Nevada, by integrating the results of detailed field, structural,
thermochronologic, and thermobarometric studies to constrain the tectonic
history of what are probably the deepest- seated rocks in the Great Basin.
Comparisons and contrasts will be made of the macrostructural, micro-structural,
petrological, and crystallographic fabric data with the Saxony granulite terrain
in eastern Germany, by using scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe,
and x-ray facilities in Zurich, where the Fellow has chosen to spend his
fellowship at the Geologisches Institut of the Eidgenossische Technische
Hochschule (ETH).
