The goal of this research is the design, analysis, and implementation of
algorithms and data structures for a collection of geometric computational
tools. These tools are chosen to directly address existing computational
problems in application areas including data compression, molecular biology,
geographic information systems, and computational fluid dynamics. In particular
the following areas are considered. (1) Practical algorithms and data structures
for nearest neighbor searching in high dimensions, and applications to problems
in data compression. (2) Algorithms and data structures for detecting
intersections and simulating the motion of a set of moving objects in two and
three dimensional space. (3) Construction and maintenance of triangulations with
specified shape requirements and applications to geographic information systems
and mesh generation in computational fluid dynamics. Emphasis is on practical,
implementable to these problems, and both theoretical and empirical analyses of
their performance.
