An innovative new capstone course, Radiation and Photobiology, challenges
senior-level undergraduates to synthesize disparately acquired knowledge from
the physical and life sciences into a common intellectual investigative field.
Content areas such as photochemistry, photosensitization, environmental effects
of high-energy radiation, circadian rhythms, vision, photomorphogenesis,
photomovement, photosynthesis, and bioluminescence are developed in an
investigative laboratory format.
