P.I.: LUTZ, Richard A. Proposal #: 9529819 Keeping in mind that the program
weighs secondary considerations in the individual award/no-award decisions, it
is still informative to look at the numerical rating statistics to have some
feeling for the level of competition for available funds. For the regular
panels, award rates are currently about 15% of the total proposals received. We
have made recent efforts to let the reviewers and panels know clearly what the
general level of competition for funds is like, expecting that evaluations of
individuals proposals and discrimination among proposal will be influenced to a
degree by this information. In this panel, 50% of the proposals had average
numerical mail review rankings of very good or better (~2.0 on a scale where
1=Excellent and 5=Poor). With the pressures of increased costs of doing research
(and increased dollar requests in proposals), the directive to make longer-term
awards, the consistently large number of proposals submitted to the regular
panels, and with no increases in funds to support research in areas not
identified as strategic initiatives, the Program expects that we will continue
to face the unpleasant reality of not recommending many important, worthy and
high-rated proposals for support by the Foundation.
