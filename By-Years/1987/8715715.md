Large scale system simulation of long term power system dynamics has proved to
be a vexing problem with respect to cost and accuracy of solutions. This
proposal suggests a new approach termed a multi.grid scheme (multi.grid in both
time and space) which increases parallelism and speeds up the iterative process.
Analytical investigations into questions of rates and regions of convergence are
also proposed.
