9521254 Gilbert This project will study the composition, biological
availability, and rates of uptake and release of dissolved organic nitrogen in
two highly contrasting estuarine systems- the Chesapeake Bay and Georgia coastal
rivers. These systems are vastly different with respect to the type, source and
relative liability of dissolved organic nitrogen. Because the Principal
Investigators will conduct their studies in conjunction with the two currently
funded Land Margin Ecosystem Research studies at the these sites, the results
will greatly enhance the understanding of these important coastal aquatic
environments. The significance of the proposed research is several fold. First,
in the broadcast, sense the eutrophication of nation's coastal waters and
estuaries is a well recognized problem, yet we have little knowledge of the
contribution and importance of organic nitrogen to this problem. Second, with
the advent of new techniques, these studies will yield and appreciation of the
mechanisms by which both bacteria and phytoplankton obtain their nitrogenous
nitrogen will aid our ability to balance and control the flow of nitrogen
through estuarine and coastal systems.
