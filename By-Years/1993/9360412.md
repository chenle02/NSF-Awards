9360412 Abramovich In the past decade seismologists have witnessed a spectacular
development in seismic instrumentation. Broad band seismometers now routinely
record signals down to milliHertzs with a dynamic range approaching 140dB. Data
collected by these instruments teach us much about the Earth's structure and
seismic wave propagation. However, increasing demand to sample the wavefield
with a much higher density cannot be satisfied by the use of these very
expensive instruments. There is a strong need for inexpensive, portable
seismometers with a broad band frequency response and dynamic range around 120
dB. We propose to develop a new seismometer based on molecular electronic
technology. Previous attempts to use this technology have failed, especially in
achieving acceptable transfer characteristics and long term parameter stability.
Our preliminary theoretical and experimental studies have yielded new methods of
overcoming these problems, which have allowed us to build and successfully test
first conceptual prototypes. Our research would focus on proving the feasibility
of a practical implementation of a molecular electronic seismometer with a
consistent, broad frequency response and wide dynamic range. These instruments
would be compact, rugged (no moving parts), very inexpensive and well fitted for
field installation (no precise equilibration required).
