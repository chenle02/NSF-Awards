An Engineering Optics Laboratory for undergraduate students in the areas of
physical optics, optical communications, integrated optics, lasers and
optoelectronics is being developed. The laboratory complements the theoretical
courses being taught in the department at the undergraduate level. Six
reconfigurable work stations are used for setting up various experiments to
demonstrate the fundamental concepts of optics and provide knowledge of the
basic optical phenomena and usage of optical elements, sources, detectors and
instrumentation. Students perform specific experiments as suggested by the
instructor as well as explore the world of optics on their own.
