The research will investigate the integration of a number of sensors and
actuation mechanisms to form a robust robot controller. Principal research
issues are: (1) the subdivision of the task to allow for concurrent planning and
execution by the sensor and action systems, or "agents", (2) the integration of
a number of disparate partial sensor observations from these agents into a
"best" statistical estimate of task state; and (3) the development of a real
time programming system to support such a distributed agent system. The project
will also investigate language primitives for expressing timing constraints
within agents, distributed scheduling of agent execution, and inter-agent
communication requirements.
