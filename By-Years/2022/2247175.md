Complex variables are used throughout mathematics and have important
applications to engineering, physics and other scientific disciplines. This
project will clarify and enhance the scientific understanding of phenomena
observed in several complex variables. The results of this project will lead to
significant advances related to commonly used tools, operators, and partial
differential equations that originate in the study of multidimensional complex
analysis. In addition, the project will aid the development of early career
researchers at both the graduate and postdoctoral
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work to be carried out in the project initiates
from a fundamental partial differential equation in the theory of several
complex variables known as the d-bar Neumann problem. The problems to be
considered interact with numerous areas of mathematics, and outcomes from this
research will push the frontier of knowledge in partial differential equations,
potential theory, differential geometry, and operator theory. The project will
further the research of the Principal Investigator on the connection between
global regularity of the d-bar Neumann operator and the Diederich-Fornaess
index. In addition, the Principal Investigator and the co-Principal Investigator
will collaborate on a study of the relationship between compactness of the d-bar
Neumann operator and the local boundary structure at weakly pseudoconvex
boundary points for a domain in complex Euclidean space. Finally, the Principal
Investigator, in collaboration with his PhD student, will study operators
between Bergman spaces of domains in complex space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
