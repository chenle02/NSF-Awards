The PI's goal in this exploratory research is to tackle the fundamental obstacle
preventing high quality, interactive animation of natural phenomena, namely the
enormous number of degrees of freedom involved. Because hand animating a typical
mesh is a tedious and time consuming task, computer graphics has turned to
physics and simulation to animate most natural phenomena. In this context, the
promise of simulation is generality; an infinite space of material properties
and initial conditions can be explored. This generality is also simulation's
greatest limitation; the space of possible animations is vast, while the space
of desirable animations is a great deal smaller. The PI's approach is to use
simulation's strength (its ability to create rich animation data under a variety
of conditions) to combat its greatest limitations (high dimensionality and
computational expense).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To this end, he will develop
machine learning tools for finding new and more expressive low-dimensional
representations, which do not describe all possible animations but rather
succinctly describe the space of desirable animations. Previous attempts to
apply machine learning to the animation of natural phenomena have shown promise,
but also significant limitations. These approaches have suffered from over-
fitting, have sacrificed locality, and have not allowed artistic control over
the space of possible animations. Furthermore, these approaches have been too
data-driven, failing to allow for the input of valuable human knowledge and
intuition or mathematical and physical models. Until these limitations are
addressed, the promise of high-quality interactive computer animation of natural
phenomena will remain out of reach. For concreteness the PI will focus on cloth
and fluids as test bed domains (initially assuming an algorithmic paradigm of
coarse simulation enhanced by data-driven upsampling operators), for which he
will explore questions of sparseness, expanded feature sets, combining
operators, and artistic control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:
Simulation is a powerful technique whose usefulness is not limited to computer
animation. So while the test bed domains fall within the realm of traditional
computer graphics, project outcomes will allow for high-quality, interactive
computer animation of natural phenomena across all of science and engineering,
with particular applicability to film, video games, virtual reality, medical
training, etc. Moreover, the unique context of computer animation will
necessarily require new machine learning algorithms that will feed back into
that community as well. The PI plans to develop and release the majority of his
source code under free BSD licenses.
