9601684 Mahdavi This project is for equipment at the Center for Building
Performance and Diagnostics (CBPD), NSF I/UCRC (Industry- University Cooperative
Research Center) at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), for measurement
instrumentation to enrich and continue significant research in the building
science and engineering domain, such as energy consumption, environmental
sustainability, economic growth, worker productivity, and public health;
involving research, education, and demonstration to make a significant impact on
the current approaches and practices both in the building science as well as in
the building industry. The equipment will provide for: a weather station,
thermal diagnostics, acoustics, visual diagnostics, sensing and control
components. and utility distribution models. ***
