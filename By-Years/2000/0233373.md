&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0233373 Sukumar This two-year award for US-
France collaboration in materials engineering involves researchers at University
of California, Davis and the Ecole Centrale de Nantes. Natarajan Sukumar in the
US and Nicolas Moes in France lead this cooperative project to develop a three-
dimensional computational model for non-planar crack growth. Crack growth is a
complex multi-physics phenomena in which global macroscopic material behavior
and local microscopic features play a role in the failure process. The
development of robust computer simulation tools for crack growth can lead to a
better understanding of the dominant modes of failure and provide improvements
in designing stronger and tougher materials, such as alloys. In developing a
model simulation, the US and French investigators propose to use the
computational method known as the extended finite based element technique. In
this collaboration, the French investigator provides expertise in data
structures, domain integrals and components of the code that will facilitate the
development of the crack growth model. This award provides travel funds and
living expenses for one-month visits to France by the US investigators.
