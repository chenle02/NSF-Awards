This fifth annual "2013 Graduate Student mini-Conference in Computational
Mathematics" will be held at Clemson University on February 8 and 9, 2013.
Topics covered in the conference consist of recent advances in the theory and
implementation of numerical methods for partial differential equations,
including multiphase flow in porous media, numerical methods for stochastic
PDEs, turbulence fluid dynamics, climate simulation and PDE constrained
optimization. Aside from one plenary speaker, all talks will be given by
graduate students.

Approximately twenty graduate students from Clemson, Virginia Tech, the
University of Pittsburgh, Auburn University, the University of Tennessee,
Florida State University and Emory University will present scientific research
talks involving mathematical modeling in science and engineering, and rigorous
analysis and efficient implementation of numerical methods for the modeling
equations. The goals of the conference are to give graduate students an
opportunity to give a professional scientific talk, and to bring graduate
students and researchers together to discuss collaborative research projects and
to exchange new ideas in many challenging research areas. The conference
organizers strongly encourage participation of under-represented groups.
