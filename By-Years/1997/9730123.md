9730123 SUN This award provides funding for an Engineering Research Centers
(ERC) Program/Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST)
Program Partnership between the Engineering Research Center for Collaborative
Manufacturing at Purdue University and the Crest Center for Innovative
Manufacturing of High Performance Materials at Tuskegee University entitled
"Design, Analysis, and Manufacture of Connectors Joining Components of Advanced
Composite Materials." Purdue's ERC and Tuskegee's CREST share a common interest
in the manufacture of advanced materials and structural components. While Purdue
focuses on developing close collaboration with industry in conducting the
research, Tuskegee places more emphasis on enhancing its research capability and
on its equallu important objectives in education. This project will provide a
meaningful linkup between these two Centers, from which both Centers will
benefit in fulfilling and expanding their goals. The research proposed is to
develop connectors for joining composite structural components which calls for
an integrated design, analysis, and manufacture of efficient and effective
connectors for tubular and sandwich composite structures.
