This award funds a cooperative research effort between US and Latvian
researchers. Mores specifically, this project supports the travel expenses of a
Latvian researcher to visit the University of Maryland for the collaborative
research with the PI. The award period is for two years. The research examines
issues in the area of machine learning. The project studies relative sizes of
the hypothesis space that a learning algorithm must search through in order to
find a correct solution. Several new views of learning by examples are used for
investigation. The project also generalizes regular expressions, which are
extensions of the term rewriting systems for which practical learning algorithms
have been implemented. The project develops techniques for extending these
implementations to a broader class of functions.
