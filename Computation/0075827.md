Lega 0075827 The investigator uses numerical simulations and analytic techniques
related to amplitude equations to study pattern formation dynamics in swimming
bacteria, wave number selection in a Swift-Hohenberg equation modeling traveling
wave patterns, and traveling hole solutions of the complex Ginsburg-Landau
equation. The broad topics of pattern formation and the behavior of patterns are
widely important in mathematics and in application areas. The investigator
studies the conditions under which certain equations have solutions that show
such patterns, and what these patterns say about the underlying physical or
biological problems.
