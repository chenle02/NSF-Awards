Searching for planets around other stars is an extremely difficult technical
endeavor, yet the scientific benefits include understanding the circumstances
that led to the development of life on Earth and estimating the number of
planetary systems that resemble our own solar system. This project exploits the
latest technical advances in astronomical methods to obtain images of Jupiter-
like planets that may orbit a sample of 600 stars very close to the Sun. This
survey for planetary systems will also map the locations of asteroid and comet
belts in other planetary systems. It will also help identify nearby stars that
should be targeted by future searches for smaller planets located in the
habitable zones around these nearby stars. Graduate and undergraduate students
will participate in all phases of this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
cornerstone of the project is a 600-star, three-year, direct-imaging survey to
be conducted with the recently commissioned Gemini Planet Imager at the Gemini
South 8-meter telescope. The architectures of planetary systems beyond 5 AU will
be probed, a region that is mostly inaccessible by transit and RV techniques.
The team will also obtain follow-up observations at other facilities such as
HST, Keck and ALMA. The key deliverables are: (a) multi-epoch astrometric
measurements of directly detected exoplanets in order to calculate their orbital
elements, (b) high resolution maps of the spatial distribution of dust grains
associated with the collisional erosion of planetesimals in debris disks, and
(c) analytic and numerical tools to infer the past, present and future dynamical
interactions between planets and planetesimals.
