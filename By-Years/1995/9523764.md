ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS 95-23764 Ain A. Sonin This project will be a study
the problem of capillary driven motion of a molten material spreading over a
solid that is below the meltOs fusion point. Solidification takes place
simultaneously with spreading, making the flow process much more complex than
the isothermal moving contact line problem. The objective of this work is to
develop a fundamental understanding of the dynamic processes that occur when a
molten droplet touches a cold solid, spreads partly over it by capillary action,
and freezes. The focus will be on conditions where the moving contact line plays
a strong role in the dynamics. Research of this nature is of great importance to
evolving methods of materials processing based on molten material deposition,
such as the precise fabrication of objects from microdrop units. The work will
be both experimental and theoretical.
