Multimode heat transfer in turbulent flows will be investigated. Many widely
varying industrial processes - chemical vapor deposition, drying of textiles and
foodstuffs, solder reflow of surface mount circuit boards, polymer injection
molding, combustion, and countless others - have a significant dependence of
heat transfer by convection, conduction and radiation. Employing the spectral
method and focusing on multimode heat transfer problems, more efficient and
accurate numerical schemes will be developed to permit a much closer
correspondence between academic research and industrial applications in heat and
mass transfer. The construction of new experiments designed to rigorously test
and validate the numerical predictions, as well as to provide detailed
measurements and insight to the physical processes that are observed. Together,
the experiments and calculations will proved much information about the
complicated transport phenomena present in modern technological application.//
