9731233 Gaines The University of Miami provides a 36-month Teacher and Student
Development Through Research Experience project. The project engages 27 seventh
grade students and 9 teachers each summer in ecological research focused on the
Florida environment. Teams of 6 participants each work with a faculty researcher
and an undergraduate facilitator on an on-going project during the 6-week summer
experience. Follow-on occurs as teachers transfer the research experience into
their classrooms, data collection continues at the summer field sites,
schoolyard environmental research projects are developed, and students and
teachers engage in a WWW-based research community.
