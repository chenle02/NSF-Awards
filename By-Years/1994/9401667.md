9401667 Paul The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary physics research project
between Dr. Peter Paul of the State University of New York and Dr. Istvan
Dioszegi of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Isotopes is to
examine heavy nuclei where the collectivity of giant resonances is well
developed. Specifically, the researchers will explore the evolution of nuclear
shape and measure the viscosity of nuclear matter as a function of temperature
in heavy ion fusion-fission reactions. The researchers intend to determine these
parameters from giant dipole resonance. The associated reaction mechanism will
also be studied. Results are expected to contribute to our basic knowledge of
superheavy elements. This project in nuclear physics fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
