Interdisciplinary (99) Interdisciplinary understanding first within and then
among biology, earth science, and physical science is being attained by early
childhood through eighth grade (EC-8) preservice teachers by incorporating
inquiry and case based instruction into the science curriculum. The strategies
developed by French and Ulrich and further elaborated by Russell and French in
mixed major/non-major biology courses are being adapted for use in
interdisciplinary science courses designed for preservice teachers preparing for
EC-8 certification. The courses support the National Science Education Standards
and facilitate modeling of exemplary inquiry based science teaching. Outcomes
being achieved include: a) enhanced courses in science linked to unifying
concepts in the state and national standards, b) improved understanding of
science content and the nature of science both within and among science
disciplines, c) improved preservice teacher attitudes toward science, and d)
improved preservice teacher perceived efficacy in teaching science. Results of
the project are being disseminated nationally.
