This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new
category of high energy density nanocomposite dielectric materials for use in
high pulse power capacitors. The approach is to bring together 3 nanostructures
in a polypropylene matrix to form a novel nanocomposite material with high
effective dielectric constant, high breakdown voltage, and low dissipation
factor.

These high-performance nanocomposite dielectric materials may be used in many
commercial high-power pulse, fast pulse, and high-energy density capacitors,
resulting in reduced size, reduced weight, and improved circuit design. The
commercial opportunities include high density electronic devices and packaging
for medical, communication, transportation, and power distribution systems, in
products such as defibrillators, medical and commercial lasers, pulse forming
networks, A.C. motors, ultrasonic transducer exciter, strobe lighting, and
acceleration and energy recovery systems of automobiles.
