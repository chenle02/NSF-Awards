A unified education curriculum will be initiated at the Freshman level in the
College of Engineering and Architecture at Prairie View A&M University. Four
courses will be integrated into a two semester course sequence emphasizing
creativity and conceptualization in the preparation of the engineering students.
If successful, the results will attract and motivate students to remain in
engineering.
