Funding is requested to support acquisition of workstations (1 Texas
Instruments Explorer LX, and 3 Digital Equipment Corp. AI VAXstation-GPX) to
upgrade the computing facilities at the Center for Automation and Intelligent
Systems Research. This upgrade will benefit various research projects
emphasizing artificial intelligence tools and techniques for enhancing the
productivity of manufacturing industry. Some of the current projects are:
investigation of meta-interpreters for expert systems, introspection
capabilities in Rummelhart associative networks for pattern recognition and
mechanization of discovery, a domain-independent expert system for scheduling,
tactile sensing for robotic manipulation, and the use of expert systems to
improve productivity in the production of "high-technology" metal parts with
challenging specifications.
