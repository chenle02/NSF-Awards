This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the Chemistry Division
under the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. This research will
focus on the synthesis of organic-inorganic designer solids, specifically thin
films fabricated in a layer-by-layer fashion with two-dimensional periodicity
parallel to the surface and total control of the composition in the
perpendicular direction. The parallel sheets will be hexagonal lattices formed
by polymerization of organometallic sandwich complexes, while the vertical
pillars will be carborane-based rods containing a central dipolar chromophore
parallel to the hexagonal sheets and capable of rotating about the pillar axis
in the presence of an external electric field. The length of the rigid carborane
rods will be varied to provide variable spacing between the parallel sheets and
a novel interfacial technique will be used to build up the thickness of the thin
films. %%% The synthetic methodolgy developed by this research will provide the
basis for designing layered films with broad potential across several materials
application areas. Electronic and photonic materials, for example, wave guides,
are envisioned.
