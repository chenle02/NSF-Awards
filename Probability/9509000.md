9509000 Huebner Abstract This project involves research in the development of
statistical methods for stochastic partial differential equations. Two main
problems are to be investigated. The first concerns the estimation of parameters
occurring in hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations, while the
second concerns the construction of estimators for discretized versions of the
equations with nonconstant parameters. The results of this project can be
applied to areas such as economics, oceanography, physical chemistry, and
engineering, where stochastic differential equations often represent complex
physical systems with random perturbations. The parameters to be estimated play
a critical role in the design of technological devices and are often not known
with adequate accuracy. It is desirable to optimize the performance of such
devices--both from the standpoint of economy and ecology--for a better
utilization of resources.
