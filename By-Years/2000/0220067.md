Development of Bolted End Plate Connections for Steel Reinforced Concrete
Composite Structures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract (press-release
format for general public) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most significant lesson
learned from the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1995 Kobe earthquake was the
cracking and brittle failure of welded moment connections of modern steel
buildings. The structural engineering communities have since been working on
development of improved designs. One possible solution for making steel
structures more resistant to earthquakes is to combine concrete and steel to
take the advantages of each material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Xiao and
Anderson at the University of Southern California have conceived several new
details to achieve this. They proposed to use bolted steel and concrete
composite connections instead of traditional welded connection to improve
constructability and meanwhile to ensure excellent seismic behavior for building
structures. In the proposed project, they plan to prove their ideas through
experimental testing and analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
