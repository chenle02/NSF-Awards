ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rising Tide Project: Changing How University
Researchers and Secondary Educators Work Together&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Rising Tide Project raises the level of scientific awareness and confidence on a
local level by making collaboration between researchers and educators the norm,
rather than the exception. Teacher/student teams, each consisting of one local
high school teacher and one Coastal Carolina University (CCU) undergraduate,
work with CCU marine science faculty mentors on summer research projects. Each
team participates in a different local marine-related research project. Using
the methodology and data from its research experience, each team designs locally
relevant discovery and inquiry based classroom activities for high school
students. Activities are designed in a web-based format, tested and assessed in
the classroom, and incorporated into the South Carolina Aquarium's web site
where they become part of the Aquarium's statewide aquatic curriculum. The goals
of this program are to improve the scientific competence of local high school
science teachers and enable local high school science teachers to motivate their
classrooms by incorporating classroom activities based on locally relevant
scientific research that is pedagogically sound and is consistent with national
and state standards. &lt;br/&gt;
