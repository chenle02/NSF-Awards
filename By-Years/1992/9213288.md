The principal investigator will use this award to initiate a research project
in the study of infinite entropy billiard systems with a fractal boundary. She
will use Bernoulli theory and the theory of Brownian motion to study
perturbations of the flow. She will attempt to prove the robustness of the
Markovian model and investigate dynamical systems with singularities. This award
will support research in the general area of dynamical systems. A process which
is very simple and easy to understand locally can become extremely complicated,
nonlinear, and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study of
this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can best be modeled
using this area of mathematics including fluid flow and turbulence, complex
biological systems, mechanical systems, and chemical reactions.
