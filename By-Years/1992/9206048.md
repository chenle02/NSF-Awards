Physical models of flow in medium- and high-temperature fumarole fields suggest
that mass flow will exert a strong control on fumarole temperature in most
circumstances. The PIs plan to monitor temperature and mass flow continuously to
test this relationship in three active fields. These fields are on Volcano
Colima, Mexico, Poas, Costa Rica, and Galeras, Colombia, and encompass a range
of hydrothermal regimes. At Galeras, young fumaroles are likely a manifestation
of forced convection of magmatic and deeply circulating meteoritic fluids. At
Poas, shallow free convection likely dominates flow. Colima represents a flow
regime intermediate between the other two. The time scales and interdependence
of temperature, mass flow, and geochemistry will vary between these systems.
Geochemical data, particularly stable and cosmogenic isotopes, will help
distinguish more clearly between shallow free convection and fumaroles fed by
forced convection from relatively deep or magmatic sources. Differentiation of
these transport mechanisms is important to the understanding and interpretation
of observed changes in fumarole activity at active volcanoes.
