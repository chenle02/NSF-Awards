This project entails research and development and to address the software and
tools problems fro ultra-scale parallel machines, especially targeted for
scalable I/O, storage and memory hierarchy. The fundamental premise is that to
achieve extreme scalability, incremental changes or adaptation of traditional
(extension of sequential) interfaces and techniques for scaling data accesses
and I/O will not succeed, because they are based on pessimistic and conservative
assumptions of parallelism, synchronization, and data sharing patterns. We will
develop innovative techniques to optimize data access that utilize the
understanding of high-level access patterns ("intent"), and use that information
through runtime layers to enable optimizations and reduction / elimination of
locking and synchronization at different levels. The proposed mechanisms will
allow different software layers to interact/cooperate with each other.
Specifically, the upper layers in the software stack extract high-level access
pattern information and pass it to the lower layers in the stack, which in turn
exploit them to achieve ultra-scalability. In particular, the main objectives of
this project are: (1) Techniques, tools and software for extracting data access
patterns and data-flow at runtime; (2) Interfaces and strategies for passing
access pattern across the different layers for optimizations; (3) Implementation
of these techniques in appropriate layers such as parallel file system,
communication software 9e.g., MPI2), and runtime libraries to reduce or
eliminate synchronization and locking; (4) Runtime techniques and tools that
exploit access patterns for reducing power consumption and cooling requirements
for the underlying storage system; and (5) Development of interfaces and
software to use active storage for data analysis and filtering
