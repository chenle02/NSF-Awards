DMS-0070176-Lynne Billard

The International Biometrics Conference is planned for July 2-7, 2000, at San
Francisco. The meeting will focus on the active areas of research in
biostatistics. Areas of emphasis are "advancement of biological science through
the development of quantitative theories and the application, development, and
dissemination of effective mathematical and statistical techniques". The
conference participants are concerned with cross-disciplinary and
interdisciplinary interface of the theoretical and application oriented real-
world problems. In addition to the invited talks, ample time will be given for
small group discussions in which junior participants will meet with senior
mentors and other participants.

The NSF monies requested are to support about fifteen U.S.-based participants
and five non-U.S.-based researchers with emphasis on young researchers and
traditionally underrepresented groups. Support will be limited to individuals at
academic institutions and non-profit organizations.
