9624939 Krause This study will investigate the ecological factors involved in
the diversification of mammals 65 million years ago, after the extinction of
dinosaurs. Specifically, the goal of the proposed research is to use tooth
structure to infer the diet and feeding ecology of the archaic ungulates, or
"condylarths," the first major mammalian group to diversify on the heels of
dinosaur extinction. Although "condylarths" are believed to have given rise to
the modern, herbivorous hoofed mammals -- e.g., horses, cows, and elephants --
"condylarths" themselves are often reconstructed as small to medium-sized,
raccoon-like dietary generalists. By investigating dental adaptations to diet in
these extinct animals, this research will uncover factors that may have been
important to the recovery and diversification of "condylarths" after the mass
extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. Thus, this work is important for
understanding the ecological factors critical to recovery from biotic stress and
to the generation of biological diversity.
