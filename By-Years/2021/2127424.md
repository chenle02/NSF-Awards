This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cost of the water supply is
rising rapidly to confront ongoing challenges related to environmental change.
Water shortages affect not only drinking water, but many other uses and
potentially its quality as well. How households manage the rising costs of water
to mitigate risks of water shortages across domains is not well understood. This
is despite the well documented importance of multi-person households working
together to pool resources and minimize risks. This research leverages theory
from economic and ecological anthropology to understand how household structure
and function affect social and economic stressors associated with water
insecurity, as well as the intra-household tensions created by such stressors.
This project trains students and coordinates outreach and dissemination of
findings to academic and non-academic communities, and contributes much-needed
insights to design effective ways to manage these policy
challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a socio-hydrology approach to
examine the impact of rapidly rising water prices on diverse households residing
in water-insecure neighborhoods. The focus is on intra-household dynamics,
including household demographic structure and its effects on perceived socio-
economic tradeoffs, and impacts on household membersâ€™ well-being. The
investigators use a novel combination of ethnographic (interviews, focus
groups), demographic (surveys), and GIS mapping methods to investigate home heat
vulnerability, water use, economic stressors, and aspects of household
composition and function. In doing so, the research provides a holistic, multi-
level perspective on the dynamic feedbacks between households, individuals, and
water insecurity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
