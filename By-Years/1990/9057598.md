Tolerances play an important role in determining the quality, cost, and time to
market, of manufactured products. Current tolerancing methods are labor
intensive, and error prone. Research is directed to the development of the
theoretical foundations necessary for the automated computer solution of
tolerancing problems, based on product design specifications derived from
traditional computer-aided design systems. Some of the specific sub-problems
being addressed are: the development of a mathematical theory of tolerances that
provides a useful algorithmic interpretation of each of the geometric and plus-
minus tolerances used in current design practice; the development of assembly
models that capture the semantics of mating feature relationships; the extension
of automated tolerancing capabilities to conceptual design; and the development
of strategies for computational geometry that are robust in the presence of
small simulated manufacturing variations.
