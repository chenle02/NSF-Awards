&lt;br/&gt;Matter Matters: A Media Module for The Aspect Book for Russian
familiarizes students with the science of linguistics, contextualized to
learning Russian. All Russian verbs express a grammatical category called aspect
(perfective vs. imperfective) absent in English. Aspect involves dozens of
contrasting uses, and is notoriously difficult for linguists to describe and
learners to master. Matter Matters showcases intellectual breakthroughs in the
linguistic description of aspect, presented as an interactive animated module.
Learners gain insight into methods of linguistic inquiry and acquire language
mastery beyond what was previously possible. Student achievements will be
assessed according to national standards. Matter Matters is being integrated
into both the Linguistics and Russian language curricula. Because all Slavic
languages (e.g., Czech, Polish, SerboCroatian) have the grammatical category of
aspect, this product may inspire further linguistic research into aspectual
categories and spawn similar texts for other languages. The completed
MediaModule will be available to language professionals, and lead to the
production of a MediaBook, to be published and distributed commercially and
piloted across the country. &lt;br/&gt;
