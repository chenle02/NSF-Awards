9308530 Sleight New complex oxides which contain at least four elements will be
prepared, and their properties and atomic structures will be determined and
related to bonding and electronic structure. Generally, elements from different
sections of the periodic table are selected. A systematic study will be made of
complex osides which contain a transition metal cation together with a post-
transition metal cation and a pre-transition metal cation. At least in the
initial stages, specific properties will not be sought. Rather, the emphasis
will be on developing systematic approaches to the synthesis of new complex
oxides. The proposed work seeks to identify unknown structures and properties
that cannot exist for simple oxides. The focus will be on single phase materials
rather than composites. The overall goal of this exploratory synthesis program
is to escape the intellectual confines of current knowledge base and to discover
new materials that are useful, inexpensive, nontoxic and easy to manufacture.
Oxides have already been widely studied, however, much remains to be
accomplished with oxides, particularly because oxides generally have advantages
over other materials both in ease of synthesis and in terms of high stability in
the presence of air. ***
