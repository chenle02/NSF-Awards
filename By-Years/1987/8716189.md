This award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in a seminar on the
"Molecular and Cellular Aspects of Vascular Smooth Muscle Function," organized
by Drs. David Bohr and Robert Webb of the University of Michigan, together with
Dr. Motohatsu Fujiwara of Kyoto University, Japan. United States and Japanese
participants will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii during January 1989. The meeting will
focus on recent research developments related to the contraction and relaxation
of vascular smooth muscle. Cellular processes of excitation, excitation-
contraction coupling, energy metabolism and chemomechanical transduction will be
considered at the molecular level. Regulatory aspects of the endothelium and
nerves with regard to vascular function will be featured. The abnormalities of
these processes responsible for diseased states will be discussed. Research
funds from both the United States and Japan are currently heavily invested in
the understanding of vascular smooth muscle function at a cellular-molecular
level. Numerous advances have been made in the field over the last few years and
this seminar will provide an excellent forum for the exchange of research
results and ideas between scientists from our two countries.
