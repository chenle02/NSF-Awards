The most serious consequence of inadequate design of waste containment
facilities or a chemical spill is migration of chemicals into groundwater
supply. Central to the analysis of pollution transport through soils is
knowledge of permeability of the soil, before and after becoming saturated with
chemicals. The objective of this research is to develop a method of predicting
the change in soil permeability due to contamination. The project will seek to
develop a method of quantifying the change in permeability caused by replacement
of pore fluid with a certain amount of specific contamination. The mechanical
behavior of the clayey soils in this study depends to a great extent on the
composition of the pore fluid. When existing pore water is replaced with another
fluid, the interparticle force may in some cases become more repulsive, causing
the dispersion of the particles, and yet in other cases become more attractive,
causing flocculation and shrinkage of particle clusters. A permeability test
with water as the permeant can be conducted in a reasonable length of time.
However, a direct method of determining a contamination-induced corresponding
change in permeability is to perform a compatibility test in a laboratory on
undisturbed field specimens. Considering the wide variety of contamination
possible, this procedure is very time consuming and costly. A new method to
estimate the change in permeability is based on the Olsen's cluster model, which
recognizes that particles are arranged in clusters in a clayey soil, and that
fluid flow through such a soil occurs primarily through inter-cluster pores. The
Kozeny-Carmen equation applied to this cluster model was found to represent
reasonably well the influence of porosity on the value of permeability. With the
pre-contamination permeability experimentally determined, this modified Kozeny-
Carmen equation allows the calculation of the permeability change caused by
contamination as a function of the change in inter-cluster porosity. Previously
developed physico-chemical theories will be used to compute the change in inter-
and intra-cluster porosity caused by contamination. Commercial clays (including
montmorillonite, illite, kaolinite, and mixtures) as well as two natural soils
will be used in this study. Contaminants will include formamide, ethanol, acetic
acid, triethylamine, heptane, benzene, and a sample of industrial landfill
leachate.
