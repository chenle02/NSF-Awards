This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to understand how on-
line learning affects students' self-efficacy and later achievement in an
engineering degree program. The research will investigate how different types of
web-based activities impact student learning and their self-efficacy, or belief
that they can accomplish a given task. By looking longitudinally the study will
help instructors understand how to effectively integrate web-based learning into
mechanics courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance
of this project will be to inform best practices in the rapidly growing area of
on-line learning. The study will be conducted in an introductory mechanics
course, common to most engineering programs, and thus can widely inform
practice. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the
frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities
and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
creating results and research that are useful for society by informing
educational policy and practices.
