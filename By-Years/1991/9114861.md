A method for modeling large deformation behavior of alloys comprised of low
symmetry polycrystalline metals will be developed. Such polycrystals involve
single crystals with fewer than five active slip systems. Of particular
importance are the alpha phases of titanium alloys. Because of the inherent
kinematic constraint, numerical simulations of polycrystal behavior based on
single crystal slip are computationally intensive. On the other hand, the
restricted number of slip systems permit an analytical treatment of the rate
insensitive behavior of both the single crystal and the polycrystal. This
analysis will be carried out for HCP crystals with emphasis on titanium. The
analytical results will be used to replace, in whole or in part, the numerical
solution of nonlinear equations that describe responses of individual grains.
The polycrystalline properties necessary for finite element analysis of forming
processes thus may be obtained more directly from the average grain behavior.
This should make the determination of the evolution of the polycrystalline
anisotropy far more accurate and efficient. The predicted development of
anisotropy will be compared with anisotropy observed in samples of titanium
deformed in the laboratory under realistic processing conditions.
