This grant will support experimental nuclear physics research studying
collisions of relativistic heavy ions. The initial focus of the activity will be
experiment E-814 at Brookhaven National Laboratory in which differences between
central and peripheral collisions will be probed with the aid of a special
target calorimeter constructed of approximately 1200 sodium-iodide modules. The
grantee shares responsibility for the design, construction and use of this
calorimeter. The experiments will explore the novel phenomena predicted to occur
when relativistic heavy ion collisions create nuclear matter at high energy
density and temperature. This is the first year of a five-year continuing grant.
