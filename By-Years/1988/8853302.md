A project will be initiated to improve the laboratory experience at all
chemistry undergraduate levels. A combination of interesting experiments, modern
laboratory instrumentation and computer simulations of chemical systems will be
used in the areas of separations, electrochemistry and mass spectrometry. This
ILI award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University to acquire liquid
chromatographic, polarographic, mass spectrometric and computer instrumentation
that will be used to enhance laboratory instruction aid in chemistry curriculum
development.
