9309572 Evripidou The Decoupled Data-Driven (D3) machine separates the
synchronization and computation portions of a program and executes them
asynchronously. The compiler generates threads that utilize the processor
pipeline efficiently by reducing pipeline stalls within a thread. Priority is
given to threads which have their data in close proximity (i.e. in the cache or
registers). Decoupling synchronization and computation ensures the execution
pipeline is not interrupted by long synchronization events. The overall goal of
this project is the implementation of the computation model into an abstract
machine that will execute on existing large scale shared memory multiprocessors.
Achieving this goal requires the development of: a microtasking environment that
supports the abstract machine on commercial machines, a multi-language compiler
that generates code for the abstract machine, and a hardware thread
synchronization unit. ***
