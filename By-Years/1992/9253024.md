Parasitic nematodes are important world health and agricultural problems yet are
very difficult to study. As a paradigm, we propose to identify acetylcholine
receptor subunit genes from the important human parasitic nematode Onchocerca
volvulus using DNA sequence knowledge that we have derived for the equivalent
receptor subunits from the laboratory nematode C. elegans. Acetylcholine
receptor mutants of C. elegans are viable and three receptor subunit genes have
already been sequenced. Using monoclonal antibodies raised against purified
receptor subunits, PCR, or reduced stringency hybridization, any remaining C.
elegans submit gene will be identified. Identification of all subunits needed to
make a receptor will be confirmed by in vitro expression in frog oocytes. Based
on the set of C. elegans sequences, and Onchocerca cDNA library will be
amplified with degenerate PCR primers. PCR primers products will be identified
by sequencing and used to isolate cDNA clones. Parasite receptor function will
be reconstructed first by expressing the parasite receptor in frog oocytes from
in vitro RNA transcripts and then fy transforming C. elegans receptor mutant
strains with expressible Onchocerca cDNA constructs. Our approach should
identify all subunit genes needed to reconstruct a completely homologous
Onchocerca acetylcholine receptor. Our model should provide a rationale to
develop a transgenic strains or expression systems for other receptor or
cuticular proteins that might be useful in devising drug or immunotherapies
against parasitic nematodes.
