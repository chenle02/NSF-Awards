While the equations describing the motion of incompressible fluids have been
around for more than two centuries, the underlying mathematics is still not
fully understood. Do the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations correctly
describe what we see in fluid experiments? Can we use these equations to make
precise predictions about the flows, to predict tomorrow's weather, or to
predict the macro-scale evolution of the Earth's climate? These questions are
conjecturally related through the phenomenological theories of turbulence and
the statistical properties of solutions to the Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. When attempting to give rigorous answers to these questions we are
faced with new frontiers in mathematical analysis, and fundamental new ideas are
needed to understand the underlying phenomena. In this project the investigator
studies the relation between turbulence and the equations that are used to
describe fluid flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project focuses on furthering
our understanding of the hypothesized link between fluid turbulence and the
Navier-Stokes equations. The complexity of turbulent flows observed in
experiments translates into fundamental mathematical issues, chief among which
are the problems of singularities, uniqueness, and stability in the fluid
equations. The investigator and colleagues attack these problems from two
intimately related angles: by analyzing the statistical properties of solutions
to stochastic partial differential equations; and by studying the emergence of
singularities in the Euler and related active scalar equations. In tackling
these problems the investigator appeals to ideas from hypoellipticity (in the
sense of Hormander), convex integration, Lagrangian particle adapted methods,
and Landau damping. The goal is to develop nonlinear, solution-adapted methods.
