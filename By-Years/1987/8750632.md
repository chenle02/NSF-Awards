This equipment is providing the Biology Department with the ability to isolate
DNA and RNA through ultracentrifugation. The microfuges are being used for the
easy manipulation of small volumes (10-200 ul) of RNA and DNA. Protein
purification experiments and isozyme studies are being done in Cell Biology and
in Plant Physiology using slab gel electrophoresis techniques which make cross
sample comparisons easier than with tube gel electrophoretic systems. By working
in the laboratory with DNA, RNA, and protein, the students gain hands on
experience and greater insight into the major conceptual underpinnings of
molecular biology and molecular genetics. In addition to its applications in six
upper division courses, the equipment will support a newly instituted Honors
Program in Biology.
