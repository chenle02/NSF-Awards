9354117 Okereke Central State University (CSU) intends to maintain excellence in
its educational mission and its successes in developing new and innovative
programs within the last decade in the Sciences, Engineering and Mathematics.
CSU will improve, strengthen and expand these programs in science, engineering
and mathematics, as well as introduce other new and innovative programs. The
university intends to develop plans to further strengthen its centers of
excellence in manufacturing engineering, water resources management and Center
for Scientific Visualization and the Center for Applied Mathematics, as well as
the traditional physical and natural science departments such as biology,
chemistry, mathematics and computer science, and physics. One of the goals of
the effort is to significantly increase the number and quality of minorities
that enroll in, and graduate form, the science, engineering and mathematics
programs at the university. The other is to increase the number of these
graduates who go to graduate school to earn advanced degrees in the physical and
natural sciences. Ultimately, the achievement of these goals will significantly
expand the pool of minorities who opt for careers in the physical and natural
sciences. CSU hopes to achieve these goals by evaluating the existing programs
that impact the enrollment, retention, and ultimately the graduation of its
students in the sciences. Activities such as recruitment, advising, mentoring,
tutorial assistance, curriculum development, and the availability of
scholarships and financial aid will be reviewed. Other programs such as library
facilities, student living environments, laboratory facilities and research
participation by undergraduate students would also be evaluated. The goal of
this comprehensive evaluation is to identify and reinforce program and
institutional strengths and to correct the underlying weaknesses.
