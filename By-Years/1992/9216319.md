A theoretical study of the dynamics of ocean boundary currents and their
interaction with lateral boundaries will be conducted. Three cases are studied:
(1) a flow parallel to a continental slope through a conversing strait; (2) the
evolution of an unstable barotropic shear layer on the continental slope and (3)
the eddy- jet interaction of the Gulf Stream.
