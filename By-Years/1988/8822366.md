The objectives of this research are twofold: to understand dynamics and energy
transport in the impulsive phase of flares, and to understand the origins of
flare energy. Specifically, the aim is to: further understand gasdynamics and
radiation transfer in the chromosphere during the impulsive phase of flares;
develop diagnostics of energy transport in the impulsive phase of flares which
are applicable to H alpha observations; ascertain what can and cannot be learned
from vector magnetograms and examine methods for the extrapolation of force-free
magnetic fields from such data; study the stability of preflare coronal magnetic
fields and the role of MHD instabilities in flare initiation; investigate the
interaction of sub-photospheric flows with the footprints of coronal magnetic
field lines, to determine the source of flair energy. The investigators will
attack these problems theoretically, using both analytic and numerical
techniques applied to the gasdynamic, radiation transfer, and
magnetohydrodynamic equations. The work on chromospheric flare dynamics and
force-free fields will assist in interpreting data from ground-based solar
optical telescopes during the solar maximum of 1991. Studies of flare energy
generation touch on fundamental questions relating to the solar dynamo and the
solar cycle, and will suggest observational tests of flare mechanisms.
