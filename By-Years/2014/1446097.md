The goal of this NUE program, Nanotechnology Education for Roll-to-Roll
Manufacturing, at Oklahoma State University (OSU) under the direction of Dr.
Matthew J. Klopfstein, is to educate undergraduate students in core
nanotechnology topics for high precision Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing by
developing educational modules for key undergraduate courses in engineering,
measurements, manufacturing, mechatronics, automatic control, and vibrations.
R2R manufacturing of flexible materials offers significant advantages over batch
processing including better yields, high speed automation, and the potential to
mass produce finished materials at substantially lower costs. The project team
plans to systematically develop curriculum material in nanotechnology and high
precision R2R manufacturing in the following six undergraduate courses:
Introduction to Engineering, Measurements, Manufacturing Processes,
Mechatronics, Automatic Control, and Vibrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large
number of OSU students, approximately 800 undergraduate students per year, will
be potentially impacted by this curriculum, including up to 400 first-year
engineering students. In addition to significantly impacting the undergraduate
curriculum and student learning in high precision R2R manufacturing, the
proposed project will broadly impact a number of other education and outreach
activities. These activities include involvement of underrepresented students,
interaction with middle/high school students and teachers, and opportunities for
undergraduate students to interact with practicing engineers. The project team
will work with three programs at OSU: Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for
Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP), the Multicultural Engineering program (MEP)
and the Women in Engineering, Architecture and Technology (WEAT) program to
actively recruit and retain students from underrepresented groups.
