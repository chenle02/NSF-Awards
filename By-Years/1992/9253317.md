The grant funds a 3 year project to inservice and supports teacher trainers n
Virginia and eastern North Carolina. In addition, the project would develop a
network of leadership teams, each composed of one mathematics and one science
teacher. Thirty of these teams act as site coordinators for interactive
telecourses that use TRANSIT (Technology Reform and Specialists Inservice
training) materials developed at Ohio State University and NASA Langley. The
courses primarily focus on innovative methods of teaching mathematics and
science and include significant amounts of appropriate technology for grades
6-12. Through a combination of video demonstrations, interactive dialog with the
VANT (Virginia Network for Technology) staff, "hands-on" work with the site
coordinators, and time to practice new techniques in each teachers's classroom,
the participants modify their own teaching to meet new NCTM standards and
respond to local concerns. Each year, fifty mathematics or science teachers form
Virginia and North Carolina attend a 2-week inservice in the summer to learn to
become lead teachers. Twenty of them are chosen to form 2-person
telecommunication site coordinator teams. Ten new teams are formed each year.
Theses teams are chosen for their expertise and for the availability of a
satellite receiving station. In turn, these sites are connected to Old Dominion
University and become telecourse and inservice training centers for additional
teachers. All site coordinators receive two site visits from the VANT staff for
support and are invited to participate in two academic year one-day inservice
workshops. In each of the subsequent two years, fifty additional teachers are
directly trained and new centers formed until 150 teachers have been trained
directly, 20 telecommunication centers formed, and thousands of teachers trained
at these sites.
