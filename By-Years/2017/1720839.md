This project focuses on slab mass transport into the lower mantle. It will, 1),
expand the range of constraints on the degree of slab stagnation, e.g. by
detailed analysis of transition zone thickness as well as hypothesis-driven
reinversion of seismological data; 2), construct, by means of further software
development, regional dynamic models and simplified global parameterizations for
stagnation systematics in a thermo-chemical, multi-phase transition mantle
system; and, 3), benchmark these computational convection models for vertical
and horizontal transport. A graduate student from an under-represented group
will be trained in interdisciplinary research. All project software will be
developed openly and shared freely online. The tomographic inversion and
modeling tools will be implemented into the Solid Earth Teaching and Research
Environment software framework, allowing data-driven hypothesis testing for
entirely different geodynamic questions and facilitating the training of Earth
science students in interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better
estimates of the slab flux, over time and with error bars, will help to
constrain geochemical mixing and thermal Earth evolution models. The study will
contribute to the use of slabs for absolute plate-tectonic reference frames, and
slab dynamics has other, broad implications such as on net rotations of the
lithosphere with respect to the lower mantle, interactions with the super-
continental cycle, and sealevel variations.
