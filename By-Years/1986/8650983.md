Pacific Union College will provide students in the Laser Technology program
experience with state-of-the-art laser instrumentation and techniques. The
project provides carbon dioxide and Nd:YAG lasers and associated measurement
instruments including power meters, spectrum and signal analyzers, and a fast
oscilloscope. The instrumentation will be incorporated into the laser laboratory
activities and will expand and enhance the instructional and laboratory
experience essential for students in a new program in laser physics. The
equipment will help prepare students for a wide range of pursuits in the fields
of lasers and electro-optics.
