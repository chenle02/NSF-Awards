Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0303098&lt;br/&gt;Borguet/Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Borguet and coworkers at
the University of Pittsburgh are examining diffusion and self-assembly of
macromolecular species at electrochemical interfaces. Using a transient
perturbation method, the rate of diffusion as well as information about the
control of structures at the electrochemical interface is obtained. Scanning
probe microscopy, coupled with this transient perturbation method provides
detailed information about the diffusional motion of large molecules on the
electrode surface. Initial work is focusing on the motion and self-assembly of
porphyrin molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An understanding of the diffusion and
aggregation of adsorbed species on electrode surfaces may provide a route to the
controlled construction of nano-scale objects with interesting technological
applications. The work of this project in Professor Borguet's laboratory at the
University of Pittsburgh is focused on developing this understanding using
transient electrochemical perturbations of the electrode surface followed by
scanning probe microscopy characterization. &lt;br/&gt;
