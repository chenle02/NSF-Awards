Professor J. Eli Barkai of the University of Notre Dame is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program through a CAREER award to
develop theoretical methods for the treatment of single molecule spectroscopy, a
powerful modern technique used to investigate a wide range of physical, chemical
and biophysical phenomena. Several applications are being considered: the theory
of single photons on demand; anti-bunching behavior for molecular systems in
condensed phase environments; non-ergodic blinking of quantum dots; tracking of
single molecules in solution; and single macromolecular fluorescence. Barkai is
using the quantum jump approach, also called the quantum Monte Carlo approach,
to model these systems.

As part of this CAREER award, Professor Barkai is developing several courses in
theoretical and computational chemistry, one of which is an interdisciplinary
course aimed at students from departments beyond Chemistry. In addition, the
research will have a broad impact on fields beyond chemistry, especially those
of biology and medicine in which single molecule spectroscopy is expected to
play a role.
