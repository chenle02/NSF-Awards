Robots are increasingly becoming a part of daily human interactions: They vacuum
floors, deliver medicine in hospitals, and provide company for elderly and
disabled individuals. This project examines one aspect of people's interactions
with these robots: how intentional and self-reflective the robot seems to be.
Because the perceived agency of a robot affects many dimensions of people's
interactions with that robot, it is important to understand how features of
robot design, such as its behavior and cognitive abilities, affect perceptions
of agency. This question is addressed through a series of laboratory experiments
that manipulate behavior and cognitive abilities and measure the degree of
agency attributed to socially interactive
robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project will lead to new
measures of perceived robot agency and new knowledge about how people
collaborate with robots. The results will inform how engineers construct robots,
how artificial intelligence researchers conceptualize behavioral architectures,
and how designers craft interactions to produce robots that engage people in
simple ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The project will provide a
new quantitative measurement of agency that can be used in human-robot
interaction and related disciplines and new information that can inform how
agency is modeled in the design of human-robot interactions, especially in
situations where recognition of agency is a primary factor. The outcomes will be
used to improve socially assistive robotics for children with social deficits.
The project will also enhance interdisciplinary research offerings for graduate
and undergraduate students at the investigators' institution.
