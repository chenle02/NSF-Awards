The Cascadia convergent margin in northwest Washington State marks the
subduction boundary between North America and the Juan de Fuca plate. The
Olympic mountains consist of an assemblage of Eocene to Miocene thrusts
structurally overlain by Eocene basalts and Eocene to Miocene clastic rocks.
Uplift of these rocks occurred during the late Miocene. These observations and
available fission track data have resulted in a tectonic model involving
accretion and underplating followed by uplift while accretion continues. This
project will test between two end-member explanations for the timing and style
of the uplift, simple doming or large scale normal faulting. Methods include
fission track dating and structural analysis. Results should help understanding
causes of uplift in active convergent orogens.
