This research is to use seismic data from permanent and the new NSF/IRIS
PASSCAL instruments for over 5000 aftershocks associated with the Loma Prieta
earthquake sequence to derive high resolution (on the order of hundreds of
meters) tomographic images of P- and S-wave velocity and attenuation along a 55
X 45 km region near the San Andreas fault. Initially, separate inversions will
be examined and correlated with known geologic and geophysical observations. A
joint inversion, incorporating velocity, attenuation and gravity will be
developed requiring the resulting models to reflect what is known about the
model through independent geophysical observations. This research is a component
of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
