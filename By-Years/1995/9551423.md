This project funds computer hardware and software for a multidisciplinary
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) laboratory. The lab consists of two UNIX
workstations and six PCs integrated by local area network to support ARC/INFO
and a number of other software packages that complement ARC/INFO. The lab
fosters training and research in a number of programs, primarily in geography
and secondarily in biological sciences, chemistry and physics, environmental
studies, and engineering studies. It services several courses in these
disciplines including three newly developed ones: Geographic Information
Systems, Environmental Remote Sensing, and Environmental Analysis. While the lab
is primarily intended for undergraduate use, it can also serve the newly
introduced Professional Development Sequence in Geographic Techniques and the
M.A. program in Geography and Economic Development.
