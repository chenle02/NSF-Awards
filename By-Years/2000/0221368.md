Under this award, the PI will attempt to constrain the evolution and origin of
the unusual Indian Ocean mantle domain by determining the initial hafnium
isotope compositions and Lu and Hf concentrations of old oceanic crustal basalts
from 21 DSDP/ODP drill sites and two Tethyan ophiolite complexes already studied
for Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes. Establishing the Hf isotopic composition of old
Indian Ocean and Tethyan crust will help to determine when and where this
isotopic signature first appeared in the Indian Ocean mantle domain, and if it
was present in the composition of Tethyan crust produced before the opening of
the Indian Ocean basin. It will also help to determine whether the distinct
composition of the Indian Ocean mantle domain is primarily derived from
subducted, deeply recycled components that have undergone extensive mixing and
homogenization in the mantle, or whether it more likely derives from shallow
contamination via the foundering of local Gondwanan continental lithosphere,
which has evolved in isolation from the convecting mantle for billions of years.
