The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to decrease
health care costs for sleep apnea monitoring and diagnosis. It is estimated that
a large proportion of potential sleed apnea patients are undiagnosed. Sleep
apnea is a potentially remedial risk factor for hypertension, type II diabetes,
stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Sleep apnea also causes
learning disability among children. The proposed sleep apnea screening tool is
accurate and easy to use. It can potentially be broadly employed in clinics and
homes, and reduce the need for both overnight laboratory-based polysomnograms
and home sleep studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project targets to
provide an easy-to-use screening tool for sleep apnea that combines mobile
technology, internet of things (IoT) technology, and machine learning technology
into one system. The core technology of this screening tool is the state-of-the-
art machine learning algorithms with IoT sensors. The solution is expected to
deliver a high accuracy and sensitivity sleep apnea screening methodology using
deep learning methods. Preliminary results are consistent with six types of
apnea-hypopnea index threshold.
