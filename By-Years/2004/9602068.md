Professor Konkowski will continue and extend her previous work on spacetimes
with mild singularities. Mild singularities include quasiregular and nonscalar
curvature singularities. In the case of quasiregular singularities, particle
paths end suddenly with no warning from infinitely- increasing tidal forces,
while in the case of nonscalar curvature singularities some, but not all,
particles moving near the singularity feel infinite tidal forces. A study has
already begun of a spacetime with a quasiregular singularity which can be
approached only by an incomplete curve of bounded acceleration. This
investigation will be continued using classical and quantum fields and
applications of the singularity conjecture. In addition, spacetimes with mild
singularities due to Siklos and to Gurses and Sermutlu will be studied. The
rather than Ricci curvature singularities, which are likely to provide more
stringent limits on the validity of the conjectures. Most of the stability tests
have involved classical field techniques. She will now extend the tests to
include the behavior of quantum particles and fields near mild singularities and
Cauchy horizons. It will be interesting, for example, to examine the behavior of
a particle wave packet as it approaches a mild singularity or a Cauchy horizon
to study the effects of barrier penetration. It will also be interesting to
broaden the stability conjectures to include the behavior of quantum test-fields
near singularities and Cauchy horizons.
