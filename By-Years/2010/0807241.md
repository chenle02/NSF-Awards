A major barrier to a student pursuing degrees in the STEM fields, especially one
who is financially disadvantaged, is his/her need to work a significant number
of hours to support themselves and/or a family while carrying the demanding load
of a STEM major. This project is providing scholarships that will lower this
major barrier for our STEM majors and motivate our students while they are
attending and preparing for transfer to a four-year institution. The S-STEM
scholars receive major support through the established Mathematics, Engineering,
and Science Achievement (MESA) Program. S-STEM scholars are also divided into
small faculty-led cohorts of students based on their majors. These cohorts
provide mentoring, academic and social support, and professional development
guidance. Our program targets those students who are traditionally
underrepresented: however, assistance will be available to any STEM student
attending the institution who meets the minimum requirements. This program is
increasing the number of students who successfully complete their coursework and
transfer to 4-year institutions in a STEM field. It is anticipated that this
programmatic model can be adapted for use with other MESA Programs throughout
the state and other community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
