This award is to support a meeting of directors of the Division of Astronomical
Sciences (AST) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites. The meeting
will be held on May 19-20, 2014 in Flagstaff, Arizona, and will be hosted by the
PI on the campus of Northern Arizona University, one of the AST REU sites. The
intellectual merit of the meeting rests with the bringing together of site
directors, current and new, to discuss successes and shortcomings in their own
REU programs, and to establish best practices for future REU activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major goal of the program is to foster ideas to achieve
better success in recruiting minority students. Several people with specific
expertise in minority-student recruitment will be invited to the meeting. Other
topics include program evaluation, ethics, site management, and inter-program
co-operation. The discussion of these issues will help broaden the impact of the
AST REU portfolio, by improving the overall quality of the program, and making
it more attractive to a broader range of students.
