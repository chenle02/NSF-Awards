This project deals with some of the fundamental aspects of gel technology.
Characterization studies to determine interaction parameters of polymers with
solvents, degree of cross-linking, preferential adsorption in mixed solvents,
and, when necessary, ionic charge, are carried out to make qualitative
predictions based on classical thermodynamic equations for gels. The
experimental results obtained on macroscopic gels are then used to determine the
role played by surface forces and particle size on the swelling behavior of
microgels. The reverse emulsion and suspension polymerization technique is used
to prepare microgels with controlled properties of size, cross-linking density,
and degree of swelling during polymerization. The microgel properties of primary
importance to be investigated are their thermodynamic swelling properties and
their rheological and mechanical properties which govern many of the practical
and industrial usages of these systems.
