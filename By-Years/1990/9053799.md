The University of Arizona will carry out a project for preparing teachers of
secondary science and mathematics. As is the case in many large research-
oriented institutions, the university previously had not capitalized on its
resources and faculty to produce significant numbers of secondary teachers.
Under this project, a close-knit alliance of scientists, mathematicians,
educators, and teachers will develop a coordinated curriculum that integrates
education in the content areas with pedagogical preparation. The program will
include rigorous content-area courses, subject-specific pedagogical courses, a
range of practice teaching situations, and paid summer internships in research
laboratories. Special attention will be given to recruiting and retaining
minorities. Throughout the program the students' interest in teaching will be
nurtured and encouraged by careful advising, close supervision, and follow-up
during the first years of teaching. The University's cost sharing will be 25% of
NSF's support.
