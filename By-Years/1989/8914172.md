A computer-based design system is to be developed and evaluated that will
support evaluation for manufacturability at an early stage in the design process
(when the configuration has been established) and also at the detailed design
stage (when dimensions have been established). Evaluation and redesign advice
will be provided on request to the designer, who can make changes as desired and
have the design re-evaluated. Evaluation will be provided at the configuration
and detailed design levels in the domains of injection molding, stamping, die
casting, handling for assembly, assembly by insertion, and for tolerances. The
representations to be provided are feature-based, and will include not only
representations of form and spatial relationships, but also additional design
and manufacturing information needed for the evaluations. The system, to be
developed jointly by mechanical, electrical, and industrial engineering
researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the University of
Massachusetts, is to be tested and evaluated to determine the validity of the
representations, of the efficacy two-tier evaluation concept, and the
completeness of the manufacturability data base included.
