We recently showed theoretically that dynamic carrier heating effects are
critical to the stability an intraband gain saturation of semiconductor lasers
even at room temperatures. This is true, for example, with one of the simplest
compounds, GaAs, where a hierarchy of relaxation times exists. At this time
there is remarkably little known about the interplay of dynamics associated with
carrier heating effects and transverse effects together. Having targeting those
systems with a quasi-independent subsystem of energy levels we shall continue
our studies of fast processes taking into account electron, hole and lattice
temperatures, in less restrictive regimes of the plane- wave model. We have
dynamical equations of motions that describe the evolution of the semiconductor
laser output beam and its characteristics transverse profile; however, the
numerical development is, to date, incomplete and is included as a first phase
of this program. Experience and sensitivity to the difficulties in modeling
transverse effects in dynamical systems is established in our group and can be
used effectively to develop appropriate numerical integration schemes for this
problem. Computer methods are on line to analyze various nonlinear phenomena
associated with spatio-temporal aperiodic or periodic fields. We will conduct a
comprehensive research program on the stability and dynamics of semiconductor
lasers distinguished by their quasi-independent subsystem of energy levels. The
role that new degrees of freedom play in the generation of complex waveforms
including, for example, hysteresis or bistable operation and linewidth of the
laser will be addressed. The investigations will lead to the development of
novel, compact laser sources with wide applicability in optical devices and
systems. Experimental programs designed to accommodate this timescale have only
recently become possible through the development of femtosecond lasers. We are
exploring possibilities of demonstrating these effects with an external group.
