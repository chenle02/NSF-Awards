This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop
glass-coated amorphous metal (GCAM) fibers in which the glass coating is porous
on the nano-scale level. Thermal treatments would be used to produce phase
separation in the coating. The soluble component of the glass would be leached,
leaving behind a porous skeleton of the non-soluble phase. The porous GCAM
fibers will be employed as solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) devices for the
sampling of analytes such as pharmaceuticals and biomolecules from liquid
matrices and volatile organic compounds from gaseous matrices. The GCAM fiber is
unique in that the metal core can be heated via magnetic induction, allowing for
rapid heating of the porous coating and rapid analyte desorption.

The commercial application of this project will be in industrial and
environmental monitoring, and in various security applications. The proposed
technology will facilitate rapid, in-situ release of key samples for analysis
from monitoring devices following field collection and transfer to laboratory
based equipment such as gas chromatographs. In contrast, current SPME devices
require external heating to desorb the analyte.
