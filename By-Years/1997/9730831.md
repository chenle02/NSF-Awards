The aim of this research is to analyze how people of different cultures exhibit
similar understandings of the meanings of words in particular semantic domains
such as emotions. Using an interview technique developed in cognitive science
that elicits judgments of similarity between terms, and produces
multidimensional maps of similarity-distance of terms, the project will elicit
data from a range of respondents in different languages and cultural contexts
(bi-lingual English-Japanese Japanese students in the US as well as in Japan,
Chinese respondents from Taiwan in China and in the US, as well as other non-
Indo-European language speakers). The study will examine the changes in the
patterns of similarity meanings elicited from respondents with varying degrees
of multiple-language use, from monolingual to fully bilingual speakers. The
technique used will allow the PI to estimate the proportion of variation that is
culturally specific as compared with variation due to universal patterns and
individual characteristics. The role of gender in predicting this semantic
domain structure will also be examined. The significance of this project is that
it will advance our understanding of the extent of universal features in
semantic domains, as well as provide new methods for the discovery of patterns
of meaning in linguistic terms. The findings will contribute to an understanding
of the extent to which there is an underlying `psychic unity` among all human
cultures.
