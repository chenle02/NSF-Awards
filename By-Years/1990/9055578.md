The Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University will use this award
from the Chemical Research Instrumentation Program and the National Facilities
and Instrumentation Program to help acquire a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrometer. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include the following: FTIR Studies of Interactions in Polymer
Blends, IR-Microscope Studies of Phase Separation in Polymer Blends,
Crystallization from Polymer Blends, New Conducting Polymers, FT-Raman Studies
of Various Highly Fluorescing and Colored Samples, The management of Optical
Constants of Materials, New IR Studies of Acid-Base Interactions, FT-Raman
Studies of Metal Clusters on Polymer Surfaces and Far-IR Studies of Thin Films
and Surfaces. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that
used absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. When used in
conjunction with a modern computer, FTIR studies on large numbers of samples can
be conveniently carried out and the resulting data readily analyzed. The use of
FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out research in many
important frontier areas.
