Daniel Joseph Abstract A high-speed, digital video system and image processing
equipment will be used to support engineering research in two-phase-fluid flows,
including: the measurement of hold-up ratios and eccentricities in water-
lubricated flows of viscous materials (crude oil, slurries, and capsules); the
determination of an empirical correlation between particle size and
sedimentation velocity in oil-in-water emulsions (which are also used for
transporting viscous materials); the study of the microstructural properties of
long particles in fluidized suspensions and shear flows; the investigation of
blockage effects of finite-size spheres in a monodisperse fluidized bed; and the
study of interaction of a thin liquid film on a flat surface subjected to an air
shear flow. ***
