Professor Kapitulnik will investigate superconductivity near the metal
insulator transition. Superconductivity near the percolation threshold for lead
films deposited on germanium or on cadmium sulfide will studied. Both the
weakly-localized regime and the strongly localized regime in various systems
exhibiting Anderson localization will be studied. The interesting high Tc
materials will be investigated. Other projects include a study of the
superconducting proximity effect with a two dimensional electron gas and the
quantum Hall effect and fractional quantum Hall effect in the limit of low
carrier density.
