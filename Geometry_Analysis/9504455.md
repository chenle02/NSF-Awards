9504455 Oh The proposed research lies in the general area of symplectic topology
and geometry. More specifically, the investigator proposes to study Floer
cohomology and Lagrangian submanifolds. It is expected that such a study will
lead to new techniques for Lagrangian embedding and immersion problems. In
addition, the investigator proposes to consider curvature estimate problems for
special Lagrangian submanifolds - this may have ramifications in minimal
submanifold theory. Symplectic geometry provides a rigorous mathematical setting
for many problems in classical and quantum mechanics. Lagrangian submanifolds
are fundamental objects - they are extremal objects in some sense - in
symplectic geometry, Floer cohomology is a powerful topological tool for their
study.
