Scripting languages such as Python, Javascript, and Ruby have carved out an
important niche: rapid development of solutions to small and medium sized
problems. Unfortunately, scripting languages today also have significant
shortcomings: type errors arise only at runtime, making it harder to isolate
bugs; there are no declared type interfaces, forcing libraries to use
informally-described interfaces; and runtime performance is poor compared to
statically-typed languages. The main cause of these problems is the lack of a
static type system.

This project is preliminary work on a new scripting language that addresses this
problem by developing a statically-typed scripting language from scratch, aiming
to retain the flexibility of existing scripting languages while also solving the
fundamental problems of difficult debugging and poor runtime performance. The
PI's approach is based on subtype constraint type inference algorithms, which
are very flexible and do not require type declarations.
