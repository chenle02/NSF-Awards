Teaching undergraduates to use modern chemical instrumentation has become
increasingly difficult due to the sophistication and complexity of both the
instruments and the theory upon which they are based. This situation has
aggravated the problem of scheduling experiments at the most opportune time. A
unique plan to overcome these difficulties is being implemented by the Chemistry
Department of the College of the Holy Cross by merging the Physical Chemistry
and Instrumental Analysis Laboratories into a coherent three-semester advanced
laboratory program. An orderly progression from basic instrumental laboratory
techniques in the first semester to challenging and advanced topics in the third
semester is being followed. During the first semester a unique timesharing
approach utilizing the rapid data acquisition capabilities of a an ultraviolet-
visible (UV-VIS) rapid scan spectrophotometer and a Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) spectrophotometer makes it possible for all students to concurrently
carry out a series of introductory experiments in spectroscopy. During the same
semester they will be introduced to the use of the computer as a data station.
The culmination of the students' laboratory experience occurs in the third
semester where they devote attention to projects centered around some of the
challenging and advanced techniques essential to carrying out modern chemical
research, including the use of lasers in chemistry, techniques for studying very
fast reactions, and microcomputers.
