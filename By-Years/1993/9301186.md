Graph traversal is a fundamental computational problem, not only because it is
the natural abstraction of many search problems, but also because its complexity
is at the root of important relationships among deterministic, non-
deterministic, and probabilistic computations. There has been exciting progress
made during the last few years toward understanding the complexity of graph
traversal, and there are surely more breakthroughs in store very soon. This
project consists of a number of integrated approaches for investigating the time
and space complexity of graph traversal, including pseudo-random walks,
universal traversal and reflecting sequences, and time-space tradeoffs in the
rich structured setting of ``jumping automation for graphs'' (JAGs).
