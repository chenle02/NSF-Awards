John Dahler is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical statistical mechanical research on
suspensions, polymers, and chemically reactive and non-uniform fluids. Four
specific areas of research are being pursued: 1) Statistical mechanical studies
of non-uniform systems that seek to extend a new theory of non-uniform but
static thermodynamic field variables to incorporate fluxes and rates of
relaxation and reaction in terms of well-defined correlation integrals of
microdynamic variables; 2) An extension of a theory of colloidal dispersions and
applications to studies of frequency-dependent viscoelastic moduli and of
sedimentation and light scattering; 3) Studies involving a theory of chemically
reactive fluids to examine density fluctuations caused by size changes of the
species involved in reactions and the effects of chemical reaction on collective
modes of the fluid such as those associated with ordinary and fast sound; and 4)
Studies of the equilibrium properties of ideal polymer chains to incorporate the
effects of excluded volume interactions. A number of commercially important
products are derived from colloidal dispersions and solutions of polymers.
Dahler's research is focused on a molecular level understanding of the physical
properties of such complex fluid systems. A deeper understanding of these
systems may lead to improved materials properties and new commercial
applications.
