9354599 Bereman The Visualization Technologies in Environmental Curricula (VTEC)
Project is a large scale partnership effort among: Sigma Xi, the Scientific
Research Society; North Carolina State University; Duke University; the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; The North Carolina Supercomputing
Center, North Carolina Central University, The North Carolina System of
Community Colleges; and industry, government, faculty and student consultants.
VTEC is a two-year project to develop, demonstrate and evaluate: An
interdisciplinary, problem-oriented, team-based environmental case study
development strategy involving faculty, undergraduate students, and consultants
from industry, government, and supercomputing centers. Environmental curriculum
case studies and instructional materials which effectively integrate the power
of computer networking and visualization technology in enhancing understanding
of scientific concepts and their interrelationship with other disciplines in the
solution of complex environmental issues. These visualization-- enhanced case
studies are intended to increase environmental and scientific literacy and to
improve undergraduate student attitudes toward science and technology careers,
particularly among women and underrepresented minorities. Comprehensive,
project-driven computer visualization and networking skills development at the
N.C. Supercomputing Center to enable excellence in curriculum development for
collaborators from participating universities and community colleges. ***
