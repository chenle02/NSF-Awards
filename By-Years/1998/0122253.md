This is a collaborative research project between the Engineering Research Center
for Reconfigurable Machining Systems (RmS) at the University of Michigan and the
Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Wisconsin
at Milwaukee. The objective of this research is to develop a methodology of web-
based informatics platform toenable an implementation of remote monitoring and
assessment of production machinery in internet-augmented reconfigurable
manufacturing environment. The methodology will address the underlying issues in
correlating machine condition and manufacturing process data into predictable
and usable machine health and performance over time.
