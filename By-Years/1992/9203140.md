From a general point of view, the proposed work will involve the development,
implementation and evaluation of a general object- oriented framework for use in
nonlinear dynamic structural finite element analysis. This framework will
consist of sets of classes of objects modeling nodes, elements, degrees-of-
freedom, materials and so on. In light of the special issues surrounding
nonlinear dynamic analysis, the classes will be designed with the following
goals in mind: to allow flexibility in algorithm selection, implementation, and
distribution; to be well-suited for parallel implementation; and to function
well in an interactive environment with respect to model development,
modification and visualization. To achieve these goals, several key components
will be used: coordinate-free geometry, iterative techniques for solving systems
of equations; and an element-by- element implementation strategy.//
