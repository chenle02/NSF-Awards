With this award, the NSF Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the
research of Professor Helen E. Blackwell at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Professor Blackwell seeks to interrogate the mechanisms by which eukaryotes
intercept bacterial communication pathways at the host-bacteria interface.
Bacteria use a chemical language of small molecules to assess local population
densities in a process known as "quorum sensing" (QS). Plant-associated bacteria
use QS to regulate critical processes both harmful and beneficial to their plant
host. It is now evident that many plant hosts, in turn, "listen" to these
bacterial signals and can respond with their own chemical signals that influence
bacterial pathogenesis and symbiosis. The reliance of both bacteria and plants
on a language of small molecules places organic chemists in a unique position to
uncover the fundamental principles underlying this communication network and
design new tools to modulate it at the molecular level. Blackwell and her team
propose to (1) identify non-native small molecules capable of intercepting
bacterial QS at the plant-bacteria interface, (2) delineate the mechanisms by
which plants sense and respond to native and non-native QS signals, and (3)
characterize the native small molecule signals used by plants to intercept
bacterial QS.

The Broader Impacts of this research project are potentially wide-ranging. Prof.
Blackwell's discoveries should be applicable to host organisms beyond plants,
and will likely shed light upon the mechanisms by which QS occurs in host
eukaryotes, in general. As such, the CLP program sees this project as having
elements of high risk/high reward in interrogating front-line questions in the
growing fields of QS and sociomicrobiology. Students involved in this project
will be exposed to multidisciplinary research involving organic synthesis,
bacteriology, protein biochemistry, molecular biology, plant science and bio-
analytical chemistry. This is expected to provide an excellent training
environment at the chemistry-biology interface.
