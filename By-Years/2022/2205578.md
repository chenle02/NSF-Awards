The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Undergraduate Programâ€™s
Targeted Infusion Projects aim to support research and educational projects to
improve the success of HBCU students in science, technology, engineering or
mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and careers. Computer vision is an
important subfield of artificial intelligence, and it deals with developing and
analyzing algorithms that can extract useful information from images. Its
origins can be traced to research activities in the 1960s aiming to invent
machines that imitate human cognitive functions in directly observing
information from photos. Since computer vision is instrumental in science and
technology, this targeted infusion project focuses on advancing this field by
improving curriculum and establishing new educational and research
infrastructures at Texas Southern University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning
computer vision theories can be challenging for most undergraduate students as
these theories often involve high levels of mathematical relations. A common way
of teaching computer vision is to present theoretical foundations that are
followed by examples to highlight the significance of these theories. However,
students may have difficulties following lengthy mathematical derivations and
understanding specific rationales of these derivations without seeing examples
that clarify the role of major components. In order to improve teaching
methodology in computer vision, this project aims to implement and investigate
two teaching models, based on theoretical and hands-on exposure to computer
vision. The other aims of this project are to create a computer vision
certification program including a new course on this field at Texas Southern
University, to create a computer vision research program to engage senior year
undergraduate students in research, and to provide educational and research
opportunities to high school students in computer vision through summer boot
camps. To this end, learning modules with theoretical and laboratory components
to strengthen students' knowledge and practical skills, computational resources,
and continuous supervision for their research projects are
provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
