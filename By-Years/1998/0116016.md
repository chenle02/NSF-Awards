A major research instrumentation grant has been awarded to Dr. Ehud Isacoff at
the University of California at Berkeley for the purchase of a 2-photon scanning
microscope. The research goal is to probe, non-invasively, by microscopic
photometry and imaging, the distribution and structure of macromolecules (RNA,
DNA and proteins), and their activity and interactions in living cells. The
2-photon microscope makes it possible to image cells and tissues with high
spatial and reasonable temporal resolution, with penetrating excitation, but
also with optically confined irradiation, thus limiting photo-damage to cells
and photo-destruction of fluorescent tags. The instrument will form a
centerpiece of a recently built Berkeley Imaging Center. The Imaging Center will
provide access, training and technical support for use of the 2-photon
microscope for students, postdocs and faculty in the biological sciences on
campus and in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and will make the
instrument available to academic researchers at other Bay Area campuses.

The research projects conducted with the 2-photon microscope will include; 1)
studies on synaptic proteins that have been engineered to be fluorescent and to
change their fluorescence upon either activation or interaction with other
proteins, 2) optical probes of neural activity to measure the function of neural
circuits involved in visual information processing, 3) organic and protein-based
indicator dyes to study the roles of calcium ions in synaptic transmission,
short- and long-term plasticity, 4) the regulation of other second messenger
systems and, 5) fluorescently labeled proteins to study the localization of
postsynaptic receptors, and the changes in proteins involved in exocytosis
during synaptic transmission.

The aim of the research using the 2-photon microscope is to employ innovative
forms of microscopy that can characterize the dynamics of molecular machines in
their physiological environments: inside intact cells and tissues.
