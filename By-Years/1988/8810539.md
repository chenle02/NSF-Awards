The primary objective of this U.S.-Bulgaria cooperative research project is to
study the dimerization process of converting methane, an abundant natural
product, into more complex and valuable hydrocarbon compounds such as ethylene
and acetylene using direct conversion. Such a process could prove to be less
expensive than current methods. The U.S. investigator, Dr. Alvin Weiss of
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, has considerable research experience in the
closely related process of cyclic butane dehydrogenation. The Bulgarian side,
under the direction of Dr. N. Davidova of the Institute of Kinetics and
Catalysis of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, will be responsible for catalyst
preparation and characterization and will also contribute its specialized
expertise in the relatively new ENDOR analytic technique. This project fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the United States and Bulgaria to combine complementary talents, pool
resources, and share research facilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
