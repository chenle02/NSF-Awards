This research concerns three areas of spectral geometry: (1) spectral geometry,
trace formulas, and determinants for Kleinian groups, (2) finiteness and
compactness theorems for isopectral Riemannian manifolds, and (3) spectral
geometry of free boundary problems. The research concerns the development of
trace formulas and the study of determinants of Laplacians for arbitrary
geometrically finite discrete groups of hyperbolic isometries. The emphasis is
on co-infinite volume groups, and the goal is to understand poles of the
scattering operator geometrically and to study the behavior of the determinant
of the Laplacian and Selberg zeta function under deformations. This research is
in the general area of geometry and, in particular, Kleinian groups acting on
hyperbolic n-dimensional space. The research has significance both to geometry
and to mathematical physics.
