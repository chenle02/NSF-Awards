This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant promotes the national
welfare by supporting scientific research into improved methods for
redistricting. Common criticisms of districting plans include unequal district
populations, a lack of contiguity or compactness, the needless splitting of
counties (or other political subdivisions), or the use of demographic
characteristics of the population to ensure anomalous representation. The
challenge of neutrally designing districting plans leads to many questions about
baselines and tradeoffs. This project addresses these challenges through
optimization methods that provide a mathematically sound, transparent approach.
Current optimization formulations lead to very large problems that cannot be
solved using existing methods. This research will: (i) investigate methods for
establishing the limits of what is possible in a redistricting plan, and (ii)
provide politically neutral methods that can inform the public about how well
various constraints can restrain manipulation. The three components of the
education plan will serve to excite students about a career in operations
research. The PI will engage and mentor graduate and undergraduate students in
the research. Students from underrepresented populations will actively be sought
to work on the project, in part, through collaboration with the Oklahoma Louis
Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing exact
models for redistricting do not scale well. Even the best of them begin to
struggle on county-level instances of redistricting due, in part, to the large
number of variables defining these models. To satisfy critical population-
equality constraints requires a finer level of granularity, which results in an
even larger problem. This research considers new models and algorithms that have
the potential to handle significantly larger instances. This is enabled, in
part, by the newly researched Arborescence Models, which exploit planar graph
duality to simultaneously achieve small size and remarkable strength. Some of
the researched techniques for handling contiguity and compactness constraints,
e.g., length-bounded cuts, are new and require few or no additional variables.
These methods go well beyond the many existing approaches based on multi-
commodity flows or layered graphs. Investigation of these methods have the
potential to enable new solutions to network problems that have distance,
latency, and compactness constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
