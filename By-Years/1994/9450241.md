9450241 Brady Texas Learning Technology Group TLTG Environmental Science This
project intends to develop two multimedia instructional program in the
environmental sciences that relate to issues in the community. These programs
are entitled The Case of the Leaking Substance and Oil and Water. The first of
these two programs is based on leaking fuel storage tanks in a fictitious low-
income neighborhood which is polluted by leaking petrochemical storage tanks.
The program is to consist of a videodisc case study, hands- on activities,
discussions, and laboratory activities. The second program is to investigate
various factors that affect the level of soil and ground water pollution near
leaking fuel storage facilities. Both programs can be used separately or
together in an integrated format. Print-based materials are to include a student
edition of laboratory activities, notes, selected readings and databases of
resources needed for the activities and a teachers edition which supports the
programs and provides assessment items. ***
