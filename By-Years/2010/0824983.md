0824983&lt;br/&gt;Asimow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports upgrade of the
Caltech Shock Wave Lab facilities. In order to advance U.S. capability for high-
precision, high shock pressure (up to 500 GPa) dynamic compression experiments
on small, porous, and pre-heated targets (silicates, oxides and metals), a new
25 mm x 228? launch tube, flash source for fast streak photography, two
oscilloscopes and a vacuum pump will be acquired. The equipment upgrade will
permit simultaneous measurements of Equation of State, sound speed and
temperature of shocked materials and experiments at pressures equal to that
found within Earth and planetary cores. Higher shock pressures will be afforded
by the tighter barrel inner diameter of a new launch tube relative to the aging
and stress expanded tube now in use at Caltech. Studies of the melting behavior
of silicates at lower mantle conditions can be used to constrain models of the
thermochemical evolution of a magma ocean, thought to exist on the early Earth.
The new capability will also allow the PIs to explore the melting curves of
metals at conditions found within the Earth?s Core.
