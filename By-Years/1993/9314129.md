9314129 Reiss This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
theoretical chemistry between Howard Reiss of the University of California, Los
Angeles and Pierre Schaaf of the Institut Charles Sadron in Strasbourg, France.
The objective of their research is to use newly developed methods of optical
microscopy to study the deposition and adsorption of colloid particles on
various surfaces, for example, melamine particles on silica surfaces. They plan
experiments on particle deposition, kinetic theory, the radial distribution
function, and especially, the fluctuation of particle density over surfaces. The
U.S. investigator brings to this project considerable expertise in theoretical
chemistry, especially in the area of colloid particles. This is complemented by
the French experimentalist who developed a method to measure fluctuation
density. They will be involved with theoretical aspects of the project as well.
The deposition of particles and fluctuation of particle density are of
considerable importance in science and technology, and of particular interest to
the biochemistry field, where the focus has been on the adsorption of proteins
on surfaces. ***
