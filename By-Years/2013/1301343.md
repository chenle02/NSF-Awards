In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Liming Zhang of Department of Chemistry at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, aims to study the reactivities of two novel and
reactive gold intermediates, gold vinylidene and gold aryne complex, and develop
versatile reactions based on them that would be operationally simple, high
yielding, and robust and offer unique/unprecedented access to important new
skeletons. These procedures will be used in the synthesis of highly complex
natural and unnatural products such as polycyclic hydrocarbons and heterocycles.
Successful implementation of these strategies will provide for the rapid
assembly of a variety of polycyclic systems, including some less commonly found
in the chemical literature. Ready access to privileged ligand frameworks may
also be achieved. Successful outcomes should have an impact on any area of
chemical activity where the syntheses of novel molecules are needed, such as in
the pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical industries. Moreover, the project
promises to provide excellent training vehicles of students at all levels,
including those from historically underrepresented groups.
