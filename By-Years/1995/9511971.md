IBN-9511971 Clemens, Lynwood G. Reproductive success in most species depends on
both humoral and neural responses acting coordinately. The majority of studies
have focused on the male as the critical component for determining successful
outcomes, however, female reproductive tract function is also significant, and
yet underinvestigated. In the present work, Dr. Clemens will focus on the
effects of hormones on uterine contractions and the role of these contractions
in the initiation of pregnancy. By recording electrical activity of uterine
muscles, it will be possible to determine what stimuli are important for the
induction of uterine activity around the time of ovulation and whether these
responses are associated with the release of hormones from the ovary involved in
the initiation of pregnancy. The experiments will provide new and exciting
information on the role of the female reproductive system in pregnancy
initiation and reproductive success in mammals.
