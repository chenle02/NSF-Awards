This RUI grant will support research by a University of Dallas faculty member
and her students to determine the low spin structure of the nuclei of tellurium
isotopes using (n,nOgamma) reactions. Excited states up to about 3.3 MeV can be
studied using neutrons from the University of Kentucky Van de Graaff accelerator
and the measurements include studies of lifetimes using the Doppler-shift
attenuation method as well as gamma-gamma angular correlations to determine the
spins of excited states. The work will involve a collaboration with a U.S. Naval
Academy faculty member and his students as well as personnel from the University
of Kentucky.
