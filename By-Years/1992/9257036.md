This NSF Young Investigator grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
work of Professor Thomas C. Pochapsky at Brandeis University. The structure and
dynamics of self-assembling systems will be determined using NMR and
chromatographic techniques. Two-dimensional NMR techniques will be used to
determine the structures of putidaredoxin and closely related analogues prepared
by site-directed mutagenesis. Other biological macromolecules that will be
investigated include a chimeric protein created by replacing a four-residue
tight turn in interleukin-1-beta with the ten-residue trypsin binding loop from
alpha-1-antitrypsin. Ion pair structure will be investigated by measuring inter-
ion pair NOE's. %%% The three dimensional structure of proteins will be
determined by using a spectroscopic tool which gives a response which can be
related to the distance between pairs of atomic nuclei. Distance data for
several pairs of nuclei greatly restrict the possible solution geometry of the
protein and in many cases provide a unique structure. This work will provide
important information necessary to understand the forces which control molecular
self-assembly.
