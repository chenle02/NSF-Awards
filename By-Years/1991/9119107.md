The powdery mildew disease of barley, caused by the obligate fungal pathogen
Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei, offers several advantages for the study of host
genes mediating resistance. This disease has been studied intensively for more
than 50 years; thus, there is an extensive base of physiological data and
genetic materials available that is unmatched by most other host/pathogen
systems. The barley M1-a locus is of particular interest in that more than 30
resistance alleles have been identified at this locus. By screening 118,000 M2
seedlings, I have isolated 41 partially or fully susceptible mutants.
Complementation analysis of these new alleles will be used to determine the
genetic structure of the M1-a locus, which may represent either a complex locus
or cluster of tightly linked genes. Also, the mutants will be exploited in
subtractive hybridization experiments to isolate M1-a cDNA clones. No such
disease resistance gene has been cloned from any plant. Analysis of the M1-a
clones will provide information about the nature of the allelic variation at the
M1-a locus and about the biochemical role of the M1-a gene product in mediating
disease resistance.***//
