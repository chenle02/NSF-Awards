*** 9760843 Jamison This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
to develop a robust field emission electron source using diamond microtips as a
replacement for standard hot filament cathodes. The project will use
nanocrystaline diamond microtips grown in a silicon mold to produce diamond
field emission sources that are direct replacements for hot filament cathodes
used in many scientific instruments. Phase I of this project will test the
applicability of diamond microtips for use as a cold field emission source of
electrons to replace hot filaments in electron guns. The concept will first be
tested by replacing the hot filament cathode in an electron gun by the diamond
microtip and obtaining preliminary operating parameters (e.g. maximum emission
current, emission voltage, etc.) for the gun. This information will then be used
to design a direct replacement tip for hot filament electron guns. Because
diamond microtips have a very low effective work function, the Wehnelt power
supply in most electron guns should serve as the extractor supply. The
anticipated benefits of simple field emission replacement for a hot filament
electron gun are many, They range a high brightness "burn-out-proof", low energy
spread electron gun for scientific applications, to robust, smaller spot size
electron guns for high resolution TV tubes. ***
