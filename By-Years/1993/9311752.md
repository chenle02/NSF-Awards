9311752 Telford The objective of this research is the physics of marine stratus
clouds which exist over large portions of the ocean adjacent to the Americas.
The competing effects of radiative exchange; vertical motion within the clouds
and the heat exchange at the sea surface need to be evaluated experimentally.
The necessary measurements will be made using a research aircraft (C- 130) from
NCAR. In particular, a new (spectral) radiometer will be used, which should help
to determine the relative importance of infrared cooling from the cloud tops.
