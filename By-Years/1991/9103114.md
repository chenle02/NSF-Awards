Description: This project provides support for participation of two University
of Miami scientists, in an on-going research project in Karachi, Pakistan, at
the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) under the
direction of Dr. M. A. Beg. The project aims at finding optimum methods to
remove pollutants from industrial waste water so that it can be reused. The
research has been underway for three years, and at the stage of moving from
laboratory studies to pilot plant treatment. The work deals with small tanneries
as well as textile mill waste waters. For small tanneries the treatment covers
high pH, high solids, biological aeration, and for textile mills it is based on
ultrafiltration. It is anticipated that the existing pilot plant will be
modified, and additional, more representative, types of tannery and textile
wastes will be collected from various plants. Scope: This project brings two
U.S. specialists and well known researchers in environmental sciences with an
active senior Pakistani scientist to collaborate in finding viable solutions to
one of the most common and damaging problems in urban areas of developing
countries. The results can have wide application in many countries where both
the scarcity of water and the pervasiveness of contamination from low-tech
industries cause severe degradation of the quality of life. The project fits
well within the guidelines of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
