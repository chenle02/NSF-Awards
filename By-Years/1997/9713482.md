9713482 Hochbaum This project will study three approaches to devising algorithms
and analyzing their effectiveness for obtaining solutions to hard optimization
problems. These three approaches (1) probabilistic analysis of heuristic
algorithms, (2) worst case analysis of heuristic algorithms, and (3) implicit
enumerative algorithm design are often pursued separately, since the techniques
involved are usually quite different. Considerable insight can be gained by
employing all three approaches in parallel. Algorithm design is largely an ad
hoc procedure, whether the goal is to devise an algorithm with good performance
based on its average or worst case performance, or to provide bounding
procedures within a branch-and-bound context. This research will focus on
devising unified techniques applicable to large problem classes. The research is
expected to generate, among other outcomes, a unified technique based on the
choice of problem formulation and the application of specific types of
transformation on the formulations that make obtaining good feasible solutions
easy, at a limited loss of optimality. This technique has enormous potential for
deriving approximation algorithms with good performance and generating tight
bounds that are useful for enumerative algorithms. The technique is also a
unified approach applicable to a wide range of problems. If the investigation
using all three approaches is successful, it will provide new and useful methods
for improving the quality of solutions for problems in areas varying from
telecommunications and scheduling to locations, clustering and circuit testing.
