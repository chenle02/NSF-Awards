Global Riemannian Geometry generalizes the classical Euclidean, Spherical, and
Hyperbolic geometries. One of the major challenges in this area of study is to
understand how local geometric invariants such as curvature, that is, how the
space under consideration "bends", relate to global topological invariants such
as fundamental group, which indicates whether or not the space has 1-dimensional
"holes". Manifolds with curvature bounds have been studied intensively since the
conception of global Riemannian geometry. One relatively recent approach, which
is the focus of this project, to the study of manifolds with lower curvature
bounds has been the introduction of symmetries. Graduate students will be
trained through research.

The principal investigator will pursue a program in which she carefully studies
and analyzes symmetries of both Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bounds
and Alexandrov spaces, considering both sectional curvature and Ricci curvature
lower bounds and their corresponding generalizations to Alexandrov spaces, with
an eye to gaining a deeper understanding of this largely unknown class of
spaces.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
