9309053 Ducheyne This grant will support a study of the mechanisms involved in
the promotion of bone tissue formation and bonding by bioactive materials.
Specifically, the research will determine if carbonate containing hydroxyapatite
with small crystal dimensions is the rate limiting reaction. The study will make
use of transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. This study
is important since it may lead to the development of new materials for implant
devices or to the optimization of presently used materials for orthopedic and
dental implants. ***
