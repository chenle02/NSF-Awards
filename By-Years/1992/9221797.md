The New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium proposes to lead the U.S. effort in
concluding U.S.-Argentina workshop series in Coastal Ocean Engineering Research
with due regard to the coastal environment. The first workshop was held in
Buenos Aires and the second and last would be held in the United States at
Miami, Florida. The subject matter for both workshops will be approximately the
same, but the specific content of the second workshop will be based on the
results of the first workshop and the need to fulfill the objectives of the
project. The objective of this workshop is to enable the United States and
Argentina to gain mutually from collaborative discussion of common research
needs in developing coastal ocean space and how best to approach them. In this
connection, two projects already in conceptual stages, are being planned. The
New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium will act as rapporteur and assume
responsibility for preparation of a report covering the workshop. The report
will include, in addition to the presented papers and dialogues; thoughtful
extractions of the sense of the meeting and recommendations for future actions
therefrom. Copies of these reports will be distributed to the participants,
sponsors, and others.
