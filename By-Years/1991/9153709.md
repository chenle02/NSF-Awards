This proposal is for a planning grant that is the first step in the
development, implementation, and evaluation of material for middle school
mathematics. It is anticipated that a full proposal will be submitted to
Instructional Material Development at the end of this project. The PI proposes
to become involved in the efforts of successful programs in curriculum
development, to study the materials available, and to make contacts with other
mathematics educators by means of NCTM and other professional meetings.//
