Two fundamental tasks of laboratory education are (1) to engage students in the
processes of science and (2) to communicate scientific information effectively.
To accomplish these tasks, educators must keep pace with current trends in
science education. Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is such a trend.
Computers are laboratory tools important in data acquisition and analysis. They
are communication tools in the rapidly growing field of information technology.
The objective of this project is to improve laboratory science education with
the installation of a networked multimedia laboratory. Students acquire skills
with modern information technologies by using them to learn science. These
technologies are being implemented in a prototype program (Human
Anatomy/Physiology Learning Program or HALP), using innovative teaching
approaches documented in the literature. Laboratory instruction incorporates
interactive multimedia, computer-assisted data analysis, and on-line information
retrieval. This project improves and updates undergraduate laboratory science
education at college. It produces better-educated science students; that is,
students who are capable of using information technologies, who are excited
about science, and who have succeeded in learning science.
