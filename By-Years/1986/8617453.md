Research will be conducted into the inelastic deformation and failure of
ceramics in a combined theoretical and experimental investigation. The research
will address improved understanding of the development of microcrack structures
and corresponding reduction in stiffness of materials. Constitutive equations
will be developed for the evolution of damage due to microcrack initiation,
growth, and coalescence. Sub- microsecond duration plane-wave experiments will
be conducted to verify the theoretical models. The impacted ceramics specimens
will be recovered and examined after impact to characterize the development of
microcracks. An improved understanding of microcrack development in ceramics and
the subsequent effect on stiffness will be applicable to a wide variety of
strength/stiffness problems in ceramics.
