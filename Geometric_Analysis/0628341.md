Black holes have fascinated physicists and mathematicians for half a century.
Despite intensive research, they remain one of the most enigmatic objects in the
universe. Many important theoretical breakthroughs in physics have resulted from
attempts at a better understanding of the mysteries of black hole.
Supersymmetric black holes arise from Calabi-Yau compactifications of string
theory. A precise relation between topological string amplitudes (or Gromov-
Witten invariants) of the Calabi-Witten computations were performed and found to
be in complete agreement with the conjecture. It is proposed to provide the
foundations of this new theory and greatly expand on these new connections
between geometry and string theory, in the process enriching both fields.

In the past few years a deep connection has been found between microscopic
constituents of black holes and cycles with minimal volume inside manifolds.
This connects puzzles of black holes to many mathematically interesting
questions, including special Lagrangian submanifolds, holomorphic curves, etc.
These are broadly known as topological strings. The project is an attempt to
more deeply understand the link between topological strings and black holes.
This will very likely have important ramifications both for physics and
mathematics. The principal investigators have already made some of the
pioneering investigations in this regard and with their active research groups
are well equipped to carry out the proposed research.
