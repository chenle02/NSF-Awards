EIA-222359&lt;br/&gt;Salim Hariri&lt;br/&gt;University of
Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS: The Fourth Annual Workshop on Active
Middleware Services (AMS 2002) and The Third Annual International Workshop on
Grid Computing (Grid 2002)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing complexity of the
emerging ubiquitous grid network infrastructure in conjunction with active
technologies requires additional support for application developers and users.
Middleware will play a crucial role in the degree to which active technologies
achieve their full potential. Such middleware will in all probability be
deployed in grid environments. For these reasons, two workshops are proposed:
one in active middleware and another in grid computing. While these two
workshops will be held separately, each will bring together leading researchers
in their respective fields. Research in related areas will be invited to add
their expertise to the discussions. While the main focus of each workshop in
different, there is nonetheless a synergy between them. Both could explore the
advanced area of active grid middleware.&lt;br/&gt;
