This project supports laboratory studies of the chemical evolution of organic
carbon in the atmosphere. Research is ongoing to investigate how key properties
of organic compounds change as they undergo multiple generations of atmospheric
aging. This effort will provide significant insight into the distribution of
carbon across species and into the formation of organic aerosol in the
atmosphere. This research will help improve current models of air quality and
climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific scientific objectives of this
project are as follows: (1) The development of laboratory approaches and
capabilities for chemically characterizing all carbon within a laboratory aging
context, using a range of speciated and ensemble techniques; and (2) Application
of these approaches to key atmospheric aging systems in order to track the
evolution of organic carbon within both the gas and particle phases. Recent
advances in the characterization of atmospheric organic species, including
traditionally difficult-to-measure species such as multifunctional oxidized VOCs
(OVOCs) and semivolatile and intermediate-volatility organic compounds
(S/IVOCs), enable carbon closure studies to be carried out in the laboratory for
the first time.
