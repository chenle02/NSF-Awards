Description: This award supports cooperative research by Dr. Douglas Macdougall
of Scripps Institute of Oceanagraphy with Dr. K. Gopalan of the National
Geophysical Research Institute, in Hyderabad, India. The work covers geo-
chemical and petrogenetic research in the Deccan basalts of India. The field
research is to be carried in three areas, in Gujarat in western India, in the
Rajasthan and in eastern India. Each of these areas contains a different
geologic structure and possesses a unique relevance to the general field of
mantle geochemistry. Samples will be collected and shipped to the U.S. where
laboratory work will be done at Scripps. Scope: Drs. Macdougall and Gopalan have
collaborated in this research area for several years with significant published
results and with a number of U.S. graduate students obtaining samples and data,
for their Ph.D. research, from the field in India. The collaborative effort is
productive and the results of high quality. Dr. Macdougall is currently funded
under two grants: INT8613485 for field expenses in India; and EAR8618554 for
research costs in the U.S. This action is being funded under INT8722661 to
National Geophysical Research Institute and INT8813233 to Scripps Institute.
