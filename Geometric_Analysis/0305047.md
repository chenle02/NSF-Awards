ABSTRACT TOPICS IN DISCRETE GROUPS AND GEOMETRY

Richard Schwartz plans to continue his research in geometry and discrete
groups. One of his main goals is to explore the connections between three
dimensional real hyperbolic geometry and four dimensional complex hyperbolic
geometry. Schwartz observed that certain complex hyperbolic deformations of the
reflection triangle groups lead to complex hyperbolic four-manifolds whose ideal
boundaries are real hyperbolic three-manifolds. As the angles in the triangle
group change, the ideal boundary appears to undergo Dehn surgery. Schwartz also
plans to study quotients of the circle, based on patterns of geodesics in the
hyperbolic plane which are invariant under the action of a surface group. The
idea is to make topological models for the limit sets which could arise in
connection with deformations of surface groups into Lie groups and then use the
models to study actual deformations of surface groups into Lie groups.

Broadly speaking, Schwartz' research deals with the geometry of infinite
repeating patterns. A crystal lattice is an example of an infinite repeating
pattern in Euclidean space. Analogous patterns exist in curved spaces, and often
the curvature of the space allows for the existence of more exotic and
geometrically rich patterns. Schwartz is interested in the studying these exotic
patterns when they are generated by a simple mechanism which has a finite
description. For example, one can place several mirrors in a curved space and
look at the pattern generated by the images of an object which is reflected
endlessly in the mirrors. The central question is: When does the finite
mechanism of generation lead to an infinite discrete pattern?
