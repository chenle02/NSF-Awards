Our understanding of stellar evolution hinges to a large extent on our ability
to interpret the spectra of cool stars. The Principal and Co- Investigators
(PI's) plan to continue a long-term program of laboratory measurements of the
emission spectra of molecules of astrophysical interests. The PI's measurements
will determine wavelengths, level structure, excitation energies, and transition
probabilities from measurements made with an electric furnace mounted in the
beam of the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the McMath Solar Telescope on Kitt
Peak. These data will be transformed to spectral atlases for use in molecular
identification and molecular synthesis by astronomers interested in determining
the physical conditions (including chemical composition) of the atmospheres of
cool stars.
