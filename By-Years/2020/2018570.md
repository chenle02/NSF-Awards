This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a
photonic 3D printer for the rapid fabrication of nano- to macro-scale parts and
maskless lithography. As the only system of its kind in the state, it will
enable users at Purdue and throughout the region to pursue new fundamental
research directions by eliminating fabrication bottlenecks and design
limitations. The team will integrate the instrumentation into ongoing education
and outreach activities and will leverage the College of Engineeringâ€™s Summer
Undergraduate Research Fellow program and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation program for undergraduate research using the system. The PIs will
work with middle and high school students -- in collaboration with Deaf Kids
CODE--enabling students to design and 3D print their own microrobots and to
write code to control them -- exposing the students to the worlds of
microtechnology, controls, and microrobotics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
instrumentation will enable interdisciplinary fundamental research in a range of
fields including microrobotics, materials, sensors, devices, metamaterials, and
programmable structures. The potentially transformative fundamental research can
advance understanding of nanoscale physics during phase change from liquid to
gas by enabling fabrication of nanopores for nanoscale evaporation. The
fundamental research on materials and metamaterials can lead to novel phase
transforming materials that can be used to design and fabricate energy
absorption systems at the nano-scale. The research on microrobotics may advance
fundamental knowledge on the navigation and control of micro-robots through
vision-based micro-force sensing systems and how such robots might be scaled-
down for biomedical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
