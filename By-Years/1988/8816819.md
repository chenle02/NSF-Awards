The PI will model the structural and thermodynamic properties of silicate
liquids and solids. Liquid simulations will include Monte Carlo and integral
equation approaches, with covalent potentials deduced from molecular orbital
calculations and spectroscopic as well as thermodynamic data. Properties to be
studies include the relationship between glass and liquid structure, Raman and
IR spectra of compressed silica glass, equation of state of silicate liquids,
and the effect of pressure induced coordination changes on the compressibility.
Crystalline phases of selected oxides and silicates will be modelled with
Hamiltonians that include many body effects. Parametric many body potentials
will be developed in conjunction with numerical models based on extensions of
existing electron gas models. The potentials will be used to calculate the
elastic constants and phase stability as functions of pressure and temperature.
The parametric models will also be used to study relationships among thermal
properties and other more easily accessible properties, such as compressibility.
