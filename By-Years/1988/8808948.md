In the Northern part of the United States, a variety of structures (small
buildings, highway embankments, tanks) are supported at shallow depths on soil
deposits composed of a crust (1 to 5 meters thick) overlying a deep layer of
soft clay. It is often uneconomical to provide support for the structures using
deep foundations which penetrate through the soft clay to harder layers
underneath. For shallow support, the ability to perform analyses that include
the effects of the stiff crust are important. Unfortunately, the physical
properties of the crust are difficult to measure and analyses for a layered
system (soil layers of varying properties) is difficult. This proposal provides
for a careful set of physical measurements of the stress-strain properties of
hand carved samples of a desiccated crust in Maine, and for analytical work
needed to allow these properties to be modeled properly in theoretical analyses.
The results of the study should make foundation design more economical and
minimise the probabilities of failures.
