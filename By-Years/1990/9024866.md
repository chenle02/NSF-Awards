Mills College will develop and operate a 6-week program for 24 women
undergraduates, selected nationwide, which will provide them with an intensive
immersion in mathematics designed to motivate them, and strengthen their
preparation, for entrance into a mathematics Ph.D. program after graduation. The
program will also broaden and strengthen the efforts of the nation's mathematics
faculty to encourage more women to major in mathematics and to direct the most
promising ones toward graduate school. The program will also encourage
participating students to serve as leaders in mathematical activities among
their peers at their own institution. Finally, data will be gathered and
analyzed with a view to clarifying the reasons why many fewer women mathematics
majors than men now go on to Ph.D. programs in mathematics.
