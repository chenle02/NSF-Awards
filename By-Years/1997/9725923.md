This award supports Dr. Omar Knio and a graduate student from the Johns Hopkins
University in a collaboration with Rupert Klein of the Department of Safety
Engineering at the Bergische University in Wuppertal. The collaboration will
investigate the development of asymptotics-based schemes which enable simulation
of fluid flows characterized by a stiff scale-complexity. The specific focus of
the project is in two areas: slender vortex filaments and high Reynolds number,
and compressible flows at very low Mach number. In both cases, the approach will
be based on combining asymptotic multiple-scale analysis with state-of-the-art
numerical methods for flow simulation. The results of this work could have
implications for related areas, such as, turbulent flows, oceanic and
atmospheric flows, shocks, flames, interfaces, and bubbles, among others.
