Major advances in the understanding of macromolecular structure have come
directly from advances in computation and computer graphics and from the
development of methods that have enhanced collection of X-ray crystallographic
data. This award will support a collaborative effort to solve major problems in
crystallographic refinement and computer graphics analysis of macromolecular
structure using the combined unique resources available at the San Diego
Supercomputer Center (SDSC), the University of California at San Diego (UCSD),
and the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic (RISC). Each institution has
outstanding strengths in aspects of crystallography, molecular dynamics,
graphics, and computation. In Crystallography, the group expects to decrease the
time required to refine a structure from years to months, and to substantially
improve the accuracy of the refinement. Tightly coupling supercomputer
calculations on the CRAY with visualization of the calculation on a graphics
workstation will allow the design and testing of novel molecular modeling
algorithms. Algorithm design will be driven and tested by specific structural
problems requiring the analysis of folding, shape, flexibility, and
electrostatic forces as well as the prediction of interaction complexes. This
project will provide a set of integrated software tools that will result in
advances in structure determination and refinement, and in structural
interpretation, modeling, and design. The intention is to develop a facility
that can be widely used by the scientific community as a whole. This project
should have a major impact on the efficient use of supercomputer calculations
for structural molecular biology and molecular graphics.
