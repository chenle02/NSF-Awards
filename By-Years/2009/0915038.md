Many routine, real-world tasks can be seen as sequential decision tasks. For
instance, navigating a robot through a complex environment, driving a car in
congested traffic, and routing packets in a computer network requires making a
sequence of decisions that together minimize time and resources used. It would
be desirable to automate these tasks, yet it is difficult because the optimal
decisions are generally not known. Many existing learning methods lead to
reactive behaviors that perform well in short term, but do not amount to
intelligent high-level behavior in the long term. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is developing methods for learning strategic high-level behavior.
Strategic methods need to (1) retain information from past states, (2) learn
multimodal behavior, (3) choose between the different behaviors based on crucial
detail, and (4) implement a sequential high-level strategy based on those
behaviors. The neuroevolution methods developed in prior work solve the first
problem by evolving (through genetic algorithms) recurrent neural networks to
represent the behavior. To solve the remaining problems, these methods are being
extended in the proposed work with multi-objective optimization, local nodes
with cascaded structure, and with evolution of modules and their combinations.
Preliminary results indicate that this approach is indeed feasible.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the long term, developed technology will make it
possible to build robust sequential decision systems for real-world tasks. It
leads to safer and more efficient vehicle, traffic, and robot control, improved
process and manufacturing optimization, and more efficient computer and
communication systems. It will also make the next generation of video games
possible, with characters that exhibit realistic, strategic behaviors: Such
technology should lead to more effective educational and training games in the
future. The OpenNERO open source software platform developed in this work will
be made available to the research community.
