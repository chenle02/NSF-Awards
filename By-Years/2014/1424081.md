Many scientific fields conduct research using data collected from large-scale
probability samples of individuals or establishments. Secondary analyses of
these data can be complicated by the complex nature of the sampling strategies,
which are employed for data collection efficiency. It is important that any
secondary analyses employ appropriate analytic techniques that account for the
complex sample designs. This concept can be described as examining analytic
error within the broader framework of Total Survey Error (TSE), which is a very
promising area of survey research. This project will begin by identifying and
documenting potential analytic errors in several complex NCSES surveys. The next
step will be to synthesize best practices for analyses of these data. In the
principal focus of the project, these state-of-the-art methods will be compared
and contrasted to existing analyses of NCSES data, and the implications that
alternative approaches can have for the interpretation of the results. This
research has the potential to improve the analytic uses of NCSES data, but also
to make contributions to the more appropriate use of complex sample survey data
in general.
