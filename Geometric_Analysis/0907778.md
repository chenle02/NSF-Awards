In recent years, striking progress has been made in Kahler geometry. The famous
Calabi conjecture states that every Kahler manifold whose first Chern class C_1
has a definite sign will always have a Kahler Einstein metric with appropriate
sign on its scalar curvature. This famous conjecture was proved by Yau in 1976
when C_1 =0, and independently by Yau and Aubin for the case C_1 < 0. In Fano
surface, the corresponding Calabi conjecture is solved by G. Tian in 1989. The
high dimensional case is largely open till this day. This is an exciting area of
mathematics in which we will see more important breakthroughs in the near future
with impact both on the rest of mathematics and on physics. For instance, the
work of Calabi-Yau directly provided mathematical foundation to mirror symmetry
in the so called Calabi-Yau manifold. Therefore, we propose to study a network
of problems centered around the existence of extremal Kahler metric, stability
of the underlying polarized Kahler manifold, and other related areas. Extremal
Kahler metrics is natural extension to the renown Calabi-Yau metrics.

The principal investigator has been involved in the education and supervision of
many graduate students at the University of Wisconsin and elsewhere. The
proposer actively promotes the interaction of mathematicians from USA, Europe
and Asian (particularly China, Japan and S.Korea). He has organized several
international conferences in China where mathematicians from different
background are invited. So this proposal will enhance our ability to train next
generation of US based mathematicians.

More broadly, The set of problems we propose here is key problems in
differential geometry, which has strong impact to other fields of sciences like
physics. According to Albert Einstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted
as the geometry of space-time. Thus the research in differential geometry is
crucially important in physics and cosmology. The proposer's work, together with
the works of other mathematicians and physicists, helps in understanding our
Universe.
