This project convenes an international conference on computational stochastic
mechanics in the fall of 1991. The goal of the conference is to bring together
the two distinct fields of computational mechanics and stochastic processes and
to facilitate their applications in areas where uncertainty and system
complexity prevail. In earthquake engineering many problems are dominated by
factors which are uncertain, functions which are non deterministic, or materials
systems which are too complex to model by conventional mathematical means.
Stochastic processes theories when combined with advanced computational methods
offer an effective approach to the solutions of such problems. The conference
will provide a unique opportunity for exchanging ideas on the current status of
computational methods as applied to stochastic methods and for identifying
future research needs.
