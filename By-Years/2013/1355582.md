The Department of Computer Science at Kean University is implementing "Project
ASK: Applying Student Knowledge (ASK) for Success in Computer Science (CS) and
Information Technology (IT)," which is aimed at increasing the number of
academically talented, financially needy students graduating with undergraduate
degrees in CS and IT. Project ASK supports a total of 40 transfer students and
rising juniors who each receive two-year scholarships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASK
Scholars participate in weekly workshops, cohort experiences, and interact
closely with faculty members who provide academic and professional support
through advising and mentoring. They gain leadership experience from
participating in professional student organizations and local and regional
programming contests. The individual and cohort experiences offered to ASK
Scholars provide a basis for intellectual growth and promote increased student
confidence, retention, and timely degree completion. Upon graduation, ASK
Scholars are prepared to enter the scientific workforce or graduate school as
competent, highly trained individuals who are skilled in teamwork and research,
serve as role models to members of their communities and contribute to increased
diversity in the fields of CS and IT.
