The award will facilitate the participation of US-based and/or US citizen
graduate students to the 2020 Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF).
CSF, founded in 1988, is an annual conference for researchers in computer
security, to examine current theories of security, the formal models that
provide a context for those theories, and techniques for verifying security. The
2020 edition of CSF will take place in Boston, MA in June 2020. Attending
conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our
society's future computer security researchers. Students will have the
opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security
researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships
that will serve them well during their research
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
