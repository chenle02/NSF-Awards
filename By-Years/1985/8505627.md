Although most superconducting circuits employed for small-scale applications use
Josephson conjunctions as an active or switching element, in some important
instances Josephson junctions should be replaceable by simple thin wires whose
dimensions are of the size of the temperature-dependent coherence length, E(T).
The researchers are studying theoretically the feasibility of a microcircuit
which may behave in many respects like a SQUID (superconducting quantum
interference device) circuit without the use of Josephson junctions. This device
may be fabricated by means of a superconducting loop whose diameter is of the
order of magnitude of the coherence length and has connected to it on opposite
sides superconducting wires for the purpose of injecting an external control
current. Magnetic flux B is applied perpendicular to the ring. The flux density
gives rise to a circulating current. The circulating current density will be
studied as a function of magnetic flux for various injected control currents,
and these results will be extended to more complicated circuits such as finite
and infinite ladder circuits and arrays.
