9317214 Basu This collaborative project is to conduct petrologic, Nd, Sr, Pb-
isotopic, major and trace element geochemical studies, 3He/4He isotopic and
40Ar/39Ar geochronologic studies of alkalic igneous rocks, which are found in
association with the major flood basalt provinces of Deccan in India and Parana
in Brazil. This research will establish the time- relationship of the alkalic
rocks with respect to the main pulse of voluminous flood basalt volcanism. This
research will also attempt to establish early temporal histories of the Reunion
and Tristen da Cunha mantle plumes, which are generally believed to be
responsible for Deccan and Parana volcanism, respectively. The proposed
acquisition of the isotopic data of He, Nd, Sr and Pb are expected to
characterize the plume source-magma. The results of this study are also expected
to contribute to current controversies regarding plume-impact versus plume-
incubation hypotheses and on questions of the relative contributions of
lithospheric mantle in flood basalt generation.
