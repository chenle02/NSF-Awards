HRD-#9453829 Center for Accessible Technology Lisa Wahl, Principal Investigator
"Science Access for All Students (SAAS)" ABSTRACT The Center for Accessible
Technology, working cooperatively with the NSF-supported State Systemic
Initiative (SSI), California Advocacy for Mathematics and Science (CAMS) will
conduct a one-year pilot project that will establish a model for improving
instructional delivery for students with disabilities, in grades 3-6. The
outcome is a plan for teacher enhancement that would be activated statewide
first in elementary school science and later in middle school mathematics. The
project, entitled Science Access for All Students, has the following goals: o
Science curricula will be reviewed and made accessible for all students, o
Science educators and staff developers in California will be prepared to meet
the needs of students with disabilities, o A selection of elementary schools
where students with disabilities are mainstreamed will be established as model
sites for total inclusion in science curricula, o A replicable model for
accessibility review and staff development will be disseminated, and o A
proposal for statewide enhancement of teaching science and mathematics to
students with disabilities will be developed. These goals will be achieved
through a process of reviewing the accessibility of instructional materials,
adapting instructional materials, providing on-site support and professional
development, and disseminating findings and procedures.
