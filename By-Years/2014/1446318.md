This workshop project is designed to bring together dedicated faculty members in
Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) from across the USA to share and acquire
up-to-date knowledge in a conference format about the most effective strategies
for improving retention and graduation rates of Hispanic students majoring in
STEM disciplines. Attending will be faculty instructors and administrators from
an equal number of 2-year and 4-year HSI institutions. The focus is on
successful approaches that have worked for Hispanic students. The conference is
covering emerging topics of particular interest to HSIs, including data about
outcomes of new approaches that is being disseminated for the first time. The
workshop will focus in particular on around high-context educational activities
(e.g. internships, co-ops, and research experiences with faculty members as
mentors) that students from Hispanic origins find particularly empowering and
motivating.
