This project employs a combination of fractionation, protein labeling, and
antibody techniques to identify and purify polypeptide components of pea Golgi
and plasma membrane glucan synthase systems. This work makes possible the
identification and cloning of the responsible gene sequences so that molecular
aspects of the regulation of plant cell wall synthesis and Golgi function can be
further investigated. Cell wall polysaccharides are generally the most abundant
products of plant metabolism. Their biosynthesis is as characteristic and
central to plant growth as structural protein synthesis is to the growth of
animals. Wall synthesis must be correlated with cell enlargement; in growing
tissues it is up- regulated in response to growth-stimulating hormones and
environmental signals. Wall synthesis is also a prominent aspect of plant cell
differentiation. Synthesis is conspicuously up- regulated during the development
of thick-walled specialized cells such as epidermal cells, vascular elements,
fibers and sclereids. Thus, understanding the control of wall polysaccharide-
synthesizing enzymes and the genes that encode them would bring us close to the
heart of plant cell biology and development.
