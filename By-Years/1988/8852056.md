In order that existing solid state physics lecture and laboratory courses may be
kept abreast of new developments, the physics department will add a Raman
spectroscopy experiment to the laboratory course. This will add capability in
the optical study of solids and builds upon the modest amount of optical
equipment which already exists. The instrumentation to be acquired can itself be
expanded upon later to add experiments involving other optical techniques such
as Brillouin scattering and flourescence.
