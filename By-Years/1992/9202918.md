New theoretical and computational methods for computer simulation studies of
biomolecular systems will be developed. These methods will be applied to help
explain the activity of several systems of chemical and biological interest.
More specifically, effective potential energy functions that are more accurate
than those in common use for molecular dynamics simulations will be created by
explicit inclusion of electronic polarization. Other potential functions that
are more approximate but that can be evaluated rapidly will be created by
implicit treatment of solvent. Applications will be made to molecular
recognition in host-receptor systems, to the dynamics of enzyme-substrate
interactions, and to the kinetics of enzymatic reactions. %%% The significance
of the work lies in the provision of new tools for designing drugs, enzymes, ion
channels, and other molecules for practical applications; in the deepening
understanding of the activity of biological molecules; and in the preparation of
young scientists for research careers in this emerging field.
