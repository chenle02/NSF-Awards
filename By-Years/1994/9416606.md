9416606 BRULAND Although chemical and biological oceanographers have known for
several decades that the dynamics of many trace elements, especially the
bioactive trace metals, and the population dynamics of the phytoplankton are
intimately interrelated, few studies have succeeded in establishing cause-and-
effect relationships between them. In this study, an internationally preeminent
marine trace metal geochemist will address this question by studying the
interactions between four trace metals-- iron, manganese, copper, and zinc --
with phytoplankton communities off the coasts of California and British
Columbia. Because these are areas where deep nutrient-and-metal-rich water is
upwelled to the surface, the principal investigator will be able to sample the
plankton, the four trace metals (and their various chemical forms, or
"species"), along transects extending from the low-productivity oceanic zone far
from shore, across the high-production upwelling zone and its environs, and into
the nearshore zone. By studying the cruise-track variations in water chemistry
and plankton community composition and productivity, the PI will attempt to
elucidate how phytoplankton productivity relates to the phytoplankton blooms
impact trace metal chemistry.
