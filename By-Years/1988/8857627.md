Dr. Francisco has been awarded a Presidential Young Investigator Award through
The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform spectroscopic studies of
energy transfer and molecular photodissociation dynamics. The studies which Dr.
Francisco is performing on reactive intermediates have an important bearing on
atmospheric chemistry, biochemistry, combustion and surface chemistry. In his
research, Dr. Francisco uses a variety of laser techniques, such as laser
photolysis coupled with laser-induced fluorescence, emission, and multiphoton
spectroscopy to obtain information on how the structure and reactivity of
molecules correlate. A novel aspect of his research is the intimate interplay of
theory and experiment for the detection and characterization of polyatomic free
radiacls. Theoretical methods are used to predict the structure and other
spectroscopic properties of ground and excited states which are then used to
guide experiments designed to detect and characterize these gas phase radicals
using high resolution laser spectroscopic techniques.
