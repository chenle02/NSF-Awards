This proposal is concerned with several extensions and applications of the
theory of homotopical higher categories. Our first foundational objective is to
develop equivariant versions of the many known models for homotopical higher
categories and to establish equivalences between them. Our first proposed
application is the development of homotopical approaches to equivariant extended
topological field theories. The second application is the development of
topological cluster categories arising from surfaces; extending to higher
dimensions should allow for the development of new invariants of higher-
dimensional manifolds analogous to ones for surfaces. This second application
should also inform the first, with higher-dimensional cluster categories giving
new information about topological field theories. The third application is
concerned with connections between Hall algebras and algebraic K-theory. In one
direction, constructions of homotopical Hall algebras are expected to give rise
to K-theory spectra which should give new information about Hall algebras,
especially those related to quantum groups. In another, variations of Hall
algebra constructions have corresponding variants of algebraic K-theory which
are worthy of further investigation.

Broadly speaking, this proposal is concerned with incorporating algebraic
information into categorical and topological structures which are currently
being used in a wide range of kinds of mathematics. We then seek to apply these
enhanced structures in mathematical physics, manifold theory, and representation
theory. The educational component of this proposal consists of a series of four
summer workshops for mathematics majors who are in the process of transferring
to UC Riverside. The goal is to help twenty participants each year to make the
transition to upper-level mathematics via introduction to proof techniques, more
theoretical concepts, and a broad overview of the range of topics in higher-
level mathematics courses. Students will be provided with some follow-up
mentoring activities, including opportunities for participating in undergraduate
research.
