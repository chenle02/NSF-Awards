The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Amar Flood
of Indiana University for the synthesis and characterization of modular anion-
binding receptors, called triazolophanes. Surprisingly, these triazolophanes
incorporate only weak CH hydrogen bond donors. Therefore, the structural and
electronic parameters that enforce strong anion affinities in these receptors
will be determined by thermodynamic analyses. As a consequence of these
investigations, the strengths of the two types of CH donors will be addressed.
The effects of electronics, size and shape, flexibility, charge, axial ligation
and dimerization will be evaluated. Secondly, template-directed approaches will
be developed to effect more efficient syntheses of the triazolophanes by
conducting kinetics studies in a step-wise manner on the individual reaction
steps involved in the overall one-pot preparation. The proposed research will
answer questions about how triazolophanes bind anions, how strong the C-H
H-bonding interactions are, and about the templating effect of anions in
macrocyclization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic Dynamics
Program in the Chemistry Division, Dr. Flood is developing inquiry-based
learning modules using nanoscience and nanotechnology as a hook for non-science
majors at local high schools and at the undergraduate level in order to engage
students with science. The PI wants to introduce high school students to real
scientific inquiry in the lecture hall versus canned discourse in which
individuals can choose their particular level of involvement. He is going to use
the chemical technology and the nanoscience involved in producing the iPod to
attract students. For the younger people who are interested in playing video
games, the PI is going to involve game theory in education. To help with this
project, he is collaborating with the Indiana University College of Education to
use virtual worlds (Quest Atlantis) and gaming strategies to attract the younger
students.
