9602967 Dieringer This award will support a short-term visit by Dr. Gregg
Dieringer of Western Illinois University to Dr. Jose Garcia Franco of the
Instituto de Ecologia in Xalapa, Mexico in order to plan research and locate
suitable species for a study of different adaptive responses by plant species
present in high elevation cloud forests and lowland tropical forests. It has
been suggested that frequent episodes of moisture and fog, characteristic of
cloud forests, place severe restrictions on the foraging activity of
pollinators. Compared with other lower tropical forest types, cloud forest plant
populations may exhibit a number or characteristics that result from a lower
pollinator abundance. With this visit, the investigators intend to identify
species that occur in both montane cloud and lowland forests. These study
species will then provide a suitable base from which to engage in a comparative
study of pollination dynamics in different habitats. ***
