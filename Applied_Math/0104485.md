NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0104485 Mathematical Sciences: Wave Interactions in
Continuum Mechanics

Abstract

DMS-0104485 Young, Robin

This project is a study of nonlinear hyperbolic waves and their interactions.
Waves are ubiquitous in science, and a general understanding of their
interactions is of fundamental interest and importance. This project will
systematically develop a dual framework for understanding waves and their
interactions, via direct and asymptotic methods. Interacting pairs of waves are
described in detail, and are combined in a coherent fashion to describe the
structure of general solutions. These methods will be applied to several
important systems of continuum mechanics.

The mathematical theory of waves lies at the intersection of mathematics and
physics and has application to many engineering problems. This project develops
methods for understanding the results of wave interactions in general systems.
The results obtained in this study will be of use in experimentally measuring
material properties of elastic solids.
