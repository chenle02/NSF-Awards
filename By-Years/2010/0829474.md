Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences is awarded a grant to establish two new
marine culture collections. They plan to organize these collections with the
existing Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton
(CCMP) to utilize the collections infrastructure of the CCMP. They request funds
to purchase the equipment necessary to house, maintain these culture collections
to establish quality control policies, and for identifying the culture strains.
Bigelow Laboratory and the (CCMP) have demonstrated that they can operate a
large and highly used marine algal culture collection. Bigelow Laboratory is an
outstanding site for these collections because of its many scientists who are
dedicated to marine research on microscopic organisms, it is situated on the
Gulf of Maine, and it has 27 years of experience successfully operating the
CCMP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cultures of
marine archaea, bacteria, and viruses will be made available to researchers,
saving them time and expense to obtain the organisms from the oceans of the
world. In addition, the Bigelow Laboratory offers courses, workshops, and
internships for high school and college students, and attempts to interest the
general public in their research.
