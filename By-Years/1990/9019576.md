Dr. Herbig will continue his observational research into the nature of diffuse
interstellar bands. It includes an effort to correlate the strengths of the
diffuse bands with local properties of the interstellar medium through high-
precision observations of stars imbedded in ionized hydrogen clouds, of stars
behind clouds in which the coatings of the interstellar dust grains have to some
extent been removed, and of stars behind shocked interstellar gas. Dr. Herbig
wil also search for interstellar polyatomic carbon molecules. These studies
depend upon the special advantages of observing from the high altitude site of
Mauna Kea in Hawaii. The problem of the identification of the carrier of the
diffuse interstellar band (DIB) spectrum remains unsolved over fifty years after
it was demonstrated that these features are produced by some constituent of the
interstellar medium. With the availability of new detectors the list of diffuse
interstellar bands has grown to some 50 sure entries, to which can be added at
least 20 more weak features that have recently been found in the red and near
infrared regions of the spectrum. Still no convincing regularities in DIB
characteristics are apparent. This leads to the suspicion that a family of
carriers may be involved. Dr. Herbig's research will address this very vexing
problem in astronomy.
