*** 9704036 Downing This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
from 3D Technology Laboratories will produce the final detailed system design
and materials optimization that are necessary to construct a laser diode driven,
solid-state, three-dimensional display. A fully functional device will be
integrated, tested, evaluated, and optimized within the duration of this
proposal and, when complete, will be capable of displaying true 3D data sets
from a variety of input sources. The device will offer real time capabilities,
and it will be able to display both static and dynamic images. Objects drawn in
the display will be accessible to viewers through all sides of the display, with
no restricted or obstructed regions and with no need for special glasses or head
gear. Potential commercial applications for this technology include medical
imaging, computer-aided design and manufacturing, scientific visualization, air
traffic control, geological and oceanic exploration, molecular modeling and
computational chemistry, as well as education, entertainment, and general
consumer electronics. ***
