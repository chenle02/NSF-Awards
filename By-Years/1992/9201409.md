This proposal supports a FASEB Summer Research Conference on Calcium and Cell
Function to be held July 6-10, 1992 at the Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, VT.
This meeting is held once every two or three years, and the participants cover a
broad range of biology but share a common interest in calcium as a physiological
regulator of many cellular events and processes. %%% This FASEB conference
provides a common platform for scientists working in an unusually-wide variety
of fields to share their results and common interests in calcium. The informal
setting and small meeting size will foster scientific interactions between
individuals who, in all likelihood, would not otherwise meet. These interactions
are important in developing interdisciplinary research collaborations.
