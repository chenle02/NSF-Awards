The black swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes) exhibits a hilltopping lek mating
system. Lek behavior occurs where males cannot economically defend either
females or resources important to females. Males that are more successful in
male-male competition or possessing unique qualities attractive to females often
do most of the mating. Since females gain nothing but gametes from lek males,
leks provide an excellent opportunity to test questions relating to male
intrasexual selection and female choice. Choosy females may gain by producing
offspring that survive and mature better than those of less selective females.
Also, choosy females may produce sons that are more successful in male-male
competition or are more preferred by selective females. However, whether females
actually gain reproductively through their mate choice in lek-mating species
remains largely hypothetical. Using descriptive and experimental techniques,
Lederhouse and Scriber will investigate the importance of female intersexual
selection (mate choice) and of male-male intrasexual selection (competition) in
determining reproductive success in P. polyxenes. They will determine physical
and possible genetic correlates of aggressive territorial males with male mating
success. The nature and degree of female choice will be determined. The
maturation and survival of their offspring and the ability of sons to gain and
maintain territories and court females will be compared. The investigators will
also test if male reproductive success is correlated to specific genetic
profiles. Results of this research will improve understanding of the evolution
of leks by testing several alternative views.
