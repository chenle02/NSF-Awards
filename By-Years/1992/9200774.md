Gross will investigate the natural Dirichlet form operator over loop spaces
associated to Brownian bridge measure. The particular interest is in proving
existence and uniqueness of ground states of the associated Schroedinger
operators over homotopy classes. This is a continuation of Gross's recent work
on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on loop groups which has many implications
for the representation theory of Lie groups. The theory of Lie groups, named in
honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major
themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for
exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie
groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself and theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
