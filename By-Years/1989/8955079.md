Education Development Center, Inc., in cooperation with many of the key
individuals and organizations engaged in mathematics education reform, will (1)
design, pilot, and implement a process for identifying, collecting, reviewing,
and indexing exemplary materials and practices in mathematics education, geared
to the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics of the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and starting with those
programs supported by the National Science Foundation; and (2) create a series
of products and processes, starting with a CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only
Memory), that will provide teachers, supervisors, administrators, teacher
educators, mathematicians, policy makers, and curriculum developers with access
to actual materials, wherever possible, and to information about their
implementation and use. This project sill benefit all of the constituencies for
the reform of mathematics education. By providing information development and
classroom application of new standards. The Resources for Mathematics Reform
(RMR) CD-ROM will be easy to use; permit searches configured to meet users'
needs; provide concise, informative abstracts for each program and chapter or
lesson; permit printouts of actual teacher and student materials; span all
grades from K-12; be geared to emerging consensus about what should be learned
and taught in mathematics, as embodied in the NCTM Standards; extend its scope
beyond NSF and public-domain materials; provide information about program
implementation and use; and take advantage of an extensive dissemination and
users network. It will also constitute the first in a series of products using
different technologies to make exemplary materials and information accessible to
a wide variety of users.
