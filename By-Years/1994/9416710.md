This project seeks to explain discrepancies the PIs have found between ground-
based Fabry-Perot measurements of thermospheric winds and those predicted by
numerical models. Previous studies have compared thermospheric models with
single ground-based stations, with data from limited periods using multiple
northern hemisphere stations, and with DE-2 spacecraft data for solar maximum
only. However, the PIs seek reasons for disagreement when using data from
multiple Fabry-Perot spectrometers at southern polar latitudes. In doing so,
they will extend previous comparisons away from solar maximum using multiple
high latitude southern hemisphere sites. Results from the combined study will
present an observation-based description of the southern polar thermosphere over
a broad range of geophysical conditions.
