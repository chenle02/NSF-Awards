An experimental test will be made of theory which includes hyperfine structure
effects in low energy electron spin exchange collisions between ground state
hydrogen atoms. Measurements of hyperfine-induced frequency-shift cross sections
will be made at 0.5 Kelvin using a superfluid liquid helium surface atomic
hydrogen maser (at the University of British Columbia) and at 10 Kelvin with a
new solid neon surface hydrogen maser (at Williams College). Results will also
test the degree to which collisions between hydrogen atoms may limit the
stability of cryogenic hydrogen maser frequency standards.
