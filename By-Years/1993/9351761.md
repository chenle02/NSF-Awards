9351761 Dye Western Connecticut State University, through the acquisition of new
instrumentation for the isolation, culturing, observation and manipulation of
living cells, tissues and organs, will increase the quality of laboratory
instruction for undergraduate students in formal class work (Cell Biology;
Developmental Biology; Methods of Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture; and
Immunology) and in research which is required of all majors. Specifically,
students will have access to modern techniques in cell culture, in microscopy,
in micromanipulation of cultured material. They will be able to use state-of-
the-art technology in courses and have expanded opportunities for individual
research. Students will benefit by being better prepared for graduate school,
for professional school (medical, dental, veterinary, physician's assistant),
for teaching, and for work in clinical, commercial or industrial laboratories.
The funding we are requesting will match funds from the State of Connecticut's
High Technology Program to support efforts to improve undergraduate laboratory
facilities. ***
