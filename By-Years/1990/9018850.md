This New England Appalachians are composed of several tectonic blocks whose
relationships to one another are relatively unknown or poorly constrained.
Existing models indicate origins are diverse and spatially separate, so detrital
zircons in sedimentary assemblages may be distinctive. This project will apply a
recently developed direct 11 evaporation mass spectrometric technique for single
zircon grains to several of the tectonic blocks to characterize the age of
continental and/or volcanic-arc sources of the sediments included in each
terrane. Results will evaluate the utility of this technique in testing the
various models that have specified the relative locations of blocks through the
Paleozoic evolution of the Appalachians.
