9455425 Bergland Over 600 students (mainly non-science majors) take Introductory
Biology at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls each year. Many of these
students tend to equate success in college with the ability to memorize facts,
and need more exposure to critical thinking skills used by scientific
investigators. Research on gender issues in science education indicates that
computer simulation is a particularly effective way to interest more women in
pursuing scientific careers. We are developing highly interactive experimental
simulations based on existing upper-division laboratories in our biotechnology
curriculum (Virology, Molecular Biology, and Animal Cell Culture). These
simulations are used by Introductory Biology students to generate and test their
own hypotheses while working in small collaborative groups. Students manipulate
objects on the computer's screen much as they would in reality. For example,
they can "spin" the dial of a micro pipette or operate the control panel of a
spectrophotometer, DNA thermal cycler, or electron microscope. Digitized video
images of students using actual equipment are incorporated into the simulations
to make them more realistic. Undergraduate education majors enrolled in a
teaching methods class are involved in the evaluation of the simulations which
gives them first-hand experience in evaluating the uses of technology in the
classroom. The editorial staff of BioQUEST will provide assistance in the
dissemination of the simulations.
