HARMONIC ANALYSIS, GEOMETRIC MEASURE THEORY AND PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Abstract of Proposed Research Marius Mitrea

This project will develop the systematic use of singular integral operators
(SIO) under more general hypotheses than has been previously attained. The goal
is to display the effectiveness of SIO-based methods in circumstances
traditionally handled by other, more specialized, tools (such as variational
methods, harmonic measure techniques, etc).

It is well-recognized that there are subtle connections between the boundedness
of singular integral operators and the geometric measure-theoretic properties of
sets. A fundamental result in this direction is the boundedness of SIO with
reasonable kernels on surfaces which are Ahlfors regular (i.e., behave like n-1
dimensional at all scales), and contain ``big pieces of Lipschitz surfaces'' in
a uniform fashion (one calls such surfaces uniformly rectifiable). This earlier
work involved geometric measure theory, but has not yet been applied to problems
in Partial Differential Equations (PDE). The ultimate goal of this proposal is
to explore the role that SIO may play in the treatment of boundary value
problems under sharp geometric measure theoretic assumptions on the domain and
its boundary. In particular, this work will develop the analysis of SIO on
uniformly rectifiable surfaces for applications to problems in PDE, such as
boundary problems for the Laplace operator, other second order elliptic
operators and systems (such as the Lame, Stokes and Maxwell systems).
