This SLC Catalyst activity focuses on individual differences in learning. If
individual differences can be known -- and marked somehow in each individual --
then it may be possible to intervene to optimize learning. To fully understand
the highly individual learning process, this project aims to resolve in detail
the molecular, cellular, and systems basis of patterns of neural activity and
networks in rodent models and in humans that contribute to individual learning.
The long-range vision is to develop an integrated understanding of individual
differences in learning such that it may be possible in the future to tailor
teaching methods, or other means of intervention, to an individual based on the
function of his/her unique brain system to optimize learning. This Catalyst
project plans for a Science of Learning Center through a yearlong activity that
emphasizes not only pilot projects to explore the basic research core, but the
development of a foundation for diverse disciplines to work together. The
research activities proposed have the potential to optimize learning for all
individuals of our society. New Mexico as the first minority-majority state is a
reflection of the changes occurring throughout the nation and consequently, has
an important role as a laboratory for the exploration of the foundations of
learning in a highly diverse population. The proposed Southwest Center for the
Science of Learning will bring to bear the intellectual and diversity resources
to address the complex educational, cultural and economic changes facing the
rest of the nation. &lt;br/&gt;
