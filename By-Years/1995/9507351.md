This project will involve theoretical research on various aspects of quantum
field theory and its relationship to gravitational theory and cosmology. The
research will especially focus upon issues relating to quantum fluctuations,
either in gravitational systems or in other contexts (such as boundary effects)
which are analogous to gravity. One line of investigation will study the vacuum
fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in flat spacetime. New physical
effects which may be testable by experiment will be sought. A closely related
line of investigation will study the effects of fluctuations of the
gravitational field itself. When quantum matter fields act as the source of the
gravitational field, there will often be large fluctuations in the energy
density and pressure of the source which will translate into large fluctuations
in the gravitational field. The effects of these fluctuations will be
investigated. There are also fluctuations due to the quantum nature of the
gravitational field itself. These will be studied in the context of a model
where a background bath of gravitons causes the lightcone to be slightly smeared
out. This smearing may produce effects upon other quantum fields which will lead
to insights about the quantum nature of gravity and possibly even observable
effects. In the latter case, one would also gain important information about the
origin and evolution of the universe through the background of relic gravitons.
