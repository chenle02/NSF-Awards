This project investigates algebra that comes from objects with symmetry, such as
the highly symmetric Platonic solids studied in antiquity: the cube,
tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. Over the centuries,
people have understood that not only are these objects beautifully symmetric,
they also give rise to new algebraic objects, called rings, inheriting the same
symmetry. Understanding the symmetry of these rings has proven fruitful not only
in many areas of mathematics, but also in applications to error-correcting
codes, which allow us to send data over astronomical distances while removing
corruptions from noisy transmission. The project will also involve undergraduate
and graduate students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the rings
with symmetries studied in this proposal range from more commutative to less
commutative rings. The commutative projects include invariant theory of
polynomial rings, Stanley-Reisner rings, and Varchenko-Gelfand rings. The
proposal also studies the representations of the symmetry groups on anti-
commutative rings like exterior algebras and Orlik-Solomon algebras. Finally it
studies group representations on some very non-commutative but still highly
symmetric rings, such as Tits semigroup rings of hyperplane arrangements and
Solomon descent algebras for reflection arrangements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
