This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Metagenomic
Investigations of the Rhizosphere of Miscanthus gigantus" for Adina Chuang. The
host institution for this research is Michigan State University, and the
sponsoring scientist is James Tiedje.

Miscanthus gigantus has recently emerged as a high potential domestic, renewable
bioenergy source that could play a large role in decreasing our nation's
dependency on foreign petroleum supplies and minimizing the consequences of
continued fossil fuel emissions. It has been shown to achieve three to six times
more annual conversion of harvestable biomass as compared to switchgrass (the
DOE model energy crop)with minimal agricultural inputs. Research efforts into
Miscanthus could help to significantly decrease land requirements to meet the
energy goals of the future. Despite the high potential of Miscanthus to meet
U.S. bioenergy goals, there have been very few efforts to study and optimize its
agronomy and genetics. This research uses environmental genomic techniques to
help gain insight into the soil-plant environmental relationship of Miscanthus,
including identifying and optimizing beneficial relationships between
rhizosphere bacteria and plant productivity. Furthermore, this research helps us
better understand how to manage the natural benefits offered in the rhizosphere
of Miscanthus to help minimize input costs, especially fertilization, for its
growth on marginal lands.

Training goals include (1) using bioinformatics tools to identify and evaluate
environmental genomic information from complex environmental samples, (2) using
other computational tools to streamline analysis and comparison of complex
datasets, and (3) extending research experience into the management of an
independent project centered around applied problem-solving and the integration
of tools and expertise from multiple disciplines.
