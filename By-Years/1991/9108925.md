This research will complete a major longitudinal study of the role of patterns
of emotion expression and emotion-related behaviors in the development of
temperament/personality and competencies in childhood. The stability and
predictive efficacy of indexes of infants' emotion-related responses, including
patterns of cardiac activity, will be evaluated across the first 5-1/2 years of
life. The project will have five aspects relating to emotional development from
birth to 5 years of age. It will study (1) stability and change in expressive
behavior, (2) the construct validity of emotion variables, (3) developmental
changes in emotion responses to pleasant and mildly stressful conditions. (4)
development al changes in relations among emotion expression variables and
patterns of cardiac activity under pleasant and mildly stressful conditions, and
(5) early emotion variables as predictors of later socioemotional and affective-
cognitive competence. Results from the first two years of the research showed
that early-infancy emotion variables were significant predictors of the quality
of infant-mother attachment at 13 months (an important index of socioemotional
competence) and of infant temperament at 13, 18, and 24 months. Early emotion
variable s predicted significant aspects of the development of personality and
social behavior. This research will further our understanding emotional
development.
