This S-STEM scholarship program will provide support for first and second year
engineering students at Southern Methodist University (SMU). The goal of the
"Today's Scholars, Tomorrow's Leaders: Identifying and Developing Engineers as
Leaders(IDEAL)" program is to improve the retention of financially needy
students during the first two years of their engineering program by increasing
their engagement in curricular and extra-curricular programs. This goal is
realized through the implementation of four objectives: 1) identifying incoming
engineering students with high leadership potential; 2) developing students'
leadership skills through mentoring, tutoring, and work experience; 3) building
academic excellence; and 4) fostering community building through the engineering
residence hall. The IDEAL scholars program will support majors from various SMU
School of Engineering departments: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical
Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Environmental and Civil
Engineering, and Engineering Management, Information, and Systems. IDEAL
Students who successfully complete the first two years of an engineering program
will be supported in the third and fourth years by scholarships from the SMU
Engineering Fellows program.
