The project will introduce several significant bioanalytical separations into
the interdepartmental undergraduate biochemistry laboratory experience. At
present, students are separating biomolecules using classical methods such as
thin layer chromatography, polyacrylamide and agarose gel electrophoresis, and
ion exchange resins. These methods are useful in illustration of the separation
principles; however, the results are, at best, qualitative. A technology has
been identified, high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE), which
appears to have the versatility, quickness, and simplicity required for
integration into five of our existing experiments that focus on separation,
identification, and quantitation of amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
Faculty-supervised undergraduate research projects in biochemistry, biology, and
chemistry will also employ the HPCE system.
