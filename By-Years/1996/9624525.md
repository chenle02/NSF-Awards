The proposal deals with open issues in ATM networks and mixed ATM wireless
networks. The work will include four topics: 1) Scheduling in the ATM
environment. Work will focus on generalizing their real-time scheduling
algorithm, which minimizes the weighted loss at an ATM node, to a network and to
non-real time traffic. 2) Traffic modeling and performance analysis for
bandwidth allocation in ATM networks. Work will extend their analytical
techniques to capture the queueing behavior over an ATM network for fairly
general doubly stochastic arrival processes and address issues of self-
similarity, transient analysis, and dynamic bandwidth allocation. 3) Video
transmission over ATM networks. The PI will capture cell-jitter in order to size
the receiver buffer appropriately and determine the startup delay. Further work
will include error-concealment for transmitting video traffic in a lossy ATM
medium and ways in which flow control can be implemented on non-real time
traffic to improve the overall utilization in the network. 4) Integration of
wireless and ATM environments. Work will focus on ways in which dynamic
bandwidth control can be accomplished, and flow control and admission control in
the mixed wireless environment can be addressed.
