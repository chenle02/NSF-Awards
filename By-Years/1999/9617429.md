The proposal is a request for support of a workshop "Paleoenvironments of
Beringia". The workshop will provide a forum for multidisciplinary discussion of
the current state of knowledge of Beringian environments of the Quaternary. The
purposes of this workshop are to examine and synthesize diverse research fields
concerning Beringia with the aim of preparing a new volume on Beringian
paleoenvironments, and to establish an agenda for future Beringian research. The
workshop will include invited papers from key scientists from the US, Canada,
and Russia, as well as submitted papers from other researchers and students. The
symposium will bring together a large number of scientists studying a problem
that is very important to the future development of several ongoing research
programs supported by NSF, including Paleoenvironments of Arctic Lakes and
Estuaries and the Greenland Ice Shelf Project.
