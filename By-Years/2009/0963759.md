Parallel programming is notoriously difficult, but essential to the future of
computing. Much of the difficulty stems from the need to guarantee, in advance,
that parallel computations will not conflict with one
another.&lt;br/&gt;Speculation provides an attractive alternative. By monitoring
behavior at run time, and retrying computations that conflict, speculation can
expose significant amounts of otherwise unexploitable parallelism, while
imposing little or no conceptual burden on the
programmer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sponsored research aims to make thread- and
process-level speculation a fundamental feature of future programming systems,
and to employ it in multiple forms and for multiple purposes: to automatically
or semi-automatically parallelize sequential applications; to check,
dynamically, the independence of explicitly parallel computations; to isolate
the execution of semantically atomic functions; to enable optimizations that are
not always safe; to parallelize scripting languages with one-thread-at-a-time
semantics; and to profile applications in parallel, for feedback-driven
optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project adopts a tiered approach that
isolates the users of simpler programming idioms from the need to understand
more complex alternatives.&lt;br/&gt;At the implementation level, it stresses
the seamless integration of shared memory and cluster-level distribution,
compiler- and binary translator-based software instrumentation, virtual memory,
and hardware speculation/transactions where available. Latter phases of the
project place major emphasis on profiling tools to identify potentially
independent program regions, which can then safely be executed in parallel (via
speculation) in future runs.
