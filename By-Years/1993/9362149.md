9362149 Rogers The goal of this project is to develop an improved model which
will relate the biological activity of a compound to its physicochemical
properties. This area of research is known as Quantitative Structure-Activity
Relationship (QSAR) analysis. The QSAR is a tool which can be used by chemists
in drug design to help reduce the current high level of testing in drug
development. The approach to model development in this proposed research is
based on the Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) algorithm. The GFA would
replace the standard regression analysis normally used in the QSAR task. The
objective is to construct higher- quality predictive models, even with data sets
that may have thousands of parameters. ***
