With communication link speed exceeding terabit per second, packet processing at
the routing processors is becoming the main bottleneck in network services. The
workload for these processors is very different compared to the general-purpose
processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-year project develops necessary
benchmark and simulation environment to analyze the impact of new architectural
ideas, such as instruction-level parallelism, branch prediction, speculative
execution, lock-up free caches and multiprocessing, on the performance of
Internet router architectures. First, it creates suitable workload by developing
a set of communication benchmark programs that normally execute on high-
performance routers. These programs are executed on commercially available
processors and their performance is compared with other standard benchmark
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main contribution of the project lies in
development of an execution-driven simulator for the router, where these
communication programs are compiled and executed. The simulator incorporates the
network processor, line cards, and the backbone crossbar switch. The input data
to the simulator is obtained from real Internet traces, such as NLANR and UCB.
By incorporating new ideas in instruction-set design, memory subsystem, packet
scheduling, and multiprocessing into the simulator, architectures for the next-
generation Internet routers are developed and tested in this project.&lt;br/&gt;
