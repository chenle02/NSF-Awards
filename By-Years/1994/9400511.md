9400511 Nation This research is concerned with the study of the equational
theory of finite lattices and the structure of free lattices. These problems are
related because questions about lattice varieties can often be interpreted as
problems in free lattices. The first objective of this work is to determine
which finitely generated equational classes of lattices have a term rewrite
system. The second objective is to find an algorithm for determining all lattice
varieties which cover a given finitely generated lattice variety. The principal
investigator will also study which ordered sets can be embedded in free
lattices, and which lattices are sublattices of free lattices. Lattices are
discrete mathematical objects with a structure reflecting to some extent the
structure of set theory or logic. This very weak structure means that lattices
can be found in many mathematical environments. It also means that problems are
easy to state, hard to solve and of a very general nature. The results of this
work will impact many areas of mathematics, computer science, the social
sciences and business management.
