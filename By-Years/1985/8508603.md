This tribology research investigates the physical, chemical, and microstructural
changes which occur during sliding of unlubricated steel surfaces under contact
pressures high enough to cause adhesion. Specimens will be pressed against each
other and then rotated to simulate the environment that a bolted joint
experiences. The experiment is intended to provide insight into the failure
mechanisms associated with bolted joints.
