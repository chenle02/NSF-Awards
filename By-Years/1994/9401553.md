9401553 Stevens This award funds the research of Prof. Glenn Stevens into
connections between Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry. In particular Prof.
Stevens will study the arithmetic properties of modular symbols. He also hopes
to make progress in the understanding of the exceptional zero conjecture of
Mazur, Tate and Teitelbaum from higher rank and from higher weight. This is
research in the field of number theory. Number theory is basically the study of
whole numbers. The research done under this award studies properties of the
whole numbers by encoding them into functions called modular forms. Number
theory is among the oldest fields of mathematics, yet it has always played an
important role in choosing directions for the rest of the subject. Within the
last half century, the study of whole numbers has become doubly important as the
theory has been used to develop new algorithms for computer science and to
construct new error correcting codes for electronics.
