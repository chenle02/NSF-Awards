This research investigates several aspects of wireless office information
networks with particular emphasis in manufacturing environments and surrounding
offices. The focus is on developing a reliable and accurate statistical model
and computer simulation for indoor radio channels, innovative methods to
increase the data rates of both wideband spread spectrum and narrowband
transmission techniques, and various multiple accessing and network
architectures suitable for fading multi-path indoor channels. The principle
investigator (PI) will perform wide band channel measurements in several
manufacturing plants and offices to be used to develop the model and simulation.
He will analyze the throughput and delay characteristic of ALOHA-like and other
multiple accessing techniques in fading indoor environments and compare
distributed and central networks for this application. He will also analyze
performance, data rate limitations and improvements in data rate for spread
spectrum techniques.
