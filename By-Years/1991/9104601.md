MOLECULAR BASIS OF CYANIDE ASSIMILATION IN PSEUDOMONAS BACTERIA The fundamental
goal of the proposed research is to establish the metabolic mechanism of cyanide
transformation in two different Pseudomonas bacteria. Although it has been
recognized for some time that microorganisms are capable of assimilating cyanide
as a source of nutrition, very little is actually known about the molecular
basis of this ability. Work in our laboratory has shown that bacteria capable of
utilizing cyanide as a sole nitrogen source occur readily in nature, but the
mechanism of assimilation is unknown. Other investigations have indicated that
assimilation is oxygenase-mediated, but this has yet to be confirmed. The
present work is aimed at further defining the metabolic basis of this ability by
(i) chemically identifying conversion products, (ii) identifying the kinds of
enzymatic activities responsible for conversion, and (iii) identifying the
combination of chemical (e.g., radiolabelling, 13C-NMR), biochemical (e.g.,
biotransformation assays, inhibitor studies, SDS-PAGE) and genetic approaches
(mutant analysis). New information on the fundamental microbial basis of cyanide
metabolism is expected, which given the importance of cyanide as both an
environmental toxicant and participant in prebiotic evolution, is of significant
scientific merit.//
