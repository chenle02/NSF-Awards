This research is concerned with the development of numerical methods for
multiple scales problems. It is proposed to apply the "booster" or "generalized
error modification" (GEM) method which combines an asymptotic apporach with
numerical discretization methods on 1) laminar flows at high Reynolds numbers,
2) time dependent flows with disparate time scales, 3) low-Prandtl number
thermal convection, and 4) turbulent transport modeling. The marriage of local
asymptotics with the overall GEM framework, and exploitation of parallel
computing will improve the efficiency of solution of the aforementioned problems
by at least an order of magnitude.
