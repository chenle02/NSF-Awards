Investigations of the mechanical properties of transform plate boundaries have
dominantly focused on the crustal (seismogenic) component of the plate. Although
the lithospheric mantle's role in plate boundary deformation has received much
less attention, it represents the potentially strongest part of a plate
boundary, and thus the region which will control the overall deformation.
Previous studies have also suffered from the application of rheologic laws which
may not be appropriate for the high strain rates and deformation at plate
boundaries. The evolutionary nature of boundaries like the San Andreas has also
normally not been included. This project will apply current best estimates of
mantle rheologic laws to the development of transform plate boundaries and
evaluate the 3-D stress, strain, and mineralogic (grain size, deformation
mechanism) evolution of the region.
