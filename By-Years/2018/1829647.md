The Research at High Pressure Gordon Conference (HP-GRC) is one of the oldest
topical conferences held since the emergence of the field of high pressure and
has been held uninterrupted for over 60 years. The HP-GRC is a multidisciplinary
conference in the field of high pressure research, and this year?s HPGRC program
consists of presentations on breakthrough and unpublished results obtained using
high-pressure methods and new innovations for studying matter under extreme
conditions. This conference brings together experts from the dynamic and static
pressure communities across the world to present and discuss their new and
unpublished results. Accompanied by an associated High Pressure Gordon Research
Seminar (HP-GRS) this conference attracts many young researchers as well as
pioneers of the&lt;br/&gt;field. The collegial atmosphere of this conference
accommodates many fruitful discussions, motivates new directions in the field of
high pressure and promotes mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
