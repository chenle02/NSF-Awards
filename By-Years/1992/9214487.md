Although powerful tools for numerical, statistical, and algebraic computation
are readily available and widely used, a comparable tool for combinatorial
computing has not yet emerged. The lack of such a tool seriously impedes
interaction between theory and practice in discrete mathematics. Building on
shared experiences, a comprehensive software system for combinatorial computing
that is efficient, portable, and extensible will be created. The core of the
system will be an object-oriented library containing reusable implementations of
state-of-the-art combinatorial algorithms and data structures. To facilitate
experimentation, the workbench will have a powerful graphical user interface and
a versatile command-interpreter based on a functional programming language. The
tool is to be built and distributed as a self documenting or `Literate` program.
This new software environment facilitates research in theoretical, experimental,
and applied discrete mathematics.
