ABSTRACT BLACK, John AST-9421311 This award supports the use of the US Air
Force 1.5m SOR telescope to undertake a range of observational programs in very
high resolution stellar spectroscopy in the 0.5-1 micron spectral range. A
Littrow echelle spectrograph will be assembled on the user optical bench,
tailored for operation with diffraction limited star images. It consists simply
of two units, the image relay, entrance aperture and CCD detector together at
one end, and a lens, prism and grating unit at the other. The cross dispersed
spectrum format will be optimized by using grating with a large groove spacing,
so advantage can be taken of the diffraction limited images to record 90 orders
at once. The CCD will have a large format (2048 X 4096 pixels), so that full
spectral cover will be possible with only a few exposures. With this instrument,
the SOR telescope will be able to record the very high resolution diffraction
limited spectra of fifth magnitude stars, with a combination of resolution (/d =
500,000), signal/noise ratio (100) and full cover never previously obtained. * *
