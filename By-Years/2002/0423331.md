In addition to its primary function as a reproductive hormone, the ovarian
hormone estrogen affects performance on various measures of learning and memory
in mammals. Although the mechanisms underlying these effects are as yet unclear,
estrogen affects the structure and function of the hippocampus, an area of the
brain involved in learning and memory. The primary goal of the current project
is to understand the mechanisms by which estrogen exerts its effects in the
hippocampus and on associated behaviors. Experiments in this project will
investigate the role of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter whose activity is
modulated by estrogen, in the ability of estrogen to effect change in the rat
hippocampus. Results of these experiments will determine the role of a subtype
of acetylcholine receptor, the M2 muscarinic receptor, in the ability of
estrogen to affect the hippocampus and to affect performance on tasks of
learning and memory. Experiments will also investigate the effects of different
regimens of estrogen replacement, previously shown to differentially affect the
activity of acetylcholine, on the hippocampus and on tasks of learning and
memory. The results of the experiments in this project should contribute to the
understanding of how estrogen acts in the brain to affect cognitive functioning.
In addition, the activities in this project will provide increased research
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of New
Orleans. The University of New Orleans is an urban campus with a high percentage
of minority and female student enrollment and with a student body that consists
primarily of residents from the state of Louisiana, a geographical region that
has traditionally been underrepresented in the sciences. Thus, the participation
of students at the University of New Orleans in the proposed experiments will
broaden participation of underrepresented groups in scientific endeavors.
