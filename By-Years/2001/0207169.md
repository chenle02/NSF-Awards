Fein&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207169&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed research
program, we will use x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of natural and
laboratory-generated samples to determine the importance of metal-bacteria
adsorption in affecting the distribution of metal in bacteria-water-rock
systems. The overall objective of the research is to test whether surface
complexation modeling can account for the observed metal distributions under a
range of conditions and complexities. Quantifying the effects of bacteria on
adsorption reactions in water-rock systems has direct applications not only to
contaminant transport modeling, but also to bioremediation engineering and to
the understanding of bacterial pathogen mobility. The proposed research will
ultimately lead to more accurate predictions of the mobility of aqueous metals
in contaminated groundwater systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
will deliver three things: 1) an understanding, provided by both XAS and bulk
adsorption measurements, of whether bacterial surface adsorption of aqueous
metal cations plays an important role in metal speciation in bacteria-bearing
water-rock systems; 2) a rigorous testing of whether surface complexation
modeling can account for the metal distribution in those systems; and 3) a test
of whether natural populations of bacteria exhibit identical metal adsorption
properties, as was suggested by the data of Yee and Fein (2001a,b). The
experimental results from this research not only will further our understanding
of metal-bacteria interactions, but they will also significantly improve our
ability to accurately model the effects of bacterial adsorption on the fate and
mobility of heavy metals in realistic geologic systems.&lt;br/&gt;
