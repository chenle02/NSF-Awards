Borisov's project aims to further the understanding of derived categories of
algebraic varieties, which are used to describe boundary conditions that govern
the propagation of open strings. He will verify the expected derived equivalence
of double mirror Calabi-Yau complete intersections in toric varieties. He will
work to construct flat families of triangulated categories that interpolate
between derived categories of different crepant resolutions of a toric
singularity. Borisov will also attempt to settle the conjecture that states that
birational algebraic varieties with the same canonical divisor are derived
equivalent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory is the leading physical candidate
for the unified theory of the known physical forces. Despite steady progress in
recent years, mathematical aspects of string theory are not yet adequately
understood. This dearth of understanding is an obstacle to further development
of string theory which is needed to connect it with the real world phenomena.
Borisov will contribute to an active branch of mathematics research which is
related to and is inspired by string theory, and will train a graduate student
in this area of study.
