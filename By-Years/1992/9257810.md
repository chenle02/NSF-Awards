This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, studies Riemannian geometry, with emphasis on understanding how bounds on
geometric quantities affect the local and global topological structure of metric
spaces and Riemannian manifolds and understanding how geometric quantities
relate to each other. The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award
recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award recognizes the recipient's
strong potential for continued professional growth as a research mathematician
and for significant development as a teacher and academic leader.
