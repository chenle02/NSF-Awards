Heating and modification of the ionosphere by powerful HF heaters have been
recognized to be a powerful means to study the nonlinear plasma physics and to
understand the internal dynamics of the ionosphere. The proposed program is
aimed at developing theories for better understanding of the experimental
observations with particular reference to: (a) height difference between HFPLs
and natural lines and the correlation between HFPLs and field-aligned
irregularities; (b) frequency upshifted HFPLs and their organization altitude;
(c) plasma lines overshoot and expansion of originating altitude interval of
HFPLs; and (d) generation of electron Bernstein modes as the source waves of
secondary simulated EM emission. New experiments will be initiated whenever they
are feasible. The approach will be based on our earlier and recent works that
include the study of thermal flamentation instability of field-aligned Langmuir
wave, evolution of HFPLs and the study of various parametric instability
processes. We also propose to study the effects of the ionospheric plasma
inhomogeneity on the results of HF heating experiments. ***
