Professor R. Graham Cooks of Purdue University is supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program to use the soft ionization capabilities of
electrosonic spray ionization to generate molecular clusters probed by mass
spectrometry. Reactions of these clusters will be carried out at atmospheric
pressure prior to introduction of the products into a mass analyzer. Clusters
and products are 'soft landed' onto surfaces (liquids and solids) after mass
selection and detected using infrared laser desorption. The work focuses on the
homochiral clusters of the amino acid serine discovered in the PI's laboratory,
and on issues of chiral amplification and transfer of chirality to other species
through enantioselective chemical reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noncovalent
bonding is an important topic in understanding interactions between biologically
active molecules, as well as in many other areas including colloid chemistry and
sensors. Thus, in addition to providing excellent student education, the PI
continues to develop mass spectrometry ultimately for biology and security
applications, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
