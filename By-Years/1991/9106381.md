This project will carry out work related to relativistic theories of nuclear
physics. The role of vacuum polarization in nuclear ground state correlations
will be studied. A new approach to renormalization will be investigated. It is
also proposed to study nucleon-nucleon interactions within a deformed chiral
soliton model.
