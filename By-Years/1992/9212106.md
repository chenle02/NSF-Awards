New methodologies have opened up the possibility of discovering how young
infants perceive the world around them, and even how they think about it. This
research will examine the relations between infants' representations of objects
and substances and early language learning. The studies will establish the ways
in which language learning requires children to conceputalize the world in new
terms and the ways in which language learning simply requires children to learn
how their language expresses the concepts they already possess. One series of
studies will explore how babies establish representations of distinct objects in
their environment, and how they track identity of these objects over time.
Previous research has discovered a change in the criteria for object
individuation and object identity beginning around eleven months of age that is
related to learning to comprehend object labels. Other series of studies will
explore the processes underlying word learning by 2- to 4-year-old children,
documenting continuing changes in lexical representations throughout the
preschool years. These studies will shed light on fundamental questions
concerning the relations between language and thought. Furthermore, they will
contribute to a deeper understanding of normal language and cognitive
development, in terms of which abnormal development can be better understood.
