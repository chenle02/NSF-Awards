This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will
use the LPG (Long Period Grating) technology to interrogate the interactions
between drugs and G-Protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). To effectively study
these interactions, one has to stabilize the GPCRs by immobilizing them to lipid
layers. This Phase II project will focus on optimizing the lipid selection,
composition, and attachment to the GPRCs and to the surface of the sensor. The
development of stabilized lipid based GPCR coating for the LPG biosensor will
provide a valuable tool in the area of drug discovery.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of new high
throughput proteomics instrumentation to aid in the development of new
therapeutic products.
