9316255 Patchett This project will continue Hf and other isotopic research into
problems of crustal and mantle chemical evolution, with two main thrusts: (1) to
complete study of granitoids melted from different crustal sources, and (2) to
undertake a new effort to definitively determine the depleted mantle source of
new crust over geologic time. Terranes have been selected from Greenland,
Australia, Africa, Canada, USA and Saudi Arabia as representing known or
potential juvenile additions to the continents over 3.8-0.7 Ga. Other terranes
and collaborations may become necessary to fully determine the depleted source
evolution. This data should constitute a firm basis for modeling by the PIs and
others of crust- mantle evolution 4.0 Ga to present.
