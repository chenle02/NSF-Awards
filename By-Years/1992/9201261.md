The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of research vessels,
operated by academic institutions, provides support services to those NSF
sponsored researchers who require time at sea to complete their investigations.
All of these ships use oceanographic cable as part of this research support.
Arrangements have been made which allow bulk purchases of cable resulting in
considerable cost savings. Sixteen reels of cable will be purchased. The cable
is stored until needed by ship operators at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution (WHOI) on the east coast and at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography on the west coast. Mr. Donald A. Moller, Marine Operations
Coordinator, WHOI, will manage this project.
