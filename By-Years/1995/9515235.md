95-15235 Research on homicide proliferated during the 1980's and 90's but social
scientists still lack a fundamental understanding of the socioeconomic factors
that shape Latino homicide. This Research Planning Grant proposal addresses this
shortcoming through the collection of data that will enable the investigator to
examine the relationship between poverty and economic inequality and Latino
homicide in Miami, Florida between 1989-1993. Data (i.e., date, time, location
of homicide event and age, gender, race/ethnicity of offender and victim) from
the Miami Police Department homicide files will be supplemented by US Census
income, poverty, educational and population data. This study will test a series
of hypotheses related to economic correlates of homicide using localized
measures (by census tracts) to predict variations in homicide rates. Using
census tracts as the level of the analysis is far more sophisticated than most
similar work that relies on measures that aggregate data at the city or state
level. This data set will be unique in criminology and will provide the basis
for future comparative efforts with Latino subpopulations in other geographic
areas.
