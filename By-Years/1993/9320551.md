9320551 Trippe The Berkeley Particle Data Center is the headquarters of the
International Particle Data Group, whose primary task is to provide high energy
physics researchers with up-to-date compiled and evaluated particle-properties
data and other information they most frequently need. This information is made
available to about 20,000 researchers, teachers, and students through the
biennial publication of the "Review of Particle Properties" and the "Particle
Properties Data Booklet." The Center and its collaborators also produces other
compilations of value, "Current Experiments in Elementary Particle Physics," and
"Guide to Experimental Elementary Particle Physics Literature." The Center
provides computer network access to its databases via the SLAC- SPIRES system
and other more modern public interfaces to its databases. The Center is also
involved in the Contemporary Physics Education Project, which has developed
educational materials such as a wall chart, teacher activity packet, and
computer software on "Fundamental Particles and Interactions," and it has been
involved in other activities such as the ICFA Review of Detector Properties and
a pilot project, the AIP Physics Data Diskette. The Center's scientific staff
are also active in current theoretical and experimental high energy physics
research and in teaching at the University of California at Berkeley. ***
