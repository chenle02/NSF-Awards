9729679 Saadatmanesh This project will conduct a preliminary analytical and
experimental study to investigate the feasibility of strengthening buildings by
plastic materials. The analytical study will focus on the optimization of the
relative ratio of the carbon and glass fibers for the best absorption and
dissipation of the energy due to a blast loading. The theory will be developed
in general format that could be applicable for the design of this strengthening
system for a typical building. The experimental part of the study will focus on
the evaluation of this concept under simulated blast loading delivered by means
of a high impact load. Concrete as well as brick speciments will be constructed
and retrofitted with the hybrid composite sheet and then tested under impact
loading. Control, unretrofitted specimens will also be tested. The test results
will verify the effectiveness of this strengthening system. ***
