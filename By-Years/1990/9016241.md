The National Science Foundation and the State of Florida are providing funds to
a consortium, consisting of Florida State University, The University of Florida,
and Los Alamos National Laboratory, to establish a new National High Magnetic
Field Laboratory. The Florida/Los Alamos National Magnet Laboratory (FLNML) will
be located at Florida State University, Tallahassee and at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. FLNML will be a major user facility open to all qualified scientists
and engineers. FLNML will develop a number of advanced high field magnets
including a hybrid DC magnet with a design field capability of at least 45T, a
bore with a diameter of at last 32mm, and a 20MW low-ripple power supply, state-
of-the-art superconducting magnets for NMR in fields greater than 25T, intense
pulsed field facilities capable of producing fields in excess of 75T for time
durations of msecs, and pulsed fields of 200T for microsec durations, and a
variety of water-cooled magnets capable of the production of fields up to 25T.
In addition, FLNML will have available a comprehensive range of instrumentation
to carry out experiments requiring these fields. These magnets will be housed in
the Tallahassee facility, except for the pulsed field magnets which will be
located at Los Alamos. The laboratory will also have a diverse in-house research
and educational program involving faculty, post doctorals, and students from
several disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials science,
engineering, and biology. Examples of research to be carried out at the
laboratory include high magnetic field studies of high temperature
superconductors and high resolution NMR studies of the structure of complex
biological molecules.
