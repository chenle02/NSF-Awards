This award provides funding for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Site program at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO)
located in Palisades, NY. This program has a Global Databases theme that focuses
the intern experience on unsolved scientific problems in the ocean and earth
sciences within the sub-disciplines of Geology, Petrology, Physical
Oceanography, Marine Biology, Geochemistry, and Geophysics. Support includes
stipends, housing, and travel to attend the program for a total of 14 students
each summer for two years. Students will be recuited nationally. LDEO has over
120 PhD-level geoscientists (~80 in ocean and/or earth science). Each student
will be mentored by one of these scientists who will serve as research advisor.
The 10-week program takes the students from initially posing a scientific
question, to collecting data or producing models to answer that question, to
asking new questions of their own. It includes a lecture series on leading
scientific research and workshops in professional ethics, scientific writing,
and career opportunities. Students will present their research results at a
final student symposium and will be encouraged to publish or present their
research at professional conferences following the program.
