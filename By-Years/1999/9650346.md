The objective of the project is to enhance understanding of geographic
phenomena through scientific visualization and geographic information systems
(GIS) technology. These tools enable students to effectively see the spatial and
temporal characteristics of geographic data. Exercises can be conducted within
four areas of emphasis: computer cartography and GIS, urban and regional
planning, statistical analysis, and earth science. Lab exercises emphasize
scientific computing, reasoning, and critical thinking. Fifteen undergraduate
courses enrolling approximately 2,045 students are affected by the project each
academic year. Participants consist of geography majors and nonmajors, including
elementary and secondary education majors. In the summer, the facility is being
used for short courses designed for K-12 teachers in the Dallas-Fort Worth
metroplex. Previously, the department has had a facility for upper-level (junior
and senior) courses that has been equipped with 10 personal computers (PC's) and
a SPARC20 workstation/fileserver. The laboratory enhancement includes 5 PCs and
hardware upgrades to the workstation to accommodate the needs of the upper-level
classes, 10 PCs for the lower-level (freshman and sophomore) introductory
laboratory science courses, and SPYGLASS data visualization software for
analyzing the three-dimensional and temporal characteristics of geographic data.
Site licenses have been acquired for ARC/INFO, ER-MAPPER, and ATLAS*GIS, all of
which contribute software support to the project. Vehicles for project
dissemination include providing access to exercises and supporting data over the
Internet.
