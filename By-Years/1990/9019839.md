This grant is for research in basic magnetospheric plasma physics and the
nature of the aurora. In particular, the role of magnetic pulsations for the
injection and removal of outer zone trapped Van Allen belt electrons will be
studied. Observations of the pulsation phase of low-latitude auroral events
during the maximum of solar cycle 22 using high sensitivity photometers and
correlated data at Minneapolis will be continued and expanded by adding low-
light-level TV images to the data set to produce permanent images of the
pulsating forms. These pulsations begin at auroral breakup and often continue
for many hours into the morning. This interaction is thought to be due to the
interaction of Van Allen outer zone electron with cold plasma producting
instabilities and precipitation.
