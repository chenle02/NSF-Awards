9512183 Kastner This proposal request equipment to upgrade two existing MIT
facilities: (1) the Microsystems Technology Laboratory (MTL) devoted to
ultraclean semiconductor processing and (2) the Microfabrication Shared
Experimental Facility (MSEF) for fabricating general-purpose microstructures.
The request for the MSEF facility consists of an e-beam evaporator, a thermal
evaporator, a device characterization station and sputtering system, while the
MTL request is for a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) for silicon wafers and
an ECR RIE plasma CVD system. ***
