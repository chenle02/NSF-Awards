The university's Department of Chemistry has recently converted the organic
laboratory to the microscale, purchased an FT-NMR, added a laboratory-based
polymer chemistry course to the curriculum, and purchased some analytical
instrumentation. Through the project, the university is obtaining a
supercritical fluid extraction unit and a capillary electrophoresis system. The
instrumentation serves alongside existing gas and liquid chromatography
equipment as the instructional basis for a newly offered separations course. In
addition, this equipment enables several students in other courses to gain a
working knowledge of a wide range of chromatographic techniques.
