Dr. Phanord will extend to elasticity the work done by Richard Solakiewicz under
the guidance of Professor Victor Twersky on acoustic scattering by an obstacle
in a half-space bounded by a penetrable interface. With the elastic extension of
the solution for the single object in isolation, Dr. Phanord will construct the
multiple scattering solution for a distribution of identical spheres. He will
use the self-consistent procedure to obtain integral equations for the multiple
scattering amplitudes of the composite media in terms of the scattering
amplitudes of the single obstacle. From the ensemble average of the integral
equations and the equivalent medium approach, he will derive a pair of
dispersion relations which provide a means to obtain the bulk propagation
parameters of the composite media from those of the isolated single scatterer.
To compute multiple scattering cross-sections, Dr. Phanord will establish new
reciprocity relations corresponding to multiple elastic scattering for different
combinations of the incident waves.
