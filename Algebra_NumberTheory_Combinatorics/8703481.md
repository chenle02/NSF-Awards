New machinery has recently been introduced into the study of PI algebras which
show that the study of Z/2Z-graded algebras yields information about the
identities of PI algebras. This project is concerned with investigating these
algebras, especially their graded identities. This research is in the general
area of noncommutative ring theory. In particular, it is concerned with a
particular class of rings which satisfy a polynomial equation. This area, with
the discovery of combinatorial theorems that provide insight into the structure
theory of the algebra, has become an exciting topic of current research in ring
theory with implications for representation theory and the symmetric group.
