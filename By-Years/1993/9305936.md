A collection of problems in stochastic adaptive control will be investigated in
this project. Stochastic adaptive control is the optimal ergodic control of an
unknown system and includes identification and control. For finite dimensional,
continuous time, unknown linear stochastic systems the research will improve
existing results for completely observed systems and result in a better
conceptual understanding of partially observed systems. For unknown stochastic
linear distributed parameter systems the initial work on adaptive control of
systems described by analytic semigroups with boundary or point control will be
expanded to stochastic hyperbolic systems. For unknown, finite dimensional
nonlinear stochastic systems the results for almost self- optimality and self-
optimality will be improved. The adaptive control of unknown stochastic
distributed parameter systems will be initiated for families of semilinear
equations with cylindrical noise. Most physical systems require the intervention
of control mechanisms for their optimal performance. Typically the system is not
completely known and often contains random and unknown perturbations. The
control of an unknown system subject to unknown random perturbations is called
stochastic adaptive control. Most controlled systems require stochastic adaptive
control in order to meet system performance criteria. This project will
investigate problems in stochastic adaptive control that are motivated by
potential applications to physical systems. It is anticipated that significant
improvements in the conceptual understanding of adaptive stochastic control
processes and their applications will be obtained .
