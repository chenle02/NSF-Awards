Scientists love a mystery, because solving a mystery in nature means the
opportunity to learn something new about the universe. High-energy cosmic rays
are just such a mystery. Something out there -- no one knows what -- is hurling
incredibly energetic particles around the universe. Do these particles come from
some unknown superpowerful cosmic explosion? From a huge black hole sucking
stars to their violent deaths? From colliding galaxies? From the collapse of
massive invisible relics from the origin of the universe? We don't yet know the
answers, but we do know that solving this mystery will take scientists another
step forward in understanding the universe. This group from Northeastern
University wants to be a part of the team that solves this mystery.
