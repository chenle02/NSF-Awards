9628134 Egami The local atomic structure of some technologically important new
materials, mostly crystalline oxides, will be determined by non-crystallographic
diffraction techniques including the atomic pair-distribution analysis. The
materials studied include superconducting cuprates, manganates with colossal
magnetoresistance, CeO2/ZrO2 mixture for automotive catalyst support, and
metallic glasses. Many of these materials have a periodic crystalline structure
in average, but show significant local structural deviations from perfect
periodicity that can be critically important in determining their properties.
Experiments will be carried out using pulsed neutrons and synchrotron x-rays
available at national facilities. Results will be analyzed by computer modeling
methods developed in our group. To facilitate understanding of the results,
theoretical studies will be carried out in collaboration with other theory
groups. %%% The properties of a material ultimately depend on the atomic
structure. Recent research has shown that the local atomic structure, that is,
the structure within a few atomic diameters of an atom, may not be the average
structure of the material. In many cases, such local variations do not have
significant consequences, but in many cases the properties of a material are
critically dependent on the local structure rather than the average structure.
The purpose of this project is to determine the local atomic structure of these
materials using non-crystallographic scattering techniques. Three materials
systems will be examined, all of which are of technological importance. ***
