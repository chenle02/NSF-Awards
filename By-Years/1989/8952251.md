This project enhances the quality of undergraduate teaching in Remote Sensing
and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by increasing the number of computer
workstations. There were several deficiencies in teaching these courses with a
single workstation connected to various expensive peripherals. The department
could not use the university's IBM or VAX mainframes because of the specialized
configuration and display needs associated with image processing and geographic
information systems. The major equipment acquired in this project is connected
to the existing computer and peripherals, through a Local Area Network, (LAN).
The LAN accomodates more students and permits more complicated image processing
and GIS analyses procedures than waiting in line to access the one and only
workstation. This project is significant since it provides an opportunity for
students from various fields to learn state-of-the-art applied technologies. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
