How do we learn to protect ourselves from approaching danger? One of the oldest
paradigms for studying this kind of learning is classical Pavlovian
conditioning. In classical conditioning, the repeated presentation of two
stimuli together, one that the organism normally would avoid (the unconditioned
stimulus), and one that it does not (the neutral stimulus), leads eventually to
the organism trying to avoid the neutral stimulus. The previously neutral
stimulus has acquired a value -- it has become conditioned. Pavlov thought that
the new associations necessary for conditioning occur in the cerebral cortex,
that part of the brain devoted to thinking and perception. Dr. Thompson and his
students have shown, surprisingly, that circuits in the cerebellum, not the
cerebral cortex, are necessary for conditioning to take place. In this renewal
of his NSF grant, he will use newly developed reversible inactivation methods to
demonstrate that the new associations are actually formed in the cerebellum. He
will then use a variety of sophisticated neurobiological techniques to determine
the mechanisms by which these new memories are stored. The investigators have a
good chance of being the first to delineate a complete information storing
circuit in the mammalian brain. Their work will further our understanding of
human learning and memory and will be also useful to designers of artificial
neural nets and teaching machines.***//
