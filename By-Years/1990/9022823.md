The purpose of this research is to extend the investigators recent work on
irreversible investment decisions in a number of interesting and important
directions. One of the directions is the impact of the uncertainty of future
environmental regulation on business investment. A related topic that will also
be investigated is the problem of environmental irreversibilities and their
implications for the design of policies to deal with global warming, ozone
depletion, and related long-term problems. Another topic is aimed at deriving
investment rules for projects in which the ultimate cost of completion is
unknown, but is resolved as construction proceeds as in the case of electric
power plants. Another study will focus on the measurement of economic
depreciation and obsolescence, and the decision to replace old capital with new.
At issue is how stochastic wear and tear, and uncertainty over the future
productivity of capital can affect the replacement decision, and how they should
be accounted for when calculating depreciation. The final project involves the
study of investment in R&amp;D and the adoption of new technologies. In
particular, the trade-offs between adopting a current technology, waiting for
new technology to arrive, or conducting R&amp;D that can lead to a new
technology will be examined.
