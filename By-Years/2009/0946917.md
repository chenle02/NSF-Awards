The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) at the
University of California Santa Barbara will install a new compact storage system
to house its historically significant and biologically important algae and plant
collections. The collections include some of the oldest algal material from the
central California coast and a rich diversity of plants from threatened and
unique habitats. The specimens will be transferred from the existing 60-year-old
cases into the new storage system, which will provide enhanced accessibility and
organization. During the transfer, each specimen will be examined for damage,
new labels will be prepared, and misidentified specimens will be
corrected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new compact storage system and curation will
have important impacts on research, teaching and outreach programs at the
university and in the broader community. Scientists worldwide and the large
environmental consulting community on the central coast that uses CCBER's
resources will benefit from the increased accessibility and organization. CCBER
will also train graduate and undergraduate students in specimen preparation,
curation, and the use of the collections as well as engaging local elementary
students in activities focused on the plant and algae specimens.
