Demands for wireless access to the Internet and voice communications keep
growing exponentially, while the available spectrum remains scarce. As a result,
cellular, WiFi, mesh, and cognitive networks are increasingly interference-
limited.

Despite significant efforts over the last decade, key aspects of the
interference are still not well understood. In particular, the spatial and
temporal correlation of the interference has been largely ignored, despite its
profound impact on the performance. With the proper mathematical and numerical
tools from stochastic geometry and spatial statistics, the impact of protocol
decisions on the interference as a random field in space and time can be
assessed, and, even more importantly, the question of how to engineer the
interference for optimum performance can be addressed.

This project aims at taking a major step in this direction. It focuses on
developing a fundamental understanding of the structure of the interference
using a rigorous analytical approach. While the outcomes of the project will be
applicable to and relevant for most modern wireless systems, they are
particularly pertinent for cognitive systems, where interference between primary
and secondary users is not just a technical problem leading to a performance
reduction, but also a regulatory and legal issue.
