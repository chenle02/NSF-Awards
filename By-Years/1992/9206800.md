This is an award to support research on a sufficiently large scale to determine
the technical and commercial feasibility of using pulsed electrical fields for
disinfection of water, wastewater and sludges derived from treatment of
wastewater. The project consists of design and fabrication of a small, prototype
pulsing device and treatment cell; study of the disinfection rate as a function
of pulse amplitude, pulse width, rise-time and repetition, fluid characteristics
including temperature and pH; and design of a modular system that could be
utilized in potential commercialization of the process. This is an award for
support of Phase II of a project, Phase I of which was initiated under NSF Grant
No. 90-60060 under conditions stated in the Program Solicitation. Results are
expected to provide the basis for engineering design of a device that can apply
the proposed innovative process for use in environmental engineering processes
for disinfection of fluids and may find potential use in deinfestation of food
products and sterilization of pharmaceuticals.
