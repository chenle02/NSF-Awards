This research will use a combination of field observations, endocrine analyses,
and "DNA fingerprinting" to determine the mechanisms and adaptive consequences
of several reproductive phenomena that have been little-investigated in mammals.
The study organisms is the dwarf mongoose, a small gregarious carnivore for
which a substantial base of observational data and a population of individually-
recognizable animals exist in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. In groups
of these animals older dominant individuals suppress reproduction in younger,
subordinate (but physiologically mature) animals, which are less likely to
exhibit mating behavior, to conceive, or to bring pregnancies to term than are
dominants. The PIs will use behavioral observations and analyses of urinary
peptide and steroid hormones to document the stage(s) at which reproduction is
suppressed. Genetic fingerprints will be used to determine maternity and
paternity of offspring and thereby determine whether subordinates's breeding
attempts are ever successful. Field demographic data will determine the effects
of attempting reproduction on individual survival and future reproduction. A
second reproductive phenomenon to be investigated is synchrony of estrus between
subordinate and dominant females. DNA fingerprinting will be used to determine
whether synchronously reproducing subordinates produce more surviving offspring
than do asynchronous animals. Finally, subordinate females without young of
their own nevertheless lactate and nurse the young of dominants. The endocrine
status of lactating nonbreeders, as well as the effort of their lactation on
components of their own and of dominant's fitness will be investigated.
