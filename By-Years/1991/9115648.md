The uptake of stable isotopes and trace metals into the calcite shells of four
paleo-ecologically important species of living planktonic foraminifera will be
studied. Specific objectives include quantifying the effects of symbiont
photosynthesis and foraminifera respiration on isotopic composition within the
shell, and determining whether incorporation of trace metals is proportional to
seawater concentrations and to what extent temperature may affect this
incorporation.
