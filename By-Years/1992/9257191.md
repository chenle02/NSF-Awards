Funds ar provided for Young Investigator Maureen Raymo to carry out research on
study of deep sea cores to reconstruct the history of global climate change in
the Earth's past. In particular, the PI will use carbon and oxygen stable
isotope data to reconstruct history of ice volume, ocean circulation, and
atmospheric CO2 changes over the last few million years. She will use these
records to understand cause-and-effect linkages between major components of the
Earth's climate system.
