DMS-0107792 Zoltan Szabo The main theme of this project is the study of three-
manifolds and smooth four-manifolds by using gauge theory and symplectic
geometry. The Principal Investigator proposes to study and further develop a
recent construction that give invariants for closed oriented 3-manifolds and a
related construction that give invariants for smooth closed oriented
4-manifolds. These constructions use handle decompositions and a version of
Lagrangian Floer-homology. The PI will also study applications of these new
techniques in 3 and 4-manifold topology. In particular PI will study these
invariants for three-manifolds that fiber over a circle and symplectic
4-manifolds.

Gauge theory is a very important technique in smooth 4-manifold theory. It
involves the theory of Donaldson invariants and Seiberg-Witten invariants. These
invariants are constructed by solving certain elliptic partial differential
equations inspired by mathematical physics. Both constructions have
ramifications for three-manifolds as well, these are related to solving the
partial differential equations over four-manifolds with a three-dimensional
boundary. In addition to studying these invariants the Principal Investigator
also proposes to study in detail a third construction that involves holomorphic
disks and a decomposition of the manifold into elementary pieces.
