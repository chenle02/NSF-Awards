Li To achieve the best possible estimation performance with an antenna array,
signal processing algorithms must consider both sensor and wave properties, and
exploit the advantages of these properties. The main objectives of this research
are: 1. to exploit the advantages of different polarization sensitive arrays; 2.
to develop the direction and polarization estimation techniques for both
completely and partially polarized waves; and 3. to take into account the mutual
coupling effects between antenna sensors for direction and polarization
estimation and for modeling nearby scatters with antenna theory. The algorithms
are being applied to both simulated and experimental data from industrial and
government sources. The performance of the algorithms are being evaluated for
both types of data.
