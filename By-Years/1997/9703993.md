9703993 Galligan In situ measurements of dislocation velocities and the
associated mobile dislocation density are performed. These measurements, carried
out while a metal crystal is deforming in an ordinary tensile test, are based on
the intrinsic interactions of electrons with moving dislocations. The
interaction can be varied by deforming a crystal in the presence of a rotating
magnetic field, resulting in a change in the deformation stress. The change in
stress occurs at an angle determined by the spatial orientation of the magnetic
field vector relative to the moving dislocations. Measurement of the angle
establishes the dislocation velocity of the mobile dislocations during an
ordinary tensile test. Selective alignment and rotation of the magnetic field
relative to the active slip system of the deforming crystal allows the
determination of edge and screw dislocation velocities. These dislocation
velocity measurements are carried out as a function of stress and temperature,
establishing how the instantaneous dislocation velocity varies with these
parameters. Dislocation velocities and mobile dislocation densities are also
measured as a function of changes in the strain rate. %%% These experiments
provide measurements of instantaneous dislocation velocities and mobile
dislocation densities in iron crystals while they are deforming. This
information is presently unknown for the plastic deformation of materials and
provides the first such measurement in iron crystals. ***
