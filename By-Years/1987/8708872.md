Industrial machine vision, using cameras and computers to automate industrial
inspection tasks, has proven to be harder to introduce into factories than was
anticipated. The major reason is that the underlying principles for extracting
industrially useful information from images are not well understood. The
objective of this research is to construct a new research tool for studying the
information content in industrial machine vision images: a computer simulation
of image capture systems. This simulation will combine numerical models of
lighting, surface reflection, optics, cameras, and video electronics to
synthesize images with highly accurate surface luminances. Using the simulator
to replace a vision system's camera, image processing algorithms can be tested
by applying them to images with known information and noise characteristics.
When these images are compared with the outputs of cameras, insight into the
nature of camera defects will also result. In short, this simulator provides the
first tool that can look into all areas of an image capture system, even those
that are normally inaccessible. The principal investigator expects this to lead
to new ideas about the design of image capture systems and image processing
algorithms. In addition, the simulator has a practical use. Because it can
simulate images of parts that have not yet been built, it can be used as a tool
to design industrial vision applications or as part of a system that
automatically programs vision systems.
