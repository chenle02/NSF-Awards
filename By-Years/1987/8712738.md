The University of California at Los Angeles is being supported to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is
to provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry
for outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced
research chemists. The program will support about 7 students for the summer of
1987. An effort will be made to attract students from institutions which have
limited research opportunities for undergraduates. Research activities will
include the following: o Synthesis of Antitumor Antibiotics o The Chemistry of
Organics in Sediments o Chemical Dynamics via Molecular Beams and Lasers o Bio-
Organic Chemistry
