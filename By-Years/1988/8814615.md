The objective of this research is to develop methods of predicting large-scale
contaminant transport processes in naturally heterogeneous aquifers. The aquifer
heterogeneity is represented by a three-dimensional random field and the
resulting transport processes are predicted by using a small perturbation
spectral representation technique to solve the governing stochastic differential
equations. The validity and limitations of the theoretical results are evaluated
using large- scale three-dimensional numerical simulations employing state of
the art supercomputer facilities. The theoretical results will also be compared
with ongoing field experiments. Using these techniques, the research
specifically addresses unresolved issues regarding highly heterogeneous
aquifers, unsteady flow effects, non-stationarity heterogeneous reactive
processes and two-phase flow. This research is expected to establish methods of
predicting field-scale transport parameters from small-scale laboratory or field
measurements. Quantitative predictions of these field- scale transport processes
are a central element of schemes to regulate and rectify groundwater
contamination associated with waste disposal activities. The research will also
be of broad scientific interest in that it will establish systematic methods of
predicting the large-scale behavior of complex, naturally heterogeneous
environmental systems.
