Valdosta State College will host a 3-year enhancement program in molecular
biology for high school teachers. Over three years, 75 participants from South
Georgia will take part in an intensive 3-week course. Hands-on laboratory
experiments will include principles of enzyme action, principles of
electrophoresis, DNA isolation from E.coli, separation of DNA and RNA using
Sephadex, analysis of DNA fragments sizes, DNA fingerprinting, analysis of
restriction enzyme patterns, characterization of supercoiled, nicked, and
catenane forms. DNA sequence analysis and immunoelectrophoresis of proteins.
Teacher participants will take a kit back with them to their schools to
incorporate molecular biology techniques directly into their curricula. Over the
three-phase program, lead high school teachers will assist with the course and
provide feedback on their use of these techniques in their home schools. A
network of participants will develop into a biology interaction group which will
continue to support the on-going program with the assistance of Valdosta State
College.
