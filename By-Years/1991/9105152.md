This research is to utilize the Saint Louis University seismometer network to
study heterogeneities in the New Madrid intraplate earthquake zone. A new series
expansion method will be use to develop path Green's functions on source
locations from small, less than magnitude 2.5, earthquakes. Then, the Green's
function method will be applied to larger earthquakes in the New Madrid region
to study spatial/temporal variations in rupture properties. A second
investigation will utilize the S-wave coda to map three-dimensional Q structure
in the New Madrid seismic zone. These studies should provide insights on the
nature of heterogeneities within and near the source zone of New Madrid
earthquakes. This is important both for knowledge of earthquake processes in
intraplate regions and for assessing earthquake hazard. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
