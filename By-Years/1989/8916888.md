The objective of this project is to study the role of histone-like proteins in
the organization and folding of the bacterial chromosome in Salmonella
typhimurium. Our approach will be to use genetics to explore in vivo the
contribution of these proteins to chromosome structure and their interactions
with other cell proteins. Our goal is to achieve genetic control over each of
the proteins which contribute to chromosome structure so that the problem can be
studied as an interactive process in vivo. We will pursue a number of genetic
selections to look for compensatory mutations which describe interactions with
the major bacterial histone-like protein HU. We will use the combined approach
of molecular biology and genetic selection to identify and characterize members
of this protein class. We also will use in vivo genetic tools to study the
regulatory interactions of these proteins. Finally, we will begin to look at the
effects of these DNA scaffolding proteins on supercoiling and their interactions
with such catalytic protein determinants of chromosome structure as
topoisomerase and gyrase.
