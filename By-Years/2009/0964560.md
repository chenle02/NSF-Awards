Despite a number of recent efforts, current solutions for database
administration tasks like tuning, troubleshooting, benchmarking, and capacity-
planning remain far from satisfactory. Database systems have many configuration
parameters to control memory distribution, I/O optimization, costing of query
plans, and other behavior. Regular users and even expert database administrators
struggle to tune these parameters for good performance. The inherent complexity
makes it hard for these systems to gracefully handle uncertain and dynamically-
changing workloads and diverse query mixes. The .eX project addresses these
challenges through a novel methodology called automated experiment-driven
management which encapsulates key building blocks to automatically generate
knowledge of system behavior for simplified administration and self-tuning.
These building blocks include techniques to: (i) characterize good system
performance models, (ii) plan experiments that generate data to learn and
maintain these models efficiently under system and workload changes, and (iii)
make robust decisions using these models given the inherent uncertainty in how
accurately the models capture the true underlying system behavior. Apart from
system administration, .eX's automated experiment-driven management can benefit
applications like MapReduce computations, large-scale computational simulations,
and keyword auctions in online advertising. Two new courses for graduate and
undergraduate students at Duke cover principles of automated experiment-driven
management. A fully-functional prototype of .eX is being developed and deployed
in multiple settings to simplify database administration. The source code of .eX
will be released publicly and the technology will be migrated potentially to
industrial-strength system administration products. Results from .eX will be
disseminated via the project Web site
