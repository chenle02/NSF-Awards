Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0315165&lt;br/&gt;Frisbie/Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative
research project between Professor Frisbie and Professor Zhu at the University
of Minnesota addresses the problem of metal-molecule contacts in molecular
electronic devices. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, Frisbie and Zhu and their coworkers are examining the electronic
structure of metal molecule contacts using time resolved two-photon
photoemission spectroscopy. The electronic structure of the contact is then
correlated with its electron transport properties determined using conducting
probe atomic force microscopy. Information from this fundamental study is useful
in the understanding and further design of molecular electronic devices and
nano-structures used in the electronics industry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the connection between the detailed
electronic structure of a metal-molecule contact and its conductivity properties
is the goal of the work of Professors Frisbie and Zhu at the University of
Minnesota. Using photoemission spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy they
are measuring these properties for a variety of model molecular electronics
systems. Results of this work impact the growing field of molecular and nano-
scale electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
