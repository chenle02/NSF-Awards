The project develops a high data rate optical communication system and a
localization algorithm that combines optical with acoustic information as well
as two robot capabilities that use the optical communication system. The first
explores new methods for acoustic and optical underwater coordination that lead
to target identification and efficient data muling using autonomous underwater
vehicles. The second explores the use of optical communication as a remote
control of an underwater robot as well as for live video transmission from the
robot.

The systems contribute a new approach to search and rescue at sea and also
enhance the tools available to marine sciences. The proposed underwater systems
enhance the scope of observations and communication of the ocean?s physical
properties which are essential for advancing knowledge on a wide variety of
multi-disciplinary, societally-relevant concerns such as climate variability,
gaseous sequestration (e.g., CO2), biogeochemical cycles, and ecosystem dynamics
for small scale (e.g., phytoplankton) to large scale (e.g., mammals and
commercial fisheries) biota. Furthermore, there is an international
collaboration with Prof Hirose from the Tokyo Institute of Technology (TIT) to
create an optically-enabled version of AnchorDiver III and demonstrate its
ability to localize, communicate, and transmit video imaging. This involves
student and faculty exchanges in the international research community.
