We are recommending support of Professor Ford's investigations into the
relationship between quantum field theory, gravitation and cosmology. One of the
strange and critical problems which Professor Ford shall investigate is the
effect that fluctuations of locally negative energy, permitted by quantum field
theory, would have on the gravitational field.
