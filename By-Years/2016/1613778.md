The 6th Conference on "Emergent Phases in Quantum Hall Systems" (EPQHS-6) will
take place in Mumbai, India from January 7 to January 9, 2016. The Conference
focus is on quantum phases found in two-dimensional electron systems. Main goals
of EPQHS are to bring together key scientists as well as young researchers, to
evaluate recent developments and to discuss further research directions. The
organizing committee envisions a meeting with approximately 30 high level
lectures and with a total of approximately 150 participants. Its format will
enable active discussions among participants. This proposal requests travel
support of students and postdocs from the US to enable their participation.
