This award provides funds for an REU Site in Biocultural Anthropology at the
University of Notre Dame. The Site will last for six weeks each summer and
involve 10 undergraduate students. The program will engage a diverse pool of
talented undergraduates in an experiential learning environment that immerses
them in anthropological method and theory. Using the large Byzantine St.
Stephen's skeletal collection from Jerusalem as the cornerstone for study,
historical and archaeological information will be synthesized in a biocultural
reconstruction of ancient monastic life. Students will engage in original
research to develop a suite of methodological skills in the sciences and enhance
their capability for collaborative research. They will share in a field trip
program to area research sites, libraries, museums, and a functioning monastery
to gain an understanding of the cultural parameters affecting human
adaptability. Exploration of ethical issues related to the politics of
archaeology, treatment of artifacts, and repatriation will focus attention on
scientific ethics, an important foundation for future research endeavors.
Finally, a dynamic lecture program delivered by an international team of
scholars in the fields of anthropology, biology, history, classics, geography,
theology, and Near Eastern studies will crystallize the importance of a holistic
approach for studying the past. The biocultural field school will provide an
intellectually energizing learning experience, which will equip participants
with a suite of talents for viewing their surroundings. The integration of
practical research skills, ethical inquiry, and the synthesis of disciplinary
paradigms for viewing human interaction will prove useful as students move into
graduate or professional careers in the natural and social sciences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
undergraduate research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
