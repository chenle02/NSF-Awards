An increasing amount of data is stored in an interconnected manner. Such data
range from the Web; hyperlinked pages; to bibliographical data; graph of
citations; to biological data; associations between proteins, genes, and
publications; to clinical data; associations between patients, hospitalizations,
exams and diagnoses. A critical need in order to leverage the available data is
the enablement of information discovery, i.e., given a question (query) find
pieces of data or associations between them in the data graph that are "good"
(relevant, authoritative and specific) for the query, and rank them according to
their "goodness". Submitting such queries should not require knowledge of a
complex query language (e.g., SQL) or of the details of the data (e.g., schema).
Unfortunately, little has been done to provide high-quality information
discovery on data graphs in domains other than the Web, where search engines
have been successful. This project is expected to have the following broader
impacts: (a) Promote participation of FIU (one of the largest Hispanic
institutes in the country) minority students in the research process, in the
form of independent or senior class projects. (b) Facilitate effective
information discovery on biological and clinical data, which can lead to cost
savings, and increased research productivity in these domains. The results will
be disseminated through publications, public Web demo systems, and the project
Web site (http://dblab.cs.ucr.edu/projects/DGID/).
