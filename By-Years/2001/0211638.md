The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the Polymers
Program in the Division of Materials Research make this award to Pennsylvania
State University to design and synthesize four different types of hybrid
polymers containing poly (organophosphazenes). With this award, Professor
Allcock will synthesize poly phosphazene containing hybrid block polymers, and
polymers with poly phosphazene linear or cyclic side chains and phosphazene
rings connected by organic chains. Different reaction chemistries such as ROMP
and ADMET polymerizations will be used to prepare these multifunctional
polymers, and they are expected to exhibit a combination of properties not
amenable by each class of polymers separately. Functional properties of these
polymer hybrids may find applications in drug delivery systems, fuel cells, and
solid-state energy storage and electro-optical devices. Strengthened education
and outreach programs in polymer sciences will be another outcome of this award.

chemistries will be used to prepare these multifunctional hybrid materials with
improved performance and functionalities. In addition, research and educational
opportunities in polymer sciences will be provided to students with this award.
