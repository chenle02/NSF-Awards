This research is to support data analysis of the 1990 Brooks Range Seismic
Experiment for which field operations support was provided by NSF, IRIS, and the
USGS. The project conducted a vertical-incidence to wide-angle seismic
reflection/refraction investigation across the Brooks Range and North Slope,
Arctic Alaska extending 315 km from the Ruby terrane at the Arctic Circle,
across the eastern edge of the Koyukuk Basin, the Brooks Range fold-and-thrust
belt, and the southern half of the North Slope. A 700-channel seismograph system
was used in 6 deployments to record 63 shots at 44 shot points. This research is
for conventional and advanced seismic processing and interpretation
complementing that done by USGS scientists. Lithologic interpretations will be
done in collaboration with Purdue University.
