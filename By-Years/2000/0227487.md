Kesler&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0227487&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a request for support
for a conference that will focus on designing research objectives for the
geology and geochemistry of ore deposits (economic geology) in the future. The
conference will be held October 5, 2002, in Denver, Colorado, one day before the
national Geological Society Conference meeting. The main goal of this conference
is to outline research that will help clarify how mineral deposits and related
geochemical anomalies form and how they are related to the global-scale
processes that have produced chemical heterogeneity in our planet. Support will
be used largely to supplement lodging costs for those already attending the GSA
meeting. Results of the conference will be published in the Newsletter of the
Society of Economic Geologists and other journals.&lt;br/&gt;
