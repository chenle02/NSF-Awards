This project will employ cyclostationary empirical orthogonal functions (CsEOFs)
to analyze variability of the Asian-Australian monsoon. This technique,
pioneered by the P.I. in recent years, provides an alternative method of
analyzing space-time variability. The project is to include the development of
statistical forecasts, and the analysis of modes of variability in atmospheric
and coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations. This research is expected to lead to
an improved predictability of Asian monsoon variability, and provide significant
societal benefit by offering greater lead times to prepare for drought and
floods. The impact on agriculture could be highly significant. Three graduate
students will be supported by this award.
