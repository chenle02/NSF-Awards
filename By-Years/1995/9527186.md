9527186 Sunderam The proposed research address enabling technologies to support
collaborative, distributes computer-based problem solving in the natural
sciences. The research emphasis of this effort will be on problem solving
environments in scientific disciplines, and on computer science issues in
multimodal distributed systems. the project will be driven by the requirements
of collaborative research and problem-solving in natural sciences, i.e.
chemistry, physics, biochemistry, and allied fields. In these, and other
laboratory/instrument based sciences, an increasingly common research
methodology involves the use and dependence upon computation, interaction,
graphical display of data, and data storage. The overall goal of this project is
to evolve a virtual distributed computing framework that integrally supports
human AV communication, high performance heterogeneous computing, and
distributed data management facilities. this research will involve analysis of
computational transformations and graphical viewing of results produced by
scientific instruments, and the development of methodologies and tools to
enhance the experiment-results-analysis phases of scientific endeavor, in a
collaborative distributed setting. It is expected that this project will
culminate in a tangible suite of software tools that facilitate such
collaborative frameworks.
