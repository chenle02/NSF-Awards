The objective of this research is to study an innovative arcing mechanism and
the resulting novel process of double-electrode gas metal arc welding or DE-
GMAW. The approach is to separate the production and control of the base metal
part of arc heat from the production and control of the electrode melting part
of arc heat. This separate production and control mechanism allows the base
metal part of arc heat to be controlled at a desirable level for an appropriate
bonding between the detached droplet and the base metal while the electrode
melting part of arc heat can be increased to maximize the productivity. The
proposed studies involve heat transfer, arc radiation, fluid mechanics,
numerical modeling, materials, control system/theory, circuits design and
computer hardware/software development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of
this research first lies in that it will establish a knowledge base which can
help understand and support the operation and optimization of the promising DE-
GMAW process and help US manufacturing industry improve competitiveness,
especially with countries where the labor cost is relatively low. It will also
provide opportunities to train participating graduate students through
challenging multi-disciplinary research and industry-collaborations and help the
PI develop credited and non-credit short courses on control based manufacturing
which are needed to educate first-class manufacturing engineers and graduate
students. In addition, the PI will identify appropriate topics for two
outstanding undergraduate students, with one or two from under-represented
groups, and for two exceptional high school students to attract them to graduate
school and to choose engineering careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
