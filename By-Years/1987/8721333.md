The PI has developed a neural-like system called stack filters, which have
achieved high performance in fixed image processing and show evidence of being
more manageable, in some ways, than conventional neural networks. This project
will attempt to develop learning algorithms for these systems, which will
hopefully take advantage of their unique properties. These algorithms will be
tested in speech recognition applications, in collaboration with a researcher
who has developed a new programmable hearing implant for the deaf.
