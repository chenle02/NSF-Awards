This project will develop an advanced 3-D hybrid simulation code (fluid
electrons + kinetic ions) that included the coupling of the magnetosphere to the
ionosphere. The hybrid magnetosphere model will be coupled an ionospheric model
developed at the Naval Research Laboratory. The existing code (H3D) will be
enhanced for petascale application with advanced techniques such as multi-zone
asynchronous time-stepping and particle splitting. The resulting code, called
H3DM ("M" for multi-zone) will be validated by comparing model results with
observational data from a variety of NASA missions.

The successful development of a 3-D global, hybrid simulation of the
magnetosphere with realistic coupling to the ionosphere has the potential to be
transformative in our abilities to model and predict how the solar wind couples
to Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere.

The project has societal benefits because of its relevance to space weather and
space technology. The project has educational benefits and includes both
undergraduates an graduate students in the research.
