SBR-9511034 MATISOFF ABSTRACT The Sino-Tibetan (ST) languages constitute one of
the great language families of the world. Yet despite the rapid development of
Sino-Tibetan studies in recent decades, they remain poorly understood; indeed,
some branches of the family are still virtually unstudied. To fill this vacuum
in historical linguistic research, the STEDT (Sino-Tibetan Etymological
Dictionary and Thesaurus) project gatheres data from both extant published works
and the growing body of field work and intergrates them into a coherent whole.
The concrete goal of the project is the publication of an etymological
dictionary of the ancestor language, Proto-Sino-Tibetan (PST), spoken perhaps
6000 years ago. The Dictionary is organized by semantic fields, so it will
constitute a "thesaurus" of PST. A large computer database of etymological and
lexicographic information has been created to support the research required to
publish the Dictionary. This database consists of a lexical file (containing at
this time over l90,000 words in about 200 languages and dialects), an etyma file
(containing over 2,400 reconstructions), and ancillary files containing
references to language names, bibliographic citations, extensive etymological
notes, and semantic diagrams. Sources for lexical data range from published
dictionaries and wordlists to questionnaires solicited from fleld researchers.
Along with the Dictionary, electronic and hardcopy versions of materials
supporting the reconstructions will be published, including a directory of
language names, a compendium of phonological inventories, and detailed sound
correspondences in the form of a "sound law database."
