This is a part of a coordinated research program in seismic precast concrete
structures. This projects will develop a limit state design methodology for
precast concrete structures present design standards and past research in
structural reliability theory will be drawn upon. The methodology will be able
to incorporate the energy dissipative and other innovative characteristics used
in the connection design, and will be updated and expanded to incorporated the
current research findings. The design recommendations at the completion of the
project will ensure maximum technology transfer of new and innovative research
results.
