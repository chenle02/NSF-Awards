This project will use the new California Framework for Mathematics as a model to
merge the content and methodology needs into an inservice package for 66
elementary teachers in the Santa Ann Unified School District and the Diocese of
Orange. The project has two goals: (1) Indentify and support ethnic minority
school children who have mathematics potential, (2) help teachers of K-6 improve
their skills in mathematics content and mathematics teaching. The project
represents a university's partnership with a school district and parochial
diocese that have school populations that are over 75% Hispanic, an ethnic group
that is underrepresented in professions requiring mathematics and scientific
preparation. There is evidence that at the elementary school level, Latino
children show promise of success in these areas, but this is not fulfilled at
the high school or college level. The project seeks to improve this discrepancy
by identifying children who show mathematical promise, involving parents through
a home-school linkage and training teachers to develop childrens' mathematical
potential. This project addresses a major priority of the Division of Teacher
Preparation and Enhancement to extend opportunities in mathematics to all
students. The instructional team of four have expertise in content and
experiences in teaching and bilingual-bicultural education to meet these needs.
