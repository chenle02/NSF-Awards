This award will support the research activities of three investigators in
several areas of symbolic, smooth, and measurable dynamics. Among the topics in
symbolic dynamics are automorphisms of the shift, inverse problems for non-
negative matrices, and general structural questions. In smooth dynamics some of
the topics are ergodicity and topological transitivity of partially hyperbolic
dynamical systems, geodesic flows, and singular spaces of non-positive
curvature. Among the topics to be studied in measurable dynamics are restricted
orbit equivalence, non-singular and rational joinings, and the construction of
natural smooth models of measurable systems. This research group will study
dynamical systems. The notion of a dynamical system is a very general one. The
idea is just that the system must evolve in time in some way. The object is to
learn things of a general nature about the dynamics in the hope of classifying
large families of these systems. The dynamical systems under consideration often
behave chaotically over large time periods even when they are completely
predictable. To understand how nevertheless to extract knowledge in this case is
one of the most important problems facing science today. This is one of the
ultimate goals in the study of dynamical systems.
