Prior research on democracy's effect on economic performance generally, often
implicitly, contains an unsound assumption, which is that voters demand the
highest possible rate of growth. A different assumption can be drawn from an
analysis of the likely risk/return preferences of voters. It is that a
democracy's performance will reflect not an unconstrained desire for growth, but
a balancing of a desire for growth and the risks involved in attaining higher
growth. The research in this project develops the hypothesis that the way in
which democracies will differ from dictatorships is that democracies will seek
either low volatility growth strategies or higher volatility strategies that are
predictably well compensated by higher rates of growth. Initial investigation
has shown that when two dimensions of economic performance are examined - - the
rate and variability of growth - - countries with a high level of democracy in
1972-73 unquestionably showed superior economic performance compared to non-
democracies in a cross-sectional regression analysis of a sample of 108
countries, 1974-1989. The researchers develop and extend the investigation by
addressing the following questions: 1) does a higher initial level of democracy
lead to improved economic performance in a broader sample of countries for the
longest period of time available? 2) as opposed to base-year democracy, what is
the connection between within-period democratization and democratization and
growth in both its dimensions? 3) what are the political correlates of
volatility in the rate of growth? The main objective of the project is to
examine the core hypothesis of the research, which is whether or not democracy
is, as the investigators argue, the economically efficient form of government.
Another objective is to establish the robustness of the findings from a pilot
study, and to re-examine previous studies of voting and economic performance in
light of the reported results. This research examines one of the most important
question in the study of political economics: does democracy affect national
economic performance and if so, how? The data collected will be of use to other
scholars interested in the question.
