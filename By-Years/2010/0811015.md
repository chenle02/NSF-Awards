Modern software systems involve millions of lines of code. In many systems, many
of these lines are repetitions, with some variations, of a few patterns. This
repetition is necessary because current programming languages require the
programmer to spell out many details over and over again. Such repetition is
error-prone and increases the cost and time-to-market of software systems. This
research studies syntactic abstraction, a technique to eliminate much of the
repetition in such systems.

This research aims to develop the theory of syntactic abstractions (also called
"macros") to put it on a par with procedural or data abstraction. Its goal is to
develop theories and tools that will make syntactic abstraction easy. Its
results are intended to make it easier to write complex syntactic abstractions
and that will allow a language designer to make rational choices when designing
a syntactic abstraction facility. The main technical innovation is the inclusion
of binding patterns as part of the public interface of a macro.
