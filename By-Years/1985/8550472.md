The University of Chicago School Mathematics Project is in the process of
developing and implementing in the classroom a comprehensive K-12 program
designed to upgrade mathematics education for all elementary school students and
for the majority of secondary school students who are in the middle achievement
range. An up-to-date curriculum, emphasizing problem solving and applications,
is being written and tested in Chicago area schools. In its elementary (K-6)
component, the project seeks to reduce the amount of time devoted to teaching
computational skills, introduce more geometry and statistics, and use calculator
arithmetic to aid instruction and expand the teaching of applications of
mathematics. Initial funding for the project has been provided by the Amoco
Foundation. Additional funding, to assist in supporting the secondary component,
has been provided by the Carnegie Foundation. NSF funding will help support the
elementary component. The project will field test the elementary school
mathematics materials that are being developed, including calculator workbooks,
problem solving workbooks, and workcards designed to guide students in the
independent use of a variety of manipulatives. It will develop a model for the
teacher training necessary to assure successful use of the developed materials.
The model will focus on training generalist teachers for grades K-3 and
specialist teachers for grades 4-6. A teacher training package will be prepared
for use by mathematics supervisors, coordinators, and others who wish to adopt
the training program.
