Programmable networks---networks whose functionality can be changed by a network
operator---are emerging to fundamentally change the way computer networks are
designed, built, and managed. Programmable networks have been a holy grail for
networking research, and such devices (such as network interface cards and
switches) as well as new advanced network applications are coming to market. Due
to the requirement of providing fast packet processing, programmable network
devices have a limited amount of high-speed memory and can perform only a small
amount of computation on every packet. This award supports a workshop addressing
a grand challenge in this space: to rethink the full software stack of networks,
from developing new algorithms and data structures to efficiently realize
network applications with limited resources, to developing high-level
programming frameworks to simplify programming. This requires the efforts of
multiple research communities: networking, algorithms, programming languages,
and computer architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop aims to bring
together these different research communities to survey the state of the art in
programmable networks, to identify key research challenges going forward, and to
exchange ideas. The primary goal is to stimulate discussion between different
communities engaged in research on programmable networks and to broaden the
research community working on programmable networks. As a concrete output from
the workshop, participants will produce a report that will be published as an
editorial in ACM SIGCOMM's online magazine, Computer Communication Review. This
report will cohesively summarize the workshop's discussions, outline a set of
research themes for future research in the area, and make recommendations on
infrastructure support to aid research in programmable
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
