9401119 Overton This proposal addresses the goal of NSF's Research Opportunity
Award program: to enable researchers at institutions with limited research
opportunities to work with NSF-funded investigators at better known
institutions. This project will bring a colleague on the faculty of Fordham
University (Bronx, NY) to New York University to develop a collaborative working
relationship with the principal investigator. The work concerns a nonsmooth
quasiconvex optimization problem. The minimization objective is linear, but the
constraints are Hermitian matrix inequalities, either linear or nonlinear. An
equivalent formulation is the minimization of the largest eigenvalue of a
Hermitian definite matrix pencil, which is a pair of matrices (A, B) with B
positive definite. This specific problem is of great importance in modern
methods for robust control. The goal is the development of fast, reliable
numerical algorithms to solve this problem, together with analysis of
theoretical questions concerning optimality conditions and algorithm
convergence. Software will be developed and made available to the general
scientific community over the Internet (using Netlib). Applications in robust
control will be emphasized. ***
