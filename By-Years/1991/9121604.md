Enhancing research productivity is critical for many U.S. corporations as
product life cycles continue to shorten and global competition intensifies. This
study begins an empirical examination of research units' values concerning
justice and the development of new technologies. The hypothesis is that
employment relationships with the primary purpose of innovation involve high
transaction costs, because of the negotiating, monitoring, and enforcements
needed to allow exchanges between parties to occur. Shared values, specifically
those concerning justice, are critical in governing these relationships between
researchers and employers. This project will consist of indepth field interviews
of research and management personnel in eight biotechnology firms. Interviews
will be directed at exploring the respondents' perceptions of justice and of
productivity in their research groups. The investigators will publish their
results in relevant journals, and develop plans for further research in this new
and important area. Results from this work have both theoretical and practical
interest. The investigators are well qualified; the research plan is good; the
budget is very reasonable; and the proposal is recommended for support with high
priority.
