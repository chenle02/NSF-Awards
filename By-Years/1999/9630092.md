9630092 Howe This research effort employs high-resolution analytical electron
microscopy to address several fundamental questions concerning the interfacial
structure and growth kinetics of precipitate interfaces in metal alloys.
Specifically, the diffusion fields (solute concentration profiles) surrounding
growth ledges on the faces of gamma precipitate plates and the plate edges in an
Al-Ag alloy are determined using the high-resolution (0.14 nm image resolution),
small-probe (0.5 nm diameter) capabilities of a field-emission transmission
electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer
(EDS). These data are compared with concentration profiles obtained from
theoretical models to provide the first tests of these models. The Gatan imaging
filter (GIF) on the same microscope is used in conjunction with the 0.5 nm probe
to obtain electron energy-loss spectra (EELS) across the faces, edges and ledges
of gamma hydride plates in Ti-H alloys. These data make it possible to determine
whether the titanium hydride structure is fully formed at the transformation
interface or whether the compositional and structural changes may be decoupled
in this mixed-mode transformation. Such analyses should clarify key fundamental
questions related to the growth of precipitate plates in metal alloys. %%% This
experimental research provides theorists important information on the
concentration profiles in the vicinity of ledges on the faces of growing
precipitate plates during early stages of growth. Ti-H alloy research explores
the question of whether shear of Ti permits the titanium hydride, TiH, to grow.
The mechanism of growth is obscure at the present time, but the hydride is an
undesirable phase in titanium alloys. ***
