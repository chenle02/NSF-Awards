Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to
strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate
education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty
member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution,
and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at
Texas College intends to identify and characterize important molecules that
affect proteins. Undergraduate students will participate in this research that
involves computer modeling. The research results will be used in coursework at
Texas College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will identify new small
molecular regulators of functions of the physiologically important
multifunctional and multi-ligand transmembrane receptor protein â€“ EPCR. Using
homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, the project will create
functionally relevant conformations of EPCR which cannot be found in published
structures. Structure based molecular docking of small molecules to these
conformations followed by the database searches will identify candidate
molecules that will be tested experimentally to reveal their regulatory
potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
