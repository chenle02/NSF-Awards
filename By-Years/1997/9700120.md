This project provides support for experimental equipment upgrading for
structural control research at University of Notre Dame. The new equipment to be
purchased include a large capacity hydraulic actuator for full-scale component
testing and new control hardware/software which will be dedicated to
interdisciplinary research in engineering. The equipment will be used to support
current and future research efforts in active/hybrid, semi-active and passive
control of structures for wind and earthquake hazard mitigation. The large
capacity actuator will allow for testing of full-scale control devices to
demonstrate their scalability.. Such component testing is essential to the
acceptance of new control technology by the profession. In addition, new digital
controllers are requested in support of the model testing on Notre Dame's
seismic simulator. Acquisition of this equipment is expected to accelerate
development of control devices/strategies that are implementable in full-scale
structures.
