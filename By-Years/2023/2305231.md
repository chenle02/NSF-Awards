The award provides funding for the five-day conference "Arithmetic Geometry and
Algebraic Groups" held at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville during
the period May 24-28, 2023 (website https://sites.google.com/view/agag-at-
uva/home). The conference will highlight recent advances at the meeting ground
of those areas and will explore new connections. It will help to identify new
questions in arithmetic geometry that have potential applications to algebraic
groups and will also promote the development of the arithmetic theory of
algebraic groups over general fields. The program of the conference will consist
of 50-minute invited talks, 20-minute short communications, and a poster
session. The list of invited speakers includes mathematicians from the US,
Canada, Chile, and France, with broad participation of early career
mathematicians from these and other countries, and several members of groups
underrepresented in mathematics.

Topics presented at the conference will include various forms of the local-
global principle over different classes of fields and the analysis of algebraic
groups having good reduction at an appropriate set of discrete valuations of the
base field. These issues are related to the investigation of unramified
cohomology, which comes up in many problems in algebraic and arithmetic
geometry. In turn, finiteness results for unramified cohomology (including those
obtained very recently) rely on the analysis of algebraic cycles. Along with
these themes, which are considered "traditional" for arithmetic geometry and the
theory of algebraic groups, the program will include recently discovered
applications of Diophantine approximation to linear groups, which has resulted
in the resolution of an old problem concerning linear groups with bounded
generation and has led to further developments in the area.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
