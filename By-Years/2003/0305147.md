This project addresses high-field carrier transient transport in nitride-based
wide bandgap semiconductor nanostructures. The approach is to conduct systematic
studies of transient electron and hole transport properties such as velocity
overshoot and phonon dynamics in nitride-based wide bandgap semiconductor
nanostructures by using time-resolved, sub-picosecond Raman spectroscopy. Goals
are to achieve greater understanding of fundamental phenomena to define optimal
device operation conditions, and to provide the basis for the design of a new
class of high performance electronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;An
important impact of the project is in education and human resource development
through the integration of research and education. The proposed research program
will enhance the PI's student mentorship activities and increase chances of
attracting minority students pursuing advanced degrees at ASU. The proposed
research program will further enhance the existing infrastructure of both
nanostructured materials as well as wide bandgap semiconductors having
advantages in computing and signal processing technologies. &lt;br/&gt;***
