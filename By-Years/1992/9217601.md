The primary objective of this project is to allow the production of high
definition molds and casts of a series of important fossil hominids from the
Upper Pleistocene of France. These fossils are currently at the University of
Bordeaux but will soon be dispersed to other facilities at which point they will
no longer be available for casting. Hence, this is an urgent project. The casts
will be become part of the Fossil Pattern Repository and will be available for
examination by scholars.
