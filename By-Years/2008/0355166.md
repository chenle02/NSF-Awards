DMS-0355166&lt;br/&gt;Alexander Merkkurjev&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
covers a wide range of aspects in algebra such as algebraic geometry, algebraic
groups, and homogeneous varieties. The investigator proposes to study motivic
cohomology groups and motivic decomposition of homogeneous varieties such as
projective homogeneous varieties and algebraic groups. The investigator will
seek to produce constructions associated to objects arising in algebraic
geometry, which closely reflect subtle aspects of algebraic cycles. In
particular, the investigator proposes to compute motivic cohomology groups of
simplicial objects associated to projective homogeneous varieties. The second
topic of the proposal involves introduction of the notion of essential dimension
and incompressible varieties that provide new interrelations between algebraic
varieties given by algebraic cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of this
project lies between algebraic geometry, the branch of mathematics devoted to
geometric objects coming from graphing polynomial equations and called algebraic
varieties, and algebraic topology that concerns continuously varying families of
structures called topological spaces. Translating the methods of topology from
topological spaces to algebraic varieties gives new tools to solve problems in
algebraic geometry. Much of the proposed work is to use topological techniques
and ideas to get better understanding of some problems of algebraic
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;
