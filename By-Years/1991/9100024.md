This project is part of a collaborative effort to obtain long- term (2 years)
observations of ocean circulation and atmospheric forcing, in anticipation of an
intensive experiment planned for the Western Pacific Warm Pool in late
1992/early 1993, called TOGA-COARE (Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response
Experiment). Long- term measurements will begin in late 1991, and continue until
well after the intensive experiment is completed, providing the overall
environmental context for the intensive experiment. In this component, together
with colleagues at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, and the
University of Hawaii, the P.I. will deploy and maintain an array of sub-surface
moorings equipped with upward-looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers, which
will provide data on the circulation in the upper 250 meters in a region near
that of the intensive experiment.
