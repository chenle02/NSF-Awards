The objectives of the proposed instrument acquisition are to enhance the
analytical capabilities and benefit ongoing and future research in the field of
microbial ecology in extreme environments. The capabilities provided by these
instruments will aid in the integration of terrestrial, hydrologic, and
atmospheric research within the PIs' university system, address environmental
problems associated with microbial ecology, and enhance facilities and research
programs for the benefit of undergraduate and graduate students. Research made
possible by the acquisition of these instruments includes chemotaxonomic and
phylogenetic characterization of Antarctic pack ice microbiota, phylogenetic
determinations of Bacteria, Eukarya, and Archea from ancient brine habitats,
completion of several microbial genomics projects, evaluation of individual cell
phylotypes and activities in ice environments, oceans, lakes, and travertine
carbonate materials, evaluation of temporal and spatial shifts in taxonomic and
enzymatic activities in freshwater ecosystems, and characterization of
microbially mediated iron mineral transformations and elemental isotopic
signatures reflective of microbial activity.

Upcoming research exploring the relationship between the timing of sea ice
formation and the seasonal movements of krill, fish, penguin, and whale
migration will be facilitated by the acquisition of instruments capable of
quantifying factors that have implications for changes in these movements,
including characterizing pigment in microalgae, profiling the bacterial
community composition, and determining nutrient status. Quantification of
accessory pigments will all for more statistically sound comparisons of
microbial ice communities associated with early versus late forming ice. Results
of this research will have important implications for prediction of the effects
of global climate change on the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

The instrumentation requested in the proposal will benefit numerous
collaborative projects in the field and in the laboratory. The proposed
instrumentation will also lead to significant educational and information
contributions at several levels. The instrumentation will provide increased
opportunities for training with state of the art equipment at the undergraduate,
graduate and post doctoral level, and educational opportunities for younger
students. Information from the research will be made publicly available through
several outlets, including websites generated by the PIs and their
collaborators.
