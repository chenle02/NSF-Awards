This action is for continued support of a U.S.-Taiwan cooperative research
project (NSF CES-8417856) to record and disseminate earthquake strong ground-
motion data. This research facility, called SMART-1 (Strong Motion ARray in
Taiwan -1), is a large-scale digital strong-motion array installed in a highly
seismic area of Taiwan. It is a collaborative project between the University of
California at Berkeley and the Academia Sinica of the Institute of Earth
Sciences at the National Taiwan University. The SMART-1 array commenced
operation in September 1980, and in the first 6 1/2 years of operation, strong-
motion records from over 50 local earthquakes of magnitude between 3.8 and 7.0
(Richter scale) have been recorded. These strong-motion records represent an
important resource for earthquake engineering and for the understanding of
seismic strong motion in the near field. The goals for this continued
cooperation are: (1) To support research on the strong-motion data sets already
recorded, including the magnitude 7.8 earthquake on November 15, 1986, and (2)
to assist in the relocation of a major part of the array to a new site in the
same highly seismic region, with firmer (stiffer) ground foundation conditions.
This will provide earthquake response data for structures built on stiff soil
and rock sites.
