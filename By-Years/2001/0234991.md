The goal of the research is to further the development and analysis of a simple
prokaryotic system which models the complex process of homologous recombination
in eukaryotes. The investigators have replaced the normal recombination system
of the bacterium Escherichia coli with the Red recombination system of
bacteriophage lambda. This switch to the Red system makes the bacterium far more
prone to carry out recombination events involving linear double-stranded DNA
molecules in the size range of single genes. The recombining DNA will be
delivered into the Red-expressing bacteria by infection with a modified version
of bacteriophage lambda. This bacteriophage injects its chromosome, which is cut
in two places by a restriction endonuclease present in the bacterium, releasing
a linear double stranded DNA molecule containing the antibiotic resistance gene
cat, flanked by sequences identical to parts of the lacZ gene in the bacterial
chromosome. Recombination between the linear DNA and the circular bacterial
chromosome produces a strain in which lacZ is replaced by cat. Unlike the
starting strain, these recombinants are both antibiotic-resistant and unable to
utilize the sugar lactose; they are readily selected and enumerated. Experiments
are proposed to explore the involvement of various recombination-promoting genes
in Red-mediated gene replacement. The bacterial genes recF, recO, recR, recA,
and recQ, and the lambda genes orf and rap will be studied in particular. In a
second set of experiments, the dependence of the recombination event upon
structural features of the linear recombining DNA species will be examined.
Questions to be addressed include whether the system responds more efficiently
to some sequences than to others, and whether various artificial DNAs bearing
indigestible phosphorothioate linkages are active in Red-mediated recombination.
