This is the first year of a three-year continuing Research Initiation Award. The
resarch aims to develop theiries and techniques of automatic learning for object
recognition from 2D images. Visual recognition is recognized as a veruy
difficult task due to large image variations, high complexities, and a huge
amount of data in the images that computers muyst deal with in the real world.
Automatic learning is crucual for achievement of versatile and reliable vision
systems. The new approach to learning in this research project is general,
flexible, adaptive, and efficient. The proposed methods will be tested on a
large number of real-world images to recognize learned objects and identify
their locations in the images.
