In June 2006, the eighteenth international conference entitled Formal Power
Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) will be held in Pacific Beach,
California. These annual FPSAC conferences have considerable interdisciplinary
breadth---linking leading researchers in combinatorial mathematics with strong
researchers in allied fields. The principal topics featured during the FPSAC
2006 conference willbe algebraic and enumerative combinatorics and their
applications and relations to other areas of mathematics, physics, biology and
computer science. The interdisciplinary span is evidenced by the choice of
plenary speakers, including Mage Bayer, Fan Chung, Jim Haglund, Bruce Sagan, and
Michelle Wachs from the U.S., Tom Koorniwinder from the Netherlands, Seok-Jin
Kang from Korea, Nigel Ray from he United Kingdom.

A distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to
recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists. This is accomplished by
the tradition of designating an award for most outstanding submission by a
junior researcher and by choosing to highlight some stellar work of younger
researchers as plenary speakers. Each year the FPSAC conference sees
announcements of some of the major advancements in the field of algebraic and
enumerative combinatorics. This year will be no exception with presentations of
beautiful results by Thomas Lam, Gilles Schaeffer, Mark Shimozono and many
others.
