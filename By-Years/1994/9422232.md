This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Florida. The project is to study the impact of
institutionalization on the performance of feminist non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) in the Brazilian women's movement. The student's hypothesis
is that the more institutionalized NGOs will deal in issues more in the
mainstream of Brazilian culture, stressing short-term concrete results, with
fewer participatory procedures. The less institutionalized are hypothesized to
deal in more consciousness-raising, `empowerment` practices. Data will be
collected using participant observation, in-depth interviews, surveys of
organization membership and a content analysis of written and oral material
produced by each group and its grassroots beneficiaries. This research is
important because social movements are where cultural practices and beliefs are
voluntarily transformed by a group of individuals. Advancing our understanding
of the procedures used by such groups and the social implications of the
procedures, can help society design policies and programs to create more
satisfying cultures.
