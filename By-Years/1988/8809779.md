This proposal is a Major Research Equipment Request for establishing a
Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) facility at the University of
California at San Diego (UCSD). The proposed facility will mainly provide
advanced semiconductor materials for optoelectronic device and material research
efforts at UCSD. The portion of the support from UCSD will be used for
purchasing a basic MOCVD reactor, and the portion requested of NSF will be used
to obtain the needed accessories to operate the reactor. These accessories
include a vacuum pump with controlling system, a hydrogen purifier, a toxic gas
monitor, and temperature baths to metalorganic sources. This proposal also
describes various present and future III-V semiconductor optoelectronic device
research projects that can be benefitted by this facility.
