ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Advances in medical imaging technology have allowed
clinicians to generate vast amounts of shape data describing various parts of
the human body. In doing so, the goal is to obtain precise statistical notions
of what a "normal" morphology looks like, and what the different types of
"abnormal" morphology look like, so that clinicians can target treatment to
patients based on these classifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing tools
for the statistical analysis of morphology (i.e. shape) has the potential to
transform medical imaging processes in a fundamental way, allowing us to
understand at a large scale the normal and abnormal variations in human organs
and provide a statistical "map" of the human body. In this research, the PI
develops new tools for the statistical analysis of shape by combining the
mathematics of non-Euclidean shape spaces with techniques for approximating and
efficiently manipulating such spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
