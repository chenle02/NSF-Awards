9319705 Ladefoged ABSTRACT The survival of many languages is endangered as the
speakers die out or are absorbed into larger communities. Soon we will no longer
know what these languages sounded like, or what articulatory gestures their
speakers used. Their disappearance will result in permanent loss of data for
future linguistic investigations. Following a pattern established during
previous research we will investigate endangered languages that are important
from the linguistic point of view. Another major aspect of this project is that
it provides standardized descriptions in quantified form using a set of basic
phonetic measures, designed to characterize both specific and universal phonetic
features. Fieldwork will be conducted in response to invitations from linguists
already working on appropriate languages. In many cases such linguists lack
sufficient phonetic expertise or field experiences to do the job alone, but are
eager to cooperate in producing a good phonetic description. The principal
phonetic and phonological patterns will be identified and illustrated in
specially prepared material, along with supplementary material illustrating
coarticulatory and other phonetic phenomena. We will make both audio and
physiological recordings including aerodynamic records for airstream mechanisms
and the timing of articulatory gestures, and palatographic records for
articulatory contacts. Audio recordings will be analyzed in the UCLA Phonetics
Laboratory. Fully illustrated and documented accounts of each language will be
published so that the knowledge of the sounds and articulatory gestures involved
in these endangered languages will remain available for future researchers and
can form part of the input to the formulation of theories of phonetic and
phonological universals. ***
