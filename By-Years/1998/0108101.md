Electrons injected in the conduction band of a quantum dot exhibit strong
intraband transitions in the mid-infrared and this is interesting for potential
applications. This individual investigator award provides support for a project
to discern and control the mechanisms that influence the energy, coherence and
lifetime of the intraband transitions, in particular the role of phonons and
surface states, issues that are currently unclear. The project deals with
colloid quantum dots prepared by solution chemistry that allow for the
modification of the surfaces. This should provide an important element of
control in the electron dynamics. The characterization of the spectroscopy and
dynamics of the electrons involves steady state and picosecond time-resolved
optical studies using lamp and infrared laser spectrometers. This project,
combining wet organometallic chemistry along with extensive charaterization of
the nanostructures, offers an excellent opportunity for training graduate
students in a frontier area of optical material science.
&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Electrons inside a nanoscopic semiconductor particle
are very sensitive to infared radiation and this is interesting for potential
applications in the mid-infrared, from lasers to detectors, and night-vision.
This individual investigator award provides support for a project to discover
and control the mechanisms that influence the infrared response of the
electrons. This will be necessary in order to take advantage of the flexibility
with which the optical response of the electron can be "engineered" via the
size, shape and composition of the nanostructure. Chemistry is used to make the
semiconductor particles in solutions. These solutions readily exhibit the
effects of quantum mechanics via their strong colors, and they can be processed
to make more practical gels or thin films with identical properties. This
project combines chemistry and optics of nanomaterials and it offers an
excellent opportunity for training graduate students in this technologically
promising area of material
science.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
