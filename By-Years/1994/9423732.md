This research is on techniques for analysis of VLSI interconnect nets. Methods
for predicting capacitance effects in VLSI circuitry, especially at rounded
corners, are being investigated using asymptotic expansions. Secondly, methods
to determine the voltage-current regime of nonlinear networks on a chip are
being assessed. The approach is to model each interconnection network as a
cascade of three terminal networks connected together at their ends. Each
cascade can be described mathematically by a nonlinear operator. Computationally
efficient analysis techniques are being developed.
