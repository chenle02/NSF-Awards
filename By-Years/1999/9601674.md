9601674 Sutterer This is an equipment award, to (1) retrofit and an existing
1334 kN tension/compression universal testing machine (UTM) for digital, closed
loop control, (2) development of a triaxial testing system for specimens up to
560 mm (22 in.) in diameter, and (3) acquisition of a 32 channel data
acquisition system with re-usable strain gages for ongoing research and
teaching. The load frame, which is capable of testing columns and panels up to
4.3 m (14 ft) long, is in excellent condition, but the hydraulic power unit and
manual control valving is outdated and in need of repair. ***
