Bdellovibrio is unique among procaryotes in its obligate parasitism and
predation of certain other bacteria. Since predation by Bdellovibrio destroys
the prey bacterium, it has been postulated that the predator may function as a
biological control agent. This view is not universally accepted and the role of
Bdellovibrio in nature remains a mystery. The small size and low numbers of
Bdellovibrio in the aquatic environments previously studied have exacerbated
ecological investigations of the predator. Studies by Dr. WIlliams have revealed
that Bdellovibrio are recovered in large numbers from surface biofilm. The
nature of the association of the predators with surfaces is the basis for this
study. The objectives are: I) to determine the nature of the association of
Bdellovibrio with surfaces and those environmental factors which affect the
association. II) to characterize the effects of Bdellovibrio on the formation
and integrity of surface biofilms and III) to demonstrate the usefulness of
surface microbial biofilm as a model for the study of Bdellovibrio. The
interaction of Bdellovibrio with other biofilm bacteria may reveal the potential
of the predator in the control of susceptible bacterial populations.
