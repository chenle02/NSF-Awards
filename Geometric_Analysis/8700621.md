Ezra Getzler will continue his work on developing a collection of analytic
tools for loop spaces. This involves Sobolev spaces, logarithmic Sobolev
inequalities, Brownian motion, singular integral estimates, deRham cohomology,
Feynman- Kac formulae. This research forms part of a larger program to determine
whether local index theory is intrinsically connected with Dirac operators or if
it is part of a much bigger algebraic theory. Equivalently the relations between
the the Dirac index and equivariant cohomology of the loop space may be part of
a larger theory.
