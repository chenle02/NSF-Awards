9306997 Evans In the past ten years, many research groups have found that the
mammalian heart and brain produce a family of peptide hormones which have a
variety of effects on the cardiovascular system and the kidney. Their name
refers to the fact that they stimulate the kidney to excrete salts and water.
However, it is still unclear what role(s) these hormones play in humans.
Previous research by Dr. Evans has shown that similar hormones are produced in
the fish heart and brain and preliminary evidence suggests that they may be
important in cardiovascular physiology and salt and water balance in the se
aquatic vertebrates. He proposes to use the techniques of molecular biology to
clone the gene(s) for these fish hormones and initiate a study of their sites of
secretion sites of receptors for these hormones, and their role in fish
physiology. Such studies will allow him to study the evolution of the form and
function of these important hormones and will allow a more precise estimation of
their role in cardiovascular physiology and salt and water balance in vertebrate
animals, including man. ***
