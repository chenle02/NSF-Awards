This award will support cooperative research between Dr. Ronald H. Brlansky of
the University of Florida and Dr. Helen Garnett of the University of Wollongong.
This research is to evaluate mild citrus tristeza virus (CTV) from both Florida
and Australia under uniform environmental conditions for protecting ability
against severe stem pitting Australian and quick decline Florida strains of
viruses. Methods will be developed to differentiate mild and severe CTV strains
from both countries by screening libraries of cDNA clones for different
hybridization, enumeration and charac- terization of the intracellular bodies
characteristic of virus diseases, and development of monoclonal antibody
protection against these infections. The project represents excellent
U.S.-Australian collaboration in offering the opportunity to compare and
evaluate CTV strains from both Australia and Florida for their virus-protecting
abilities. This is important fundamental work using advanced DNA-related
techniques to develop reliable chromosome markers of plant viruses, as well as
having potential for eliminating major virus- disease threats to citrus
production worldwide.
