IBN-9724155 PI: CHIU A mature nervous system functions in large part because
correct synaptic connections are made and maintained between the appropriate
groups of neurons. Although we do not fully understand how appropriate
connections are established and maintained, it is clear that neuronal networks
require bi-directional communication between nerve cells and their synaptic
partners. Dr. Chiu has preliminary evidence that the downstream or post-synaptic
target can "talk back" and regulate the characteristics of the innervating
neuron. Her laboratory has produced a marker that recognizes a molecule found
only in mature motor neurons (the specialized nerve cells that directly control
the contraction of skeletal muscles). This molecule is interesting for several
reasons. First, it is very selective and detected only in this single population
of cells, suggesting that the molecule must play an important role in the
function of this class of neuron. Second, it appears very late in development,
at a time when motor neurons establish their adult pattern of connections with
muscle cells. Third, its presence requires an active response from the target
muscle. Finally, the molecule is lost when communication between nerve and
muscle is disrupted. Together, these results demonstrate that when motor neurons
form and maintain active synaptic contact with muscles, they acquire a unique
molecule not found in any other cell type. These preliminary results suggest
that when muscles are activated, they return a signal to the presynaptic
(upstream) neuron; this retrograde signal then confers a biochemical property
found only in motor neurons. In this manner, the post-synaptic target can
regulate the biochemical nature of its innervating neurons. Dr. Chiu will now
investigate how communication between motor neuron and muscle regulates the
levels of this molecule, and she will identify and characterize this novel,
motor neuron-specific molecule to understand its possible functions in
signalling a nd maintaining the normal wiring of the nervous system.
