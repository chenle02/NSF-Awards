9316061 Yuretich The Baikal Drilling Project is a multi-institutional effort to
investigate the paleoclimatic history and tectonic evolution of the Lake Baikal
sedimentary basin in the Late Neogene. Recent climate modelling studies have
predicted the pattern of temperature expected for the Baikal region in response
to Milankovitch forcing. Proxy climate time series obtained from Baikal sediment
cores will provide essental ground truthing for these types of models. Lake
Baikal occupies the largest basin in the Baikal Rift Zone, one of the two major
continental rift zones in the world. Hence, Lake Baikal provides an opportunity
to study the recent evolution of an important tectonic feature. ***
