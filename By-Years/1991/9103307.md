This is an award to support research to determine the technical feasibility of a
process for removal of organic substances of potentially toxic significance from
water. The process involves passage of contaminated water through a fixed-bed,
adsorbing medium and regeneration of the exhausted adsorbing medium by a
photocatalytic process based on use of n-type semiconductor photocatalysts such
as titanium dioxide. Regeneration of the adsorbing medium and destruction of the
adsorbates are expected to be accomplished by radical species formed when the
catalysis is subjected to illumination with ultra- and near-ultra light
radiation. Adsorption processes are recognized as being effective for removal of
organic pollutants from water. Economic feasibility of adsorption depends
largely on ability to regenerate the adsorbing properties of the adsorbing
medium and to deal effectively with the organic substances released during the
regeneration process. Results of this research are expected to be used for
devising mathematical models that can be used in potential selection and
engineering design of processes and systems for use in decontamination of water
for municipal and industrial needs.
