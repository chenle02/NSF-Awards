This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
at the development of a fully molecular theory for homogenous nucleation of
drops in supersaturated vapors. It involves the research groups of Howard Reiss
of the University of California at Los Angeles and Pierre Schaaf of the
Institute Charles Sadron in Strasbourg, France. They propose studies to develop
a rigorous statistical theory for the prediction of nucleation rates in
substances. Their work will focus on a single substance - argon vapor. The US
investigator brings to this collaboration theoretical expertise. This is
complemented by the French investigators' expertise in experimentation and
simulation. The project will advance understanding of the process of nucleation,
a ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs in atmospheric science, boiling and
cavitation, crystallization and chemical processing, metallurgy, high-energy
physics, planetary formation, contrail formation, superfluids, and biological
processes.
