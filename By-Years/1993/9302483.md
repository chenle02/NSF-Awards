D'Hondt 9302483 The PIs will use chronostratigraphic techniques to test the
regional and global extent of Late Cretaceous oceanographic conditions. The
oceanographic response to Milankovitch forcing during periods of stability will
be deciphered through an integrated analysis of paleoceanographic proxies and
development of cyclostratigraphic records at critical sites. Magnetic
susceptibility, carbonate and terrigenous flux, planktonic foraminiferal and
stable isotopic studies are planned. The focus will be on South Atlantic and
Indian Ocean sites.
