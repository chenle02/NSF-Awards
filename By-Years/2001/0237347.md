This research explores the processes of introspection, namely, how people answer
questions about themselves. The research focuses on the early stages of the
process where people interpret the question asked and search for relevant
information. The meaning making process is revealed through a comparison of how
people answer assertion questions (e.g., "I am happy") and negation questions
(e.g., "I am not sad") that have the same semantic implication. The PIs' earlier
research demonstrates that (a) respondents endorse assertions more than
negations and do so more quickly, (b) wide individual differences occur in this
"Endorsement Bias", and (c) personality scales often confound item type (i.e.,
assertion or negation) with the direction the item is scored. This research aims
to identify the processes that produce this bias and technologies than can be
used to eliminate its effects from self-reports. Many of the studies use the
advanced statistical sophistication of Item Response Theory to identify the
differences in meaning of semantically similar questions. This research will
improve survey methodology, performance appraisal, and other forms of self-
report information.&lt;br/&gt;
