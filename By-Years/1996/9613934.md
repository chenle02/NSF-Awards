9613934 Webster The objective of the project is to maintain a database of UNOLS
and FOFCC research ship schedules and ship characteristics. The database
provides a comprehensive up- to-date and searchable listing of the national and
international research ships, the ship schedules and vessel characteristics that
are used in optimizing the scheduling and planning of research time by the ship
operators and research scientists. The information is accessed through a variety
of ways, including the World Wide Web and Gopher. As a result of the up-to-date
information provided through OCEANIC the US Naval Oceanographic Office no longer
prints ship schedule information and acknowledges that the database provides
more current information than their previous publication. OCEANIC continues to
develop electronic scheduling procedures that provides the user with current
information and access to the world oceanographic fleet. ***
