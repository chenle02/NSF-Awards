This award supports the research of Dr. Robert Kottwitz in Automorphic Forms.
Among his projects are joint work with D. Shelstad involving a twisted form of
the Trace Formula and its relation to twisted endoscopic groups. He will also
investigate the spaces of points modulo p on certain moduli spaces, and work on
a conjectured "Fundamental Lemma" in the field, according to which certain
spherical functions have matching orbital integrals. Non-Euclidean Plane
Geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but
by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of
fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed
study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of
modern mathematics, of which the study of Automorphic Forms is one of the most
active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole
numbers, but in its use of Geometry and Analysis, it retains connection to its
historical roots.
