With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Illes will convene a workshop
examining the ethical implications of emergent and foreseeable advances in
cognitive neuroscience, neuropharmocology, and various other technologies
capable of influencing human cognitive and brain function. The proposal brings
together a variety of highly expert researchers, commentators, and ethicists, as
well as observers from the significant scientific press and funding agencies.
The goal of the small meeting is to closely examine the prospects for using such
methods to enhance learning, memory, and attention, to draw out the ethical
implications of such practices, and discuss possible guidelines. The discussion
will evaluate these matters with respect to society as whole, as well as to
researchers and funding agencies. The workshop will result in a manuscript that
summarizes the discussion and will be submitted to a high profile public science
news journal. The workshop has several potential broader impacts including make
available to the scientific, lay, and policy-making communities, seminal
discussions of the quite varied core ethical issues associated with cognitive
brain enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;
