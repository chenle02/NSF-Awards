The North American Cordillera contains a number of exotic terranes that were
accreted to the continental margin during late Mesozoic to Tertiary time. Study
has focused on those Terranes presently found in the northern part of the
Cordillera in the Pacific northwest and Canada. One of the largest such Terranes
however, is the Guerrero Terrane of western Mexico and is the subject of this
project. The Terrane consists of Jurassic- Cretaceous submarine lavas
volcaniclastics, and sedimentary rocks. The project will include mapping,
isotopic characterization and radiometric age dating. These and other data will
be integrated to constrain models of mesozoic paleogeography of the western
margin of North America and the role of Guerrero Terrane and its accretion.
