In evolutionary biology, life history refers to the way the stages of life are
structured in a species. Life history variables include gestation period, age at
weaning and first reproduction, inter-birth interval, and life span. These
variables correlate highly with each other, as well as with body size, brain
size, and dental development. This project will test the precision with which
life history correlates with dental development, using histological and
radiographic methods to determine the sequence and timing of crown and root
development in six Asian primates. The project will use a new approach,
controlling for the effects of body size by examining the variation in dental
development in a gibbon, two leaf monkeys, and a macaque with similar body
weights but differences in life history variables, as well as a larger siamang
and a smaller macaque. Any patterns of correlation will be examined to determine
how phylogenetic, demographic, and ecological effects on life history affect
dental development. The results of this research will provide critical
information on dental development in species for which very little is currently
known and permit the construction of a new model of dental development that may
be used in understanding life history strategies in primate and human evolution.
