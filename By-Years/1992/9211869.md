The Third Biennial Mammalian Developmental Genetics Workshop will be held in
Bar Harbor, 8-12 September, 1993. This Third Workshop builds on the highly
successful workshops held in Bar Harbor in 1989 and 1991. Emphasis will be
placed on the mouse as a model species. The program will consist of keynote
presentations, topic sessions, and 'brainstorming' sessions. Keynote
presentations will provide an overview of broad developmental questions; topic
sessions will emphasize specific developmental problems; and 'brainstorming'
meetings will emphasize strategies for studying important but poorly understood
developmental problems. For the Third Workshop, the keynote presentations will
focus on genes that control mouse development and on the genetics of human birth
defects; topic sessions will focus on the genetics of hearing and vision, gene
expression in early development, the genetic control lineage determination and
the genetic control of sex determination and gametogenesis; and 'brainstorming'
sessions will focus on the developmental impact of environmental insults and on
the genetic control of programmed cell death. Each topic session will begin with
an invited 60 minute presentation providing an overview of the research problems
and progress for the subject of that section. These overviews will be followed
by two or three 20 minute, more narrowly focused, complementary presentations.
Presentors will be selected by the Organizers form attendee applications.
Attendance will be limited to 110. Participation of graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows is encouraged. Abstracts will be provided to attendees but
will not be published. Poster presentations are encouraged.
