This research program is intended to elucidate the molecular structure and
dynamics of the photocycling intermediates in native, and in a series of
artificial bacteriorhodopsin (BR) systems. The proton pumping process which
operates in BR membranes is triggered by retinal excitation and will be examined
with time- resolved laser measurements of the vibration and electronic state
properties of selected amino acids in the trans-membrane protein. Vibrational
Raman, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies measured with femto/pico
(10-13 sec to 10-12 sec) times resolution will be used to determine the
configurational and conformational changes that occur. These photocycles are
related to the molecular mechanism of vision and may have relevance to the
design and synthesis of new photochromic material for optical data storage and
fast optical switching.
