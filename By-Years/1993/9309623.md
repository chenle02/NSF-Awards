9309623 Lakmazaheri Engineering problems are modeled using linear and non-
linear constraints. Automated reasoning about engineering problems, thus,
requires reasoning about linear and non-linear constraints. Effective strategies
for reasoning about linear constraints exist. The use of these strategies for
engineering applications has been investigated by several researchers. However,
automated reasoning about engineering problems which involve non-linear
constrains has not yet been explored. This is mainly due to the lack of
effective strategies for reasoning about non-linear constraints. Recently, Wu
developed an effective approach for reasoning about non-linear constraints. The
proposed investigation explore the use of Wu's method for reasoning about
structural design problems in ways which have not been possible before.
