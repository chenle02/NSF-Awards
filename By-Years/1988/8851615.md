The University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire will purchase an automated X-ray
diffractometer, associated apparatus, and a computer for control of the
instrument and analysis of the data. This equipment will be used to improve
instruction in introductory and advanced geology courses. In two lower division
courses X-ray diffraction techniques will be used for instruction in scientific
metholds and computer-assisted data reduction. In upper division courses in
mineralogy and geochemistry this equipment will be used to teach basic
techniques of X-ray diffraction analysis. The University of Wisconsin, Eau
Claire will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
