Ultrasound is routinely used for safely imaging unborn babies deep in the body
and diagnosing a variety of illnesses from liver to heart diseases. This opens
the possibility that it can also be used to power medical implants such as
cardiac pacemakers and neural stimulators. Capacitive devices, like microphones,
are widely used for sound to electrical signal conversion but they are deemed
unsuitable for implants as they require batteries to charge them. In this
research, parametric effect, like a child pumping a swing by periodically
standing and squatting to increase the size of the swing's oscillations, is
investigated to remove this limitation. It turns out that one move a plate of a
capacitor using sound waves or mechanical input over a certain threshold level
to start this type of oscillation in an electrical circuit without a need for a
battery. Initial analysis shows that this energy conversion can be very
efficient, leading to remotely powering medical devices with ultrasound, and
this oscillation can be started potentially with very small input levels,
leading to very sensitive mechanical sensors to be used for energy harvesting,
seismic or underwater sensing. In this project, these possibilities and
fundamental limits of this unique approach will be explored experimentally and
through detailed models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is
to test a radically different approach to acoustic power transfer and sensing
through the use of electrical parametric oscillators (resonators) driven by
acoustic waves. In addition to optimized power transfer efficiency, the
parametric amplification and noise squeezing for acoustic sensing applications
will be explored by analyzing the fundamental mathematical problem of coupled
oscillator based parametric systems and parametric super-resonance. Both
analytical and numerical analysis methods will be utilized. This project will
generate the proof of concept data for demonstration of efficient power transfer
and model verification to develop new type of devices through ultrasound
experiments in 500kHz-2MHz range. Use of inductance and resistance modulation
for parametric resonance will be explored. If successful, this project, by
exploiting nonlinearity and resonance, can lead to a paradigm shift in acoustic
transduction which heretofore depended predominantly on linear, passive
properties of capacitive and piezoelectric devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
