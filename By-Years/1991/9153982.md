The purpose of this project is to hold a Symposium on Graduate Study in the
Sciences for female science undergraduates from the Pacific Northwest (Oregon
and Washington) to provide them with the information and encouragement needed to
consider graduate study. The number of women receiving Ph.D. degrees in the
sciences is far smaller than the number of men who receive this degree, and the
fraction of female undergraduates who opt for graduate study is smaller than the
fraction of males who opt for graduate study in all scientific disciplines.
Those who attend this symposium will learn about graduate education in general
and about specific aspects of their chosen field. They will also be involved in
discussions about choosing a graduate school, financial aid, life as a graduate
student, preparation for graduate study, career opportunities, and special
concerns of female students. Sixty undergraduate participants (representing
physics, chemistry, mathematics, earth sciences, and the biological sciences)
from approximately 30 colleges and universities in Oregon and Washington will
attend the symposium. Symposium organizers will remain in contact with the
participants throughout their remaining undergraduate years and chart their
progress towards graduate study.
