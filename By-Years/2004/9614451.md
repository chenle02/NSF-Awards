ABSTRACT OPP-9614451 DARBY OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION This
project is designed to assess the magnitude and timing of the Arctic Ocean ice
influx into the Greenland and Iceland Seas during the last 300,000 years. Arctic
glacial ice export and melting might have provided more freshwater to this
region than previously considered. Because freshwater is thought to be important
in decreasing the formation of deep water, the thermohaline conveyor might
reduce the northeastern flow of warm North Atlantic water. This study will
analyze ice-rafted detritus in well-dated cores from the northern Greenland and
Iceland Seas, and match Fe oxide composition and grain lithologies to those from
the Arctic shelves and land sources. Correlation of these dated cores will
enable a comparison to global paleoclimatic records and a better assessment of
the role of the Arctic in global climate.
