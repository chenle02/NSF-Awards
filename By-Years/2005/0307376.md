AST-0307376&lt;br/&gt;Meszaros&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and
active galactic nuclei (AGN) are natural accelerators capable of producing very
high energy particles, but understanding of their physics remains sketchy. The
investigators will study high-energy neutrino and photon emission from inelastic
nuclear collisions and photo-meson interactions in GRBs and AGN sources. A new
generation of experiments will soon be able to measure the flux and spectrum of
these particles, which provide unique signatures that can be used to test and
constrain models. The present research will identify the key distinguishing
features of the models, and will help to optimize planned experiments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is relevant to many areas of high-energy
astrophysics, and will test basic particle properties in regimes outside the
reach of terrestrial experiments, and with an accuracy many orders of magnitude
better than is currently possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
