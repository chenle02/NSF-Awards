Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures such as permutations,
combinations, subsets, and so on. This research project studies combinatorial
problems that arise from algebra, geometry, and theoretical physics. One of the
topics to be studied is the classification of electrical resistor networks
consisting of finitely many resistors. In this problem, one studies whether the
structure of an electrical network can be recovered by performing measurements
at particular nodes. Another problem to be studied is the understanding of the
combinatorics of high-energy particle scattering experiments. These computations
have been related to the combinatorics of permutations and other related
projects. A third problem is the study of certain discrete two-dimensional
surfaces in high dimensional space, called membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigator's work is in algebraic combinatorics. Topics to be pursued include:
(a) Development of the theory of Laurent phenomenon algebras, originally
introduced in joint work with Pavlo Pylyavskyy. These LP algebras generalize
cluster algebras by allowing exchange polynomials to have arbitrarily many
monomials, rather than just two. (b) The study of the algebraic deRham
cohomology of cluster algebras, which may have applications to the calculation
of higher extensions of Verma modules. (c) A development of a positive analogue
of polymatroids, called polypositroids. These polytopes turn out to have
remarkable properties, and appear to be related to certain discrete minimal
surfaces called membranes. (d) The study of a parabolic analogue of Whittaker
functions. The aim is to study solutions to the quantum D-module for a
generalized partial flag variety.
