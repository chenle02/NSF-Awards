The 2013 Ohio River Analysis Meeting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ohio River
Analysis Meeting (ORAM) will be held on March 9-10, 2013, at the University of
Cincinnati, in Cincinnati OH. ORAM is an annual analysis conference organized
jointly by the mathematics department at the University of Cincinnati and the
University of Kentucky and it is now in its third year. Analysis is a major area
of strength in the two organizing departments; particularly well represented are
PDEs and their applications, harmonic analysis, and geometric analysis.
Furthermore, there exists a remarkable concentration of analysis research at
universities around the Ohio Valley region. ORAM aims both to capitalize on and
to deepen these connections. Each meeting features a rich mathematical program,
with plenary lectures by leading experts and contributed talks by junior
participants. The 2013 ORAM will have five plenary lectures and around 20
contributed talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this mathematics
conference is to present researchers from the larger region with a regular,
centrally located forum in which to present their work, collaborate, and
exchange ideas. While ORAM attracts analysts of all career stages, the
organizers place particular emphasis on bringing in graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and pre-tenure faculty. Members of these groups especially
benefit from exposure to cutting-edge research and unique networking
opportunities. This NSF award will be used to help defray travel costs of such
junior participants.
