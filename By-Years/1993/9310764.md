ABSTRACT PHY-9310764 Karl Berkelman Cornell University This project supports a
program of basic research in Elementary Particle Physics and Accelerator Physics
at the Laboratory of Nuclear Studies of Cornell University. The research program
includes the operation of, and accelerator studies on, the Cornell Electron
Storage Ring (CESR), research on the CLEO-II detector, and provides,
parasitically, synchrotron radiation beams for the Cornell High Energy
Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The CESR accelerator, an electron-positron colliding
beam facility optimized to produce hadron final states in the 9 to 12 GeV range,
delivers a yearly integrated luminosity far exceeding other similar machines.
CESR is a test-bed for many accelerator physics studies; the Cornell group leads
the world in the production of accelerator physicists. The center-of-mass energy
range of CESR includes the Upsilon(4S) resonance which decays 100% of the time
into a pair of B-mesons, enabling very clean studies of bottom quark decays with
the CLEO II detector. The collider also produces copious numbers of charm mesons
and tau leptons simultaneously, allowing a broad range of physics topics to be
studied.
