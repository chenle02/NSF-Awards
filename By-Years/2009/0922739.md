This doctoral dissertation collects data on social networks and social norms
using an innovative sampling frame. The project builds on an ongoing prospective
randomized experimental evaluation of a new biofortified sweet potato.
Biofortification of sweet potatoes could be a cost effective way to reduce
Vitamin A deficiencies, which are widespread among women and children in parts
of Africa. However, information about the health benefits must spread widely
through a society if people are going to adopt the new food.

Social networks are especially important in African economies because other
institutions are weak; these networks are an important pathway for information
diffusion. This doctoral dissertation measures the effects of social networks on
decisions to purchase the new variety of sweet potato. Research methods include
a direct household survey of 500 households and field experiments using dictator
and trust games to measure the effects of altruism and trust on network
diffusion effects.

This project contributes to the growing area of network economics by providing a
direct measurement of the effects of a specific social network on information
diffusion. This research also has broader impact because it will result in a
more scientifically valid assessment of the cost effectiveness of the
biofortification project.
