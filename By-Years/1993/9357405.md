This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of analytical chemistry and in the subfield of surface chemistry. During
the five-year tenure of this award, Professor Crooks and his students will carry
out a fundamental investigation of molecular recognition phenomena observed in
organized chemical systems. The research will involve i) the synthesis and
characterization of surface-confined, self- assembling membranes, ii) analysis
of electron- and mass-transfer phenomena in ultrasmall domains, iii)
electrochemical synthesis and characterization of metal nitride and sol-gel-
derived ceramics, and iv) the fabrication of quantum devices by scanning probe
induced lithography. %%% The successful attainment of the goals of this project
should enable broad advances in the area of surface chemistry, in general, and
the study of molecular interactions in self- assembled thin films in particular.
The research results will be used for the development of new chemical sensors
based on molecular recognition phenomena. Additionally, this NSF Young
Investigator Award will significantly assist Professor Crooks to establish a
viable, innovative research program at Texas A&amp;M University.
