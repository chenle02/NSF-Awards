*** Usiskin 9552990 The Gateways IV Conference, being held in Chicago, IL on
October 7-9, 1995, brings together leaders from all the National Science
Foundation funded elementary, middle, and high school comprehensive mathematics
curriculum projects in order to share information and experiences and address
common questions which have surfaced as materials have been developed, tested,
and implemented. A major focus of the conference is the discussion of evaluation
studies related to the materials and methods developed thus far. A special
closing event acquaints the general public, the media, and policy makers with
the progress being made by the funded projects. ***
