Arun Yethirraj is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research on static and dynamic properties of
polyelectrolyte solutions. A combination of liquid state theory and computer
simulations will be used to investigate the conformational properties, static
structure, self diffusion, and viscosity of polyelectrolyte solutions. Monte
Carlo simulations will be used to investigate the effect of solvent, chain
branching, and charge sequence distribution on the polymer properties and to
analyze neutron scattering data on DNA and sodium polystyrene sulphonate.
Brownian dynamics will be used to study the kinetics of the collapse transition
in polyelectrolyte chains, and to test various models for the dynamic form
factors used in the analysis of experimental neutron diffraction data. Non-
equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations will also be used to investigate the
anomalous behavior of intrinsic viscosity. Polyelectrolytes have a wide range of
technological uses: as processing aids such as flocculants, dewatering agents,
demulsifiers, and drag reduction agents; as additives in detergents and
cosmetics; and in the manufacture of membranes, ion-exchange resins, gels, and
modified plastics. The study of polyelectrolytes therefore spans diverse areas
such as biomedicine, wastewater treatment, separations, colloid science, and
petroleum recovery. The behavior of polyelectrolytes, however, is far from well
understood, and Yethiraj's research will help in obtaining a molecular level
understanding of these systems. ▓@¥ ─} Ì¨╠f(DT 'µ ¦M     ı╬i .|7(┴ ═áZ5¯     P9
