Ceramics are being considered increasingly for high temperature structural
applications, as bearing surfaces and as cutting toolds. The current limitations
are strength and fracture toughness. This project explores a novel technique,
namely, plasm sintering ceramics, in particular of SiC and Si3 N4.
