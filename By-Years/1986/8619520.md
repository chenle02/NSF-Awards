This research is aimed at developing an improved understanding of surface
acoustic wave (SAW) microsensors for gas detection. The potential performance of
the proposed sensor is in the range of parts per billion to parts per trillion.
The proposed sensor will use twin SAW delay lines, and it will measure gas
concentration as a function of the frequency shift between the reference delay
line and the delay line of the test sensor containing a selectively sorbent
film. The interdisciplinary research effort will include development of the
theory, design, fabrication, and testing of SAW devices, and the physics and
chemistry of surfaces needed to realize the potential of this type of sensor.
