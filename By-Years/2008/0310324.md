The CD-ROM (Continental Dynamics of the Rocky Mountains) collaborative
investigation was originally designed to understand the tectonic evolution of
the lithosphere of the southern Rocky Mountains. The first phase of the CD-ROM
project has produced some very interesting and important results which promise
new understanding of continental evolution in the western US. In order to
realize the full potentlal of Phase I, this award will allow the Principal
Investigator to hire a post-doc who will work with him to complete the analysis
and synthesis of the Phase I results.
