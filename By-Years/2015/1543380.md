Interest in the reduced alkalinity of high latitude waters under conditions of
enhanced CO2 uptake from the atmosphere have been the impetus of numerous recent
studies of bio-stressors in the polar marine environment. The project seeks to
improve our understanding of the variance of coastal Southern Ocean carbonate
species (CO2 system), its diurnal and inter-annual variability, by acquiring
autonomous, high frequency observations from an Antarctic coastal mooring(s).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A moored observing system co-located within the existing
Palmer LTER array will measure pH, CO2 partial pressure, temperature, salinity
and dissolved oxygen with 3-hour frequency in this region of the West Antarctic
Peninsula continental shelf. Such observations will help estimate the dominant
physical and biological controls on the seasonal variations in the CO2 system in
coastal Antarctic waters, including the sign, seasonality and the flux of the
net annual air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide. The Palmer LTER site is
experiencing rapid ecological change in the West Antarctic Peninsula, a region
that is warming at rates faster than any other region of coastal Antarctica.
