0203207&lt;br/&gt;Mueller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Mexico award will
support Dr. Peter Mueller of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center, in a research collaboration with Dr. Andres Christen of CIMAT in
Guanajuato, Mexico. The researchers intend to work on sequential design
approaches in the context of sampling designs for estimating species diversity
and for inference about areas of high habitat potential. Appropriate probability
models for these applications will involve optimal sequential design strategies,
using a hybrid strategy of reduced action spaces and Monte Carlo
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborators will bring complementary
skills to the project with the Mexican collaborators contributing expertise in
inference for biodiversity, and the U.S. collaborators contributing research
focus and experience in simulation-based optimal Bayesian design. Both
investigators also have extensive research experience in Bayesian data analysis,
modeling, and simulation. The involvement of graduate students will broaden the
basis of the collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;
