This award supports the creation of an REU Site in computational astrophysics at
the University of California-Santa Cruz (UCSC). Students will principally be
recruited from Hartnell, Cabrillo, Monterrey Peninsula and De Anza Community
Colleges, where the main selection criteria will be outstanding academic
accomplishments and promise of future achievement. The selected interns will
work closely with mentors at UCSC and will take part in an intensive eight-week
introduction to astrophysical research methods and tools with an emphasis on
cosmological simulations. The overall goal of the program is not to solely train
astrophysicists but to utilize astrophysical simulations as an exciting medium
for imparting a broad array of scientific skills to the
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site will also increase the retention
and graduation rates for students enrolled in two-year colleges through inquiry-
based learning of concepts related to astronomy and planetary sciences, using
state-of-art astrophysical simulations as a common pillar. Through a
comprehensive program of research instruction, mentoring, workshops, and support
programs at UCSC, students will develop additional skills to advance their
educations and careers. The REU Site will also develop a Family Astronomy Night
lecture series at the partnering diversity-serving institutions, with the dual
aims of communicating astronomy to a wide audience, and ensuring that parents of
REU students can support their child's academic success.
