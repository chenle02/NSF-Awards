9317464 Cox Stochastic models and methodologies for statistical inference will
be developed in the context of modern instrumentation- intensive
experimentation. Bayesian, likelihood-based, semi- and non-parametric methods
will be investigated for prediction, calibration, testing and constructing
confidence intervals. Efficient and numerically stable computational algorithms
will be developed and statistical properties will be investigated both
theoretically and via computer experimentation. Much modern science relies on
instrumentation-intensive experimentation. With instrument-generated data, the
problem may be prediction of responses for new inputs or untried experimental
conditions, or calibration of the responses for the test settings, or
understanding which components of the response bear a scientific relationship to
the input variables. A variety of processes may influence each observed
response: the simplest is simple random error, other include deliberate or
accidental censoring, and the limitations due the precision of the measuring
instrument. Proper, efficient and valuable inferences require statistical models
and inferential methodologies with correct understandings of all these
processes.
