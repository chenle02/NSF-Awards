Interdisciplinary and collaborative training in the applied biosciences is
increasing enrollment, retention, and graduation in STEM fields by targeted
outreach and recruitment of students for bioinformatics, biotechnology, and
biochemistry. Scholarship support is being provided for traditionally
underrepresented students and a Complementary Learning Program (CLP) is
providing academic support for bioscience and other STEM majors. The impact of
the project is being assessed by comparing retention and graduation rates for
CLP participants and non-participants and tracking STEM enrollment and retention
rates among minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The merits of the project
include the use of group learning environments and exposure to scientific
applications in biotechnology and bioinformatics to increase student learning
outcomes and persistence in STEM majors. This project is adapting best practices
in undergraduate education, including the concepts of Supplemental Instruction
and the model of Learning Organizations by Senge, and implementing them within
an interdisciplinary curriculum.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is having a
broad impact by (1) increasing the number of students graduating in STEM,
particularly in bioinformatics, biotechnology, and biochemistry; (2) increasing
awareness of STEM research and employment opportunities; (3) increasing
awareness of bioinformatics and biotechnology among high school students; and
(4) expanding STEM enrollment for underrepresented populations. The
dissemination plan includes sharing project results in presentations at
scientific meetings and education conferences, preparing manuscripts for
submission to scientific and educational journals, and submitting materials for
inclusion in the National Science Digital Library (NSDL).&lt;br/&gt;
