Duke University will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site
located at the Duke Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, NC. The program supports
internships for 9 students each summer who conduct independent research projects
during a 10-week research program that includes seminars in marine sciences,
field trips and a series of workshops. Students will live in Marine Laboratory
dormitories and take their meals in the dining hall. Students will have a choice
of advisors in the general research areas of (1) sensory physiology, ecology and
behavior, (2) molecular biology and genetics, and (3) coastal and estuarine
physical processes. Throughout the program there will be sessions on safety,
scientific ethics, scientific writing, oral and poster presentations, and
graphics skills, graduate school and non-academic science careers. The final
week will involve completion of a scientific manuscript on the student's
research project and a final oral presentation. Co-curricular activities include
a Marine Laboratory-sponsored seminar program, participation in selected field
trips. The proposed REU is organized to train students to frame scientific
research questions, to design and undertake laboratory and field work to address
these research questions, and to develop the skills to communicate the results
of their research.
