The proposal is a request for funds to help support students and young
scientists from U.S. institutions that otherwise could not afford to attend the
2003 Particle Accelerator Conference (PAC'03). The conference will take place
from May 12-16, 2003 in Portland, Oregon. This conference is the 20th in the
biennial series. The conference will focus upon new developments in the science,
technology and use of accelerators. Its purpose is to provide an opportunity for
communication among accelerator scientists, engineers and others concerned with
accelerator applications.
