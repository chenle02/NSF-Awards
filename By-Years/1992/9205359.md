A number of research projects in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics,
Oregon State University, depend on the use of analytical sedimentation methods.
These include studies of the structure, stability, and assembly of chromatin
(K.E. van Holde): studies of the structure, evolution, and function of
hemocyanins (K.I. Miller, K.E. van Holde): investigators of association between
enzymes involved in protein phosphorylation (S.R. Anderson); and multi-enzyme
complexes involved in biosynthesis of DNA precursors (C.K. Mathews). The
laboratory of Dr. van Holde has maintained, and steadily used for many years a
Beckman Model E. analytical ultracentrifuge. This instrument is both obsolete
and decrepit. Fortunately for our future research, the Beckman Instrument
Company has just come out with a radically new analytical ultracentrifuge
design. This instrument will not only meet the present needs of our department,
but will allow kinds of experiments hitherto impossible. This proposal requests
funds for such an instrument. As a group that has been a leader in the
utilization and development of ultracentrifuge techniques, we are in a position
to make maximum use of such a facility.
