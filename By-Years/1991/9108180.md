This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program and the National
Facilities and Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at
Oregon State University acquire a Nd:YAG tunable dye laser system. The laser
will be used in research projects aimed at 1) Optical Studies of New Solids and
2) Nonlinear Raman Spectroscopy. Raman Spectroscopy is concerned with
vibrational and rotational transitions in molecules. The information obtained
sometimes complements that obtained from an infrared study and provides valuable
structural information. Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy with near-infrared
excitation provides a powerful solution to problems of high background
fluorescene or sample photodegradation or photolability and enhanced signal-to-
noise quality. Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in studies of condensed-
phase chemical and biomolecular systems.
