This project involves an integrated, multi-disciplinary investigation to
quantify how the deep continental crust and uppermost mantle respond to
extension, and to thus establish how large horizontal strains of the lithosphere
relate to vertical motions controlled by isostasy. The principal investigators
plan to use the "natural experiment" of a large strain gradient in the uppermost
part of the lithosphere associated with the abrupt boundary between highly
extended terrain and a tectonically stable block. They have chosen the western
margin of the Colorado Plateau to study. It is ideally suited for accomplishing
their research objectives for several reasons: (1) the transition is
particularly abrupt here; (2) the geologic setting indicates a simple pre-
extensional crustal structure; (3) it has a well-understood large- scale
extensional kinematic history; (4) the large inland waterway of Lake Mead
provides a unique environment in which to perform deep geophysical studies that
transect the boundary in precisely the location where geological studies place
bounds on crustal uplift during extension. They propose to integrate geological
and geochronologic studies, "marine" multi-channel seismic reflection profiling
in the lake itself, integrated with land-based recordings on an array on three-
component seismometers to provide control on seismic velocity structure and to
develop tomographic images of the region which, together with gravity modeling
will allow them to unravel the kinematics and dynamics of the lithosphere's
response to severe extensional strain.
