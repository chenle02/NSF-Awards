In spite of the large body of work on invasive, in situ medical devices, there
is very little research to draw from in the area of non-invasive devices. The
proposed research plans to develop a non-invasive instrument to do blood panels
based on optical imaging techniques. The approach to this development will be by
trying to characterize blood cells through the skin, using optical imaging
techniques with coherent, visible light. One possibility would be using
interferometric techniques using pulsed lasers.
