Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wikis, known as collaborative
knowledge building environments, are being used to facilitate computer mediated
collaboration among undergraduate students working in project-based settings. As
educational technology becomes an integral part of the instructional engineering
landscape and distance education becomes accepted practice, understanding how
students learn engineering becomes intertwined with understanding how computer
mediated communication helps and hinders learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Pedagogical Wiki project is creating a novel framework for assessing and
scaffolding collaborative learning within Wiki environments. Research being
undertaken includes (a) studying student adoption and interaction in new and
ongoing Wiki-based engineering courses, and comparing Wiki adoption in non-
engineering (education) courses;(b) developing instructional assessment tools
based on discourse analysis and course topic ontology for qualitatively
evaluating student Wiki interactions; and (c) identifying scaffolding
opportunities, such as topic-based material sharing, to promote student
engagement and communication. Activity Theory is being used as a framework to
study Wiki adoption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, a key component of this
work lies in the new discourse and topic-based instruments that enable
instructors and educational researchers to better assess student learning within
Wiki environments. Qualitative as well as quantitative metrics are being
developed, some with respect to the particular domains being studied. The
combined use of new natural language processing techniques and traditional
instruments to study Wiki adoption in an engineering context contributes to an
understanding of how students learn engineering in a collaborative, "real-world"
medium. Codifying best practices for computer mediated collaboration is
impacting the way engineering is being taught.
