Ilan Benjamin of the University of California in Santa Cruz is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in his continuing research on
liquid/liquid and liquid/vapor interfaces. He employs equilibrium and non-
equilibrium molecular dynamics computer simultions to consider two specific
aspects of these interfaces. The first involves a study of ionic dissociation
and associated charge shift reactions, while the second examines molecular
rotations at these interfaces.

The systems that Dr. Benjamin is studying will lead to insights that will
potentially have a broad impact on other areas within chemistry, such as
electrochemistry, as well as other areas of science, such as biology and
environmental science. Also, Dr. Benjamin is working with scientists who are
examining these systems experimentally, so his theoretical insights and
predictions are likely to have an effect on the types of experiments which will
be carried out by others.
