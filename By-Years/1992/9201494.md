Loeb will continue his work in applying nonstandard models to measure theory,
potential theory, and stochastic processes. This approach uses measure spaces
defined on nonstandard point sets. These spaces make finite combinatorial
methods available in research on infinite probability spaces. Loeb will combine
this measure theory with the theory of nonstandard hulls. He also will continue
his work on representing measures and ideal boundaries in potential theory. This
research project is in the area of nonstandard analysis. This subject arises
from the attempt to develop the standard topics of analysis, including
integration and differentiation, based on a nonstandard model for the real
numbers. In the nonstandard model, one has the notion of "infinitely small"
numbers which formalize the intuitive notions behind the concept of limit. This
formal construct often leads to greater combinatorial efficiency.
