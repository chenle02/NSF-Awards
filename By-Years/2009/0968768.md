This project seeks to advance a pore-scale micromechanical modeling framework
for quantifying capillary-induced intergranular stress in unsaturated soils.
Focus is placed on refining a statistical upscaling methodology used to
differentiate portions of the pore network partially filled with water in the
form of interparticle liquid bridges and portions of the pore network completely
filled with water in the form of saturated pockets. A corresponding capillary
stress function may be computed from relatively simple measurements of the soil-
water characteristic curve, quantified over the complete range of pore water
saturation, and cast into conventional effective stress formulations for
saturated soil behavior. Specific objectives are to refine the modeling
framework for capturing generalized pore geometries, account for surface
adsorption effects in fine-grained materials, and account for wetting-drying
hysteresis effects. Laboratory measurements of water retention behavior,
particle and pore morphology, shear strength, tensile strength, and small-strain
dynamic behavior will be used to evaluate the model performance. Education and
outreach activities designed to stimulate graduate and undergraduate research,
diversity, and more effective implementation of unsaturated soil mechanics into
practice are integrated with the research plan. Improved basic understanding of
the pore-scale forces and processes that govern unsaturated soil behavior is
expected to yield insight into problems in geotechnical engineering practice
that may occur under unsaturated soil conditions, including precipitation-
induced landsliding, foundation and excavation stability, and the dynamic
response of compacted earthworks.
