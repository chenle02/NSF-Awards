The proposal seeks to develop and optimize a novel approach for detection of a
blood borne marker (Troponin I) associated with cardiovascular disease. This
biomarker has been shown to have predictive value in diagnosis of myocardial
infarctions. Therefore, it is important to monitor such biomarker rapidly and
onsite - either in the first responder vehicle or in the emergency room. This
proposal addresses the need for rapid detection of troponin by simplifying
traditional sandwich immunoassay/ELISA used for analysis of this biomarker. This
simplified assay will use just one antibody/one step for detection of troponin
and will involve a novel mutant antibody oriented on the surfaces of the
biosensor in a controlled manner. Troponin binding to this to this fluorescently
labeled antibody will result in the change of fluorescence intensity. Successful
completion of this project may lead to future development of biosensor for
rapid, point of care diagnosis of myocardial infarctions.
