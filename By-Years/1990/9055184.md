The Ohio State University will continue an 8-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Mathematics for 57 students entering grades 9-12. Activities in
discrete mathematics and number theory will provide a basis for development of
reasoned argument. The project will include visits by mathematicians and
scientists working "in the field."
