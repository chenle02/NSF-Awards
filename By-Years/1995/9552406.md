PR 00681 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Geosciences Title: Improvement of
Undergraduate Education in Geoscience and Engineering Through the Acquisition of
New Subsurface Exploration Technology The ground-penetrating radar system (GPR)
in this proposal is being used to establish an inquiry-oriented, hands-on
approach to educating undergraduates. The equipment is an integral part of a new
course in environmental geophysics that allows students to apply scientific
concepts and state-of-the-art technology to geological, engineering and
environmental problems. This course is intended to teach upper-level
undergraduate students how to ask questions, collect appropriate data and how to
interpret that data in a meaningful way, in short, train students to think
scientifically. In addition, GPR is used to demonstrate the practical utility of
geophysical measurements to first and second year undergraduate geology and
engineering majors through real time visualization of familiar shallow sub-
surface structures.
