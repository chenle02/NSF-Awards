This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program at Oregon State University (OSU). The program will provide 20
students with a 10-week active learning experience each summer for five years,
for a total of 100 students over the duration of the program. Each summer, ten
interns will work with scientists from the Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC)
in Newport, Oregon, and ten interns will work at the OSU main campus in
Corvallis with mentors from the College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences
(CEOAS). The major field for this REU site is broadly defined as marine science,
ranging from marine and estuarine biology and ecology (at HMSC) through the
physical sciences (marine aspects of physics, geology, and climate at CEOAS) to
provide a diverse range of undergraduate research opportunities and faculty
mentors. The major objectives of the REU program are to i) provide students with
the opportunity to experience research in marine science and an understanding of
its interdisciplinary nature; ii) provide students with a unique educational
opportunity and exposure to a wide range of marine science; and iii) increase
participation in and access to marine science for under-represented groups and
students lacking access to STEM research. Interns have directed research
projects, a required report and oral presentation, and are encouraged to present
at regional or national meetings. Additional activities include seminars,
fieldwork, interaction with graduate students and related intern programs,
career development training, scientific ethics discussions, and exchanges to
learn about other interdisciplinary research conducted in Oregon's diverse
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.
