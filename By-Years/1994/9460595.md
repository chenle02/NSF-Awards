Silane is a toxic, pyrophoric gas which is used in large quantities (&gt;150,000
lbs/yr) by the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Advanced Technology
Materials (ATMI) is a world leader in the development of scrubbers, purifiers,
and delivery systems for hazardous gases. In the proposed Phase I program ATMI
will work with the University of Wisconsin to determine the feasibility of
generating silane in a point-of-use fashion from nonhazardous precursors. The
precursors are specifically designed to allow both generation of high purity
silane and recycling of the chemical byproducts. The availability of a silane
generation system would represent a major enhancement to the environmental
safety and health of semiconductor fabrication facilities and the communities in
which they are located. In the Phase II program ATMI will develop large scale
synthetic procedures for the precursors and will build a prototype generator
which will be used to grow high purity silicon. This will lead to commercial
introduction of the system in Phase III.
