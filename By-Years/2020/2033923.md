As a result of the COVID-19 virus, many states are looking to rapidly switch
from in-person voting to postal voting (also called vote-by-mail or VBM), in
order to reduce the infection risks to voters that might come from in-person
voting. Among the many challenges of increased use of VBM, commercial ballot
printing services have limited capacity and will be unable to scale to support
the surge in demand they will face. To mitigate this problem, VotingWorks, a
non-profit, is developing an open-source VBM solution called VxMail, targeting
small- to medium-sized counties. VxMail will use commercial bulk-mailing
services as well as off-the-shelf hardware for printing ballots, slicing
envelopes, and scanning the ballots to provide a secure, affordable, and highly
scalable VBM solution. If VxMail is successful, it will have a large impact on
the practice of voting in the November 2020 general election, by making VBM
available to more voters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VotingWorks faces a variety of
engineering challenges to ensure that VxMail will be accurate, including dealing
with stray marks from voters, and damage that might occur to ballots in the
postal mail. To address this, VotingWorks is partnering with a team from Rice
University with experience in human-computer interaction and elections. This
research will recruit thousands of participants, across the country, to fill out
test ballots, yielding a large corpus of real-world examples. VotingWorks will
use these ballots to validate and improve its scanning algorithms. Rice will use
these ballots to measure votersâ€™ accuracy at filling out the ballots and
following the return instructions. With multiple rounds of these experiments,
Rice and VotingWorks will be able to identify and remedy deficiencies in VxMail,
leading toward better voter experiences and more accurate tabulation
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
