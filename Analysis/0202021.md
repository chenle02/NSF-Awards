ABSTRACT

The proposed research will deal with several problems in harmonic analysis some
of which are also of interest in ergodic and number theory. The emphasis is on a
combination of techniques from analysis and of other fields such as analytic
number theory and singularity theory. The objects of study are related to
diophantine equations, maximal averages over subvarieties and their discrete
analogues, polynomial type ergodic theorems as well as oscillatory integrals and
integral operators with degeneracies. A set of problems are discrete in nature,
where mapping properties of operators related to classical exponential sums play
a crucial role. Tough these appear as discrete analogues of well known
constructs in analysis, they in turn can yield to new insights both in ergodic
and number theory. Another direction is to study problems related to oscillatory
integrals with degeneracies, where the usual "curvature" type conditions are
replaced by assumptions on the singularities or only assuming genericity.

During roughly the past decade the scope of harmonic analysis has been vastly
extended by incorporating methods from seemingly different fields of
mathematics. This has led to an essentially deeper understanding of basic
partial differential equations under periodic conditions (such as the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics and the Wave equation), new phenomena
in ergodic theory meaning that measurements do not have to be taken regularly
but only very rarely to understand physical processes. The proposed research
will concentrate on these types of problems Where a combination of methods of
different fields of mathematics seems to be needed.
