Plastics, a form of polymeric materials, break down after repeated use. One of
the causes of this break-down is the rupture of chemical bonds of the polymers.
Professor Esser-Kahn examines methods of using force or pressure to generate new
bonds in plastic materials. These materials will be capable of capturing energy
from an applied force or pressure and using it to initiate the growth of a
polymer chain or the formation of a polymer network to strengthen the material.
This project includes research and educational components to impact fundamental
knowledge about polymer materials across the disciplines of chemistry and
engineering. Outreach entails summer research training of high-school
interns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jointly supported by the Macromolecular,
Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry and the
Polymer Program of the Division of Materials Research, the Esser-Kahn research
group is developing novel approaches that use the reaction of piezo-electric
particles as a method to generate new bonds in polymeric materials. In one
direction, the project investigates the piezo-reduction of a Cu(II) precursor to
a Cu(I) activator that initiates the growth of polymer chain via atom-transfer
radical polymerization. In a second direction, the piezo-generated Cu(I) is used
to catalyze azide-alkyne cyclo-addition, creating new bonds between click
chemistry handles. The research activities include 1) generation of novel
reactions using piezo-mechanical reduction, 2) the growth of new polymer chains
and types using piezo-ATRP, 3) the crosslinking of polymer gels using piezo-
electric reactivity; and 4) the study and development of piezo-responsive
materials and their mechanical characterization.
