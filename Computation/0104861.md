This proposal addresses a direct numerical reconstruction algorithm for the 2-D
inverse conductivity problem. The 2-D inverse conductivity problem is to
determine an unknown conductivity distribution on a bounded region from
knowledge of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. Physically, knowledge of the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map is tantamount to knowing the current density
distribution on the boundary of the region resulting from any given voltage
distribution applied on the boundary. The problem is modeled mathematically by
the generalized Laplace's equation with the conductivity as an unknown
parameter. In 1995 A. Nachman proved that knowledge of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
map uniquely determines the conductivity in the interior of a smooth bounded
region in 2-D. An important feature of Nachman's proof is that it outlines a
direct method for solving for the conductivity without iteration. The proof is
based on techniques of inverse scattering and the d-bar method, which is a
method of solution for scattering problems, not a numerical technique. The
primary goals of this proposal are to solve the inverse conductivity problem
numerically using the d-bar method, develop a practical reconstruction algorithm
for medical applications, and to test the implementation on physically relevant
conductivity distributions.

The 2-D inverse conductivity problem has applications in geophysics,
nondestructive testing, and a medical imaging technique known as electrical
impedance tomography (EIT). One application of EIT is the imaging of heart and
lung function in real time. In this application, electrodes are placed around
the circumference of the patient's torso, current is applied on the electrodes
and the resulting voltage is measured. The resulting 2-D inverse conductivity
problem is then solved numerically to reconstruct how the electricity passes
through the interior and to form a cross-sectional image of the patient's chest.
Other applications include the detection of breast cancer, monitoring for
internal bleeding, and the diagnosis of pulmonary embolis (a blood clot in the
lung). The proposed approach represents a new class of image reconstruction
algorithm for the EIT problem. Work thus far has indicated that the algorithm
yields more accurate images than the existing fast algorithms, since it solves
the full set of equations rather than a a more simplified version of the
problem. This is particularly important in medical applications such as breast
cancer detection, where the measured values distinguish between the presence of
a tumor or a benign cyst. The algorithm will be tested on real data and compared
to existing algorithnms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
