Mapping Polygranular Parallel Programs (P3) to Shared, Heterogeneous, High
Performance Reconfigurable Computers (HPRC)

Abstract

The proposed project aims at the development of performance models and mapping
algorithms as the theoretical foundation of a design infrastructure to support
polygranular parallel programs executing on shared, heterogeneous, High
Performance Reconfigurable Computers (HPRC). The project will develop a
mathematical framework for characterizing the performance of polygranular
parallel applications executing on HPRC systems. Moreover, the project will
investigate computationally efficient approaches for optimally mapping
applications to HPRC systems, providing dramatic improvement in design
automation efficiency for HPRC and related computational platforms. Given the
emergence of both embedded systems and the Grid as the basis for ubiquitous
computing, the project will specifically address issues related to polygranular
parallel application execution in a shared, heterogeneous environment.

This project addresses the area of emerging computer systems architectures with
the broader objective of providing the theoretic performance modeling and
mapping infrastructure necessary to effectively exploit current and emerging
hardware platforms with polygranular parallel programs. Hence, the program
supports national efforts to meet next-generation computational needs with the
grid and with embedded systems including system-on-chip. The computational
capabilities of HPRC platforms promise significant performance and cost
improvements for a spectrum of problem domains, such as image processing and
graph algorithms.
