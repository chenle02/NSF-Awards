Cryptography and cryptographic protocols have become a key element of
information systems, protecting data and communications to ensure
confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data. While most symmetric key
systems have relatively modest mathematical requirements, asymmetric or public
key systems, as well as cryptographic protocols, have become increasingly
mathematically sophisticated. Such systems rely for their security on the
difficulty of specific mathematical problems such as integer factorization and
the modular discrete logarithm problem. No rigorous mathematical proof of
security has ever been given for any of these systems. The difficulty of these
problems is usually established anecdotally through frequent and unsuccessful
attempts by specialists to provide computationally efficient solutions to them.
Indeed, several problems thought to be very difficult have recently been shown
to be less intractable than previously believed. Furthermore, the possibility of
quantum computing becoming practical would change this picture dramatically. If
realized, most of the problems on which the security of public key cryptosystems
rely drop from exponential complexity to polynomial, rendering currently
deployed cryptographic systems useless. While the likelihood of this occurring
in the short term is remote, this is an exciting area of research which may well
lead to revolutionary advances in computation and secure information
communication. This special meeting will attempt to make progress on these and
other related problems.



The program will take place at the Fields Institute, which will mount an
intensive program on Cryptography during the period June - December 2006. This
program will engage and stimulate interaction between the cryptographic and
mathematical communities. NSF funding will enable young U.S. researchers to
participate in this program, and in doing so it will expose young researchers to
a wide range of problems at the interface between mathematics and cryptographic
applications. It will increase the degree of collaboration between
cryptographers and theoreticians in attacking the important problems at the
boundaries between the fields, and will impact on both cryptographic theory and
practice.
