A robot vision laboratory is being developed that will become part of the
curriculum for robot vision and robots in manufacturing. The laboratory is a
collaborative effort that will teach undergraduate students in the electrical
engineering and manufacturing engineering technology programs the principles and
the applications of robot vision. The laboratory consists of five workstations
involving an image processing unit, a camera, a TV monitor, a personal computer,
and a robot. The interdisiplinary project will help create an environment for
interdepartmental cooperation to help students master the concepts in the design
of digital control systems, digital signal processing, and manufacturing system
integration. This project is being matched by an amount greater than the award.
