9361278 Murphy Power system stabilizers are used to prevent oscillations induced
by generators on the utility network. This is typically done by installing
instruments at the terminals of the generator. As lines become more heavily
loaded, and the generators are run at higher outputs, system stability becomes a
more critical issue. Without proper stabilization, generator outputs must be
reduced and/or line loadings reduced to keep the system form becoming unstable,
resulting in a power outage. The use of remote input stabilizers based on phasor
measurement techniques will result in increased reliability, and enormous dollar
savings is terms of deferred plant and transmission construction. ***
