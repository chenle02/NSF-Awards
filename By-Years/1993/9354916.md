Expansion of Ph.D. training within the Department of Biology at Howard
University specifically in the area of plant biology is proposed. The department
has a significant group of botany faculty which reflect a broad range of
research areas. This department (and the University as a whole) has made
significant contributions in the area of minority graduate education in science
over the years. Also, Howard University has a rich history of academic
excellence and serving as a leader among minority institutions. Given these
considerations, further development of a consortium network with sister
undergraduate institutions is described here: the purpose of this arrangement is
to direct talented students toward graduate education and the specific area of
plant biology. This project has the potential for unmatched impact in producing
minority plant scientists.
