The investigator would investigate the role of context in critical thinking
(making sure an author's points are clearly backed by evidence) across popular
media. What are the needs of everyday critical thinkers and how can their needs
be fulfilled? It will develop tools and training based on this research and
train parents and teachers on the use of these tools. Then it will evaluate
whether participation affects user practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher
will examine the personal and social impact of scientific information from three
studies of evolutionary science as perceived by college students and adults. It
will concentrate on public understanding of the human genome project and human
learning strategies. The project will use web-based forums as a vehicle for
investigating these understandings. The interactions of teachers and students
with the Web will be evaluated to determine whether informative tools that
support student strategies and reflective exercises are needed. &lt;br/&gt;
