Adaptive information systems promise to augment human information seeking by
cooperating with users to manage the cognitive burden of the search. Highly
interactive (hypertext) systems for brows- ing databases can promote natural,
low-cognitive load search strategies. Still lacking, however, is a scientific
basis for designing user-oriented organizations of data or user-oriented views
of database content. This research seeks to test aspects of a theory of
information seeking which can explain users' interactions with machines to find
information. In particular, through experimental analysis of such interactions
it examines users' development and application of mental models of hypertext
systems employed for that purpose. The research will contribute to an emerging
theory of information seeking in electronic environments, guide designers of
adaptive information systems, and facilitate the development of methods and
materials for human information seeking.
