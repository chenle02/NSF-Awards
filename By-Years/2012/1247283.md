This project proposes to develop and study an intervention with 9th and 4th
graders, with the goal of promoting motivation for science learning. The
research is based on theories of growth vs. fixed mindsets. The interventions
focus on promoting growth mindsets in students regarding science learning, with
units on brain plasticity (the brain changes as a result of effort and
experience) and scientists' struggle stories (science is not just done with
little effort by geniuses). Delivery of the information will be through multi-
media materials. The research design involves random assignment of students
within classroom to treatment and control conditions to assess the potential
impact of the interventions.

With the U.S. trailing many countries in science literacy, understanding both
the psychological obstacles to better performance and pedagogical solutions to
these obstacles is of the utmost importance to ensuring improved science
outcomes. This research will address this issue by developing and systematically
testing interventions available to educators to support science learning in the
classroom that focuses on changing children's beliefs about what success in
science requires (effort vs being innately gifted).
