This action funds Ravi Kappiyoor of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University to conduct a research project, entitled "Understanding the effects of
stress on cell locomotion, " during the summer of 2012 at Kyoto University in
Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Shoji Takada.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is as follows. Actin filaments
are used by cells for locomotion. In order to generate force, these filaments
add monomers to one end (polymerization) and remove monomers from the other end
(depolymerization) resulting in tank-tread like motion. Unfortunately, the exact
nature of this polymerization and depolymerization is unknown. This research
project aims to better characterize the role of mechanical stresses on
polymerization dynamics.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
