This research concerns numerical simulation of two phase flow relevant to
fluidized beds. The aim is to develop a predictive tool for flow patterns and
voidage variations in circulating fluidized beds. Time average and transient
solids distributions will be measured and compared to the calculated patters to
guide development of the models. Circulatory fluidized beds are being considered
for new reactors in the petro chemical fields and for power generation by coal
combustion. Better understanding of their hydrodynamics is needed for design,
scale-up, and anticipation of possible problems such as erosion of internal
structures or inadequate gas-solids contacting.
