Recently, the idea of simultaneous activation (or transparent coexistence) of
secondary and primary nodes is being explored. Under this new paradigm,
secondary nodes are solely responsible for canceling their interference with the
primary nodes so that the primary nodes do not feel the presence of the
secondary nodes. Although this new paradigm has the potential of offering much
greater spectrum efficiency and network capacity than those under the existing
interference avoidance paradigm, it is still in its infancy and current results
are only limited to very simple network settings. The goal of this project is to
make a fundamental advance in the transparent coexistence paradigm for multi-hop
secondary networks. Specifically, this project aims to study the following
important problems in the context of multi-hop networks: (1) developing new
analytical models for the transparent coexistence paradigm; (2) exploring
performance bounds and theoretical limits for multi-hop secondary networks; and
(3) developing distributed algorithms for multi-hop secondary networks that can
offer performance approaching that of a global optimal
solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings from this project are expected to
make a timely contribution to the research community by removing some
fundamental barriers associated with the transparent coexistence paradigm. An
important educational activity of this project is to develop new cross-
disciplinary course materials for wireless networking, particularly efficient
sharing of the radio spectrum. This project also has plans to involve
undergraduates and under-represented students in wireless networking research.
