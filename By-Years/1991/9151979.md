The requested video equipment, lap-top computers, and software will improve the
curriculum of the Department of Psychology. Last year the psychology department
developed a computer laboratory facility that exposes introductory level
students to quantitative methods used in psychological research. Building upon
this foundation, the department will develop a comprehensive student research
facility and incorporate student research projects into the majority of it's
core courses. The research equipment requested in this proposal will allow
undergraduate (both major and non-major) students to receive experience
conducting psychological research. Each research project is based on a published
study, and is designed to coincide with lecture material. The research projects
will highlight important empirical methods used within the area of the core
course. Because of the designs of these projects, many of which will be
conducted in field settings, the equipment must be flexible, portable, and
capable of capturing a range of complex human behaviors. For these reasons the
department believes the requested video camera/editing system, lap-top computers
and software is the most pedagogically effective means of meeting the
department's needs.
