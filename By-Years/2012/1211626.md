AST-1211626&lt;br/&gt;Wise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwarf galaxies provided the
majority of the ionizing photon budget during cosmic reionization, and in fact
recent observations have begun to reveal such galaxies. To understand these and
planned future observations, it is necessary, and timely, to construct realistic
models of high-redshift galaxies. This project will carry out cosmological
adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulations that focus on the
formation of the first galaxies and their evolution to the present-day in
varying large-scale environments. These simulations include radiative and
supernova feedback, a self-consistent transition to Population II star
formation, and self-regulation of star formation through radiation pressure.
They will resolve molecular clouds and stellar associations, and compute
radiation transport accurately using adaptive coupled ray tracing. Current
observations of high-redshift galaxies and nearby dwarf galaxies will help to
constrain the physical model. To make a direct connection to nearby dwarf
galaxies, simulations will be embedded in a larger volume to follow dwarf galaxy
evolution to the present-day and make predictions about their origin and
connection to the early universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Involved junior
researchers will gain expertise in a wide range of problems in cosmology and
astrophysics, numerical algorithms, high performance computing, and software
engineering. There will also be opportunities to tackle the challenging problem
of visualizing results from large multi-dimensional computer simulations. The
lead researcher will continue to integrate research activities into teaching in
K-12 schools and other public venues, as well as through online learning
environments.
