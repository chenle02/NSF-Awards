9408009 Whitham Recent studies have shown that the genetic and phenotypic
variation expressed by in plant hybrid zones has important effects on the
distribution of herbivorous insects, fungi, and birds. Hybrid zones can be
centers of insect species richness and abundance. This project continues a novel
study of the ecological genetics of cottonwoods hybrid zones in Arizona. The
investigators are documenting the insect community correlates of plant genotype
and making genetic maps of plant resistance and susceptibility traits. They are
using synthetic populations and common garden experiments to determine why
herbivores accumulate on some hybrids but not others. Finally, they are
establishing whether these interactions have affects on other members of the
riparian community. This research program is changing our view of the ecological
importance of hybrid plants in natural communities. The results of this research
have applicability in conservation biology, design of natural reserves, and,
potentially, forest and crop pest control.
