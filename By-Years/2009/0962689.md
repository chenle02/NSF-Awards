This U.S - Argentina Planning Visit proposal will support four senior
researchers and two graduate students from the U.S., under the direction of Dr.
Victoria Lawson of University of Washington, on two planning visits to Argentina
between May, 2010 and September, 2011. The project brings together an
interdisciplinary team of researchers in sociology, political theory, the law
and geography in Argentina, Norway and the U.S. The U.S. investigators will
collaborate intensively with colleagues from the University of Buenos Aires,
Argentina and from the University of Bergen, Norway as well as policy-makers in
the international arena. The latter is possible because all team members are
part of the Critical Global Poverty Studies network (CGPS) that forms the
intellectual backdrop and institutional platform for this research. In this
collaboration, researchers will investigate how middle class actors understand
and respond to poverty across the Americas as new forms of economic
globalization are transforming the economic position, identities and poverty
politics of middle class groups. The team will meet with Dr. Atilio Boron,
Professor of Political Theory, Dr. Susana Murillo, Professor of Social Sciences,
and Dr. Alberto Cimadamore, Professor of Political Science, all from the
University of Buenos Aires. The investigators plan to submit research proposals
to the National Science Foundation, Geography and Spatial Sciences Program and
the Norwegian Research Council.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contributes to
the development of educational and research capacity in Argentina and the U.S.
through its involvement of PhD students in both countries. The U.S. graduate
students are women from diverse economic backgrounds who will have an invaluable
educational opportunity, being involved in the creation of substantive research
and learning how to engage in international collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;
