Professor Charles E. Webster of the University of Memphis is supported by the
Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) Program in the Division of Chemistry to
develop computational methods to address mechanistic and structural details of
phosphoryl transfer enzymes and transition state analogues. The project focuses
on quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics computational analysis of several
potential species on the enzyme's reaction pathway. Collaborations with
experimentalists that are working with the target enzymes allow comparison with
experimentally derived data to produce a cyclic synergism between experiments
and theory. This research project has potential benefits for applications in
biocatalysis, including the rational design of inhibitors for phosphoryl
transfer enzymes, which play an important role in metabolic and other biological
reactions. The broader impacts involve an educational program to train all 66
high school chemistry teachers in Memphis through a series of workshops, and to
assist with curriculum development and refinement. This outreach effort benefits
several thousand students, including many minorities.
