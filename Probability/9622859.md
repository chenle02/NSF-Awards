Aldous A general methodology for the study of size-asymptotics of random finite
structures is to seek to establish, via the techniques of weak convergence
theory, existence of a limiting continuous-space structure. In this spirit, one
part of the proposal is to develop a new approach to the emergence of the giant
component in random graph theory, by representing limit component sizes as
excursion lengths in a Brownian-type process. This representation opens up a
relation between two well-studied but hitherto apparently unrelated areas of
probability theory. Other parts of the proposal include foundational work
relating to mixing times for Markov chains, and analysis of specific randomized
algorithms. As background, the study of matter aggregating into clusters is of
interest in many areas of science: polymers in physical chemistry, condensation
of raindrops in clouds, and formation of galaxies in the early universe, to name
just three examples. Models of clustering incorporating the effects of
randomness received some attention from physicists in the early and mid 1980s,
but faded out when the mathematical tools then available had been used to their
limits. The main part of this proposal concerns detailed study of one particular
model of this kind via sophisticated modern mathematical tools. It is hoped that
new tools to be developed under this proposal will be useful in at least some of
these scientific areas.
