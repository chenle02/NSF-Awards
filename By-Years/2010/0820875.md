High energy gamma rays probe the most extreme astrophysical environments
including those that produce the highest energy cosmic-ray particles. Most of
the discoveries in the TeV energy range have been made by imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) which have a few milli-steradian field of view and
~10% duty cycle. However, the Milagro observatory has demonstrated that a
detector with a wide field of view and nearly 100% duty cycle can discover new
sources of TeV gamma rays at energies between 10 and 100 TeV, and map the
diffuse emission from the plane of our Galaxy. The HAWC (High Altitude Water
Cherenkov) observatory builds on the experience and technology of Milagro to
make a second-generation high-sensitivity detector that would be capable of
continuously surveying the TeV sky for steady and transient sources from 100 GeV
to 100 TeV. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI award is to develop the HAWC
electronics and instrumentation by building a core array at high altitude. This
instrument will be developed by a collaboration from the US and Mexico, led by
the US team that built Milagro and pioneered the development of the water
Cherenkov technique for gamma-ray astronomy. It will be located near Sierra
Negra, Mexico, at an altitude of 4100m near existing infrastructure and
collaborating universities and will allow the development of Cherenkov detectors
and electronics at high altitude as a prelude to eventually building the entire
HAWC detector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond astrophysics, this will establish a
preeminent international scientific collaboration with particle physicists and
astrophysicists in Mexico. The collaboration will utilize this unique
opportunity to reach out to Hispanics as well as maintain the Milagro tradition
of providing strong scientific and educational opportunities for undergraduate
students, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows. &lt;br/&gt;
