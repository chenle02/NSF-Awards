A conference on Ocean-Atmosphere Energy Transport will be held at the California
Institute of Technology, November 5-7, 2009. The conference will bring together
distinguished experts in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences to assess the
current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of energy transfer between
regions in which the earth experiences a net energy gain from space, and those
where earth loses energy to space. Conference presentations will cover a range
of topics which will define and address outstanding questions in oceanic energy
transport, atmospheric energy transport, and the coupling between them. The
conference program consists of invited lectures by the leading scientists in the
field as well as contributed talks and posters.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this
grant support, students and postdocs interested in the dynamics of energy
transport and its role in the earth's climate system will be enabled to
participate in the conference.
