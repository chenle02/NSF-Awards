How people and animals learn about their environment is a major area of study
within psychobiology. The objective of Dr. Palya's research is to contribute to
the development of a model of behavior that would account for an organism's
increase in adaptation to the environment with increasing experience (the
"learning curve"), as well as accounting for a particular phenomenon observed in
many experiments using fixed-interval schedules of reinforcement. In such
experiments, performance of a specified action (or "response") is reinforced
only when a specified constant interval of time has elapsed since the last
occurrence of a reinforced response. Given practice with such a fixed-interval
schedule, animals or people often learn to make few responses early in the
interval and to respond at an increasing rate as the interval progresses,
apparently in anticipation of reinforcement at the end of the interval. In order
to test theoretical predictions about the distribution of responding within an
interfood interval, Dr. Palya will carry out experiments using pigeons
responding for food reinforcement. Dr. Palya will experimentally segment the
interfood interval into ten different, explicitly signaled periods. An overt
response will be required to present or remove each of the signals associated
with consecutive portions of the interfood interval. Dr. Palya predicts that the
initial portion (up to the midpoint) of the interval will be decreasingly
aversive, while the later portion of the interval will be increasingly
reinforcing. Dr. Palya's prediction is based on his extension of a widely used
mathematical model of learning, the Rescorla-Wagner model, which predicts only
the behavior that will occur the moment before food appears. If the extended
model correctly predicts the learning of the distribution of responding
throughout the inferfood interval, Dr. Palya's research will have contributed to
the goal of developing a general theory of learning and behavior.
