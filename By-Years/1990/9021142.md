Regulation and determination of cell fate are fundamental to development.
Identification of selector genes in Drosophila allows description of these
elusive phenomena in terms of gene expression. Expression of a particular
selector gene selects a particular pathway of development. Selector gene
expression must change when cells change their fate in response to environment
(regulation), whereas selector gene expression must be stably maintained when a
cell and its progeny are committed to a pathway of development (determined).
Expression of engrailed, a selector gene, commits cells to the posterior
compartment of a segment, but expression is not initially stable. Cell-cell
signalling in very young embryos appears to represent regulative control of
engrailed expression. Subsequently, engrailed expression appears to be
stabilized as it comes under the influence of two later tiers of control. As a
paradigm for the processes of regulation and determination, Dr. O'Farrell is
examining engrailed expression. He will define when and where determination of
engrailed expression occurs. He will explore the involvement of autoregulation
and candidate "maintenance genes" in the stabilization of engrailed expression.
He will map engrailed regulatory sequences that mediate regulative and
determinative programs of expression. From this base he will study the molecular
mechanisms of regulation and determination in development.
