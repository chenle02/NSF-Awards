This award provides support for purchase of a modern spectropolarimeter intended
to replace a 15 year-old instrument that is nearing the end of its useful
lifespan. The new instrument will be equipped to make simultaneous measurements
of circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence, and will also be equipped with
stopped flow capabilities. The instrument will permit measurements at short
wavelengths and over long time periods that are inaccessible with the existing
instrument. Seven research groups will use the instrument to conduct biophysical
studies on proteins, short peptides, nucleic acids, and natural products
isolated from organisms living in the Antarctic. In addition to its use in these
research projects, the spectropolarimeter will be used in two formal courses,
one at the senior undergraduate level and another at the graduate level. The
institution has a large undergraduate enrollment of underrepresented minorities,
and conducts an NSF-sponsored REU summer program targeted at students from
smaller institutions. Over 500 graduate students are currently enrolled in the
departments that have used the existing instrument. The instrument will be
available for use in both training and research by students at all levels.
