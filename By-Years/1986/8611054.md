This study is concerned with a global assessment of the performance of steel
building structures during the 1985 Mexico earthquake. The performance
evaluation is carried out by a classification of buildings according to
structural systems and height, a comprehensive damage survey, and a considerable
amount of analytical modeling which permits an assessment of structural response
with due consideration to the characteristics of the site soil conditions in
Mexico City. Approximately 10 buildings are used for analytical evaluation. From
the design information on these buildings, simplified analytical models are
developed for nonlinear dynamic analysis. The results of the analyses are used
to correlate predicted response with observed behavior. In this correlation,
praticular emphasis is placed on an evaluation of the P- effect and cumulative
damage effects. The goal of the project is to improve seismic design pratice for
steel buildings.
