This workshop will provide professional development opportunities for graduate
students and postdoctoral research associates affiliated with the Centers for
Chemical Innovation Program. Key aspects of this workshop include (1) learning
the elements of the innovation and translation process; (2) developing a
translation process related to their specific research; and (3) building
successful careers in the chemical
enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological solutions to many of the planet's
most pressing challenges can be provided by highly trained scientists through
transformative and innovative scientific research. The Centers for Chemical
Innovation (CCI) program has been developed to do just this in areas where
chemistry plays a leading role. &lt;br/&gt;
