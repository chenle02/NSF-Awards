This proposal is concerned with the mathematical problems of stochastic control
theory and multiple scattering of waves in random media. It is a product of
joint efforts of two known specialists in this area, Professors Chow and
Menaldi. The main research effort will be invested in the study of various
theoretical issues in the stochastic control problems. It is assumed that
dynamical process is subject to influence of random signals. The goal is to
determine a control function that optimizes a certain objective, expressed as a
function on process trajectories. The control is supposed to have an impulse
character. This is an idealized version of a physical situation where one can
observe abrupt changes inprocess trajectories, which can be thought of as
discontinuities, or jumps. Fo example, the inventory stocks in a warehouse may
be represented in this way, as they experience a jump in the value at the
delivery of new stock. The control of an impulse nature is usually represented
mathematically by Dirac distributions. The timings and masses of such impulses
are the control parameters that one wants to select in an optimal fashion.
