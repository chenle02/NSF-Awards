Dr. David White is Director of the Hancock Biological Station, which is
operated by Murray State University. This station is located along Kentucky
Lake, the largest reservoir in the southeast U.S., created near the confluences
of the Mississippi, Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers. The Station has been
recognized by the State of Kentucky as a Research Center of Excellence, and
Murray State has joined with eight other colleges and universities to create a
focal point for reservoir research. Dr. White proposes construction of two
dormitories and two cabins for visiting scientists at the Hancock Biological
Station. Construction of these four winterized residences would increase the
capacity of the Station by more than 20, adding significantly to the presence of
visiting researchers and students. Research on the ecology of reservoirs has
obvious and important implications for society. Hancock Biological Station is
currently a successful regional facility for student training and for some
recently initiated research projects on reservoirs. Institutional commitments to
the Station has increased its potential significantly, and it could develop into
a nationally significant research facility. The proposed visitor housing will
provide a critical mass of visiting investigators with access to the Station,
and the site's full potential should be expressed as a result.
