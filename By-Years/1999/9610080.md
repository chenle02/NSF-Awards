This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of California at Los
Angeles to acquire a Silicon Graphics Power Challenge L and four workstations.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: (1) theoretical studies of organic and biochemical reactions, (2)
developing new quantum molecular dynamics codes and studies of molecules and
reactions on surfaces, (3) development of new methods for fast and accurate
protein crystal structures, (4) studies of cluster quantum dynamics, and (5)
statistical mechanics for the study of polymers and fluids. A workstation
network of fast modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the
computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves
as a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
state-of-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in
state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
