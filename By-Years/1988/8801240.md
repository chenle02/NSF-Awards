This work is a renewal of NSF Grant ECS-8604354, for research in areas of
stochastic optimization and information theory, dynamic optimization and linear
programming. The work is based on the notion of "canonical bases" which was
developed by Professors Ben-Israel and Ben-Tal. Professors Ben-Israel and Ben-
Tal are well known scholars for their work in optimization theory and they have
shown progress in this effort. The University of Delaware continues to provide a
suitable environment for the research. An award in the form of a modest two-year
grant is highly recommended.
