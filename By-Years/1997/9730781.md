Calcium is a major dissolved species in seawater with a residence time of about
a million years. Its sources include rivers and hydrothermal fluids, as well as
small amounts via sediment diagenesis. Ca is also tied to the carbon cycle via
carbonate precipitation in the oceans. The PI proposes that detailed
measurements of Ca isotopic variations in present day Ca sources and sinks will
shed light on the details of the oceanic Ca cycle. Such data could then be used
to interpret past changes in Ca isotopic abundances, which would ultimately be
related to climatic variability and changes in global carbonate preservation and
temperature fluctuations. The PI has demonstrated the ability to make these
unique measurements with the high precision necessary to study Ca cycling, and
he proposes to make new measurements in existing samples of river water,
hydrothermal fluids and marine sediments and basalts. These data, together with
existing seawater results, would provide a signifcant advance in our
understanding of the oceanic Ca cycle.
