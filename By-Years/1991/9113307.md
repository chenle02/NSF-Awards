This proposal will support the training of graduate students in the areas of
mathematics and biology. The focus of the research area will be the dynamics of
heterogeneous ecological and evolutionary systems, with an emphasis on spatial
and temporal heterogeneity. The focus will be on deterministic and stochastic
models across broad organizational and temporal scales. Students will be
expected to gain expertise in either deterministic or stochastic mathematical
techniques, in computational methods and statistics, and in an area of
specialization in biology. Students may major in one of several biological
fields, with a formal minor in a mathematical field or they may major in one of
the mathematical fields, while undertaking field or laboratory research, and
satisfying the formal requirement for a biology minor. Students will be trained
through an integrated program, involving mathematicians, ecologists, and
evolutionary biologist with a demonstrated capacity to cross the boundaries
between their disciplines.
