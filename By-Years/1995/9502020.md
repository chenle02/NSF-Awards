9502020 Phillips This CAREER type grant is to improve the linkage between
material behavior at small scale lengths and macroscopic response. Recent
advances in the atomistic modeling of materials now permits direct calculation
of the constitutive models for problems that involve dislocation structure and
mobility changes associated with martensitic transformations. The educational
plan is to attempt to make specific courses more interesting and to help
advanced undergraduates appreciate the connection between material behavior at
different scale lengths. ***
