This study attempts to capitalize on the recent observation that very high
photoefficiencies can be obtained for the semiconductor-catalyzed oxidative
mineralization of trichloroethylene in the gas phase. A systematic study of the
dependence of the photoefficiency on vapor composition, nature and deployment of
photocatalyst, wavelength and intensity of radiation, and temperature is
conducted in bench-top fixed-bed reactors; the goal is to optimize the
photoefficiency and obtain information on the chemistry of the system. The study
will also be expanded to other compounds, including chloroform, methyl
chloroform, perchlorethylene, isooctane, and toluene. The phenomenon has great
potential as the basis of a cost- effective technology, suitable for retrofit,
for destroying volatile organic pollutants in systems for air or steam stripping
of polluted water or soil, ventilation of industrial or transportation systems,
and such highly polluting operations as painting and printing.
