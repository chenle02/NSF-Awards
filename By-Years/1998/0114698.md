MIT's Department of Materials Science and Engineering establishes a Summer
Institute in Materials Science and Materials Culture. The purpose of the Summer
Institute is to assist professors at liberal arts colleges in introducing
materials science and engineering to their undergraduate curricula. The Summer
Institute brings together MIT faculty, faculty from undergraduate liberal art
institutions, and MIT graduate students in a modular, case study format that
combines materials science and engineering with social science and humanities
fields. The design of the modules considers both the physical properties and
cultural dimensions of materials. Each module integrates laboratory experiences
in the processing and the chemical and microstructural analysis of the material
under consideration.

By teaching educators from liberal arts institutions, the project brings the
perspectives and methodologies of materials science and engineering to a much
broader and diverse audience than is usually present at engineering
institutions, thus broadening the educational base for materials science and
engineering.
