Abstract

Award: DMS-0103976 Principal Investigator: Frank Quinn

This project involves two distinct areas: 4-dimensional manifolds, and high-
dimensional controlled topology. Recent successes with topological 4-manifolds
suggest the time is ripe to try to formulate surgery obstructions for arbitrary
fundamental groups. Improved understanding of handlebody structures and a new
construction of topological field theories in dimension 4 offer hopes for
combinatorially-defined invariants of smooth 4-manifolds. In the controlled area
recent work with Ranicki has provided a proof of an elusive stability theorem
for controlled surgery obstructions. This may point the way to a full
description of the groups as generalized homology, analogous to earlier
descriptions of the end and controlled h-cobordism obstructions. Such a
description would have applications ranging from local structure in stratified
sets to sharpening 2-torsion conclusions in some cases of the Novikov
conjecture.

This project explores the boundary between the discrete and continuous worlds.
Geometry and analysis (continuous points of view) have revealed strange behavior
in dimension 4. In terms of the mathematics used in physics, other dimensions
are "classical" while dimension 4 seems to be "quantum." Topologically
4-dimensional objects are described in terms of 3-dimensional building blocks (a
discrete point of view), particularly knots and links in 3-space. One objective
is to bridge the gap between these two views, and in particular understand the
quantum behavior from the topological point of view. In higher dimensions
algebraic and qualitative topology (e.g. surgery theory) are discrete points of
view. Twenty years ago the PI bridged the gap between this and local continuous
topology in one case, "pseudoisotopy." This has had numerous applications. Many
more applications await a widening of this bridge to include other cases, for
instance algebraic K-theory and surgery, but the methods are complex and
intensely technical and have so far resisted extension. The other objective of
the project is to carry through these generalizations.
