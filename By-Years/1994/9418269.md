9418269 Leavitt This research is based on the assumption that changes in
atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the past 40,000 years can be quantitatively
measured by determining the stomatal density and stable-carbon isotope
composition of modern and ancient plant leaves, particularly leaves preserved in
packrat middens in the western U.S. To overcome the problem of separate effects
of climate and CO2, PI intends to employ analog approach by using leaves from
different latitudes and/or elevations to maintain constant climate. Samples from
the same latitude but different ages and elevations will allow determination of
whether attitudinal gradients in stomatal density and carbon isotopes are the
same in high and low CO2 periods. Ground truthing will be through analysis of
modern living samples and herbarium samples. Possible implications of the
research include determination of the relative effects of CO2 concentrations and
climate influences on vegetation change, refinement of carbon cycle and
hydrological models during deglaciation, confirmation of CO2 and carbon isotope
shifts identified in earlier studies, and enhanced understanding of CO2
variations in the evolution and distribution of C4 plant.
