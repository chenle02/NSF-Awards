The long-term goals of the seminar are to provide bridge engineers from diverse
backgrounds, industry, academia, or government with a forum to assimilate,
exchange, or become educated on the technological aspects of cable-stayed
bridges. Cable-stayed bridges have become a popular and cost-effective
alternative to suspension bridges since the Second World War. With the proven
benefits of cable-stayed bridge crossings in the United States and the world,
still many government, consulting and academic engineers are not investigating
the use of the bridge type. One can only speculate that a possible lack of
understanding of cable-stayed bridge behavior and performance aspects are the
cause. Thus, the seminar's major objective is to educate the attendees on the
overall aspect of cable-stayed bridge technology. Renowned speakers from the
United States will lecture to participants in a two-day seminar format
tentatively set for April, 1993, in Miami, Florida.
