This award provides partial funding to support a summer school as an addition to
the Eighteenth International Conference on Atomic Physics, ICAP2002, to be held
in Cambridge, MA, July 28-August 3, 2002. The purpose of the summer school is to
serve the AMO community in two ways: 1) attraction and education of new workers
into the AMO field, and 2) wider and more comprehensible dissemination of the
results.
