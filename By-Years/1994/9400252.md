94-00252 The PI requests funding to purchase a high-frequency, broad-band
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) that will be operated as shared use
equipment for a wide variety of research programs. The ADCP will be equipped
with a 600 kHz and 1.2 mHz transducers in order to allow high resolution studies
of currents in shallow environments. This equipment will be available to
researchers at many different institutions, and partial support for the
instrument will be supplied by the University of Washington, Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, the Marine Biological Laboratory, Scripps Institute
of Oceanography and Horn Point Environmental Laboratory. The instrumentation
requested is required for support of a variety of NSF-funded research projects,
primarily related to the Land-Margin Ecosystem Research (LMER) programs, and
will enhance the scientific capability of these institutions in the future.
