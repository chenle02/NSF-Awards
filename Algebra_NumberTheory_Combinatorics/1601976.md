In many branches of mathematics one encounters sets of equations with symmetries
-- transformations that take any solution of the equations to another solution.
In this situation, it is often very useful to classify all solutions up to the
action of these symmetries, two solutions considered equivalent if they are
related by a symmetry transformation. Within the field of algebraic geometry,
the theory known as geometric invariant theory provides a very good answer to
this classification question. There is reason to suspect that the methods of
geometric invariant theory extend to a much broader context. In particle
physics, the universe is described as a set of solutions of some equations up to
the action of a very large set of symmetries. This project aims to broaden the
methods and results of geometric invariant theory and bring them to bear on a
large set of classification problems in algebraic geometry, including some of
those studied in high energy physics.

This project envisions a new general approach to moduli problems in algebraic
geometry. The main technical tool is a special kind of stratification on an
algebraic stack called a theta stratification. Theta stratifications are a
common generalization of the Kempf-Ness stratification studied in geometric
invariant theory and the Harder-Narasimhan stratification of the moduli space of
vector bundles on a curve. Classically these stratifications were used, in the
case of smooth stacks, to study the Betti numbers of the moduli stack of
semistable objects. The project will pursue several generalizations of these
results to situations where the stack is not necessarily smooth, and to
extracting more subtle topological information about the stack. Examples include
wall-crossing formulas for integrals of tautological K-theory classes, and more
generally extracting information about the derived category of coherent sheaves
on the stack and the semistable locus.
