9316051 Bodnar The porphyry copper deposits are major producers of copper as
well as molybdenum, zinc, lead, gold, silver, arsenic, selenium and other
metals. It is proposed to investigate sources of the metals in porphyry copper
deposits by conducting synchrotron XRF (SXRF) analyses of carefully selected
fluid inclusions from 6 ore deposits representing a wide range in vertical and
lateral positions within the larger magmatic-hydrothermal system. Preliminary
SXRF analyses of samples from the Red Mountain and Morenci, AZ, and the Santa
Rita, NM., porphyry systems document the feasibility of conducting
nondestructive analyses of individual fluid inclusions from these deposits. Most
of the samples to be studied have previously been characterized through detailed
petrography, microthermometric and geochemical analysis, and their position
within the paragenetic sequence and their relationship to hypogene copper
mineralization are well understood. Results from this study will improve our
understanding of the genesis of this important ore deposit type by identifying
which fluids are carrying metals and where these fluids are distributed
vertically and laterally within the magmatic-hydrothermal system.
