This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at
developing optofluidic technology for medical diagnostics. Optofluidics
describes the combination of integrated optics with microfluidics in a single
chip scale system. As such, optofluidic devices have great potential to create
novel biomedical devices. Various promising approaches including optofluidic
ring resonators, plasmonic nanohole membranes, or nanoscale photonic crystal
resonators have been explored. Another possibility is to rely on the detection
of molecular targets within a fluidic channel that also guides light. Such
structures have the potential to result in fully self-contained, portable,
planar detection systems. In this project, we will optimize and clinically
validate such optofluidic channel structures to establish them as viable
candidates for next-generation diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will result in a
commercially viable detection platform for accurate and rapid point-of-care
pathogen detection. This need is evident by the huge burden infectious diseases
put on the financial and healthcare industries annually, and the potential for
overwhelming pandemics or bioterrorism attacks. The proposed work will result in
a rapid, accurate and broadly applicable pathogen detector platform that can be
administered, for example, at hospitals, doctor offices, airports, seaports,
border crossings, post offices, farms and eventually the home. In addition, the
proposed work will make important contributions to the emerging field of
optofluidics by expanding the capabilities of fully self-contained, planar
optofluidic waveguide devices.
