The southwest coastal region of Florida offers one of the richest sequences of
shelly marine faunas representing the last five million years of biological
evolution in the region. This interval is of great interest because of its
fundamental environmental and biotic changes including closure of the Panamanian
seaway, reorganization of the Gulf Stream, severing of the Pacific-Atlantic
connection between marine faunas and the interchange of North and South American
land faunas. Recent work by Florida State Museum parties has shown that
potentially rich land animal samples interfinger with the well- known marine
mollusk faunas in southwest Florida. These vertebrate samples will be enlarged
and studied, and they are expected to greatly improve the precision of present
dating of the entire late Neogene sequence in the region. At the same time,
intensive analysis of the largely neglected gastropod mollusks in the marine
faunas will be undertaken. A relatively new approach to checking the correlation
of these same marine and non-marine faunas will be tried, using strontium
isotope ratios, in comparison with the sequence based on world-wide marine
readings. This work is urgent because the major excavations now open will be
closed and forever buried in about two years.
