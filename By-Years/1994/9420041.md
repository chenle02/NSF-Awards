9420041 Siegel-Causey Large water birds-penguins, loons, grebes, albatrosses and
shearwater, pelicans and allies, herons and storks- have been considered to
comprise the earliest branching groups of birds. This project will examine
phylogenetic relationships among the pelican-like birds (Pelicaniformes) using
molecular sequence data. The phylogenetic framework will be used to address
morphologic evolution as well as the evolution of social behavior in these
birds. %%% The proposed study will help unravel the relationships among
pelicaniform birds and their close relatives. It will provide a better
understanding of the patterns of molecular evolution in mitochondrial ribosomal
genes. It will also provide the knowledge necessary to address such
macroevolutionary questions as whether the Pelicaniformes are a morphologically
and ecologically diverse clade of birds or, if this diversity is simply an
artifact of lumping together unrelated species. ***
