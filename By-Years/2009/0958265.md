This award will provide travel support for attendees and invited speakers for
the eighth annual symposium of the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship (AAPF) program, to be held in Washington, D.C. on January 2-3, 2010.
The purpose of the AAPF program is to integrate research and educational
activities at the postdoctoral level, to better prepare the fellows for a
scientific career. The Annual Symposium provides a venue for fellows to discuss
their research and teaching or outreach projects while increasing their exposure
within the astronomy and astrophysics community. The symposium represents a key
component of the AAPF program, acting as a mechanism to facilitate knowledge
transfer from experiences the fellows have obtained in the course of their
activities to a broad audience.

As with the previous symposia in this series, the AAPF symposium for 2010 will
promote discussion among astronomers with very different interests and
backgrounds. By creating a forum in which discussions can occur across the
standard boundaries defined by subdiscipline, there is great opportunity for new
insights and the ability to develop new interdisciplinary collaborations. The
symposium will also provide a venue for discussing other issues that are
important to young astronomers as they begin their careers. In addition, the
symposium will (1) provide a forum for discussing the combination of research
and teaching, (2) facilitate collaborations between AAPF fellows on both
research and education, and (3) provide exposure for the fellows and the
fellowship program within the astronomical community, given that the symposium
is held in conjunction with the winter American Astronomical Society meeting.
