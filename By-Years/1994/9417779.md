This award provides support for the Seventh International Conference on Random
Structures and Algorithms which will be held in Atlanta on May 16-20, 1995. The
aim of this meeting is to present recent research, and to identify and explore
new directions for further development, in random discrete structures,
randomized algorithms and broad areas of application of probabilistic methods in
discrete mathematics and computer science. In addition to the intrinsic interest
of the mathematics, these fields have numerous applications to such subjects as
the reliability of communication, neural networks, percolation and
polymerization processes, and sequencing DNA. This research is in the general
area of Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study
how discrete collections can be organized. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
networks, as in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer
science all deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of
combinatorial research.
