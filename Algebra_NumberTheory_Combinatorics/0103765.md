The proposer will study periods of irregular connections and Reimann Roch type
problems for Gauss-Manin connections associated to irregular connections. The
focus will be on proving a conjectured formula for the determinant of the Gauss-
Manin connection. He will study applications of this formula to epsilon factors
in arithmetic and to the theory of co-adjoint orbits in representation theory
and symplectic geometry. At the same time, the proposer will investigate whether
periods of irregular connections can be subsumed in a theory of contravariant
motives for singular varieties.

Certain numbers like pi and e play a central role in mathematics. In some cases,
these numbers are "periods". Essentially, they arise where geometry meets number
theory. Other such numbers (irregular periods) seem to be fundamentally non-
geometric and non-number theoretic in nature. This proposal is an attempt to
better understand these irregular periods. The key idea is the observation of a
Japanese mathematician, Terasoma, that even though one has no geometric
construction of these irregular periods, they are known in some cases to satisfy
formulae which are analogous to the formulae satisfied by other objects (called
epsilon factors) arising in number theoretic algebraic geometry.
