Brazil's Amazonian rainforest and its widespread cerrados (savanna-like
habitats) establish it globally as one of the top "Megadiversity" countries. We
will survey amphibians and reptiles in three poorly known cerrado areas, Serra
do Cachimbo (southern Para and northern Mato Grosso), the Vale do Parana
(Goias), and the Jalapao area (Tocantins). Most of the Cerrado has been
converted to agriculture (soybean plantation) and pastureland, making it one of
the most endangered habitats in the world. Preliminary work has revealed many
undescribed species. We will obtain distributional, ecological, morphological,
and reproductive data on all species in these areas; in addition, specimens and
associated genetic resources (tissues) will be collected and deposited in
Brazilian and American museums for future morphological and phylogenetic
analyses. Our findings will contribute to development of conservation strategies
for the Cerrado, and our collaboration with Brazilians will result in a wealth
of scientific studies. Brazilian and American graduate students will participate
in all phases of this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using data that we will collect
and phylogenetic analyses, we will examine history of distributions
(phylogeography) and ecological traits (phyloecology) in lizards and frogs.
These data will be combined with similar data that we have collected in the
Amazon region during previous NSF-funded projects. Our studies will contribute
new museum specimens that will be available to other scientists for future work,
species descriptions, genetic resources, and ecological data and will allow us
to further test the hypothesis that structure in present-day ecological
communities has an historic origin.
