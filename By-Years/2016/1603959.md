This award supports a dissertation project to conduct excavation, sampling and
lithic, geoarchaeological, chronological, and paleoenvironmental analysis of
materials from the Little John site in Yukon, Canada. The site is important as a
stratified, Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene site with archaeological assemblages
relating to the so-called Nenana/Chindadn (without microblades) and Denali
(microblades) complexes. The site includes a locus with stratigraphic separation
of paleosols and holds promise for evaluating the proposition that these two
complexes are culturally distinct (presumably implying unrelated populations)
and/or functionally distinct (i.e., relating to technological evolution or
seasonal tool kit changes) as has been argued variously from other sites in
central Alaska. The co-PI (Ph.D. student) will help supervise the excavation and
lead the analyses to evaluate whether the assemblage types are stratigraphically
and chronologically distinct and whether they correlate with paleoenvironmental
change. These correlations presumably will yield insights to help clarify the
long-standing debate about the significance of these assemblages in the
archaeology of Eastern Beringia.
