9360292 Jain A power plant simulator is designed using parallel computing
architecture. This new generation simulator integrates an innovative tech
technique for distributed computing. Traditional simulators require excessive
computing resources implemented in uniprocessing environments at low computing
speeds. In this project plant models are created for implementation in parallel
processing architecture, and generating associated algorithms and hardware
architecture for parallel processing. The new generation simulator, in addition
to plant design analysis and personnel training, is useful for many other
applications, such as configuring and evaluating procedures for plant operations
under transient conditions. ***
