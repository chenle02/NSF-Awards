The transition in failure mechanism from brittle fracture to plastic flow is
important in understanding tectonophysics, the strength of the crust, and the
style of deformation at the field scale. Recent studies in three areas have
yielded new insight into the physics and mechanics of the brittle-plastic
transition: acquisition of high quality mechanical data, systematic observations
of deformation microstructures, and advances in the theoretical modeling of the
failure of rocks in compression. Qualitative microstructural observations have
provided information on the conditions under which various deformation mechanism
operate, estimates of strain partitioning, and identification of crack
nucleation mechanism. The PI will continue work on the brittle-ductile
transition by performing triaxial mechanical tests on natural and synthetic
rocks of calcite, anorthite, peridotite, and diabase. Quantitative
microstructural analyses to understand the micromechanics of deformation are an
important part of this study. Acoustic emission measurements will also be
performed on a selected number of experiments, and axial and volumetric strain
measurements will be made during the tests.
