The overall goal of the proposal is to determine the role of the newly
described ganglioside binding sites of both fibroblasts and its 140 kD cell
surface receptor protein in the mechanism of cell adhesion. The PI recently
demonstrated a ganglioside binding site in the amino terminal domain of
fibronectin and proposes to further define the role of the ganglioside binding
site in cell adhesion. Using a quantitative binding assay, termed fluoresence
polarization, he will study the structure and and function of the ganglioside
binding sites of both fibronectin and its receptor. The fluorescence
polarization assay will be used for studying the binding of gangliosides to the
140 kD fibronectin receptor and platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. He will
also determine the specificity of the receptors for both various ganglioside
species and divalent cations. Another objective is to determine the precise site
on fibronectin which binds gangliosides by (a) limited proteolytic digestion of
fibronectin and (b) expression of the region of the fibronectin gene that codes
for the ganglioside binding site. Fluorescence polarization will also be used to
quantitatively measure cooperative interactions between the ganglioside binding
site and other fibronectin binding sites. Cell adhesion mutants will be used to
examine the role of gangliosides in cell adhesion, and the molecular basis of
the phenotype will be analyzed. The molecular basis of specific and non-specific
interactions between cells, and between cells and the substrate, is a important
area of research in cell biology. The proposed work promises to provide
important new information concerning one type of interaction, adhesion, and
combines both biochemical and molecular genetic approaches in a clever and
productive way.
