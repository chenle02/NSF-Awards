The Foundation for Independent Higher Education requests support from NSF to
connect eight of their member institutions of higher education to the Internet.
These include: Bloomfield College, Bloomfield, NJ, Charleston Southern
University, Charleston, SC, Florida Southern College, Lakeland, FL, Holy Family
College, Philadelphia, PA, Ohio Valley College, Parkersburg, WV, Peirce College,
Philadelphia, PA, St. Meinrad College and School of Theology, St. Meinrad, IN,
and Shorter College, Rome, GA. Each of the institutions funded will connect to
the Internet using service providers in within their respective areas. These
institutions of higher education need the Internet connections to be able to
access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of these institutions as
well as the community in general.
