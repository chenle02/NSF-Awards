9728434 T. Garland Jr. Responses to artificial selection for voluntary activity
in house mice Non-Technical Summary During the course of evolution, changes in
behavior, morphology, and physiology occur in some correlated fashion. Natural
selection that leads to changes in one trait also produces changes in other
traits. Artificial selection, where individuals possessing extreme values for
some trait are mated with one another over many generations, has been used to
establish lines of house mice that have a 120% greater level of voluntary
activity. Using four such lines, along with control lines that were not
subjected to selection, this research will explore the morphological and
physiological changes that are correlated with this change in behavior. It will
explore traits such as oxygen consumption, heart mass and blood hemoglobin
levels to determine differences in locomotor performance capabilities. In
addition, function of the endocrine system, limb bone proportions, muscle fiber
types and the activities of key enzymes in both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism
will be examined. This research will bring to bear a wide array of
sophisticated, modern methodology from the fields of functional morphology,
respiratory physiology, endocrinology and genetics to these truly integrative
studies of the evolution of behavior. The selected lines produced by this
research will be made available to other researchers and will provide an
important model system for studying effects of voluntary activity in behavior on
physical fitness, health, lifespan and other aspects of life history in mammals.
This project constitutes a pioneering study upon which this potential for future
research rests.
