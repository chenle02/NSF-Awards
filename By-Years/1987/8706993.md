Heat transport under a large temperature gradient is a topic of much current
interest. In order to develop methods for removing implantation damage in ion-
implanted materials and, also, to produce metastable compounds and
supersaturated alloys, it is important to achieve rapid melting and subsequent
recrystallization of semiconductor materials. As heat flows in the solid phase,
temperature profiles varying as much as 10 degrees per centimeter are not
unusual. Under a large enough temperature gradient, heat conduction becomes
anomalous, particularly near solid-liquid interfaces. The phenomenon is not yet
fully understood but it is known that thermal conduction at high temperatures in
semiconductors involves several processes, including some highly non-linear
ones, that may contribute to the anomalous case. In this research project,
Professor Gerald Mahan, in collaboration with Professor Francisco Claro of the
Catholic University of Chile plans to investigate the trapping of carriers by a
thermally induced gap-narrowing near the solid-melt interface in silicon and
germanium. The band narrowing produces a confining potential that should be
helpful in developing a theory of heat transport by electrons and electron-hole
pairs. Additionally, the investigators are interested in the threshold for
suppression of thermal conduction by temperature gradients, and in obtaining the
space profile under steady heat flow near solid-melt interfaces. The combination
of Professor Mahan's expertise with semiconductors and with nonlinear transport
theory, with Professor Claro's complementary background in thermal transport
techniques, creates a highly qualified team for addressing this complex and
significant research. The mutual benefits of this collaboration fulfill an
important criterion of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
