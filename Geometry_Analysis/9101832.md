Professor Lee will study nonlinear partial differential equations related to
problems in geometry. One of the goals will be to find complete Einstein metrics
on the ball with prescribed conformal infinity. A second area of research will
be the space of CR structures on a three dimensional manifold. The work on
partial differential equations will involve an attempt to extend the idea of the
maximum principle to systems. There have been numerous semi- successful attempts
at this in the past and any progress made by the principal investigator in this
direction should find immediate application. This award will support research in
the cross disciplinary area of global analysis which studies geometry through
partial differential equations. One of the interesting applications of the
research involves the inverse problem of measuring the conductivity properties
of a material from electrical measurements made on the boundary of the material.
It is possible to reformulate this problem as one in differential geometry and
then uses methods from this well developed field to attempt to answer questions
concerning the inverse problem.
