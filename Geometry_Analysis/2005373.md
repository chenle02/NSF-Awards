Differential Geometry is a branch of Mathematics that studies spaces of
arbitrary dimension called manifolds. A hallmark of abstract mathematics is that
the generality of concepts allows them to be applied to many apparently diverse
situations. A manifold can describe a physical object, like the two-dimensional
surface of an asteroid, or the space of all configurations of a robotic arm.
Moving away from physical objects, any data set can be seen as a finite set of
points in a manifold, in which case the dimension equals the number of
quantities measured, for example height, weight, age, etc in a population. This
project focuses on the study of "symmetry" of manifolds, which can be finite,
like the one exhibited by a butterfly or a starfish, or infinite, such as the
rotational symmetry of a round object like a planet. Symmetry leads to a notion
of equivalence between points (for example the five tips of a starfish are
equivalent), which naturally gives rise to a decomposition, or "Foliation", of
the manifold into sub-manifolds called "leaves", which are sets of points
equivalent to each other. Symmetry also yields the notion of "invariant
functions", meaning functions constant on the leaves. The main goal of this
project is to study the interplay between the algebraic study of invariant
functions, and the geometric study of the "leaves". The PI will continue
outreach to high school students, undergraduate research, graduate training,
broadening participation activities, and organization of conferences and
workshops.

In more technical terms, this project will explore the interplay between the
emerging field of singular Riemannian foliations, and the older fields of
Invariant Theory and Submanifold Theory (especially isoparametric and minimal
submanifolds). Proposed applications of Foliation Theory to Invariant Theory
include providing new, "group-free" proofs of classical results, thus giving
them a new perspective; and proving brand-new results, related for example to
the Inverse Invariant Theory Problem. Proposed applications to submanifold
geometry include the study of the index of minimal submanifolds, especially its
relationship to the topology of the submanifold, as exemplified by the Marques-
Neves-Schoen conjecture; and a new method of attack for the last remaining case
in the century-old problem of classification of isoparametric submanifolds of
spheres. This project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis and the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
