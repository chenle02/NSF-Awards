Abstract ATM-9724957 Kermond, John L. NOAA/Office of Global Programs Title:
Video Documentary Describing the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program
NSF, NOAA, NASA and ONR supported the climate project called Tropical Ocean-
Global Atmosphere (TOGA). It was conducted from 1985-1995. It was highly
successful in its efforts to explore the theoretical and practical
predictability of seasonal to interannual variations of the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. NOAA's Office of Global Programs is producing an outreach-
educational film about TOGA. This grant, combined with funds from NASA, ONR and
NOAA support that effort.
