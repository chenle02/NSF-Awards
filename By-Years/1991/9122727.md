Under certain conditions, absorption of a photon in an ultrathin
superconducting film can generate a relatively large voltage pulse. They propose
to explore this phenomenon further in both low-Tc and high-Tc sc films; they
will explore the feasibility of an ultra- sensitive, fast infrared photodetector
based upon the phenomenon.
