With the wide adoption of smart phones and other mobile devices, cellular mobile
data traffic has grown tremendously in the past few years. This rapid growth in
cellular data traffic, coupled with the increasing demands for mobile data
services, has exerted enormous competitive pressure on cellular network service
providers. How to effectively manage a large-scale cellular data network is
therefore a daunting challenge that is not only important to cellular network
service providers, but also to mobile data users and emerging mobile
applications and services. In this project, the PI sets out to develop a data-
driven, statistical machine learning-based framework to identify, analyze and
understand various challenging issues in cellular data networks, and develop
mechanisms and tools for effectively managing and trouble-shooting constantly
evolving cellular data networks. The PI leverages vast amounts of heterogeneous
sources of data obtained from operational cellular data networks, and designs
statistical inference techniques to analyze, mine and correlate various sources
of real-world data to uncover and identify various key factors that contribute
to network performance issues and affect user
experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project brings benefits not only
to cellular service providers, but also to millions of users who are
increasingly dependent on mobile voice and data services. It also provides
valuable insights to inform further development of emerging mobile and cloud
computing. Research outcomes will be disseminated through publications and
outreach activities, as well as technology transfer.
