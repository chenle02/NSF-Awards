The energetic and medium requirements in chemical processes involving electron
transfer will be probed with specially designed equipment. The systems of donor-
acceptor pairs to be investigated will allow studies to be made of the
relationship between exciplex emission and charge transfer emission, the
relationship between energetics and rates of photoinduced electron transfer, and
the role of proteins as the media in biological photoinduced electron transfer.
One of the bichromophoric systems to be studied will have as the donor/acceptor
pair a substituted anthracene and a dimethylaniline group which is separated by
a spacer of varying length. The spacer will consist of methylene or amido units.
Such a series of compounds will allow the energetics of these processes to be
probed by changes in substituents and the geometry of the transfer processes to
be probed by varying the length of the spacer. The studies will be carried out
with a transient spectrometer and a supersonic jet to obtain high-resolution
spectra. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research
of Professor N. C. Yang at the University of Chicago. Factors that govern
electron transfer between two groups within a molecule will be studied. One of
the groups will be promoted to an excited state by the absorption of light
energy. Subsequently, electron transfer from this excited group to the other
electron acceptor group in the molecule can be studied by fast spectroscopic
techinques. The energetics of the process will be probed by altering one of the
groups with other substituents which facilitate or retard electron transfer.
Electron transfer is of fundamental importance in the conversion of light into
chemical energy in many biological processes including photosynthesis and thus
this research will be of considerable interest to a wide range of scientists.
