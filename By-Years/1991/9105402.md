This award provides three years of partial support for a research staff
technician to help operate and maintain the Neutron Activation Analysis
Laboratory in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Institute is committed to
providing the rest of the funding needed for the full-time services of the
technician. The Neutron Activation Analysis Laboratory is a facility dedicated
to the analysis of planetary materials, principally terrestrial rocks and
minerals. Principal users are graduate and undergraduate students at MIT and
other research institutions in the northeast U.S. Neutron activation analysis is
based on the nuclear properties of elements and is a sensitive technique for
elements that are not readily analyzed by other techniques that depend on the
electronic energy levels of elements.
