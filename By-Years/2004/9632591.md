9632591 Newton It is proposed to continue an investigation of the thermodynamic
properties of concentrated electrolyte solutions and their interaction with
rock-forming minerals and melts under deep-earth conditions. Previous work has
identified an important property of possible deep crust/upper mantle fluids,
namely a low H2O activity and yet high alkali mobility of concentrated brines
owing to pressure-induced ionic dissociation. This property of brines could have
important implications for melting at crustal levels. The main objectives of the
current study are to describe the activity-concentration relationships of such
fluids, to determine the melting capability for various silicate assemblages in
the presence of these brines, and to constrain partition coefficient of alkalis
and oxygen isotopes between minerals and silicate melts under crustal
conditions.
