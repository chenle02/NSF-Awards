Abstract DBI 9750072 Joseph E. Peters This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Dissecting specific interactions between
mobile DNA elements to understand bacterial evolution." Mobile DNA elements such
as transposons and plasmids increase genetic diversity in bacterial populations.
The molecular mechanism by which the bacterial transposon Tn7 specifically
targets its insertion into plasmids able to move between cells is being
determined. Understanding how mobile DNA elements recognize and interact with
each other will provide important insights into how genetic information is
rapidly spread through bacterial populations.
