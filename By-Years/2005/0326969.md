This proposal is funded to confirm the Silicic Acid Leakage Hypothesis" which is
that silicic acid is less efficiently utilized in the southern ocean during
glacial periods and transported, via intermediate waters, to the equatorial
upwelling regions to support higher opal productivity, resulting in a lower
carbonate/Corg rain ratios and an increase in ocean alkalinity. The PIs propose
to the hypothesis by examining changes in opal accumulation rates in the
equatorial regions between the last glacial and the
Holocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
