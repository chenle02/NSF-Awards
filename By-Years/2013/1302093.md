Dr. Kelly Denney is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at The Ohio State
University. The Fellow plans to improve our understanding of galaxy formation
and evolution by focusing on the impact and role of supermassive black holes
(BHs) and their growth rates across cosmic time. The connection between BH
growth and galaxy evolution can be studied in active galactic nuclei
(AGNs)---systems in which the central supermassive BH is actively accreting
matter. Here, the BH mass and accretion rate can be measured, and the connection
to the host galaxy evolution can be judged through feedback processes and the
relation of BH and galaxy properties.

The Fellow's primary goal is to recalibrate the Mg II- and C IV-based AGN BH
mass scales---on which all high-redshift BH masses are based---by taking into
account recently discovered systematic uncertainties in these masses. This
program will also characterize the observed emission-line, spectral energy
distribution, and radio characteristics of the sample to investigate the
creation of intrinsic reddening and inclination indicators applicable to all
types of AGNs. Finally, time will be spent initiating a series of future
reverberation mapping monitoring programs out to a redshift of around 2 for
measuring BH masses and AGN distances.

The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.
The fellow will undertake a program of educational outreach with two components:
(1) delivering to the Columbus-area schools an inquiry-based astronomy
curriculum targeting the 6th--10th grades that aims to improve both teacher and
student attitudes and competence in STEM fields, and (2) a telescope lending
library available to public schools and other groups for use in the classroom
and evening observing activities.
