This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the China-US Group
Theory Summit 2024 to be held at University of Florida on Feb 22-25, 2024. Group
theory is a branch of modern algebra studying the notion of symmetry. It is a
fundamental and highly active field of research within the mathematical sciences
and has ramifications throughout all of mathematics and the sciences. There are
large communities of group theory researchers in all continents, and they keep
in touch through international meetings and conferences. However, local
conditions and cultural circumstances under which mathematical research is done
differ quite a bit between different regions of the world. The focus of this
conference is on research in group theory in the United States and in China.
Building on the success of the first conference of this type held in 2019, the
major goal of this conference is to strengthen ties between group theorists in
China and the United States. The conference will provide group theory
researchers in China and the United States a forum to disseminate their own
research as well as to learn about new and significant results in the area. It
will help to bridge the gap between the group theory communities in the United
States and China, and lead to future cooperation and collaborations. Speakers
from both countries will cover a large variety of the subjects in the area,
which include representations of solvable groups, representations of simple
groups, character theory, classes of groups, groups and combinatorics, p-groups,
and fusion systems. There will be about fourteen invited talks and a limited
number of contributed talks. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere
to foster new collaborations; young researchers will have the opportunity to
present their work and learn about the latest developments in the field. More
