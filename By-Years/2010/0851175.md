ATM 0851175&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enable ten undergraduate students
per year to participate in scientific research for three months per year at the
University of Michigan in the Space Physics Research Laboratory through a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program. The Space Physics
Research Laboratory is a broad interdisciplinary research organization that is
part of the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences within the
College of Engineering at the university. The Department has 46 faculty members,
including 26 research faculty. The goal of the lab's REU program is to attract,
motivate and train undergraduates in the geosciences, specifically within three
areas of interest to the Atmospheric Sciences Division of NSF, namely,
Magnetospheric Physics, Aeronomy, and Atmospheric Chemistry. The students will
be exposed to projects in a variety of areas such as Airglow and Atmospheric
Science, Space Plasma Physics, Ionospheres and Magnetospheres, Air Pollution
Transport, Planetary Atmospheres, and Lidars. Activities will include hands-on
experience working with instrumentation that has flown or will fly in space,
conducting in situ or remote sensing measurements of the atmosphere, fabricating
and calibrating state-of-the-art instruments and devices, and using and/or
developing software packages to analyze the measurements and manipulate large
data bases. Additional activities for the participants include attending weekly
seminars, preparing a written report of their research, and orally presenting
their findings to the other students and interested faculty and staff. Students
will interact with their research advisors, who also serve as mentors, as well
as other participants in the program and with graduate students, faculty
members, and research staff at the Space Physics Lab. Some of the projects will
result in journal publications or presentations at scientific meetings. Special
efforts are being made to recruit women and underrepresented groups to the
program. The goal is to engender interest and research experience in the
atmospheric and space sciences in students who might pursue these areas as a
career.
