The primary objective of this research is to establish the relationship between
finger and toe bone structure and the amount of time monkey species spend on the
ground and in the trees. Researchers have predicted that stress on the finger
and toe bones of animals living on the ground ought to be greater than those
spending most of their time in the trees. To test whether this prediction is
correct, the investigator will calculate the strength of toe and finger bone
shafts using structural engineering equations. The values used in the equations
will be obtained from measurements of radiographs of hand and foot bones of ten
monkey species. Captive and free-ranging individuals of each of the monkey
species will be filmed walking and running. The films will be used to determine
the hand and foot postures each species commonly uses when walking on the ground
and branches. It is thought that the human lineage evolved from arboreal
ancestors and, over several million years, evolved to spend more and more time
on ground. Results from this study may help in reconstructing the degree of
arboreality characteristic of early hominoids.
