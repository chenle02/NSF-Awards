Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project focuses on the development
of cryptographic mathematical models and constructions that address realistic
security requirements at the implementation level. This is a fundamental problem
as cryptographic security formalisms are often criticized for lack of relevance
given the wide range of attacks available at the implementation level. Indeed,
traditional cryptographic attacks are restricted in the way private data can be
accessed; hence, the security of systems relying on such constructs is
contingent on external non-cryptographic means for enforcing the necessary
tamper resilience. Unfortunately, this physical tamper resistance is either too
expensive or unreliable. The research extends models of cryptographic attacks to
include various forms of private data tampering and access and brings the theory
of cryptographic constructions closer to security concerns in practice. In
particular, the tamper proofing of a wide set of cryptographic primitives is
considered in an extended adversarial setting, such as digital signatures,
public key encryption, secure function evaluation, as well as arbitrary
cryptographic functions. This research thus explores the boundaries of what is
achievable algorithmically and practically through cryptographic means.
