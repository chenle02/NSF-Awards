In one-period risk measurement, the risky objects are future net worths modelled
by elements of a linear space of real-valued random variables and a risk measure
is a mapping from this space of random variables to the real numbers. Typical
examples of future net worths are the accounting value of a firm's equity, the
surplus of an insurance company or the market value of a portfolio of financial
securities. In a dynamic setup one can model the future evolution of net worths
with stochastic processes and risks can be calculated at initial and later
times. A process of risk measures is called time-consistent if it assigns to a
future financial position the same risk irrespective of whether it is calculated
directly or in two steps backward in time. The purpose of this project is to
understand the structure of time-consistent processes of monetary risk measures,
find good examples and study their implementation on a computer. It involves
methods from the general theory of stochastic processes, locally convex vector
spaces as well as techniques from linear and convex optimization. Monetary risk
measures are formally strongly related to pricing in incomplete markets, hedging
under constraints, maxmin expected utility functionals, exact games in
cooperative game theory as well as to coherent lower previsions in the theory of
imprecise probabilities. Since in most of these theories the dynamical aspects
are not elaborated yet, research on the dynamics of monetary risk measures will
also produce new results in other areas of mathematics and economics.

The proposed work is expected to lead to a new class of risk measures and
algorithms for their numerical calculations. The new risk measures will be time-
consistent and have good properties for the purposes of pricing, allocation of
risk capital and fair premium calculation. This will lead to better methods for
the regulation of the banking and insurance industry, the internal risk
management of corporations and a realistic assessment of risks the society bears
through federal agencies like the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which
guarantees pension benefits promised by insolvent pension plans.
