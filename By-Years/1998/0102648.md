ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal #0102648
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combined NIL and ESA Processing of Electro-Optic Materials
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Richard O. Claus, Virginia Tech, PI
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF NER program will study polymer/dielectric
nanocomposites with enhanced electro-optical modulation efficiency and thermal
stability, by using a combination of electrostatic self-assembly (ESA)
facilities at Virginia Tech and nanoimprint lithography (NIL) facilities at the
University of Michigan. We will use NIL to create a base nanopatterned template
and ESA to fill in the template through the molecular-level assembly of dipolar
molecules. This combination of approaches would allow the potentially low-cost
manufacturing of optical and electro-optic materials and devices. The program
will allow us to explore fundamental issues involving nanopatterning, molecular
alignment, and structure/property relationships in resulting prototype device
materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
