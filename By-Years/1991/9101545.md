This award will support continued maintenance and distribution of the protozoa
collection housed at the Protistology Department of the American Type Culture
Collection. The current holdings, all maintained in the cryopreserved state,
consist of approximately 1,000 strains. NSF support contributes to the free-
living protozoa portion of the Collection. In 1989, 3,010 protozoa were
distributed, of which over 80% of requests came from the U.S. institutions. The
user's community consists of Universities (48.7%), High Schools (1.4%),
Hospitals (6.4%), For-Profit Organizations (31.1%), and Government (7.4%). The
NSF support is primarily to provide research resources to the research community
of the Biological, Behavioral and Social Sciences Directorate.
