This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on developing and
commercializing a shape memory polymer external stent, VenoStent, to prevent
vein failure in hemodialysis patients. Although hemodialysis is the primary
lifeline for patients with end-stage kidney disease, vein failure necessitates
expensive, rather ineffective interventional techniques and re-do operations.
This puts the patient at an undue risk of infection, extensive hospitalizations,
and death, with substantial, adverse ripple effects on the economy. This project
will result in an optimized prototype of the VenoStent positioned for clinical
translation. VenoStent has the unique capability to robustly encompass the
complex, variable geometry of the graft-vein junction, where the majority of
failures occur. It is also biocompatible, biodegradable, ductile, and tunable
for optimal venous responses. In contrast to other competing technologies in
development, these features enable sutureless, custom-fittable encompassing of
the vein to reduce surgery times, risk of infection and wound reopening. These
features should also impart reductions in hospitalizations, interventional
techniques, re-do surgeries, and costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery
toward commercial application. First, the prototype must be optimized for its
ability to encompass the venous anastomoses and promote a healthy vascular
smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype, as VSMCs play an integral role in the
underlying neointimal formation responsible for vein failures. Sustained release
of a therapeutic peptide, MK2i, from the external supports will also be
evaluated in vitro for future commercialization adaptability incorporating a
therapeutic. The precise geometry of the construct, pore size, and molar
composition will be defined and then tested in an ex vivo model of the venous
anastomosis. In addition, personnel involved in this project, namely a graduate
student and post-doc, will receive extensive entrepreneurial and technology
translational opportunities through participation in business courses, pitches,
competitions, accelerator programs, and professional conferences.
