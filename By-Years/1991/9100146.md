Under the Small Business Innovative Research program (Phase I) a new type of
polymer construction of high quality planar and channel wave guides has been
developed and demonstrated. The waveguides make use of the fact that the
refractive index profile of the polymer film can be tuned by means of
polarization density change induced during wet and dry processing. Phase II
research will be addressed to establishing the technical foundation for Phase
III development of the device: characterization of the polymer formation;
refinement of the tuning process; refinement of film preparation to demonstrate
optimum low resistivity, proper dielectric property, and high transparency;
evaluation of switching speed; environmental tests; optical fiber interfacing;
and preparation of a prototype.
