AST-0300096&lt;br/&gt;Burke, Bernard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
support the optimization of very long baseline radio interferometric (VLBI)
systems in space through international collaborations with Russia and Japan.
Ultimately, space VLBI will be used to probe high-energy phenomena in the cores
of quasars and active galactic nuclei, leading to a better understanding of the
physical processes that occur in the vicinity of black holes. Mission planning
will include graduate and undergraduate students. Mission requirements will spur
the development of lower-noise circuitry and high-data-rate transmissions from
space.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
