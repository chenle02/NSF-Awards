9525758 Nathan This research project follows a two-fold approach to achieve
greater understanding and optimization of the transport properties of metal-
semiconductor junctions: a)extend exploration of Schottky barrier height tuning
with thin interlayers between the metal and semiconductor to consider different
interlayers, semiconductors, and metals; b)examine the microscopic composition
and structure of the interlayer, and the redistribution of interlayer atoms
during junction fabrication and processing. The long-term practical outcome of
this program may be the development of a new simple and reproducible method of
tuning Schottky barriers, and the incorporation of engineered Schottky barriers
in classes of prototype devices such as Schottky barrier photon detectors,
metal/semiconductor/metal detectors, and MESFETs. %%% The knowledge and
understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute
generally to improving the performance of advanced devices used in computing,
information processing, and telecommunications. An important feature of the
program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
