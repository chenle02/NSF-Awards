With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor George will perform theoretical studies of the elementary
excitations of atoms and molecules coupled to a host matrix, which is either a
solid or a cluster. This work is critical in understanding the important
experimental data gathered in this area. A formal theory will be developed to
describe the dynamics of molecular exciplexes coupled to elementary excitations
of a solid matrix; i.e., quasiparticles such as phonons. This theory will
incorporate electron-phonon interactions and the effects of spontaneous emission
between phonon-shifted electronic states. A semiempirical approach called the
diatomics-in-ionic-systems (DIIS) method will be used to study the structure of
neutral and positively charged rare gas clusters containing hydrogen and/or
halogen species. Special attention will be given to the case of argon cluster.
This study will also involve the calculation of excited as well as the ground
electronic states.
