The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to study the basic physics behind the
buildup of magnetic energy in the solar corona, extending his previous efforts
with the 'finite-element' computational technique. In this project, he intends
to cover more complex magnetic configurations in the corona, to study three-
dimensional situations, and to include pressure and gravitational forces in his
simulations. The PI's objective is to better describe the connections among the
fundamental physics of magnetic fields, associated electric currents, and energy
storage in stressed magnetic fields in the solar corona.

The researcher asserts that this work has implications for space weather
operations, and might enhance our ability to predict space weather and the
terrestrial impacts of solar activity. The PI also notes that this effort will
introduce the finite-element approach, already well-known in engineering, as a
fruitful technique for solar physics research. The PI will involve undergraduate
students in this research and also plans to communicate the results to
nonscientists and the general public through books and video courses.
