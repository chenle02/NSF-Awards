This project will use in tandem two large radio antennas located at the Owens
Valley Radio Observatory to monitor a sample of nearby active stars for radio
bursts associated with large stellar flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
The necessary custom electronic hardware to process the signals will be
constructed, and advantage will be taken of new receivers on the telescopes; all
of these are designed to permit broad spectral bandwidth observations, which
give high sensitivity, as well as high time resolution. The search for radio
bursts will be carried out in a real-time, automated
fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific targets include young stellar objects
(YSOs), close binary stars, and active M dwarf stars. The target sample consists
of 15 stars, and these will be monitored for 2.5 years, accumulating 500 hours
of observation time per star. This will give a unique data set for assessing
coronal and interplanetary conditions around active stars and their orbiting
planetary systems. There will be simultaneous low frequency coverage for every
target observed, by using a new low frequency array at Owens Valley. The result
will be observations spanning 2 decades of frequency (28 MHz to 6 GHz), thus
tracking coronal mass ejection events from the stellar corona into the
interplanetary medium. Simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations will also
be made, as well as triggered VLBI follow-up
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These observations should register
substantial broader impacts in the form of public interest, which is
particularly keen around the current time of Solar maximum. The project team is
active in public outreach lectures and other activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's
Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and
Instrumentation program.
