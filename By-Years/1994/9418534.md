9418534 White The University of California, Berkeley Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Sensors and Actuators is being funded for three
years by a "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research" Program award through the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers Program. Additional funding is
provided for an evaluator for three years to study the industry/university
interaction occurring in the Center. Funding is also being provided for an
African-American undergraduate to perform a one year study. The study, which
augments the Center's research program, will focus on the maximum quality factor
attainable by resonators constructed from polycrystalline silicon which are
measurable only under vacuum. The researchers are internationally recognized
scientists in this field and are well qualified to perform the Center's research
projects. This Center is being cosponsored by Dr. Deborah Crawford, Solid State
and Microstructure Program. The Program Manager recommends the University of
California, Berkeley be awarded a total of $163,000 for one year: $158,000 for
the first year of a three-year continuing award (this includes $100,00 cost
sharing from the Solid State and Microstructure Program and $8,000 for an
evaluator); and $5,000 for one year with funds provided by the Women,
Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program. Funding for
year two through three are recommended at the level of $108,000 per year
($100,000 per year from the Solid State and Microstructure Program and $8,000
per year for the evaluator.
