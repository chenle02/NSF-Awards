This study will build on previous work and expand the 'Concurrency Control and
Recovery Algorithms for Distributed Transaction Processing Systems' (CARAT)
testbed for additional performance studies. Some of the research questions to be
addressed include: the integration and interaction of protocols and mechanisms
for concurrency control, data distribution, replication, and recovery; the
design and performance evaluation of integrated distributed systems; and the
application and validation of analytic performance modeling techniques for real
distributed systems with attention to the extensions necessary to handle shared
resources and serialization delays.
