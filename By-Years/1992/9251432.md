Improvements in a psychoacoustics laboratory at Lawrence University will
provide, for non-science majors interested in music and languages, hands-on
experience with an enhanced, real-time analysis of acoustic signals. A sound
spectrograph and support instruments will allow development of a laboratory
component in Psycholinguistics and Psychology of Music. The real-time sound
spectrograph will provide immediate analysis and display of speech and musical
stimuli. Additional instruments, microcomputers, and software will record and
correlate physiological measures, such as vocal cord action and airflow, with
the acoustical measures. This equipment will permit students to demonstrate and
test experimentally the effect of articulatory and respiratory changes,
emotional state, and acoustic information on the perception of music and speech.
The goal of this improvement is to engage non-science majors in the scientific
study of speech and music by the presentation of compelling, immediately
accessible demonstrations and augmented interactive laboratory experiences.
Students working on independent projects in the psychophysics of music and
speech will also use the equipment.
