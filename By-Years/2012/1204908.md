Creating Plastics Technology Career Pathways in Rural Michigan is advancing
plastics technology and plastics workforce development throughout Michigan. The
project is linking Mid Michigan Community College with community and industry
leaders, the Clare-Gladwin Regional Educational Service District and Ferris
State University to ensure that students are progressing incrementally toward
academic credentials and sustainable employment in the local plastics industry.
The project's strategies are addressing gaps in current education and training
programs by: 1) formalizing an industrial alliance to provide curriculum
assistance, career awareness, and workforce experience; 2) developing a non-
credit training credential, an academic certificate, and an associates degree
with seamless transferability into a bachelors degree in plastics engineering
technology, and 3) recruiting and retaining students into a laddered program
that provides an array of hands-on and work experience options as well as the
integration of entrepreneurial instruction into the curriculum. This innovative
approach is addressing issues surrounding the state's manufacturing industries:
overt competition among companies for qualified employees, an aging workforce, a
shortage of applicants and incumbents with necessary skills, and a pervasive
stigma about manufacturing careers. This project is serving as a model to other
rural industries, demonstrating that progress can be made through collaborative,
proactive strategies. The project is also enhancing the capacity of educational
systems at all levels, comprehensively approaching workforce needs, broadening
participation by under-represented women, and building entrepreneurs who are
reinvigorating the region's economy.
