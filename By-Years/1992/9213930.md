This project measures the systematic differences in the intertemporal
allocation of consumption chosen by rich and the poor consumers and the impact
that those differences have on the intertemporal allocation of aggregate
consumption. The results of this research could provide important new insights
into the reasons why countries differ in economic growth rates, aggregate
consumption and savings. Previous work by the investigators demonstrates that
systematic differences in the attitudes of the rich and the poor toward the
allocation of their consumption expenditure over time can lead to significant
effects of the level and cross-sectional distribution of consumption on
aggregate consumption growth and saving. This project studies wealth based
variation in the intertemporal allocation of consumption caused by differences
in preferences and market imperfections. The research on differences in
preferences is a continuation of work by the investigators on measuring the
aggregate impact of differences in the intertemporal elasticity of substitution
(IES) across poor and rich consumers. The previous work assumed complete
markets. This project investigates whether or not preference parameters
estimated and estimates of the aggregate IES under the complete market
assumption is severely biased by simulating data from an economy with borrowing
constraints. Both differences in preferences and incompleteness of markets are
incorporated into the theoretical analysis. The project distinguished
empirically between different models of incomplete markets by testing whether
the idiosyncratic impact of unemployment and illness on consumption is temporary
or permanent.
