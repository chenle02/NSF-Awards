The proposed research is directed toward 1) identifying patterns of landscape
properties including soil texture; vegetation and micro- and macro-topography
and 2) determining the way in which these patterns influence hydrologic behavior
of a semi-arid catchment in eastern Washington state. Because variations in
these landscape properties occur at various scales, observations of the
distributions will be made at scales ranging from field mapping to low-and high-
altitude aerial photography. Spatial analysis techniques will be applied to
mathematically characterize patterns in the distributions of the hydrology-
affecting properties. Patterns at successive scales will then be superimposed in
an effort to determine how the interacting processes and their scale
dependencies reflect the basin hydrologic response. The distributions of the
hydrology-affecting properties on the landscape will be correlated to measured
hydrologic performance, emphasizing infiltration and soil moisture because
runoff is rare in the region. It is expected that these combinations of patterns
at various scales will be reflected in the dynamics of the hydrologic processes;
including infiltration, evapotranspiration, runoff, and recharge. Description of
landscape patterns and their properties at different scales, along with their
relationship to hydrologic processes, should provide insight into the mechanisms
by which landscape features and hydrologic processes interact.
