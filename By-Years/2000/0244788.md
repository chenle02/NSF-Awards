Supercomputer hardware, innovative numerical algorithms and a better
mathematical understanding of the nature of Einstein equations are bringing
closer the day in which simulations of binary black holes could routinely help
in extracting astrophysical information from data collected by interferometric
gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, VIRGO, GEO and LISA. The work in this
project has as main objective the numerical computation of the last few orbits
and the merger of binary black hole systems, as well as the extraction from
these simulations of information relevant to gravitational wave astronomy.
Explicit attention will be given to the needs of the data analysis community and
to the development of flexible and collaborative software
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is the
development and enhancement of infrastructure for collaborative research through
the creation of flexible and reusable software tools. These tools will be used
for numerical simulations in relativity and will contribute enriching the
learning environment for undergraduate and graduate student training. The
Pennsylvania State University, with its Centers for Gravitational Wave Physics
and for Gravitational Physics and Geometry, offers a unique opportunity for
synergy between diverse efforts ranging from computational physics through
numerical relativity, mathematical relativity and astrophysics, to gravitational
wave physics.
