Animals utilize a variety of strategies to survive when exposed to prolonged
periods of cold exposure. Some of these strategies involve maintaining body
temperature at "normal" levels; others involve allowing body temperature to
fall. The mechanisms associated with regulating the responses exposed animals as
well as those underlying the ability of the cells and tissues of these animals
to retain functional integrity are of intrinsic as well as practical interest.
This symposium will bring together scientists from around the world to discuss
the latest information regarding these mechanisms.
