The IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium, sponsored by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a top-tier venue for quick and
wide dissemination of cutting-edge research results in cyber-security and
privacy and has been for much of its 40-year history. Participation in this
symposium gives students the opportunity to showcase their research and network
with established researchers in the cyber security area. Such participation is
an important part of graduate education in cyber security. The 2019 IEEE
Security and Privacy Symposium will consist of approximately 60 technical papers
including several Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide a valuable
background to students who are starting out in specific research areas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides travel support to encourage
participation in the 2019 IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium and its Student
Program Committee meeting by students who would normally find it difficult to
attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the
field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Organizers
encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
