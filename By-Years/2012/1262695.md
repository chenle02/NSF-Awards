1262695 Hae-Kwon Jeong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 6th International Zeolite
Membrane Meeting (IZMM 2013) will be held between June 16th and 20th, 2013 on
Jeju Island, South Korea. The PI is requesting partial travel support for
participants from the US to attend this international meeting in the field of
molecular sieve membranes. The bulk of the requested funds will support travel
expenses for young investigators from the US. IZMM 2013 is the continuation of a
successful series of meetings including the IZMM conferences at Gifu, Japan
(1998), Purmerend , The Netherlands (2001), Breckenridge, Colorado (2004),
Zaragoza, Spain (2007), and Loutraki , Greece. In this focused meeting, the
scientists and engineers from both academia and industry around the world will
present, share, and discuss their recent findings, new ideas, and challenges
regarding the synthesis, characterization, and applications of membranes of
zeolites and related molecular sieves including metal-organic frameworks, an
emerging class of nanoporous materials. Emerging applications of zeolite films
as membrane-, nano- and micro-reactors for applications in the chemical,
petrochemical, and biorefinery industries and as components of fuel cells and
electronic devices will be discussed. Broader Impacts: Emphasis will be placed
on the technological and scientific challenges that should be overcome for
further commercial development of zeolite-film-based products to solve important
societal and technological problems. Participants will identify the future
challenges for research in this rapidly evolving field. The meeting will provide
the means for young faculty and graduate students to present their work and
establish themselves in the international community with the expectation that it
will catalyze the formation of international collaborations.
