St. Ambrose University requests support from NSF for connection of its campus
to CICnet as an affiliate member through the University of Iowa. CICNet is the
midlevel network located in this part of the state of Iowa that will provide
operations and network information services. It will give the colleges a 56
thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
million bits per second) National Backbone network. The colleges need greater
functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries,
and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail
system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a
unique opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
