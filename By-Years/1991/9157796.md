Glow discharge (plasma) processing plays a large role in the semiconductor
industry. The overall goal of this research is to be able to operate and develop
plasma processes better by having (1) increased understanding of the physical
phenomena, (2) predictive simulation techniques, and (3) more easily-applied
experimental diagnostics. Studying electron and ion concentrations in plasma
discharges is a major thrust of this project because these charged particles
affect gas-phase reactions and surface phenomena. The goal is to develop non-
intrusive techniques to determine electron and ion concentrations and energies
in industrially-used reactors. The PI also plans to model charged particles in
plasmas. One goal is to create a model that predicts electron and ion energies
and concentrations in radio-frequency plasmas. The other goal is to examine and
optimize the solution techniques for the model equations. Besides charged-
particle analysis, he will examine the reactions of charge-neutral species in
the discharge. One long term goal of this modeling is finding a practical way of
predicting creation rates of neutral species from electron-molecule collisions
as a function of discharge operating parameters. Another goal is to develop
experimental techniques, especially frequency response analysis, for determining
the applicable rate constants in an operating system. The above will be applied
to the low-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of nitrides and
oxides and oxygen/nitrogen plasmas for cleaning electronic parts.
