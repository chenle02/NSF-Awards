This research is to study earthquake fault behavior and regional deformation by
means of newly developed theoretical techniques. These methods invert geodetic
elevation changes, triangulation measurements, VLBI baseline data and tide gauge
observations to recover the location and intensity of slip on shallow earthquake
faults. The goal is to develop quantitative pictures of coseismic, postseismic
and interseismic strain accumulation and release. This research is a component
of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
