Through this project, the College of Human Biology at the university is
developing a progressive approach to teaching the Human Anatomy component of the
curriculum. This approach involves the use of contemporary multimedia technology
with traditional cadaver dissections. The increase in the number of students
entering Allied Heath and Health Science professions has increased the demand
for these courses. The advancements provide students with hands-on training
through cadaver dissections complemented with state-of-the-art computer
simulations in the areas of gross and microscopic anatomy. The requested
equipment allows for major improvements in those courses where human anatomy is
a significant portion of the subject matter: Kinesiology, Comparative Anatomy of
Vertebrates, Anatomy and Physiology, and Microscopic Anatomy (which is offered
as an Independent Study). The requested equipment also allows for the
development of a new course, Advanced Human Anatomy. These improvements enhance
student learning by increasing involvement, interaction, and interest with the
material. Students also benefit from the hands-on and technological experiences
that are critical for success in the Allied Health and Health Science
professions.
