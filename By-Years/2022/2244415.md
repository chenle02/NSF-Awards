With support from this grant, SIAM Interdisciplinary Conferences in Applied and
Computational Mathematics, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics
(SIAM) will organize and run a series of conferences and workshops in the
mathematical and computational sciences. These SIAM conferences form an
important part of the research, education, and technology transfer
infrastructure for the mathematical and computational sciences. SIAM conferences
and workshops provide a welcoming environment for scientists and engineers to
establish the collaborations that are required for interdisciplinary research.
The funding from this grant will support travel of students, early career
professionals and invited speakers to the conferences, and video capture and
dissemination of key conference presentations.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIAM conferences and workshops are highly
interdisciplinary and foster the communication of the latest fundamental and
applied research and applications to mathematical and computational scientists,
physical and social scientists, and engineers from academia, industry, and
government. SIAM conferences are designed to identify and disseminate knowledge
of emerging areas of research. A sampling of conferences to be held during the
award period include those on the following topics: Computational Science and
Engineering, Financial Mathematics and Engineering, Imaging Science, Life
Sciences, Mathematical Aspects of Material Science, Mathematics of Data Science,
and Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
