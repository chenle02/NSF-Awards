AST 0206038&lt;br/&gt;Touma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last decade, thanks to
high-resolution observations of galactic nuclei by the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST), supermassive black holes (SBHs) have been detected in two dozen or so
galaxies (including the Milky Way). These detections rely on the measurement of
the appreciable dynamical effects that a black hole exerts on nearby gas and
stars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Touma will conduct a detailed study of stellar
dynamics around SBHs in galactic nuclei. This study will bolster detection
efforts through careful dynamical modeling of kinematic observations. It will
also help to clarify the role that a SBHs play in shaping features found in the
central regions of the host galaxy. Finally, it will shed some light on
questions relating to the origin and evolution of SBHs. In particular, it will
involve a thorough analysis of a violent instability that Dr. Touma has recently
identified. This instability affects stellar disks which are dominated by a SBH
in their center, and which harbor a small proportion of counter-rotating stars.
The instability distorts the disk into a lopsided shape and promises to explain
the lopsided nucleus of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), which harbors an SBH, and is
suspected of supporting a small percentage of counter-rotating
stars.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
