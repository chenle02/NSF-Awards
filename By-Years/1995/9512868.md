9512868 Ginter This award will provide travel support, over a period of two
years, to assist a team of four American investigators under the leadership of
Prof. Marshall Ginter, Institute for Physical Science and Technology at the
University of Maryland, to conduct collaborative research with a team of
researchers from the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the
Australian National University under the direction of Dr. Kenneth Baldwin. The
project focuses on vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption measurements. The
researchers are all active investigators working with UV and VUV spectroscopy.
It is anticipated that the collaboration will provide important new information
on the importance of these spectroscopic studies in both atmospheric
applications and the more fundamental sciences and will assist in identifying
and reducing systematic instrumental errors which limit the accuracy of current
metrology in the VUV. Among the tools to be used in this study are long focal
length spectrographs, Fourier transform spectometers, synchrotron radiation
sources, and precision laser systems. The work in Australian is supported
through the Department of Industry, Science and Technology.
