This is a grant to support a professor and four graduate students in four
separate activities. The primary one involves the SMC experiment at CERN in
Switzerland in which the spin properties of the neutron and proton are studied
using a beam of polarized muons. In another experiment, the Large Volume
Detector (LVD) is being assembled in a large underground laboratory in Italy
(Grand Sasso). This experiment is intended to detect neutrinos from space, and
to search for effects due to changes (oscillations) in their identities. The
other two activities involve technological developments in high temperature
superconducting magnet design and in the production of devices capable of the
detection of muons suitable for use in a new detector (GEM) to be used at the
Superconducting Super Collider (SSC).
