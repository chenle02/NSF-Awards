Benthic bacteria are increasingly perceived as the most important component of
benthic carbon cycles, yet little is known about benthic bacterial activity in
polar marine basins. Deming proposes to evaluate benthic bacterial processes and
fate of organic matter in the faunally rich Greenland Basin, and the
oligotrophic Norwegian Basin. Specific topics to be addressed include: 1)
bacterial biomass and distribution, and comparisons with temperate basins of
similar depths; 2) rates of use for labile dissolved organic carbon, production
of extracellular enzymes to hydrolize more refractory carbon sources, and growth
at the sub-zero temperatues and elevated pressures of these arctic basins; 3)
bacterial use of sediment organic carbon compared with total benthic demand, and
comparison of benthic bacterial significance to carbon cycles in polar basins
and in warmer basins; and 4) extent to which bacterial community structure, sub-
zero temperatures, and elevated pressures determine rates of bacterial activity
in polar basins. Results will be evaluated within the context of total benthic
biological carbon utilization. Overall results will provide important
information on the fate of organic carbon and new insight into the constraints
that temperature and pressure place on bacterial activity in high-latitude and
deep-sea environments.
