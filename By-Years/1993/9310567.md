9310567 Islam The possibility and properties of solitons in semiconductor wave
guides will be studied theoretically and experimentally. Solitons arise in
optical fibers due to the balance between group-velocity dispersion and the
nonlinearity, and they are interesting because they are self-trapped, robust
pulses that act in many ways like particles or fundamental data bits. Just as
solitons are valuable for long distance telecommunications and all optical
switching in fibers, solitons in semiconductors will be important for integrated
optics and compact, integrable, all-optical switches. Using solitons in
integrated optics can obviate the need for low-dispersion strip-line structures,
which are being studied for short pulse propagation. Recently, major advances
have been made in ultrafast switching and networks using solitons in optical
fibers. Two approaches will be pursued to demonstrate semiconductor solitons.
First, semiconductor waveguides will be used below half of the energy gap to
avoid effects from two-photon absorption. The nonlinearity below half-gap will
be balanced by the dispersion from a periodic, corrugated surface, producing so-
called "gap solitons". In a second approach, the nonlinearity can be enhanced by
nearly three orders-of-magnitude by using a resonant nonlinearity at the
transparency point in a semiconductor amplifier. Calculations show the
feasibility of demonstrating a soliton by balancing the resonant nonlinearity
with the material group-velocity dispersion near band gap, and current injection
is used to counter both linear and nonlinear absorption. ***
