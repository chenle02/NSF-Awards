9307956 Maslak A study of mesolysis will be undertaken, which is the cleavage of
radical ions to radicals and ions. The relationship between activation energy
for mesolytic reactions and the free energy change for different modes of bond
rupture and electron apportionment to products will be explored. The project
will include probing solvent effects and ion pairing as well as a search for a
Marcus-type inverted region for highly exergonic reactions. Redox potentials of
radicals, ions, and radical ions will be measured by several methods and used to
develop an empirical relation to evaluate redox potentials that are necessary to
calculate thermodynamic quantities of mesolytic reactions. A unifying
theoretical treatment of unimolecular dissociation reactions in solution will be
developed from these results, where the goal is a master equation that governs
these reactions. Mesolysis will also be studied by semiempirical and ab initio
molecular calculations in order to evaluate pertinent stereoelectronic and
charge delocalization aspects. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program
supports the continuing work of Professor Przemyslaw B. Maslak at Pennsylvania
State University. Bond breaking in molecules that contain either a positive or
negative charge and a radical center (an unpaired electron on an atom) will be
studied. The effect of solvent and pairing of these radical ions will be
considered in this study as well as special effects when the reaction is highly
favored. The energetics of transferring an electron to or from radical ions,
radicals, and ions will be determined and these data will be correlated with the
rate of bond breaking of the radical ions to give a master equation that governs
these reactions. ***
