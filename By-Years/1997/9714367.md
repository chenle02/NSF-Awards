PROJECT SUMMARY The dynamics of the fully-developed axisymmetric far jet using
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) techniques will be investigated
experimentally. The overall goal is to obtain a better understanding of the
structure of the far jet, and the degree to which its evolution is foreshadowed
by the near jet. The experiment has two specific objective: * First, POD
techniques will be applied to extensive measurements of the velocity cross-
spectra in order to determine the eigenfunctions describing the far jet. *
Second, the eigenfunctions determined will be used to reconstruct the
instantaneous flow, both spatially and temporally, in whole or in part. The
investigation will use two unique experimental apparatus: one a 138 hot-wire
probe developed earlier to study the jet mixing layer; the other a flying array
of 15 hot-wire, the spacing of which changes with downstream distance from the
jet exit. These techniques will be used in conjunction the known one- and two-
point similarity properties of the far jet to determine the spatial and temporal
evolution of the POD eigenfunction which comprise the flow (including their
streamwise dependence)
