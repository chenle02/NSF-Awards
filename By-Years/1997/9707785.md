ABSTRACT 97-07785 Turchin Dispersal as a mechanistic basis for landscape
ecology: The role of scale and heterogeneity In recent years it has become clear
that understanding spatial dynamics of populations, including the effects of
habitat fragmentation, is critical for developing better methods of managing
natural resources. Landscape ecology has developed approaches for describing
environmental patterns in space, while population ecology has a strong tradition
of research on mechanisms that underlie these patterns. This project will bridge
these two directions in ecology, using a simple organism in a simple
environment. The study organism, a terrestrial isopod ("pillbug"), has a simple
biology, and its environment, the Negev Desert of Israel, provides a simplified
landscape with a clear limiting factor, water. This research will focus on
dispersal as the most important mechanism explaining isopod spatial distribution
in relation to the distribution of resources. Studying this system will yield
general insights into how spatial population dynamics work, and will eventually
lead to better understanding of more complex ecological systems.
