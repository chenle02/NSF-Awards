The workshop Women in Numbers 4 will take place from August 14 to 18, 2017 at
the Banff International Research Station. This workshop is the fourth in a
series of research collaboration conferences for women in number theory. The
format differs from a typical conference in that much of the time is reserved
for collaboration in small groups. The specific goals of this conference are:
produce significant and impactful research in number theory, broaden the
research programs of women in number theory, especially of those who are pre-
tenure, train female graduate students and postdocs by providing experience with
collaborative research and the publication process, strengthen and extend a
collaborative research network of women in number theory and related fields,
enable women who are faculty at small colleges to participate actively in
research activities, and highlight research activities of women in number
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will support the continued
development of the community of women in number theory by bringing together
researchers at various stages of their careers (from graduate students to senior
mathematicians) for research collaboration and mentoring. The scientific focus
of the workshop is on cutting-edge topics in number theory, including Apollonian
circle packings, arithmetic dynamics, the Chabauty-Coleman method, computational
aspects of supersingular elliptic curves, mock modular forms, Newton polygons on
the Torelli locus, sieve techniques in analytic number theory, supersingular
isogeny graphs in cryptography, and torsion subgroups on elliptic
&lt;br/&gt;curves. More information is available at
