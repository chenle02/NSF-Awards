As scientists continue to produce data from experiments, sensors, and
simulations, the next challenge is in analyzing and visualizing the results.
Addressing this issue is not just a problem of technology nor of simply
deploying larger computers and data storage devices; (future) scientists need to
develop the skills to effectively take advantage of the latest resources for
advancing scientific discoveries.

The Remote Data Analysis and Visualization Center (RDAV) is well-situated to
address essential issues in workforce development by developing and providing a
robust learning opportunity for undergraduate students. RDAV students work on
developing software to address computational problems stemming from active
projects in science and engineering and proposed by researchers who have been
allocated computation time on RDAV?s Nautilus hardware. Experience with these
hardware and software resources are each, separately, uncommon skills that
undergraduates seldom encounter; the combination is extremely rare. These
projects integrate experience working with high performance computing hardware
as well as the specialized software tools used in scientific domains. Students
gain important applicable skills in computational science.
