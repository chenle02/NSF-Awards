This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the efforts of Dr. Klaus Theopold of the University of Delaware
on the reaction chemistry of low-valent organometallic compounds of chromium,
with particular emphasis on the catalysis of selective ethylene oligomerization.
The paramagnetic chromacycles (heterocycles containing chromium ligated by beta-
diketiminate (nacnac) ligands) of various ring sizes have been synthesized.
These molecules are investigated in terms of their selectivity with respect to
elimination versus ring expansion. Chromium complexes supported by non-innocent
diimine ligands are also used for studies of metallacycle reactivity with
ethylene. The charge and formal oxidation state of the metal impacts the
ethylene oligomerization reaction.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is
fundamental in nature but may have practical impact on commercial catalyst
development. Selective catalytic processes such as those developed here are
inherently more sustainable and environmentally benign, as they avoid the
production of undesirable byproducts and are more energy efficient.
Undergraduate and graduate students experience varied research methodology and
gain a strong background in synthetic and mechanistic chemistry, which is in
high demand in the chemical industry.
