0345813&lt;br/&gt;Marone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from this grant will
facilitate construction of a custom-design biaxial deformation apparatus that
will allow for fundamental studies of the behavior of earth materials at upper-
to mid-crustal temperatures, pressures, and pore fluid conditions when subjected
to fault zone stresses. Pressure vessels, a load frame, and hydrothermal control
systems will be built in-house at Penn State using existing machine shop and
electronics equipment and expertise. The system will be assembled by a dedicated
technician within a two-year time period under the supervision of PI Chris
Marone. Study of the properties of earth materials under realistic earthquake
hypocentral conditions will greatly improve our understanding of earthquake
fault rupture initiation processes. Relevant experimental data is sparse and
successful development of this apparatus will add new empirical data to the
field of rock mechanics. Experimental data that will be obtained with this
device is highly complementary to planned in situ observation of the mechanical
and physical environment experienced by San Andreas fault zone materials (i.e.,
the SAFOD drilling project).&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
