The goal of this project is to define a general formal model for reasoning
about real-time and distributed systems, and to establish its value by using it
for a variety of purposes. Many models have been proposed for such systems; this
project is unique in that it attempts to define a single model that can be used
for many different purposes. The uses for such a model include: (1) proving
fundamental results about the capabilities of real-time and distributed systems.
These include upper and lower bound complexity results (for time, space and
communication complexity) and impossibility results: (2) describing real
systems, using appropriate programming languages; (3) specifying allowable
system behavior; (4) verifying (by hand or by machine) the correctness of
algorithms and systems. There are different styles of verification, of which
assertional, algebraic and temporal logic methods are probably the most
significant; and (5) analyzing system performance. Traditionally, research in
each of these areas has been based on a semantic model designed specifically for
that area. In contrast, this project aims to conduct work in these areas in
terms of a common model. The project focuses particularly on real-time and other
timing-based systems (e.g., communication systems and real-time process control
systems).
