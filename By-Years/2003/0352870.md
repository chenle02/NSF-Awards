This award provides support for the participation of ten US graduate students in
a school at&lt;br/&gt;the Newton institute in Cambridge, England on "Random
Matrix Theory and Number Theory." This school will be part of the program on
"Random Matrix Theory approaches in Number Theory" which will run at the Newton
institute from January through July 2004. Many of the worlds leading experts in
this field will give lectures at the school which will provide the students
participating access to a current and very active research topics at the
boundary of Number Theory and Physics. &lt;br/&gt;
