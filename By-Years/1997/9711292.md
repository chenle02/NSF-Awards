This project will investigate job-search strategies used by college graduating
seniors who are seeking their first full-time, post-collegiate jobs. Unlike most
studies of social stratification or social mobility, which focus on the
structure of mobility or the influence of antecedent conditions on outcomes,
this study will focus on the processes through which social positioning occurs.
The overarching hypothesis is that social resources, such as high-status
personal contacts, play a substantial role in the intergenerational transmission
of status, even among a relatively advantaged segment of the young adult
population. The analysis will proceed in two parts, combining a secondary
analysis of the longitudinal Baccalaureate and Beyond survey with interview data
obtained from face-to-face interviews with recent college graduates.
