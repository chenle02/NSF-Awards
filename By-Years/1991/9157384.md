This Software Capitalization award supports the development and implementation
of algorithms for manipulating sets of linear constraints over integer
variables. The resulting software is used for array data dependence analysis,
among other purposes. A preliminary version of these algorithms is used for
dependence analysis, and is quite powerful and capable of being used in a
production compilers. The software is distributed freely.
