Data-driven decision making is changing society. Political candidates now
collate and analyze databases to identify possible campaign supporters. Couples
now meet online through matchmaking websites that pair individuals based on
profiles and questionnaires. Marketers now fine-tune their messages based on
fine-grain market segmentation provided by extensive web and social network
signals. Companies&lt;br/&gt;now develop products based on A/B testing or
measured customer behavior. However, the diffusion of the basic software
platforms and algorithms for analytics has been uneven. Large firms can afford
to hire programmers and data scientists to run sophisticated analytics, but most
organizations cannot afford the large capital and operational expenses to
maintain analytics infrastructure. This leaves them&lt;br/&gt;out of the
potentially transformative impact of data-driven decision making. This proposal
expands the space of high-performance machine learning by harnessing a more
general and more efficient parallel programming
platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large capital expense stems from the lack of
a turnkey solution for predictive analytics. Applications are ad-hoc, developed
anew based on specific organizational requirements. The large operational
expense arises from the data demand of these applications, which requires many
machine-hours to produce results. The team has developed a reusable software
platform that can parallelize analytics applications with orders of magnitude
performance improvements and can run with a fraction of the hardware resources
compared to commonly deployed commercial products. On top of this platform, the
team has begun to develop a suite of state-of-the-art massively scalable machine
learning algorithms. Through the course of this project, the team intends to
broadly engage with potential customers of data analytics to help understand
possible business models for the proposed technology.
