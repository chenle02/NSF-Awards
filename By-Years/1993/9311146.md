9311146 Schlom This proposal is for equipment which allow the synthesis of
custom-made epitaxial heterostructures uniquely suited to investigating physical
phenomena and testing novel device concepts through the use of a controlled film
growth environment in which the growth process of oxides may be closely
monitored and optimized. The equipment is simple molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
machine for the controlled epitaxial growth of oxides. ***
