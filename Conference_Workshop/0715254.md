Abstract

Award: DMS-0715254 Principal Investigator: Stavros Garoufalidis, Thang T. Q. Le

This award provides partial support for participants in the International
Conference on Quantum Topology to be held in Ha Noi, Vietnam, in August 2007.
The conference aims to educate junior researchers in Quantum Topology, discuss
new developments in the area, and bring together different points of view of
Geometry, Topology, Algebra and Quantum Field Theory. Scientific themes of the
conference include quantum invariants of knots and links, Heegard Floer
homology, Khovanov homology, asymptotic statements for quantum invariants
(including the widely--studied Volume Conjecture), and geometric topology of
three--manifolds.

Quantum topology grew out of ideas and theorems of physicists and mathematicians
in the 1980s and 1990s on relations between quantum field theories and geometry.
That work introduced a number of new algebraic and combinatorial devices to
describe and attempt to distinguish low-dimensional spaces such as the
complement of a knotted curve in three-dimensional Euclidean space. This
conference will bring together old and new aspects of quantum topology to add to
our understanding of these tools and to uncover new problems for research in the
field. See the conference web site at
