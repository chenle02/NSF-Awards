This project investigates the introduction of ambitious program analysis and
program restructuring techniques into automatic program optimization systems,
with the goal of significantly improving the quality of code produced by
compilers for modern computer architectures. Although a variety of compiler
optimization techniques exist, they are not used to their full extent in
production compilers because, the analysis and transformations are
computationally intensive. In addition, the information obtained by analyses
must be maintained and updated across the various compiler passes and program
transformations. The project relies on the previous work on ``sparse'' data flow
frameworks and explores three methods for overcoming the current limitations to
using ambitious program analyses in production compilers: (1) decomposing a
dense data flow framework into an interconnected set of sparse data flow
frameworks, (2) selectively computing and using costly information on behalf of
a particular program optimization. and (3) integrating program analysis and
transformation.
