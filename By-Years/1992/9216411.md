In this project, the principal investigator will support WOCE cruise P-17N in
the Northeast Pacific Ocean, by collecting and analyzing direct velocity
measurements of upper ocean currents using a shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler (ADCP) and navigation data from the Global Positioning System (GPS)
satellite system. Combined with the many other data sets on P- 17N, these data
will be used to address zonal redistribution of heat in the North Pacific, and
heat, freshwater, and nutrient fluxes in the eastern boundary.
