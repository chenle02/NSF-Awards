The objective of this Project is to study some of the Internet routing
vulnerabilities, especially in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) domain, and
propose a resilient routing framework. This research develops models, metrics
and algorithms as well as validates the results with real traces and scenarios
to achieve the reliable IBGP (Internal BGP) reflection topology design, network
availability assessment, and routing survivability. Router and link failures,
errors in human maintenance, and changes in resource availability lead to
reliability variations on different routers, links and IGP (Interior Gateway
Protocol) paths. Furthermore, IBGP is organized currently using clusters and
route reflection topology, where different reflector and clients configurations
have different reliability in IBGP operation. It is therefore important to
deploy IBGP sessions on IGP paths that are more reliable, as well as place
reflectors on reliable routers to avoid reflector failures and client
isolations. In terms of network availability it is of crucial importance to
address and manage resource availability as dynamic information, as well as to
develop a QoS representation that can handle heterogeneity in global Internet
routing. This project will develop methods of how to efficiently manage resource
availability during route upgrading and link repairs. Finally, this project
introduces a new trustworthiness model and light-weighted authentication to
increase routers immunity to bad route advertising and misbehaving neighbors.
