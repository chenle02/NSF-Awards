Digital replication is a new, rapid reverse engineering process for making
highly detailed three dimensional electronic models of physical objects through
the use of X-Ray Computerized Tomography (CT) scanning. With current industrial
CT technology, Digital Replica of small objects (24 in3) can be generated in a
few hours. The resulting surface model is accurate and captures all part
details, but it is not compatible with conventional computer aided design (CAD)
modeling systems. The main objective of this project is to develop CAD
interfaces to organize the surface data points into a more structured curve and
surface representation, such as the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) form,
which can be converted into standard CAD data exchange formats, such as IGES,
and PDES standards. The system will provide a means to rapidly generate CAD
models from existing parts for which CAD data is missing or incomplete. In
addition to the analytic representation for curve and surface, the solid model
requires the establishment of higher level geometrical and topological features
for describing both external and internal structural shapes of the solid object.
Features such as holes, slots or pockets, that may be easily identified in both
inspection and manufacturing processes will be used.
