Phenotype conversion of wild-type Pseudomonas solanacearum, which results in PC-
type strains, appears to be an irreversible genetic process that coordinately
regulates a variety of diverse traits. We have cloned a region from a P.
solanacearum wild-type strain that complements the defect in several PC-type
strains. This regulator of phenotype conversion (rpc) locus appears to encode
one or more trans-acting regulatory factors. The overall objectives of this
research is to investigate the genetic basis of phenotype conversion and how
this locus regulates the expression of other genes. The location and size of the
wild-type rpc genes will mapped using a variety of standard techniques. The
direction of transcription will be determined by making lac fusions, and the
proteins encoded by these genes will be examined by maxicell analysis. Deletions
in the control region of the positively regulated egl gene, which encodes a
secreted endoglucanase enzyme, will be examined in vivo to locate the activator
binding site, and the possibility that rpc encodes an activator protein will be
explored in vitro with DNA-binding gel retardation assays. The altered rpc locus
will be isolated from a PC-type strain and compared to the wild-type locus after
DNA sequencing to determine the genetic changes that occur during phenotype
conversion. The long term goal of this research is to learn more about
regulation of gene expression in phytopathogenic bacteria and thereby increase
our understanding of host-pathogen interactions.
