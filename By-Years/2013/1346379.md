Computers in Scientific Discovery 7 (CSD7) is an interdisciplinary workshop that
will bring together researchers with expertise in chemistry, graph theory,
combinatorics, the generation of combinatorial structures, and automated
conjecture making in order to make computational and theoretical advances in
chemistry. The workshop will be held at Virginia Commonwealth University,
Richmond, VA from August 04, 2014 to August 08, 2014. CSD7 is the 7th in this
series. The previous six CSD workshops took place in six different
countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry is the study of matter and its
transformations, and it is an experimental science, but chemical theory has an
underlying mathematical structure. Carbon is the most versatile of chemical
elements in combining with itself to form chains, rings, sheets, cages and
periodic 3D structures. New forms of carbon, discovered in the past two decades,
have potential applications in molecular electronics, chemistry and materials
science. Exploitation of these opportunities will depend on collaborations of
scientists from many disciplines. CSD7 provides the ideal venue for establishing
these collaborations, allowing young researchers to meet and interact with
senior experts in their fields.
