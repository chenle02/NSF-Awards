van Leer 9711050 The investigator and colleagues organize an international
symposium on Godunov-type methods, which are widely used to compute continuum
processes dominated by wave propagation. The conference gives an overview of the
current state of development and use of Godunov-type methods in science and
engineering, and it offers a perspective of their future development and use.
The symposium brings together senior researchers who are experts in the
development and use of Godunov-type methods, junior researchers who are
currently making significant contributions in this field, graduate students just
entering the field, and other interested individuals. It also includes experts
from application areas. Many important physical problems involve flow of a
compressible fluid; they can be described by differential equations whose
solutions have jumps in their values. Computing such a solution is usually
difficult. Godunov-type methods are a class of methods that compute the solution
by making particular local approximations to it, moving the local approximations
forward in time, and piecing together these advanced values in certain ways.
Extensions of the original method include higher accuracy in time or in space,
higher-dimensional problems, problems with more complicated equations. This
meeting is devoted to recent developments in Godunov methods, including not only
mathematical and numerical advances but also advances in applications areas.
Examples are mesoscale meteorology, the modeling of plasma flows arising in the
heliosphere, and a variety of engineering fluid flows.
