Considerable evidence suggests that women are almost twice as likely as men to
experience depression. There is little evidence, however, as to how this sex
difference develops. Because a number of studies have shown that the sex
difference in depression first occurs during adolescence, it has been assumed
that the difference reflects changes occurring at this time. Yet, there is
evidence to suggest that the difference may emerge prior to adolescence. As
early as elementary school, girls evaluate themselves more negatively than do
boys, especially in the face of failure. This may lead to depression during
adolescence when children make the transition from elementary to junior high
school and when failure is often more common. Consistent with this proposal,
depression does appear to increase among girls, but not boys, following such
transitions. The major goal of the proposed research is to examine the social
factors that cause girls to evaluate themselves more negatively than boys, and
consequently to be more vulnerable to depression. To this end, the research
investigates whether parents' gender stereotypes cause parents to exert more
control over their daughters than over their sons. Importantly, the research
also investigates the role that such a gender socialization plays in the
development of sex differences in self-evaluation and consequent depression. The
proposed study employs a longitudinal design in which children's reaction to a
school transition both before and after adolescence is examined. The results
yielded by the proposed research will elucidate the social underpinnings of the
development of sex differences in self-evaluation and consequent depression as
well as the development of these phenomena in general. Hence, the research will
provide basic knowledge which may ultimately be used to develop intervention
programs to prevent depression in children of both sexes.
