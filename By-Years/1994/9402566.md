9402566 Falzarano This project deals with the analysis of multiple degrees-of
freedom on forced ship rolling using geometric methods. The major emphasis of
the project is on the coupling effect of other motion modes on the critical roll
motion leading to improved dynamic models. Analytical techniques used include
Poincar maps, invariant manifold intersections, Melnikov vectors and lobe
dynamics. The effects of yaw coupling on sway and roll are also considered.
Systems of dimensions greater than three are considered and a development of
decoupling and projection techniques is emphasized which allows visualization in
lower dimensional spaces without neglecting significant dynamic details. Slowly
varying systems and nonlinear normal modes are utilized for computer
simulations. ***
