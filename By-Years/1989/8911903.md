The Cornell University Insect Collections are among the country's oldest and
largest repositories for systematic entomology. Dr. James Liebherr, Curator of
Coleoptera, proposes a program of collection reorganization and improvement.
Specimens will be reorganized into taxonomic order and outdated storage
equipment will be replaced. Type specimens will be removed to more secure
storage and a computerized database of types will be implemented. The proposed
collection improvement will have a significant effect on teaching and research
at Cornell. Visiting investigators will have improved access to the collections,
and loans to other researchers will be facilitated. Undergraduate and graduate
students will be involved in the improvement program, adding to their
professional development as entomologists and museum scientists.
