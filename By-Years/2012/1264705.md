1264705(Vogel). Rapid and sensitive detection of bovine respiratory disease
(BRD)-associated viral infections in live animals is recognized as key to
minimizing the impact of this disease. Currently, the most common method of
serological diagnosis is fluorescently labeled ELISAs. ELISA-based testing is
limited as it typically relies on the detection of a single viral antibody
subtype within an individual test sample per ELISA plate, the testing is
relatively slow (up to 1 week) and expensive (~$5 per test). A low-cost
multiplexed platform capable of detecting several antibody markers related to
BRD infections in the same test assay would offer significant economic benefits
for routine serological testing. Additionally, rapid on-farm ?cowside?
multiplexed diagnostic capabilities would be a major step forward towards more
efficient and effective management, control and/or eradication of BRD-associated
pathogens. At present there is no electronic field based test for disease
diagnostics available commercially for the animal health sector, let alone for
BRD. Our team will address these challenges by building inexpensive
electrochemical sensors for detection of biomarkers associated with BRD
infection.
