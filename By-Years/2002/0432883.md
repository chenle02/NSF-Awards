This grant supports acquisition of a combined Alternating Gradient Magnetometer
(AGM)/ Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) system that will be used to study the
hysteresis behavior of magnetic properties of mineral carriers in geological
materials in the Paleomagnetics Laboratory at the University Florida. Hysteresis
behavior of parameters such as susceptibility and coercivity provide clues for
the identification of magnetic minerals, magnetic grain size and domain state.
An understanding of the magnetic mineralogy, grain size and domain state of the
magnetic carriers in sedimentary archives and rocks are critical for accurately
interpreting magnetic remanence directional and paleointensity records that can
allow for high resolution stratigraphic correlation, plate tectonic
reconstructions and elucidation of the past behavior of Earth's magnetic field.
In addition, magnetic mineralogy and grain size are useful parameters for
interpretation of paleoenvironmental conditions. The AGM/VSM will complement
existing paleomagnetic equipment in the Department of Geological Sciences and
offer new analytical opportunities for faculty and student research. ***
