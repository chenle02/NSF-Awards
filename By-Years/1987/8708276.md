Funds are requested to support the purchase of a state-of- the-art Scanning
Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) to be installed in a University of
Michigan laboratory. The University of Michigan and the Department of Geological
Sciences are supporting this proposal with 50% cost-sharing on the instrument
purchase and with the laboratory operating and support budgets. The STEM will be
made available for research by all University faculty, with emphasis on research
in earth sciences and materials science. Geological research supported will
emphasize aspects of clay mineralogy, metamorphic processes, and the role of
fluids in rock deformation at low strain rates.
