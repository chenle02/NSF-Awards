Software performance is critical for how end users perceive the quality of the
deployed software. Performance problems, also called "performance bugs",
typically correspond to software faults that create significant performance
degradation. Much evidence shows that seemingly harmless performance problems
can lead to severe scalability reductions and financial losses. This project
develops a set of new techniques and tools that can significantly improve
performance testing and debugging.

Specifically, the project focuses on three key challenges. First, what are
common patterns of performance bugs and how can these patterns be detected
during testing, before they manifest in production runs? Second, how to ensure
that code changes for adding new features, fixing bugs, or even improving
performance do not have unintended consequence of decreasing performance? Third,
how to find causes of performance bugs from testing runs, regression checks, and
in-field execution traces? The broader impacts of the project are that improved
performance testing and debugging can substantially increase the quality of the
deployed software and thus the quality of life in a modern society that heavily
depends on software.
