ABSTRACT ATM 9714995 Leaman, Kevin D. University of Miami TITLE: Analysis of
Precipitation Variations at Periods of the Tropical Intraseasonal Oscillation in
the Isthmus of Panama. This proposed work will explore the nature of
intraseasonal fluctuations in precipitation over Panama by analyzing a data set
of 30 years (1965-1994) of daily rainfall from Panama Canal Commission (PCC)
with an extension back to 1905 from a subset of six stations. The question of
whether this oscillation is local or is related to global Tropical Intraseasonal
Oscillation will be probed. Relevant satellite data will also be analyzed. The
successful completion of this work will add new knowledge about the mechanisms
responsible for intraseasonal variability of rainfall over Panama and at a
minimum it will bring to public domain an important data set, the PCC
precipitation data set.
