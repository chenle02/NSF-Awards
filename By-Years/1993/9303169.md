Three problems in gastropod biology serve as the focus for this research on
metamorphosis and morphological diversity. First, development and functional
significance of modifications to shell apertures of many marine gastropod
species when in the planktic veliger larval stage (the sinusigeral larval form)
will be studied. Second, developmental causes of an unusual mechanical
deformation occurring in larval shells of some primitive marine gastropod
species are to be investigated. A third topic relates to characterizing and
evaluating the diversity of sequential events and timing involved in development
of trochoidean gastropods, with the specific goal of translating data into
characters and character states useful for phylogenetic analysis; such
descriptors should be useful in tandem with more traditional morphological
characters. %%% This work will inform persistent and unresolved problems of
molluscan evolutionary morphology. The first two problems reside in the realm of
functional and evolutionary interpretation of features of the larval shell and
its relationship to the adult shell, for which solutions require developmental
information gathered in a comparative systematic way. Both questions are
relevant to phenomena observable in shells of living and fossil gastropods.
Addressing the third problem would cultivate a consistent language of characters
and character states that translate the rich vocabulary of developmental biology
into a language for systematics and phylogenetic analysis.
