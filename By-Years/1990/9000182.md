The calculation of paleomagnetic poles from seamount magnetic anomalies
involves several simplifying assumptions concerning the source of magnetization
of the seamount. In 1987, the principal investigators received funding for an
integrated geochemcial, petrological, and paleomagnetic study of representative
seamount lithologies to test these assumptions. Dredge samples from Jasper
seamount and oriented samples from an uplifted seamount sequence exposed on La
Palma, Canary islands were studied. This study will continue to: 1) augment the
data set with analyses from several other seamounts and oceanic island exposures
to assess the general applicability of the current data set, 2) characterize
further the geological, mineralogical, and geochemical boundary conditions for
the samples already analyzed, 3) study the effects of metamorphism on magnetic
properties, and 4) apply the results to the analysis of seamount magnetic
anomaly data.
