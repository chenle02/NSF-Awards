This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Joan Macy of the
University of California at Davis and Professor B.W. Holloway, Monash
University, Melbourne. The objective of the research is to better understand the
molecular genetic and physiological basis of selenate to selenite reduction in
order to investigate microbiological removal of toxic selenium oxides from
agricultural water. Specifically, the study tests a newly isolated bacterium of
the genus Pseudomonas for anaerobical reduction of selenate to selenite, and in
the presence of nitrate, reduction of selenite to insoluble/non-toxic selenium.
The project represents excellent collaboration between the Australian group and
its expertise in the molecular genetics of pseudomonas and the Macy work in
physiological understanding of selenate/selenite reduction. This is important
fundamental work on the molecular genetic and physiological basis of
selenate/selenite reduction, as well as having potential for major environmental
impact in lowering toxic levels of selenium in agricultural drainage water.
