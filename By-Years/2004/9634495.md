OCE 96-34495 O'Donnell The project will apply a generalized inverse method to
the problem of estimating tides and residual currents in under-sampled fields
such as those generated by Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) operated
from moving ships. Shipboard ADCP sampling suffers from inherent limitations
which necessitate separation of tides and low- frequency flows during post-
processing. The generalized inverse method will improve on existing least-
squares fitting techniques by explicitly including dynamical constraints. In
addition to development and assessment of the generalized inverse method,
emphasis will be placed on evaluating and designing optimal sampling strategies
for use in field studies.
