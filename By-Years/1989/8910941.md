This project is a technical exchange of structural engineers between the USSR
and the U.S. with respect to the performance of masonry buildings subjected to
wind, earthquakes, and environmental forces. The exchange will consist of three-
person reams to visit each other in alternate years. The first visit will be by
the USSR engineers who will come to the U.S. to meet with U.S. engineers, visit
research centers and construction sites, and participate in seminars and
conferences.
