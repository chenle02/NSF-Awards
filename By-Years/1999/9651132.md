This project consists of providing World-Wide-Web-based course materials,
tools, methods, and support to student teams working on computer information
systems analysis, design, and development projects within a computer science and
information systems (CSIS) curriculum. Computer professionals, in spite of
excellent technical skills, often lack teamwork skills. Because of this problem,
CSIS curricula increasingly require team projects, often in system development
courses, that reflect the realities of large systems development situations.
This approach is consistent with current theories in education that emphasize
active, experiential, problem-based, collaborative approaches to learning and
draws inspiration from the emerging field of computer-supported collaborative
learning. For student teams, scheduling meeting times and exchanging, reviewing,
and discussing formatted and graphical information is often difficult,
particularly for nontraditional and commuting students who may have other
demands on their time such as work and family. The objectives of the project are
to provide remote, convenient, and state-of-the-art multimedia support for
student teams working on authentic systems development projects; to facilitate
cooperative learning; to provide faculty with easy-to-use development tools; and
to increase students' technical skills through experience with widely-used
information technologies such as the World Wide Web. The Web serves as a widely
accessible and relatively inexpensive platform for teaching and learning, and
also as an outlet for the dissemination of results and the potential campus
wide, state wide, and world wide interaction with students and educators.
