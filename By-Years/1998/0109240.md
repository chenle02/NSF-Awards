The planning project will design pilot educational exhibits for an informal
education center, the "World Learning Center," located in the Presidio National
Park at San Francisco. The exhibits will be designed to engage children and
adults in activities which will highlight the integrated nature and scientific
basis of agriculture, the environment and human societies.

The design process will use site visits to observe interactive exhibitry, an
iterative process by the team of conceptual formation to final design, and a
review and evaluation by a national advisory group.
