9623087 Caflisch This proposal is for development of analytical and
computational methods for describing singularities in the solutions of partial
differential equations (PDEs), and for application of those methods to problems
of fluid mechanics and other physical systems. The key step in the analysis is
transformation of the variables of the PDE to obtain an "unfolded" system, the
solutions of which are non-singular. This will be used for vortex sheets,
swirling flow, magnetohydrodynamics and crystal patterns. For these problems we
will attempt to find singular solutions and to classify their generic type. This
proposal is for research on "singularities" in physics and engineering problems.
Singularities are points at which the measurable quantities in the system change
abruptly or become very large. An important example, which is a main focus of
this project is the development of very large rotational velocity in a fluid
such as air or liquid. These singularities are believed to be a primary cause of
turbulence, an important but poorly understood phenomena in many applications.
The goals of this research project are to find these singularities, classify
their possible behavior and use them to gain understanding of turbulence and
other problems.
