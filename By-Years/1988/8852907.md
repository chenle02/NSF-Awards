Two Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers and required sample cells are being
purchased for use in undergraduate organic chemistry, physical chemistry,
structural chemistry, and integrated laboratory courses. The instruments are
replacing outdated, failing equipment previously in use, allowing the conversion
of the organic laboratory courses to microscale work, allowing students in the
physical chemistry and integrated laboratories to obtain and analyze high-
resolution IR data, and allowing students in the structural chemistry course to
undertake more sophisticated identification problems than were previously
feasible. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
