The College of Staten Island of the City University of New York (CUNY) plans to
add a new Cray system, code-named Cray-Baker, to its existing set of machines to
exploit the advantages provided by Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS)
programming languages, such as Co- Array Fortran and Unified Parallel C. The
significance of this project is that it allows CUNY and collaborating
researchers to jump-start academic research in the development of PGAS-based
applications by acquiring the first such system, outside of the National
Security Agency and Department of Energy. City University of New York (CUNY)
investigators use high performance computing (HPC) to simulate electro-
mechanical coupling in the heart to understand how acquired disorders, such as
myocardial infarction, and genetic diseases, result in abnormal heart rhythms.
CUNY investigators also use HPC to model the ability of urban structures to
withstand the effects of blast from explosive devices. The new HPC system with
its advanced programming models and support for low-latency global
communications accelerate these research activities. Collaborations with noted
national and international researchers are supported.
