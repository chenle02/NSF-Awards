This is an ESPRIT/NSF Cooperative Activity proposal, submitted jointly to NSF by
Yorick Wilks of NMSU and to CEC/DGXIII/ESPRIT by Antonio Zampolli of University
of Pisa, Italy. The building of reusable, multilingual lexicons for natural
language processing is essential for the Grand Challenge Problem -
Speech/Language Understanding. There are extensive machine translation and other
linguistic research efforts in EC, especially those under the auspices of
Esprit. This joint project is expected to provide a start and a means for U.S.
researchers to form a collaborative relationship with their European
counterparts. The results of this joint work will be shared with the general
research community on both sides of the Atlantic. Funding of the European
colleagues is provided by the EC/Esprit.
