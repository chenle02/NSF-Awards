This US-Russia Cooperative Research project on the "Use of Soviet Light
Modulators in Morphological Image Processing" will be carried out by Dr. David
P. Casasent, Carnegie Mellon University, and Dr. Anatoliy Vasiliev, Lebedev
Physical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences. This proposal concerns new
image processing basic research algorithms and their optical implementation on
an optical correlator architecture fabricated using Russian Spatial Light
Modulators (SLMs). Russia has long been a leader in SLMs. They are the key
devices needed in optical processors. The proposal involves the Russians
furnishing the SLM devices and the U.S. furnishing the algorithms to use these
SLMs. This project in morphological image processing fulfills the program
objectives of advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and
Russia to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
