A four-day international workshop and conference titled "The Four-Dimensional
Framework of Continental Crust - Integrating Processes Through Time" is being
held in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in July of 2004. Broad multidisciplinary topics
being addressed include: temporal variation in physical and chemical processes
that generate continental crust; processes of deep and shallow crust generation
and their temporal variation; evolution of the Moho; fluid interaction
processes; magma generation and emplacement processes/models; metamorphic
processes; deformational processes leading to new continental crust; processes
driving crustal rheological changes; mountain building processes; supercontinent
formation; sedimentary processes in crustal evolution; role of biological
systems in crustal evolution. Graduate students, young and mid-career
scientists, and senior researchers are attending semiformal invited and
volunteered presentations intended to generate discussion and debate.
Presentations emphasize processes, concepts, new ideas supported by state-of-
the-art data, and future research directions. The closing session is addressing
frontiers in crustal science, future opportunities from EarthScope for
understanding crustal evolution, and nuturing geoscience discovery through
information technology. A five-day post-conference excursion is traversing the
southern Appalachian Mountains. A short white paper summarizing current and
possible future state-of-the-art crustal geoscience research and a proceedings
volume are being published.
