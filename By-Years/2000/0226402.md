With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nevada in Reno will
upgrade an X-ray diffractometer with an area detector for small molecule
crystallography. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: a) investigations of metal-metal interactions in large
cage complexes known as metallocryptands, probing metallophilic interactions
between simple trigonally coordinated platinum and palladium phosphine complexes
and heavy metal ions; b) development of ligands for aqueous or biphasic
organometallic catalysis; c) synthesis and characterization of benzoid
nanostructures focused on ribbon and helical structures; d) directed synthesis
of short nanotubes and perfluorinated carbon based materials including
fullerenes; e) investigations of hydrogen bonding in oligopyrrole species; f)
studies in metal promoted syntheses; g) development of catalysts for the
addition of nucleophiles to terminal alkynes; h) construction of metal templates
for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral phosphiranes and phosphirenes; and i) the
investigation of structure-order-property relationships in lyotropic chromonic
mesogens. The x -ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of
the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and
angles, and the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including
materials chemistry and the preparation of more efficient catalysts. In
addition, graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Nevada in
Reno will have a unique and important opportunity to participate in a chemical
research technique that many will depend upon in their future jobs.
