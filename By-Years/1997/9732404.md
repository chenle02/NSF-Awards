9732404 Garfield Statistics reform is a major undergraduate innovation, but has
not been evaluated to this point. This study will examine the nature of
statistics reform and the extent of its implementation, both within Mathematics
and Statistics Departments as well as other Department that offer statistics
courses. All Mathematics and Statistics Departments and a sample of other
Physical and Social Science will be surveyed to determine whether they have
implemented statistics reform, and the types of reform included. Based on these
findings, a set of case studies will be carried out in Departments that have
made a strong commitment to statistics reform to analyze the impact that the
reform is having.
