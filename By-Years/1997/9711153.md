This grant provides travel funds for about 40 US students from different
institutions to attend ACM's 16th SIGOPS Symposium on Operating Systems
Principles, to be held in France in October 1997. This symposium is being held
for the first time outside of US. This symposium is well recognized as the
premier conference for the leading-edge research in the field. In the past it
has been attended by a large number of US students, as it has served in
broadening the experience of promising young researchers and enriching their
careers. The students will be selected through an open competition based on
their research performance, potential to enrich the symposium, and diversity
considerations.***
