9522547 Pai In spite of the achievements in model order reduction, the size of
power systems to be simulated for dynamic analysis are very large. Hence faster
methods of simulation are needed. A promising method is the general minimal
residual method in conjunction with the simultaneous-implicit (SI) method for
differential algebraic systems. It is guaranteed to converge in almost n
iterations and easy to parallelize. We plan to demonstrate the viability of this
approach as an alternative to LU decomposition method in the SI method. A second
objective of the research is to apply the rich results of trajectory sensitivity
analysis for judging if a system is close to instability for a given stressed
condition. Finally we will compare the structural stability, Lyapunov stability
and sensitivity theory as applied to power systems. ***
