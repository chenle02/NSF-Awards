This project, sponsored by the Commonwealth Partnership, a partnership of
twelve liberal arts colleges and universities in Pennsylvania, is a three year
Biology initiative, starting April 1, 1991. The purpose of the initiative is to
enhance student interest and achievement in science by promoting the
professional development of secondary biology teachers through school/college
collaboration. The initiative will (1) update teachers' knowledge of recent
advances in biology; (2) engage teachers in laboratory investigations/research
techniques; (3) help teachers improve instructional effectiveness; (4) foster
collegial relationships biologists at secondary and college levels: (5) develop
participants abilities to be professional leaders; and (6) support ongoing
professional development programs. In the summer of 1991, 120 outstanding
secondary biology teachers from Pennsylvania and surrounding states (DE, MD, NJ,
OH, and WV) will attend 3-week residential institutes at five host campuses.
Laboratory and classroom sessions will update and deepen participants' knowledge
in cell and molecular biology. Applications sessions will focus on applying new
materials and approaches in the classroom and on means of extending selected
institute outcomes to over 3600 colleagues. Over the next two years, outreach
activities and professional development programs will support classroom
implementation and staff development activities at the local level. During the
third year of the initiative, teams of participant master teachers will conduct
seven extended workshops (nine days) for 140 secondary biology teachers, so as
to provide an in-depth transfer of knowledge and experience gained through the
program. An amount equal to 208% of NSF costs has been provided as cost sharing.
