This project aims to expand the boundaries of computational topology to include
fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization, by developing efficient,
practical, combinatorial algorithms to compute maximum flows, minimum cuts, and
related structures in graphs embedded on topological surfaces. Preliminary
results reveal intimate connections between the linear-programming duality
between flows and cuts, the combinatorial duality between graph embeddings, the
equivalence between flows in the primal graph and shortest-path distances in the
dual graph, and Poincare-Lefschetz duality between (relative) homology and
cohomology. These connections allow maximum flows to be computed in near-linear
time in graphs of any fixed genus, by optimizing the relative homology class of
the flow rather than directly optimizing the flow itself. However, the running
time of these algorithms depends exponentially on the genus of the surface; a
major goal of the project is to bring this dependence down to a small
polynomial.

The project aims to advance knowledge and understanding across multiple research
areas, by developing novel connections between fundamental techniques in
combinatorial and algebraic topology, algorithm design, and combinatorial
optimization. This research will lead to faster algorithms for several basic
optimization problems, develop new applications of topological methods, and
potentially settle several long-standing open algorithmic questions. The project
will support two PhD students at the beginning of their graduate careers. A
broader goal of the research is to strengthen ties between the computer science
and mathematics research communities; results will be disseminated broadly in
venues visible to both communities.
