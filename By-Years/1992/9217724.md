The principle investigators will develop and implement a significantly upgraded
and well documented capability for the acquisition, processing and display of
Hydrosweep data on the R/V Ewing. New shipboard hardware for processing display
of swath bathymetry data will be acquired. Exiting software will be unified and
a user-level documentation will be generated. The resulting system will be
largely independent of the swath mapping system that produced the data, will be
easily portable to common workstations and easy for the community to learn.
