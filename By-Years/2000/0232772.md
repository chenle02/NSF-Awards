This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project explores a new way to
authenticate the identity of a remote computer user. While anonymity is often an
attractive feature of online experience, it creates problems for both host and
visitor. Anonymity impedes important functions: financial transactions,
information access, secure decision-making, etc. Proof of identity enables such
action. Existing technologies--passwords, signatures, electronic keys, digital
certificates, physiological biometrics, etc.--all address this problem. Each is
limited by constraints including hardware requirements, immobility, ease of
forgery, ease of transfer, etc. The approach offers clear advantages. Like
password protection, it requires no special hardware, it is readily deployed,
and noninvasive. Passwords can be stolen, forgotten or compromised. Not so this
technique. Like retinal scanning, it identifies individual humans, not secret
keys. In this study, biometric data will be collected non-invasively from a
broad population of computer users. Statistical analysis and signal processing
techniques will be applied to isolate the metrics that reliably identify
individuals.&lt;br/&gt; The applications of such technology are manifest. This
will focuses on one significant application: online credit card authorization.
It establishes milestones on the path to a system by which an authorized
cardholder can easily make credit card purchases anywhere on the web, but nobody
else can--even when having the actual card in hand.&lt;br/&gt;
