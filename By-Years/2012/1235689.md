This award provides support for a workshop, jointly sponsored by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Science Foundation
(NSF), to be held in June 2012 in Reston, Virginia, to develop a research agenda
(roadmap) for critically needed windstorm and coastal inundation impact
reduction basic and applied (problem-focused) research. Of interest to the NSF-
supported wind engineering research community will be the long-term research
agenda, with broad strategic approach and objectives, for basic research needs
for wind hazard mitigation for buildings, structures, and lifelines, including
new and existing construction. Topics to be explored at the workshop include
performance-based design; computational fluid dynamics; characterization of
flood flow around buildings, including the influence of scour and flood-borne
debris; and impact of research on loss reduction.

The workshop will be led by an organizing steering committee and include experts
from science and engineering disciplines related to wind hazard mitigation and
community resilience research. Their interaction and synergy at the workshop
will result in a rigorous set of recommendations that illuminates the most
important research directions for the wind engineering field. The outcome of the
workshop will be a report that outlines a five-to-ten year roadmap for basic
wind engineering research. The report will be made available through the Applied
Technology Council web site at https://www.atcouncil.org/.
