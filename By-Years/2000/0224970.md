The workshop titled ``Radical Innovations of software and systems engineering of
the future'' to be held October 7-11, 2002 at Universita' Ca'Foscari di Venezia
in Venice, Italy, will bring together leading researchers in all aspects of
Software and System Engineering with a view towards discussing potential
research topics of tomorrow. To accomplish this goal, the workshop will have
several talks and several open discussions, with the hope that the latter would
lead to cross-fertilization of ideas from several disparate sub-areas of
Software and Systems Engineering.
