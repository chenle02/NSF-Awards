This project considers the construction and analysis of algorithms to simulate
fluid systems containing elastic components. Polymers, such as liquid crystals,
are an important class of such fluids, and in this instance the elastic
properties of the molecules are usually incorporated into a continuum model.
Another example is blood flow where the elasticity of the red blood cells gives
rise to non-Newtonian behavior. This problem was motivated by collaborative work
with engineers who wish to determine the distribution of and damage to red blood
cells in the small clearances within mechanical heart assist devices. Since
these clearances are of comparable dimension to the cells, it is necessary to
explicitly model the cells at the micrometer scale in order to determine their
distribution and the stresses they experience. The mathematical structure of the
equations modeling viscoelastic polymers and blood are very similar, and insight
gained in one of them sheds light on the other.

The ability to simulate the flow of complex materials on a computer is a key
technology required for the design and development of many "next generation"
products, such as micro-mechanical devices, bio-materials, and prosthetic
organs. For example, a major mode of failure in mechanical heart assist devices
is the formation of clots (thrombosis) which are primarily initiated by damage
to the red blood cells. This phenomena is difficult to control and the ability
to simulate it on a computer it would represent a breakthrough which would
eliminate much of the expensive and time consuming experimentation currently
required. The equations used to model such phenomena are complex and poorly
understood, and much of the research proposed herein is directed to revealing
the theoretical (mathematical) properties of these models. This work complements
the more practical approaches undertaken in the engineering community and at the
national laboratories.
