The proposed research is aimed at the purification and characterization of
endoglycosidases through the use of well-defined carbohydrate substrates
procured mainly by chemical synthesis. Some structures needed may also be
prepared through enzyme catalysis with a glycosyltransferase and appropriate
acceptors. Two enzymes will be emphasized: a) endo-alpha-N-acetyl-D-
galactosaminidase from Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and
2) endogalactosaminidase from Streptomyces griseus. The selected
endoglycosidases with well-defined specificity will become important tools for
structural studies in the carbohydrate portions of O-glycosidically linked
glycoproteins. These enzymes are likely to have important applications in
demonstrating the role of carbohydrate chains in naturally occuring antigens.
