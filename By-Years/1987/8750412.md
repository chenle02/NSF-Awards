Under this project, the junior mechanical engineering laboratories will be
enhanced with the addition of interactive computer control of experiments.
Experiments in three major stems of the program are envisioned. They are
mechanics/materials, thermal/fluids, and systems/controls. In the materials
area, the student will be introduced to materials analysis techniques, the
recording of x-ray diffraction patterns and their interpretation in terms of
appropriate structural parameters. In the fluids area, measurements in duct will
be made of velocity and pressure drop distribution using computers to control
fan speed and positioning of the pitot tube across the duct cross section. In
the systems area, computer controlled experiments will demonstrate various ways
to control and air engine and coupled tanks.
