ABSTRACT Auburn University plans to host a conference on Language Variety in
the south, a follow-up to one held in 1981 at the University of South Carolina.
The Auburn conference will meet April 1-3, 1993, in conjunction with Spring
SECOL (Southeastern Conference on Linguistics). It will provide a forum for
scholars in a variety of disciplines, from widely separated parts of this
country and from other countries, who would otherwise not be able to meet
conveniently. Among the goals of the conference are too encourage collaboration
across disciplines, to promote discussion among junior and senior scholars of
ongoing research projects, to expose recent Ph.D.'s and advanced graduate
students to recent research in Southern American English, and to foster an
exchange between researchers and local community members. Sociolinguists,
dialect geographers, lexicographers, historians, literary scholars, and
educators will share their research on language variety in the Southern United
States. Each day will focus on a different theme: Thursday on Materials and
Methods; Friday on Language Contact, Conflict, and Controversy; and Saturday on
Discourse and Dialect Diversity. Keynote addresses, panels, and paper sessions
have been structured so as to advance knowledge through presentation of new
data, to encourage exploration of methodological issues, and to provide
opportunities for debate over controversial themes. The impact of the conference
will extend well beyond the region. Through satellite transmission, videotaping,
and a volume of proceedings, conference activities will be made accessible to an
audience much wider than that in attendance.
