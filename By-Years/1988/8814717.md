Dr. George Ewing is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the flow of vibrational energy in liquids and on
surfaces. This basic research program will contribute substantially to our
understanding of vibrational energy storage in molecules contained in solution
and adsorbed on surfaces. Dr. Ewing has demonstrated that energy can be stored
in high vibrational levels of molecules dissolved in cryogenic liquids. Most
recently he has also shown that molecules which have been pumped into these high
levels can undergo chemical reactions. He will continue to explore the
properties of these high energy liquid systems which may serve as laser media
and which also exhibit vibrational to electronic energy transfer. In a second
quite distinct research effort, Dr. Ewing is studying the fate of vibrational
energy in molecules adsorbed on alkali halide surfaces. Three properties are
being investigated: 1) the vibrational relaxation rate of adsorbed molecules; 2)
vibrational predissociation which results when absorbed infrared energy exceeds
the physisorbed surface bond strength; and 3) fluorescence from the
vibrationally excited adsorbed molecule.
