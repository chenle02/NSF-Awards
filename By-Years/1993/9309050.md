9309050 Mayer This is an award to support research, the objective of which is to
formulate and validate mechanistic relationships for physical nonequilibrium
movement of contaminants in groundwater as a function of the physical properties
of the media through which flow occurs in the unsaturated zone above the water
table. The project involves experiments with four different porous media derived
from a silica sand obtained from Michigan's Keweenaw peninsula containing little
or no organic matter and exhibiting little or no micro-porosity. The sand will
be separated into four fractions based on particle sizing to obtain the
requisite variations in pore-size characteristics necessary to validate the
mathematical models of flow. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in
response to NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards Program Announcement and
Guidelines. Results are expected to improve the predictive capabilities for
transport of solutes in the unsaturated zone. This in turn is expected to
provide improvement in the ability to predict the movement characteristics of
groundwater pollutants and contaminants for potential use in engineering design
of remediation systems for groundwater polluted by seepage from ponds, surface
and subsurface storage tanks and landfills.
