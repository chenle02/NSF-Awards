Lake Tanganyika Scientific Drilling Site Survey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant
will support a site survey to Lake Tanganyika with marine engineers and
continental scientific drilling personnel to finalize and verify proposals and a
budget for drilling Lake Tanganyika for submission to the International
Continental Drilling Program and the NSF in 2019/2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
grant will support a site visit to Lake Tanganyika with marine engineers and
continental scientific drilling personnel to finalize and verify proposals and a
budget for drilling Lake Tanganyika for submission to the International
Continental Drilling Program and the NSF in 2019/2020. The grant will support
the following on-site requisite work:&lt;br/&gt;1) Evaluate existing vessels on
Lake Tanganyika and their suitability for use as drilling ship, evaluate
existing marine shipyards and their capabilities (dry dock, etc.) to modify
vessels on the lake, and to develop a budget for these activities;&lt;br/&gt;2)
Evaluate on-and off-shore housing for scientists and drillers and sites for a
core laboratory;&lt;br/&gt;3) Evaluate smaller vessels and work boats on the
lake to determine their suitability to serve as personnel and crew transport
vessels, and determine costs for these;&lt;br/&gt;4) Identify local contractors
for fuel supply, personnel transport, food, banking, and other services, and
obtain costsfor those services;&lt;br/&gt;5) Obtain up-to-date information on
research and drilling permitting procedures for
Tanganyika.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
