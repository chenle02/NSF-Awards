Dr. Payne's research will test the evolutionary implications of the biological
species concept. This the idea that individuals with a common set of behaviors
for breeding form a single class, and individuals in it are genetically more
similar to each other than to others because they have a common ancestor. The
idea implies that a species has evolved only once. In a parasite animal species,
a host may be colonized more than once. The colonizers may come from a single
other species or from different parasite species. If parasite species have
adapted more than once to a host, then a biological species with lookalike
behaviors may consist of individuals that genealogically are more closely
related to other populations than to each other. The aim is to compare
biological and historical species concepts, and to test whether a biological
species has evolved more than once or has a unique history. The parasitic
finches are a unique group of birds. They may reveal a difference between a
biological species and an evolutionary species viewed as a unique historical
lineage. The birds learn the songs of their host species, and use these songs in
choosing mates. Their song changes every year in a continuous process of
cultural evolution. Geographic variation in their appearance and behavior
suggests a multiple colonization of the host species. The work will use
behavioral and biochemical genetics methods to test whether the parasites have
split along the same evolutionary pathways as the host species, or whether
parasite populations of the same biological species have multiple origins due to
independent colonization events.
