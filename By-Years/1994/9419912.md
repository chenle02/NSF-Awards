This project focuses on the structure of complexity classes that are known to
lie between the classes P and PSPACE, on the one hand, and on the circuit
complexity classes, on the other hand. Many of the well-studied complexity
classes can be specified by considering computation trees and circuits with
functions of k- valued logic. It is of interest to learn the power of this
method of specification; that is, what classes can or cannot be characterized
this way. Specifically, while `leaf languages` have been successfully used in
some settings, it is not known how broadly they can be used. Similarly, the
study of the structure of the Boolean hierarchy or of the polynomial hierarchy
over a complexity class of partitions may yield approaches for studying the
Boolean hierarchy on NP or the polynomial-time hierarchy, respectively.
