The research focuses on the problem of electron correlations in scattering and
photoionization of complex atoms. Methods will be developed for accurate
calculations on systems requiring the inclusion of relativistic effects such as
tungsten and platinum. Resonance and multiplet effects will be treated. Studies
of processes involving simultaneous ionization and excitation in Li, Be and Na
will be undertaken using both MBPT and the R-matrix method. Impact ionization
involving double and triple ejection will also be treated. Finally, coupled
cluster approaches using discrete basis sets will be used to calculate energy
levels, oscillator strengths and polarizabilities in the rare gases and for
accurate calculation of parity nonconserving transitions in Rb, Cs, Tl and Pb.
