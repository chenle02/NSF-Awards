Harvard University will undertake a retrospective cohort study to analyze
college students? education background and previous IT-related experiences for
predictors of performance when students study Computer Science in college, while
controlling for demographic differences. The study will reveal how decisions
concerning the use of technology made by high school teachers in the teaching of
science and mathematics and the growing number of high school computer science
courses relate to the performance of 12,000 college computer science students
nationwide, who will be recruited from randomly selected 2-year and 4-year
colleges and universities. This study has the capacity to both reveal and
evaluate the use of the most promising educational practices and interventions,
including both in-school computing instruction and after-school programs,
competitions, and clubs, and to assess the effects of a match between
experiences during the high school years with the evolving landscape of
introductory college computer science courses. Such knowledge can only help to
ameliorate the high failure rates that prematurely end the pursuit of a
potential computer science degree, especially for females and under-represented
minorities who historically opt out of this field earlier and in greater numbers
than other classmates. Both college and high school computer science instructors
can also benefit from understanding the factors contributing to effective
preparation for students? first college computer science course.
