Dr. Peacock will continue her research in the Ituri region of Zaire. A long
term multi-investigator study has focussed on two groups: semi-nomadic Efe
pygmies who subsist primarily by hunting and gathering, and village-living Lese
horticulturalists. While people such as the Efe are normally expected to have
low fertility levels - and this in fact is the case - most often settled
horticulturalists are characterized by just the opposite. Prior work however has
shown that the Lese fertility is low. The goal of the research is to discover
why this is so. Dr. Peacock will continue longitudinal monitoring of variation
of gonadal function among both groups. She hypothesizes that high work loads
among women contribute to disruption of ovarian function. She will monitor
ovarian function through the measure of reproductive hormones in saliva and
urine. Work load will be assessed through quantitative observations of
individual behavior. Estimation of active infection with sexually transmitted
diseases will be determined through gynecological exams. A pilot study of male
gonadal function will also be initiated. Population in Africa is expanding
rapidly and this defeats efforts to raise the standard of living through
development. The population explosion is one of the most serious problems facing
third world countries. Dr. Peacock's project may provide insight into natural
factors which limit population growth.
