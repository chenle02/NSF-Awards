ABSTRACT This grant will enable the Principal Investigator to complete work in
progress on the principles of metrical stress theory, a theory of a significant
component of the phonology of natural languages. This is an integrated theory of
word stress, in which individual stress rules are analyzed as the result of
setting values for a small number of parameters. The evidence for the theory
consists of detailed studies of the stress systems of a number of languages,
aloong with sketches of the systems of a larger number of less well documented
languages. The core of the theory is a particular set of templates for parsing
syllables into stress feet. Other ideas developed include a prohibition on feet
consisting of a single light syllable; an algorithm for deriving stresses spaced
at trisyllabic intervals; and the use of moraic theory to analyze contextually
varying syllable quantity. The outcome of the project will be a book, Principles
of Metrical Stress Theory, which will serve as both an integrated exposition of
the theory and as a textbook for graduate training in phonology.
