This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is investigating the
creation of a single multi-dimensional score that accurately predicts the
preference of a consumer within an electronic commerce environment, allowing the
owner of the electronic commerce environment to deliver personalized content.
The intellectual merit of the proposed innovation is the aggregation of actual
consumer consumption behavior from a variety of ecommerce domains to form a
holistic view of the consumer and create a highly predictive model to predict
the content or offer that is most likely to elicit a desirable consumer
response.

The broader social implication for the proposed innovation is to positively
impact those engaged in electronic commerce (consumers and providers). Consumers
will benefit by receiving highly personalized content and offers that is
relevant to their actual consumption patterns which improves their interaction
or experience and removes unwanted or irrelevant content. This experience change
positively influence consumers' satisfaction and loyalty to the ecommerce
provider. The ecommerce provider benefits from increased satisfaction and
participation on behalf of their customers which translates into short and long
term economic value. If successful, the project could provide a framework from
which to build additional value-added service products and have significant
commercial impact.
