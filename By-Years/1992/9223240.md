This Americas Program award will support continuation of a research
collaboration between Dr. Gary L. McPherson of Tulane University and Dr I. A.
Kawha of the University of the West Indies, Jamaica. The research focuses on the
luminescence spectroscopy and excited state dynamics of a series of novel
macrocyclic complexes containing pairs of rare earth ions. Although the
luminescence properties of a number of the macrocyclic rare earth complexes have
been examined, many of the most important features of excited state behavior
have not been explored. This project will provide valuable new information about
these complexes and their interactions. Preparation and structural
characterization of these unusual materials will be accomplished by Dr. Kawha at
the University of the West Indies, while the luminescence of the materials will
be examined in the laser spectroscopy laboratories at Tulane. This project will
also involve undergraduate and graduate students from both institutions.
