A wide variety of exciting astrophysical phenomena involve a pair of stars
orbiting each other, often exchanging or sharing material and sometimes merging
to form a single object. Regardless of their initial or final state, these
systems pass through a phase in which both objects orbit within the same "common
envelope", through which they exchange and share material. Complex computer
simulations of this phenomenon are perhaps the only way to account for all of
the factors that determine the ultimate fate of such a system. The PI and his
collaborators will carry out such simulations, which are made possible by the
development of terascale and petascale computing technology and investments by
NSF in high-performance computing infrastructure. They will use software
developed as part of this project to enhance undergraduate astronomy education
by creating interactive binary star simulation modules for an online Digital
Demo Room site and for a new course in computational astrophysics. Students will
be involved both in the research and in developing education
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will carry out computer simulations to
study the physics of common envelopes, a short-lived but crucial phase in the
life of close binary stars that may lead to a wide variety of astrophysical
phenomena, including certain types of supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and mergers
between stars or black holes. This phase is inherently three-dimensional and
cannot be studied using the one-dimensional simulations that underlie our
understanding of single-star evolution. They will focus on understanding the
sources of energy a common-envelope binary can draw upon in ejecting the outer
atmosphere of the larger star and on predicting the appearance of the phase in
cases in which the two stars merge together.
