A centrifuge at NASA Ames Research Center was converted for use as a national
facility for geotechnical engineering research, and is referred to as the
National Geotechnical Centriguge. Although the facility is at NASA Ames, the
University of California at Davis is responsible for the funding and operation
of the facility. The purpose of this action is to provide partial financial
support for the relocation of this centrifuge to the Davis campus of the
University of California. The major cost for the relocation will be provided by
the University of California. This relocation will contribute significantly to
the effective management, operation, and use of this centrifuge as a national
facility for geotechnical engineering research.
