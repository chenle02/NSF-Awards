Abstract

Award: DMS-0405906 Principal Investigator: Gregory J. Galloway

Recent developments in gravitational theory, both theoretical and empirical,
have lead to an increased interest in the study of asymptotically anti-de Sitter
and asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. In this project, techniques of
Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry will be used to attack certain problems
pertaining to such spacetimes, as well as some problems concerning new
developments in the theory of black holes. One of the specific aims of this
project is to continue development of an approach to establishing positivity of
mass for asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds (with spherical
conformal infinity) which does not require spin assumption. This approach, which
makes use of the brane action introduced by Witten and Yau in their work on the
AdS/CFT correspondence, may also be useful in settling some positive mass
conjectures for asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes with toroidal topology
at infinity. The PI also plans to continue investigations into uniqueness and
rigidity phenomena, and the development of singularities in asymptotically de
Sitter spacetimes. The classical definition of a black hole, though
mathematically elegant, is problematic in practice (especially for numerical
studies) in that it requires knowing the full future evolution of spacetime all
the way to infinity. As an alternative, Ashtekar and Krishnan have introduced a
new, fully nonlinear and dynamical, approach to the study of black holes, based
on the quasi-local notion of a dynamical horizon. Another aim of this project is
to investigate some open problems concerning the occurence, i.e., existence,
uniqueness and position of dynamical horizons.

Modern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature. The gravitational field
and other fields, black holes and related objects, may be described and analyzed
using geometric methods. In more general terms, this project is concerned with
the study of certain features of gravity of current scientific interest from
this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools of Riemannian geometry, a
mathematical theory of space, and Lorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of
spacetime. These theories provide a method for studying the relationship among
three fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature (i.e., the
bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the global shape and complexity
of space or spacetime) and causal structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of
light rays and light cones).
