The Principal Investigator will study mean curvature flow, a natural process by
which geometric shapes change over time. In mathematics, mean curvature flow and
similar flows have proved to be very important: in particular, the closely
related Ricci flow has been very much in the news because of its essential role
in the solution of the long-standing Poincare conjecture. Mean curvature flow
also arises in the physical world. For example, grain boundaries in annealing
metals move by mean curvature flow. The Principal Investigator will also
investigate minimal surfaces. Minimal surfaces are equilibrium shapes for mean
curvature flow, that is, shapes that do not change over time. In astronomy,
minimal surfaces occur as "apparent horizons" of black holes. Here on earth,
soap films provide examples of minimal surfaces. Minimal surfaces are of great
theoretical interest: tools first discovered in the study of minimal surfaces
have proved to be valuable in many other areas of
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator plans to study
properties of mean curvature flow,especially singularity formation and the non-
uniqueness known as "fattening". Specific goals include determining whether
generic surfaces give rise to smaller spacetime singular sets than do arbitrary
initial surfaces, understanding the causes of fattening, and discovering natural
conditions that prevent fattening. He also plans to investigate minimal
varieties, including topics such as the behavior of the recently-discovered
genus-g helicoids as the genus tends to infinity, the relationship between
properties of a minimal surface and the total curvature of its boundary, the
fine structure of branch points of minimal surfaces (and, in particular, whether
the Micallef-White necessary conditions for a minimal surface to be area-
minimizing near a branch point are also sufficient), and the relationship
between topology and density at singularities of minimal varieties.
