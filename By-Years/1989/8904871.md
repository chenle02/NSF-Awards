Under this award, the principal investigator will couple two existing models: a
quasi-geostrophic time-dependent wave model of the stratosphere with a zonally
averaged (two- dimensional) chemical-radiative-dynamical model of the middle
atmosphere. By coupling the two, it is hoped that the better representation of
the large-scale structure and wave-mean flow interaction in the stratosphere
will provide more realistic estimates of transport and the mean distribution of
trace chemical species in the middle atmosphere. Further, the study may provide
clues as to how best to parameterize some of the planetary wave and eddy effects
in the two-dimensional chemical model. The complexity and vast computational
requirements of three-dimensional models makes the option of conducting certain
studies with simpler two-dimensional models very attractive. This project has
the potential to improve the (now) crude parameterizations of wave interactions
in existing two- dimensional models.
