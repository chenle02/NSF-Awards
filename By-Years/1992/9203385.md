Since the concept of comprehensive emergency management was first promoted a
decade ago, consistent complaints have been made that local governments fail to
give enough attention to the mitigation and recovery planning phases of managing
hazards, compared to preparedness and response. A lesson from the Loma Prieta
earthquake is that a wider group of local government agencies need to be
involved not only in mitigation, but also in recovery and reconstruction. This
project investigates how improved collaboration between local emergency
management agencies and planning departments may produce economies of expertise
that result in a more comprehensive effort in all phases of hazards management.
Planning departments are a significant source of poorly tapped local resources
to support that objective. Theory suggests that specific forms of communication
and cooperation between the agencies can promote more effective effort under
different environmental and organizational conditions. That proposition is
tested through a dual sample of the planning and emergency management agencies
among approximately 400 cities for which unique longitudinal data are available.
Four case studies that cover failures and successes from the national sample
provide further depth to the survey data as well as information needed to
communicate results through a user-oriented project summary. As well as
contributing to research on organization for emergency management and hazard
mitigation, the project extends prior research on interorgaizational relations
and urban policy.
