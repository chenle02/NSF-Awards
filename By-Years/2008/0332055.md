The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for
Microcontaminiaiton Control will expand and change its focus by transferring the
lead university role to Northeastern University with the University of Arizona
becoming an affiliate site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's goal is to
develop state of the art techniques primarily for micro and nanoscale
contaminant control, removal and characterization in semiconductor manufacturing
and fabrication processes. However, the broader impact of the Center focus will
contribute to the competitiveness of the semiconductor, information technology,
pharmaceutical, imaging, aerospace and other industries affected by particulate
and ionic contamination.&lt;br/&gt;
