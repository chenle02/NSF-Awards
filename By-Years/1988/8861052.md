This research is on space marching algorithms on unstructured meshes for high
sped aerodynamic configuration design, with a view toward significant numerical
efficiency gains with minimal loss in geometric flexibility. Characteristic
based algorithms for the solution of the Eulers' equations of gas dynamics are
proposed for computation on grids constructed by an advancing front method.
Commercial applications include the aerodynamic analysis and design of
hypersonic vehicles, supersonic transport aircraft, and military fighter
configurations.
