Abstract 9634922 Glumac The goal of the proposed investigation is to generate a
benchmark experimental data set of fully characterized catalytic flows in which
comprehensive surface chemistry mechanisms for pure metal and alloyed catalysts
can be refined and validated. The PI proposes to use a stagnation flow
environment to create a multispecies post-flame catalytic flow field in which
measurements can be made and compared with model predictions. Both a low
pressure (~10-30 Torr) and a rotating substrate will be used to increase
transport of gas phase species to the catalyst surface in order to achieve
strong coupling to surface reactions. Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) will be
used to obtain the spatial concentration profiles of a set of key reactive
species including NO, CO, H, NO2, and OH. The pure metal unsupported catalysts
platinum, palladium, and rhodium along with the alloyed and oxide supported
catalysts will be investigated. This combination of measurements will assist
modelers in formulating a mechanism valid for commonly-used multicomponent
catalyst materials.
