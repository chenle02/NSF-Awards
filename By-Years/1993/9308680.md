This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is made by the
Chemistry Division to Dr. Patricia A. Mabrouk of the Chemistry Department,
Northeastern University. Direct interfacial electron transfer of cytochrome c
and related heme proteins in non-aqueous media will be investigated
electrochemically. Cyclic voltammetry and optical and circular dichroism
spectroscopies will be used to characterize the electrode substrate and explore
the role of the protein's essential water. Realization of interfacial electron
transfer in this unconventional media may provide new insights into the native
behavior of these proteins, but the long term goal of the work is to extend
their biotechnological applications in sensors, electrochromic displays, and
electrocatalysts.
