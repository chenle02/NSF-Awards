The Antarctic atmospheric water cycle couples freshwater input to the Southern
Ocean. The strength of ocean convective overturning (the meridonal overturning
circulation) and its influence on the upwelling of heat is governed in large
part by these freshwater sources. Understanding the water cycle is fundamental
to estimating ocean heat uptake in the Southern Ocean and determining why
Antarctic sea ice has expanded in the last ~30 years, notably different from the
Arctic. The hydrologic cycle is in turn strongly coupled to the climate.
Precipitation influences the albedo of sea ice, depending on whether it falls as
snow or rain, and contributes freshwater to the Southern Ocean, while sea ice
and sea surface temperature influence evaporation and atmospheric circulation
and their association with moisture and heat transport to
Antarctica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of sensitivity experiments are
proposed to gain understanding of the system and test means of improving model
biases. The ultimate integration will utilize these model improvements to
attribute Southern Ocean and Antarctic climate change over the last ~30
years&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advances understanding of past and future
climate change from rising greenhouse gas concentrations and ozone depletion.
The results will inform future projections of Antarctic ice mass balance and the
resulting global sea level rise.
