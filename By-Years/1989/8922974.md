This is a two-year collaborative research project between Dr. Ching S. Chang,
University of Massachusetts and Professor Yuan Jian-Xin, Institute of Rock and
Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Science. This proposal plans to study
mechanical behavior of loess and is jointly sponsored by NSF and Chinese Academy
of Sciences. China has some of the world's largest and best known loess
deposits. The Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics (IRSM), the Chinese Academy
of Science, at Wuhan, China has been actively researching the mechanical
properties of these soils. It has a large quantity of experimental and field
data. Dr. Chang has developed models that can account for many structural
features in loess. The data available from the Chinese collaborative institute
can validate and improve his models. Both the U.S. and China collaborators can
greatly benefit from this collaboration and jointly they can enhance the
understanding of the mechanical behavior of such soil.
