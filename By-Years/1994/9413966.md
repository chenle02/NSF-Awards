9413966 Hocken This award provides equipment for the precision engineering
laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This equipment
forms the backbone of a set of interrelated facilities for the integration of
high-speed precision metrology, data management and modeling, machine control,
and manufacturing processes. The research that this equipment will support
envisions a manufacturing environment where design, metrology, machine control
and manufacturing processes are integrated in real or near real-time to provide
the capability of modifying the details of complex manufacturing cycles
according to associated design, control, and metrology data. Such a
manufacturing environment would greatly improve the efficiency of precision
manufacturing and create opportunities for whole new classes of manufactured
goods, such as those incorporating extended regions of deterministically
engineered surface finish. ***
