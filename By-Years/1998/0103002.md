Abstract CTS-0103002 N. Seeman, et al., New York University

This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
(NSE) solicitation, NSF-00119, in the category Nanoscale Interdisciplinary
Research Teams (NIRT). This is a collaborative activity between New York
University, California Institute of Technology and Dow Chemical Co. using GOALI
model. The goal is to synthesize and demonstrate operational nanoscale machines
or devices. The level of control offered by DNA systems can be exploited to make
intricate DNA nanostructures, including self-assembling DNA that forms two-
dimensional and three-dimensional arrays. Modeling and simulation is a critical
part of this project, in order construct and test the DNA nanostructures.

It is proposed to combine the activities of New York University, California
Institute of Technology and Dow Chemical laboratories to achieve a demonstration
of DNA based nanomechanical devices useful for performing fast calculations, for
sensors that detect specific molecules in the environment, or to improve the
properties or performance of a material. Practical design and manufacture of
nanoscale machines and devices requires overcoming numerous challenges in
synthesis, processing, characterization, design, optimization, and fabrication.
The approach will be first to prototype the designs computationally, optimizing
the particular base-pair sequences, making sure that the particular lengths and
spacings will lead to proper clearances, and testing the operation of the
device, including the dynamics. The project will focus on nanomechanical devices
of three types. o The B-Z based nanomotor. A DNA based nanomotor predicated on
the B to Z DNA transitions under different salt conditions. o A DNA sequence-
specific mechanical device o A DNA based switch based on principles similar to
the DNA sequence- specific mechanical device.
