Proposal Number: CTS-0226010&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Hrenya, Christine
M&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Colorado - Boulder&lt;br/&gt;Title: A
Computationally Efficient Approach to the Lagrangian Modeling of Bubbling
Beds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is based on the assumption that there
are valid scaling laws where a large bubbling fluidized bed, typical of
industrial applications, can be scaled down to a bed with fewer particles? based
on this assumption, the PI proposes to using these scaling laws to simulate an
equivalent system with fewer particles and thus save significant computational
cost which is typically proportional to the number of particles in a Lagrangian-
Eulerian approach. Lagrangian simulations have several advantages and will be a
very powerful tool in realistically modeling particulate flows if it is made
computationally more tractable. The objectives of this work are to verify the
existence of such a scaling or 'similitude' by experiments and numerical
simulations and to develop an appropriate numerical scheme for Eulerian-
Lagrangian simulations.&lt;br/&gt;
