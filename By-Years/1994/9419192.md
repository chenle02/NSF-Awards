9419192 McWilliams This proposal is for the study of, "Turbulence Driven Ion
Transport". It concerns the study of the transport of ions in plasmas using
laser induced fluorescence. It will involve the study of ion diffusion and
convection in real space and velocity space. Ion transport will be studied in
unmagnetized and magnetized plasmas. It is expected that underlying dependencies
of ion convection and diffusion on various scattering mechanisms (both Coulomb
and wave) will be determined. Laser induced fluorescence and optical tomography
will be the central diagnostic tools for study of plasmas with both argon and
barium ions. ***
