This project will add to the Chemistry Department instrumentation which will
both enhance the current high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
capabilities and give undergraduate students experience in the use of
microcomputers to control instruments and acquire data. Recent advances in HPLC
instrumentation and columns have resulted in powerful applications in all the
subdisciplines of chemistry. As a result, this instrumentation has become an
essential tool of research chemists in both industrial and academic settings.
Furthermore, recent developments in microcomputer software have made modern
instrumentation more powerful and subsequent data analysis more efficient. This
project will introduce into the undergraduate curriculum at Hobart and William
Smith Colleges a series of laboratory modules in upper-level chemistry and
biochemistry courses that allow students to carry out increasingly sophisticated
investigations utilizing the HPLC and computer capability. The students will use
state-of-the-art separation technology for separation and analysis of complex
mixtures. With the computer-enhanced display of both single and dual detector
output, students will utilize the capabilities of computerized data acquisition
to accomplish simultaneous separation, identification, and quantification of
eluted compounds, and rapid comparison of chromatograms by simultaneous display.
This modern instrumentation will be used by students in their coursework and in
undergraduate research projects.
