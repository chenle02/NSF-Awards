Professor Mallik's research focuses on the design, synthesis and evaluation of
liposome based receptors for protein surfaces. Mixed liposomes derived from
metal containing lipids, polymerizable ionic lipids, and polymerizable hydrogen
bonding lipids are equilibrated with the template protein carbonic anhydrase to
create a three-dimensional, complementary replica of the protein surface.
Synthetic targets include lipids containing differing head groups and
photopolymerizable diene or diyne tails that, after equilibration, are
photochemically polymerized to achieve a semi-rigid, protein-specific receptor.
Efficacy of the photopolymerized template synthesis is quantified by measuring
the protein-replica binding constants. Educational activities include
introducing a graduate bio-organic course and addressing undergraduate needs by
establishing a Virtual Organic Chemistry classroom on the Web to facilitate
student-teacher communication. With this CAREER award, the Organic Dynamics
Program supports the research and educational activities of Professor Sanku
Mallik of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Dakota.
Professor Mallik's research is focused on the creation of a three-dimensional
protein recognition surface by using a specific protein to direct the formation
of a collection of molecules with which it interacts. Subsequent chemical
linking of these molecules into a polymer effectively leaves a footprint of the
protein in the resulting polymer. In contrast to the considerable synthetic
effort involved in other approaches to molecular recognition, this approach is
expected to generate simply and rapidly a highly specific binding site for the
target protein. Professor Mallik's educational activities include developing a
graduate curriculum targeting the interface between organic and biological
chemistry and facilitating student-teacher communication through a Virtual
Classroom on the Web.
