This award is for support for a program to reconstruct records of the isotopic
composition of paleoatmospheric methane and nitrous oxide covering the last
200,000 years. High resolution measurements of the carbon-13 isotopic
composition of methane from shallow ice cores will help to determine the
relative contributions of biogenic (wetlands, rice fields and ruminants) and
abiogenic (biomass burning and natural gas) methane emissions which have caused
the concentrations of this gas to increase at an exponential rate during the
anthropogenic period. Isotopic data on methane and nitrous oxide over
glacial/interglacial timescales will help determine the underlying cause of the
large concentration variations that are known to occur. This project will make
use of a new generation mass spectrometer which is capable of generating precise
isotopic information on nanomolar quantities of methane and nitrous oxide, which
means that samples can be 1000 times smaller than those needed for a standard
isotope ratio instrument. The primary objective of the work is to further our
understanding of the biogeochemical cycles of these two greenhouse gases
throughout the anthropogenic period as well as over glacial interglacial
timescales.
