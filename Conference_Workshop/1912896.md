This award supports attendance by 20 graduate students and postdocs affiliated
with US institutions at the Summer School and Conference on Homotopy Type Theory
to be held August 7-17, 2019 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

Homotopy type theory is a new field of mathematics that draws on logic, homotopy
theory, category theory, and computer science to create a new foundational
system for mathematics that can be implemented in a computerized proof
assistant. Students and postdocs attending the summer school will be introduced
to the basic mathematical theory and trained in the use of the associated
computer systems. They will also be exposed to current research and open
problems, and provided with the necessary tools and resources to begin their own
research, independently and in collaboration with others. The summer school will
take place over four days, followed by a research-oriented conference of 6 days.
