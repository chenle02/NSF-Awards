0323168&lt;br/&gt;Castillo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced
Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department
of Energy (DOE), will take place in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, May 31-June 11, 2004,
on the topic of computational science and engineering. Organized by Dr. Jose
Castillo of San Diego State University, the institute will involve approximately
40 students from the U.S. and Latin America and distinguished speakers in the
field. The main goal of this workshop is to promote computational science and
engineering knowledge, encourage training, and foster cooperation among
researchers and lecturers of the Americas. Participants will be exposed to
modern techniques in computational science and engineering, computational fluid
dynamics, numerical optimization, parallel computing, grid generation, and
computational geophysics methods. The institute will develop a website with
information on the organization and registration for the course, that will allow
the dissemination of electronic copies of all the papers and educational
materials presented at the lectures. &lt;br/&gt;
