Jason Halfen, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Department of Chemistry,
is&lt;br/&gt;supported for his project making new synthetic analogs for
superoxide&lt;br/&gt;reductase enzymes. This family of enzymes has a non-heme
iron active site in&lt;br/&gt;a square pyramidal geometry. By preparing small
molecule models of this&lt;br/&gt;active site, we can better understand the
bonding and three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;structure, redox chemistry and
reactivity of the enzyme. More specifically,&lt;br/&gt;Halfen will be preparing
and studying thiolate-ligated iron and cobalt&lt;br/&gt;peroxo species, the
propensity of the model complexes to dissociate these&lt;br/&gt;thiolates, and
representative sulfur alkylation and oxidation
reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made under the Research in
Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)&lt;br/&gt;Program and incorporates
undergraduate education and training. The range of&lt;br/&gt;synthetic and
spectroscopic techniques proposed will provide a foundation&lt;br/&gt;for
undergraduate students pursuing chemistry or biology as a career.
The&lt;br/&gt;scientific impact will include a better understanding of metal-
thiolate&lt;br/&gt;bonds and how these ubiquitous bonds are involved in
enzymatic processes.
