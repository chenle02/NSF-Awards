This research is on developing circuit design and test algorithms that run on
parallel computers. These include efficient, asynchronous, portable parallel
algorithms for: (A) synthesis of combinational circuits; and (B) for test
generation and fault simulation of combinational and sequential circuits.
Algorithms are being written using an environment that makes it possible to port
CAD applications across a wide range of MIMD machines. In addition they are
designed to allow a maximum overlap of computation and communication. The
algorithms are being tested on numerous parallel platforms.
