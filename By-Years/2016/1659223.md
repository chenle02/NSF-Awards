This REU site is supported by both the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical
and Physical Sciences Directorate, and the Engineering Directorate at the
National Science Foundation. Dr. Andrew Greenberg, Professor Robert Hamers, and
colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison host the program entitled REU
Site: Chemistry of Materials for Renewable Energy, (CMRE). This program supports
a 10 week summer research experiences for 11 undergraduate students annually for
three years. Students conduct individual research projects focused on chemistry
and chemical engineering research applied to problems in renewable energy.
Additionally, students receive professional development training in science and
engineering communication. The diverse student cohort participating in research
at this site is well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as
part of the country's technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual
research projects include the development of new catalysts and materials for the
conversion of light or chemical energy into usable electrical or mechanical
energy. The CMRE REU program helps students to strengthen their written and oral
communication skills through communication training, proposal presentations,
mid-experience report writing, and poster presentations. To ensure proper
mentoring and development of CMRE REU students, this project includes a
mentoring workshop for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty
working directly with the REU Program.
