The SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM) is one of the top-tier
conferences in the field of data mining. It provides a venue for researchers who
are addressing problems in data mining to present their work in a peer-reviewed
forum. The 2022 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2022) is being
organized by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in
cooperation with the American Statistical Association. SDM 2022 will be held in
Alexandria, Virginia, USA from April 28 to April 30, 2022. Funds will provide
travel support for approximately 30 graduate students from universities in the
United States to participate in a Ph.D. student forum that is to be held as part
of SDM 2022.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SIAM International Conference on Data
Mining (SDM) provides a venue for researchers who are addressing problems in
data mining to present their work in a peer-reviewed forum. Each student
participant will be assigned a senior researcher to serve as a mentor on a
variety of career-related issues and they also can attend the technical
sessions, plenary talks, and tutorials and workshops at the conference to touch
the frontier of data mining research. The student forum consists of a poster
session for Ph.D. candidates in data mining or closely related areas or Ph.D.
students who have made significant progress towards Ph.D. candidacy. The
doctoral student forum participants will be able to present their work, interact
with their peers from other universities as well as hundreds of leading
researchers in data mining from around the world. To enhance doctoral student
participation and to recognize outstanding dissertation research in data mining
being conducted by Ph.D. students, SDM 2022 will have awards for the best
posters presented at the SDM 2022 Doctoral Student
Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
