The development of this interdisciplinary knowledge engineering laboratory for
undergraduate students at Luther College fills a role for the Department of
Computer Science as it relates to the needs of a liberal arts college. The
laboratory provides hardware and software support for the study and construction
of expert systems in both traditional and nontraditional application domains.
The resulting environment provides an arena in which computer science students
work directly with students majoring in other disciplines on joint projects.
Students are encouraged to work both independently and in knowledge engineering
teams under the direction of an interdisciplinary faculty steering committee.
The laboratory takes advantage of the strong interdisciplinary interests of the
students who attend Luther College and provides computer science students with
an opportunity to interact with students from other disciplines.
