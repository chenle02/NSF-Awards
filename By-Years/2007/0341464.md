The 2003 International Semiconductor Device Research Symposium (ISDRS'03) will
be held in Washington Dc from December 10-12, 2003. This symposium provides a
highly interactive forum for scientists and engineers in the areas of advanced
materials for devices, novel semiconductor devices, optoelectronics,
nanotechnology, and processing technologies. Furthermore, the attendees include
scientists and engineers from academia, government laboratories and industry.
There are a number of international attendees at this conference. The conference
attracts over 200 scientists and engineers. The symposium encourages student
papers and has a very large representation of graduate students. To encourage
high quality paper content and presentation, the symposium offers several
student awards for best paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium produces a
proceedings volume that has two-page abstract of each presentation. In addition
for wider dissemination of novel and high impact work, the symposium produces an
archival journal as a special issue of the "Solid State
Electronics".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
