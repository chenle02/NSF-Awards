The objective of this research is to study and implement a miniaturized
microfluidic-based uropathogen detection system for rapid detection of bacterial
pathogens. The approach is i) to use molecular probe biosensors for targeting
four important pathogens including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus spp. that cause urinary tract infections
(UTI), ii) to integrate nanotechnology-enabled fluidic valves to control fluids
in microfluidic channels, and iii) to integrate sensing and fluidic modules all
on a miniaturized chip to eliminate the requirement of skilled
technicians.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research includes the use
of molecular biosensors for single step hybridization of bacterial 16S rRNA,
which is a well described bacterial ?molecular fingerprint?. The single step
hybridization mitigates the complicated sample preparation steps. The
nanotechnology-enabled fluidic valves utilize the dynamic modulation of the
hydrophobicity of the surface of nanostructures. These nanostructures are
approximately 10?s of nanometers tall, yet are sufficient to block fluid flow in
micrometer height channels. The molecular biosensor and the nano-valves are
integrated on a microfluidic-based platform that is equipped with on-chip
heating and sample delivery functions. The miniaturized uropathogen detection
system significantly simplifies current standard procedures that are labor-
intensive, time consuming, and require a centralized laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this research include a miniaturized detection system that
can be operated in decentralized settings such as a physician?s office,
airports, or battlefield. The research will be integrated across educational
fronts including i) course development, ii) student training, iii) undergraduate
and minority research opportunities, and iv) outreach programs.&lt;br/&gt;
