In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Sitz will perform state-to-state experiments involving
molecular hydrogen and deuterium scattering from reactive transition metal
surfaces. The relative importance of translational, rotational, and vibrational
motion and molecular alignment in determining the outcome of scattering events
in hydrogen/copper and hydrogen/palladium systems will be investigated.
Stimulated Raman scattering will be used to prepare hydrogen molecules incident
on the surface in selected rotational and vibrational states. Scattered
molecules will be detected in a quantum state specific manner by
multiphotonionization. By exploiting the simple systems studied here, a
definitive comparison with theory will be possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully
highly resolved measurements provide new insight into surface dynamics.
Experimental results of the kind obtained in this project provide critical data
for testing existing models and theories and help motivate the development of
new ones. It is known that the presence of various atoms on a surface can lead
to either poisoning or promotion of surface reactions, but these effects are not
fully understood. The collaboration with theoreticians is also expected to
enable a predictive understanding of fundamental gas-surface processes that will
ultimately impact catalytic reaction processes and other technological
applications. Students in the PI's laboratory are trained in the use of state-
of-the-art laser and vacuum technologies.
