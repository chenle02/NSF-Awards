0120579&lt;br/&gt;Verdugo&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to
test the hypothesis that a major fraction of dissolved organic matter in
seawater occurs as self-assembled polymer gels with unique properties that
differ from those of their constituent macromolecules or from rigid colloids of
comparable size. These properties affect bioavailability of the organic
constituents in this colloidal matter. The hypothesis will be tested in parallel
laboratory and field experiments involving biophysics, biogeochemistry and
marine microbiology. The validity of the hypothesis is tested by addressing five
subquestions which include: (1) What are the spatial and temporal distributions
of the gel? (2) What are the chemical properties? (3) How are the physics of
marine gels related to their sources and reactions? (4) What are the biological
sources? (5) What biodegradation processes alter or remove the gels? This
research could help explain how organic polymer gels affect the function of the
oceans microbial loop, and hence the marine food web and global carbon
cycle.&lt;br/&gt;
