Galaxies are not spread uniformly through space, but are highly clustered in a
network of super-clusters separated by voids, now called the Cosmic Web. The
galaxies contain only about 10% of the mass in the Web; the remainder of the
baryonic (ordinary) matter is in the highly-ionized intergalactic medium (IGM).
The proposing team will conduct observational studies of the IGM, using the
Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope to probe the
gas in absorption in the spectra of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), and large
ground-based telescopes to study the galaxies near those lines of sight with the
intent of determining the connection between the galaxies and the absorption
lines. They will exploit a database of ~140 QSO sight lines with high-quality
COS spectra, and obtain spectra of the galaxies nearby with a combination of
archival data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), new observations with
the HYDRA spectrographs at the WIYN and CTIO 4-meter telescope, and a new
redshift survey conducted with the Gemini telescopes. The goal of these combined
observations is to produce (1) the most complete census of baryons in the Cosmic
Web to date, including the hotter gas currently regarded as "missing"; (2) a
potential solution to the baryon deficiency problem in spiral galaxies; and (3)
a mapping of circumgalactic gas, representing a largely undetected phase of the
cycle of infall and outflow that regulates star formation in galaxies. The team
will disseminate images, spectra, and higher-level data products via the
National Virtual Observatory; train a postdoc and graduate students in optical
and UV spectroscopy techniques; adapt these techniques to undergraduate-level
exercises; and develop a public planetarium show.
