9316126 LaBelle Research funded by NSF during the past year has proven that
using inexpensive ground-based instrumentation, it is possible to detect at
least two types of radio phenomena at LF/MF/HF frquencoes (0.05- 5.0 MHz) in the
auroral zone. These include narrowband emissions near twice and three times the
ionospheric electron gyrofrequency and broadband noise enhancements with nulls
in the spectrum near harmonies of the gyrofrequency. Although models have been
proposed for both these phenomena, their cause is undetermined, as are the range
and time variation of their occurrence. We propose to make more advanced
measurements of these wave phenomena, including measurements from a chain of
stations, with the following objectives: (1) to determine the latitude and time
dependence of the waves; (2) to test several specific models for their
generation, using wave data and complementary ionosonde, magnetometer, riometer,
and all-sky camera data; and (3) to explore the use of these wave observations
in combination with CANOPUS/ISTO instrumentation as a ground-based diagnostic of
the auroral ionosphere. Although radio emissions comprise a small fraction of
the total energy of the Aurora, they may provide important clues to the more
energetic processes, in analogy to the way in which solar radio emissions have
been used to infer the processes taking place in the solar corona. ***
