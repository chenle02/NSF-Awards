9320426 Sivjee This award is for joint radar and optical investigations of the
interactions between the atmospheric constituents in the polar thermosphere and
precipitating auroral electrons. The latter dissipate most of their energy
through a combination of processes involving dissociation, excitation and
ionization of some of the upper atmospheric constituents. In turn, the
byproducts of these processes interact with ambient air particles to modify
polar thermospheric composition and thermodynamics. All these upper atmospheric
auroral processes can be investigated by combining ground-based remote sensing
measurements of auroral ionization profiles using incoherent scatter radar (ISR)
sounding of the auroral region, and concurrent bore-sighted spectroscopic and
interferometric observations of the optical signatures of the auroral electron
excitation of N2, O2, O and N. The data base for these studies will be
constructed from the ISR and Spectro- interferometric observations of auroral
displays occurring over Sondrestromfjord in Greenland. ***
