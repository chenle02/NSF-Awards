Sterol C-methyl transfer reactions catalyzed by the (S)-adenosyl-L-methionine:
.24 -sterol methyl transferase (SMT) control the production and processing of
sitosterol biosynthesis in plants. SMTs differ in physical properties, reaction
complexity and the complement of C1/C2-activities. This project tests the
proposal that a family of three-dimensionally similar SMT isoforms exists in
plants and catalyzes the successive C-methylations of a sterol acceptor molecule
from a common active site according to a similar mechanistic plan (the steric-
electric plug model). Minor differences in the active site topography are
considered to determine the complement of C-methylation activities and product
outcome. In this project, cloned SMTs from Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max
will be produced at high levels. The specific goals of this project
are:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Characterization of the kinetic mechanism and product
identities involved with the first and second C1-transfer reactions. For this
purpose, substrate analogs and ATP will be used to probe catalytic action of the
recombinant SMTs and GC-MS and NMR will be employed in product structure
determination.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Identification of the sterol- and AdoMet-binding
sites and catalytic amino acids in the active center by chemical and
photoaffinity labeling techniques. Information from the active site location,
plus that gained by primary sequence comparisons with related SMTs, will be used
to guide site-directed mutagenesis of select amino acid residues in the active
center to generate unusual product diversity that can benefit the plant defense
system. &lt;br/&gt;Knowledge gained from this research is expected to be broadly
applicable to the understanding of molecular biochemistry and biosynthetic
investigations in general.&lt;br/&gt;
