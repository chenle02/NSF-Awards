A coordinated set of laboratory core exercises will take upper division cell and
molecular biology majors from the cloning of a gene to the purification of its
coded protein. The exercises is based on the baculovirus (Bac) expression
system, a procedure that inserts foreign genes into a virus which infects cell
lines derived from moths and over produces the inserted gene. The laboratory
exercises will flow from the subcloning of genes into transfer vectors used with
the Bac system to the chromatographic purification of the recombinant protein
produced in the tissue cultured moth cells. The DNA to RNA to protein principle
of molecular biology is reinforced by the working relationship students receive
with such important procedures as: tissue culture, manipulation of viruses of
eukaryotic cells, in vitro manipulations of DNA molecules, specific detections
of macromolecules (Western, Northern, and Southern blots), and protein
purifications. Senior Thesis projects will aslo employ the new laboratory
equipment.
