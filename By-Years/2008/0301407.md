This award supports purchase of a confocal microscopy system, including camera
and computer for research and teaching in cellular and molecular biology,
endocrinology, reproductive physiology, digestive physiology, animal embryology
and nutrition. This system will permit high-magnification, high-resolution
studies employing bright field, differential interference contrast (DIC) and
epifluorescence microscopy. The state-of-the-art confocal system and infinity
optics in this microscope will enhance quantitative immunofluorescence studies.
The three investigators who will share the microscope have research programs
focused on the role of vascular development (angiogenesis) in tissue growth,
development and regression; hormonal control of growth, development and
metabolism; and cellular interactions within organs and tissues. Other
researchers from the Cell Biology Center and the Departments of Animal and Range
Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Veterinary and Microbiological Sciences, as
well as their students, are also expected to use the system.
