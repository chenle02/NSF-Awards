Professor Soriaga's research effort will be directed towards a fundamental
understanding of electrocatalysis and establishing the fundamental concepts
describing molecular level phenomena occuring at electrode-solution interfaces.
Fundamental studies of interfacial structure, composition, and chemical
properties of well defined bimetallic electrocatylists will be emphasized, and
will include a study of platinum-gold electrode compositions. Unsaturated and
oxygenated hydrocarbons, and sulfur and nitrogen containing compounds will serve
as model compounds for electrocatylitic hydrogenation. The goal of the project
is to provide atomic level understanding of bimetallic electrocatalysis which
can then be used to explore new synthetic routes to highly- selective
electrocatalyst materials.
