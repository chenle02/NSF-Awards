This award supports collaborative research on algebraic geometry. Robert Lax of
Louisiana State University is an expert on Weierstrass points on complex
Gorenstein curves, while Arnaldo Garcia of IMPA (Rio de Janeiro) is an expert on
curves in positive characteristic. The notions of classical and non classical
curves will be extended to singular curves. Questions concerning classicality of
curves and normalization and classicality of curves and degenerations will be
considered. On smooth curves in characteristic zero, the investigators will
study possible weights and gap sequences of Weierstrass points on curves that
are two-sheeted covers of other curves. On smooth curves in positive
characteristic, the investigators will study relation between the defining
equation and the classicality of the curve. Finally, on curves over finite
fields, the investigators will study relations between the Weierstrass gap
sequence at a point and geometric Goppa codes defined using a multiple of that
point. The question of the number of rational points on curves with certain
types of Weierstrass points will also be considered. While this research is sure
mathematics, there exists the potential for important application in coding
theory due to the connections with Goppa codes.
