This FIRE project supports the collaboration of researchers from Texas Tech
University to engage in a cross-disciplinary research and development project in
learning about engineering concepts by young children in kindergarten through
second grade. The PIs include an early child learning specialist and an
engineering who has written books about engineering for children. The research
questions that ground this study address the impact of the use of engineering-
centered literature and aligned simulations on student learning and engagement
in related STEM content. The researchers are using a single-case design to
compare the use of the project Engineering Everywhere Literacy instruction along
and in combination with the computer simulation games in the classrooms of two
teachers. A small pilot comparison group study is being conducted in the second
year of the project to determine the promise of the
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration of disciplinary faculty and
education researchers requires that each individual build an understanding of
the conceptual frameworks and research perspectives and methodologies of the
other discipline. The collaboration modeled in this project provides an example
of the sorts of activities in which each researcher should engage in order to
make the collaboration more fruitful. The focus on engineering concepts is
timely given the rising presence of engineering design in the new college and
career readiness standards. The focus on early childhood experiences with
engineering addresses a gap in research and development in education.
