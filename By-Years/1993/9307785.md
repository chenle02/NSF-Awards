9307785 Tsai Videotapes software,k and manuals will be developed to cover the
design process of composite materials and structures. This teaching package is
intended to introduce the research results to engineers in industry without
prior knowledge of composites. It is hoped that the outstanding properties of
composites, namely, high strength, light weight, long life, and low cost, can be
applied to civilian and industrial products with the aid of this teaching
package.
