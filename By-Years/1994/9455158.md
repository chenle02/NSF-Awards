The goal of this project is flexible, consistent introductory engineering design
education for a diverse pool of students who follow single-institution or
transfer paths to their baccalaureate engineering degrees. The project links
universities to community colleges to produce design education that is
"integrated throughout the curriculum" as needed for accreditation. Project
objectives are: * Establish a curricular structure for well-defined,
transferable introductory design education in an environment of diverse
institutions, curricula, and students; * Produce transportable curricular
materials and instructional methods that support effective "integrated"
engineering design education in transfer environments; * Enable faculty at a
variety of institutions to adopt, implement, and evaluate exemplary materials
and methods suitable for their programs and their students; and * Achieve
increased enrollment and retention of students, especially women, minorities,
and disabled, in early engineering design courses. Curriculum materials are
developed to meet learning objectives for introductory design, to fit a variety
of institutions, and to serve students with diverse backgrounds and interests.
Faculty workshops transfer these learning objectives and strategies for
achieving them in a variety of settings, and they prepare faculty to adopt
materials and methods to use in classes with diverse student populations.
Exemplary curricular materials are packaged for distribution.
