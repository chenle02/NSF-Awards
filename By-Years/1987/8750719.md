As a part of an Environmental Analysis major a new laboratory course is being
developed in "Receiving Water Analysis." Experiments are being developed and
tested involving measuring the amount of dissolved oxygen in different
situations and to evaluate parameters such as, reaeration constants,
decomposition constants, and diffusion and dispersion constants. The Ion
Chromatograph is being used to monitor inorganic ions such as nitrates and
phosphates to evaluate empirical constants for use in classical water quality
mathematical models. A laboratory manual for the course is being planned to
indicate the possibilities these experiments provide for students in
environmental studies.
