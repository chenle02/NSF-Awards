This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project utilizes information
gleaned from social media about upcoming events to inform designated authorities
in a timely manner so they can prepare mitigating action plans in case of
emergency. Besides the extracted events themselves, harvested information may
include (but is not limited to) images, posted messages, peopleâ€™s sentiments and
other surrounding context which will improve relevancy and trust of the
information in understanding emergency situations. Extracted events become the
source for investigating and analyzing spatial-temporal influences between
events and cross-domain events to derive further insights. Potential
applications are real-time tracking and monitoring of events for disaster
relief, and forecasting of events for mitigation plans. Project outcomes will
benefit researchers in information extraction and integration with interests in
graph models and transfer learning; in addition to providing practical studying
materials in areas such as deep learning, spatio-temporal data causality and
analysis for students about disaster resilience and progressing towards
community resilience in the long term. Moreover, the work will increase research
capacity and collaborations to generate new research opportunities for students
from underrepresented communities to pursue advanced degrees in computer
science.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Social media data provides a means to identify
happening events prior, during, and post disasters. It provides signals for
designed authorities for reactions and mitigation planning. This research will
use social media posts, machine learning, and transfer learning techniques in
three thrusts: 1) Extract local and global events; 2) Embed surrounding context
such as relevance and trust; 3) Analyze spatial-temporal relationship between
events and cross-domain events for further insights. This project puts forth a
novel approach to events analysis under the umbrella of graph neural network and
transfer learning, leveraging recent advances and opportunities in deep
learning. The resulting data-driven algorithms will be modelled emphasizing the
socio-economic aspects of the consequences and cascading losses by allowing the
system to adapt according to the community-based variables and the dynamics of
the disasters. The findings will be disseminated via publications, source code,
and data to reach diverse communities of researchers and
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
