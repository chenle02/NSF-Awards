Healthy ventricular myocardium behaves much like a continuous uniform excitable
medium, despite its evident discontinuities of structure and function on sub-mm
and sub-msec scales. On the basis of this analogy and the corresponding
numerical models it has been predicted that myocardium should be vulnerable to a
stimulus of certain phase and size which induces reentry in the form of paired
vortices in 2 dimensions and vortex filaments in 3 dimensions, independent of
the discontinuities and heterogeneity that apparently make diseased tissue more
vulnerable. This and related consequences have now been confirmed by electrical
stimulation and high-resolution myocardial mapping. The purposes for the next
support interval are (1) to explore the implications for 3- dimensional
vorticity, both numerically and in collaboration with experimental
physiologists, as before; (2) to examine these phenomena through the
interpretive lens of the best available electrophysiological model of
ventricular myocardial membrane; (3) to understand the development of reentrant
tachycardias into fibrillation in terms of the nonlinear dynamics of excitable
media, using those electrophysiological membrane models; and (4) to examine
possible mechanisms of defibrillation from the theoretical perspective thus
consolidated. By computational modelling of specific ionic mechanisms of the
particular excitable medium of interest, it should be possible to understand
these mechanisms in quantitative detail for the first time. This will allow an
understanding and control of membrane properties via altered electric fields.
