This research explodes a unique tubular wire manufacturing process that can
allow the production of unlimited length superconducting wires. This unique
manufacturing process is intended to overcome the problems with the conventional
manufacturing method of packing powder in a fixed-length hollow tube, and can be
applied to any superconducting powder and sheath material combination. This
process is researched using the Bi- Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O powder and silver sheath. This
research will provide long, continuous, uniform, high- temperature
superconductor wires and tapes for use in the manufacture of magnets, motors,
generators, energy storage devices and magnetic resonance imaging equipment.
