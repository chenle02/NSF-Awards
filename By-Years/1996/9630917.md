ABSTRACT CTS-9630917 Luke Achenie New Solvents are developed in response to one
or more of the following: (i) a desire for better performance or reduced cost,
(ii) the presence of a new process (iii) change in federal and state
environmental regulations and (iv) safety and health considerations. Developing
new solvents with improved properties is, in general, a very time consuming and
expensive process involving a combination of heuristics and costly experimental
studies. In these trial and error approaches, different solvents are
synthesized, their physical and/or chemical properties are measured or inferred
and compared with the desire properties for that application. This proposal
deals with initiating a systems research approach into finding a systematic
framework for designing cleaning solvents for the printing industry. This frame
work simultaneously takes into consideration process performance and economics
as well as health, safety and environmental targets. An "optimal" blanket wash
(cleaning solvent for the printing press) designed through a systematic
procedure can result in significant energy savings as well as minimal
environmental impact. ***
