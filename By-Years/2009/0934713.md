This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saint Joseph's University (SJU) is
increasing the number of highly qualified math and science secondary school
teachers who work in high-need school districts. Collaborating with the School
District of Philadelphia, the project recruits current and incoming
undergraduate students to the SJU five-year BS/MS program in mathematics and
science secondary education by providing support in the form of educational
outreach opportunities for undergraduates in their first two years and tuition
scholarships during their fourth and fifth years. In return for these
scholarships, graduates of the program commit to teaching in Philadelphia and
other high-need public high schools. Scholarship recipients are mentored in
their beginning teaching years through the Urban Teacher Collaborative, which
provides monthly workshops for exploring issues specific to teaching math and
science in urban high schools. The grant also supports a summer program in
mathematics and science education that combines a graduate level class for
students in the five-year programs, a math and science educational outreach
program targeting junior high and high school students in the area and paid
summer internships for freshmen and sophomores at SJU to engage in mathematics
and science teaching as a strategy to interest them in teaching as a career. The
long term goal of the project is to graduate more secondary teachers with strong
backgrounds in mathematics, biology, chemistry and physics who are committed to
teaching underserved students in Philadelphia and the surrounding communities.
The project provides tuition support to a minimum of 19 Noyce scholars during
the project years.
