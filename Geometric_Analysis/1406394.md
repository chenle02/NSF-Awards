The project aims to study two geometric versions of the heat equation: the
evolution of surfaces by their mean curvature, and the evolution of curved
spaces by Ricci flow. Mean curvature flow models many physical processes which
involve an evolving surface, or interface. It is the most efficient way to
decrease the area of surfaces and to evolve them towards optimal ones.
Correspondingly, Ricci flow deforms curved spaces towards optimal shapes. While
many foundational results have been obtained on both flows, a central problem is
that in most relevant situations singularities will form. The proposed research
of the PI will provide ways to understand these singularities and to continue
the flow through them. This will facilitate many new applications both within
and outside mathematics.

The proposed research is on mean curvature flow and Ricci flow, with a focus on
the formation of singularities and techniques to continue the flow through
singularities. In a joint work with Bruce Kleiner, the PI will give a new
construction of mean curvature flow with surgery, based on their recent
estimates for mean convex flows. The new construction is both more elementary
and substantially shorter than prior ones. The PI will apply the mean curvature
flow with surgery to topological problems, including a higher dimensional Smale
conjecture. In a joint project with Aaron Naber, the PI will prove numerous
estimates on path space for the Ricci flow. In fact, an evolving family of
Riemannian manifolds satisfies these estimates if and only if it evolves by
Ricci flow. Based on this, the PI and Naber will define a notion of weak
solutions for the Ricci flow, and develop the theory of these weak solutions.
