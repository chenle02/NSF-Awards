This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a vaccine
for the control of infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) disease of salmon and
trout. An efficacious, safe and reasonably priced IHN virus vaccine would
improve the productivity of the finfish aquaculture industry in the Pacific
Northwest, ensure the productivity of commercial and recreational fisheries, and
reduce environmental concerns related to IHN virus transmission between wild and
farmed fish. The aquaculture industry has created jobs in remote and rural areas
of North America. These jobs are threatened by recurrent IHN outbreaks.
Additionally, this project will investigate how the glycoprotein of IHN virus
elicits a non-specific, cross-protective immune response in trout and salmon.
Such information will be helpful in developing new viral vaccines and adjuvants.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of aquaculture. The
IHN virus vaccine will provide a significant benefit to the North American
aquaculture industry. The product will be marketed to non-commercial and
commercial salmon and trout farming enterprises in western Canada and the United
States.
