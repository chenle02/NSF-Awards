This RAPID award will support the collection and storage of a rock core to be
extracted during a U.S. Army-funded drilling project that is scheduled to start
in February-March. Two, 2 km deep boreholes, will be drilled into the Army's
Pohakuloa Training Area - located near the center of the Big Island of Hawaii in
the Humu'ula Saddle region between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa volcanoes. One year
of continuous rock coring is anticipated. The core itself promises to hold
important insight into outstanding scientific problems related to mantle
melting, and the internal structure and evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes. The U.S
Army's interest is in finding a potable water source for the region and they are
willing to allow the team of geologists access to the rock core. This RAPID will
support the infrastructure needed to properly clean, label, describe, and store
the rock core that will be extracted in the drilling process, providing the
greater geological community access to these unique samples that will be
responsibly archived for future scientific analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
opportunity to analyze 2 km of continuous stratigraphy of a Hawaiian volcano is
certainly rare, yet presents a fundamental way by which to gather information
about processes that occur from the Earth's mantle to the surface. The location
of this core is distinct from any previous drill site in Hawaii, which will
enable a more complete regional sampling to address questions specifically
related to the internal structure of Mauna Kea volcano. The rationale for the
RAPID is to ensure that the core is properly archived so that this unique
opportunity to obtain these samples is not lost.
