9309711 Crosby This is a standard award for Research Initiation to investigate
the relationships between individual characteristics of students and their
performance as they search documents of varying levels of complexity. Dependent
variables in this study include eye fixations, comprehension tasks, and time on
task. Independent variables will be measurements of the differences between
individual students. The objective of this research is to investigate how humans
differentially locate information from a computer screen and utilize this
information to answer questions. Results from this research should provide
insight on how to best address searching tasks, and in particular whether to
concentrate on designing interfaces that adapt to the user's cognitive style or
to teach users how to best carry out a search, or both. ` ` h h # ( - p p 2 ` `
