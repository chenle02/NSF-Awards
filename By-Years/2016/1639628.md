Investigations of algorithms and computational complexity in theoretical
computer science typically assume that the function to be computed and the
inputs to that function are completely specified and known in advance. In most
realistic cases, however, the computation proceeds in stages, and knowledge of
the function and the inputs becomes known progressively at different stages of
this process. In addition, these data may be drawn from a probability
distribution, which may be known or may have to be discovered by sampling. The
workshop will be devoted to exploring particular settings in which such
uncertainties arise, and developing suitable paradigms for evaluating algorithms
in such settings.

The workshop will enhance communication among the mathematics, computer science,
statistics and operations research communities. It will be open to all potential
participants, and the workshop findings (including video recordings of
presentations) will be distributed to the public for comment and engagement. The
organizers will encourage students to attend the workshop, and will actively
recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds to contribute to a wide range
of applications.
