9314003 Cunningham The Pennsylvania College of Technology and Lycoming College
request support from NSF for a multicampus connection of their campus networks
to PREPnet. PREPnet is the midlevel network located in the state of
Pennsylvania. PREPnet will provide operations management and information
services and it will give the colleges s connection to the NSFNET, a high speed
(1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The colleges need
greater functionality and network speed to be able to access supercomputers,
libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more
reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the links.
This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore innovative
educational resources.
