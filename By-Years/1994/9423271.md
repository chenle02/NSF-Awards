Professor Michael B. Hall at the Department of Chemistry, Texas A&amp;M
University is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program at NSF for ab initio theoretical studies of problems of
current interest in inorganic and organometallic chemistry, especially
homogeneous catalysis. The computational methods which are being used involve
full-gradient geometry optimization techniques for both multiconfiguration self-
consistent-field and configuration interaction wavefunctions. The applications
being made often require calculations at the frontier of those possible and, if
necessary, the existing methods are modified and enhanced so that these
calculations can be performed. The work under this grant is focused on the study
and the characterization of four fundamental steps in catalytic reactions:
oxidative-addition; substitution; migratory-insertion; and atom transfer. The
systems being studied include models for biologically and industrially important
catalytic oxidation processes. The work supported by this grant will help to
provide the understanding which will allow researchers to make qualitative
chemical predictions, without the need for further calculations, related to
reactions involved in biological and industrial processes. A major objective is
the discovery and prediction of systematic trends in the structures and
reactivity of inorganic and organometallic systems. In order to achieve these
objectives the systems being studied theoretically by Professor Hall are chosen
to be as close as possible to systems being studied by experimentalists.
