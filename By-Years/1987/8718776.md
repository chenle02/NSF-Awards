The goal of this project is to deposit, on amorphous or polycrystalline
substrates, thin films of high Tc, rare earth- barium-copper-oxygen
superconductors with critical current densities exceeding 1*106 A/cm2 at 77k.
This capability would permit the direct replacement of integrated circuit
interconnects with superconductors. The present limits in critical current
density for polycrystalline superconducting films (typically 103 A/cm2) are
associated with Josephson junctions at grain boundaries. In an effort to
overcome this limitation, this project is aimed at controlling crystalline
orientation and quality without invoking epitaxial growth. The potential of two
quite different techniques will be evaluated. In the first approach, the ability
of reactive ion beam assisted deposition to control oxygen content and crystal
orientation of films will be explored. In the second, the possibility of
"grapho-epitaxy", where the film is oriented with respect to an artificially
structured substrate, will be explored.
