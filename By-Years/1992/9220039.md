An experimental laboratory investigation of two interrelated physical
properties of partially molten upper mantle rocks, permeability and rheology, is
proposed. For both of these phenomena, the effects of grain-scale melt
distribution, melt fraction, grain size and temperature will be studied.
Experiments will be carried out on samples of olivine + basalt + clinopyroxene.
The permeability experiments will focus on quantifying the rate of melt
migration in response to capillary forces or to a temperature gradient. These
experiments will yield the dependence of permeability on melt fraction and will
provide constraints on the permeability of rocks crystallizing in a thermal
gradient. The high-temperature creep (rheology) experiments will be carried out
at high confining pressures in both the dislocation and diffusional creep
regimes, with emphasis on the former. These measurements will concentrate on the
development of constitutive equations, which can be used to extrapolate from
laboratory to upper mantle conditions. This experimental program will provide
permeabilities and rheologies for dunite, harzburgite and lherzolite.
