Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic
and organometallic molecules. When combined with gas chromatography (GC), the
resulting GC/MS affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available for
the separation and characterization of compounds. The aquisition of GC/MS is
essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
The Department of Chemistry at the University of West Virginia will use this
award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help aquire a GC/MS system.
The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the aquisition include
the following: 1) Multifunctional boranes, silanes and stannanes in organic
synthesis 2) Chiral carbanions: Asymmetric synthesis via binaphthyl derived
organometallic reagents 3) Materials characterization.
