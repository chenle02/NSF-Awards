This project aims to determine the amount of water and carbon dioxide dissolved
in magma before it erupts from active volcanoes in the Aleutian islands, Alaska.
Water in particular is critical to every aspect of these magmas, from their
plumbing system beneath the volcanoes, to their very origin in the subduction
zone, to their gas content which fuels eruptions. Despite its primary
importance, water has been determined in only a limited number of volcanic
samples. The Aleutian volcanoes of Alaska offer a prime opportunity to relate
water contents to existing geochemical tracers from the subduction zone,
geophysical parameters of plate subduction, and geodetic measurement of magma
storage depths and volcano deformation. The latter linkage will be possible
through Plate Boundary Observatory installations on Augustine and Akutan
volcanoes as part of the EarthScope facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
follows from a one-year pilot study funded to collect appropriate samples. The
researchers have ~ 100 tephra samples from 10 Aleutian volcanoes, and plan to
collect more from Seguam volcano. Preliminary data are promising, showing among
the highest water contents measured in the world in mafic arc melt inclusions
(&gt; 7 wt%) from Augustine volcano, which is currently erupting. The primary
activity of the current project is to analyze melt inclusions trapped in olivine
crystals for their volatile content (H2O, CO2, S, Cl,) by ion microprobe at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington, and trace elements (including La, Ba, Sr, U,
Th, Pb, Nb) by laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at
Boston University. Another major focus will be the development of new techniques
for estimating the water content of magmas from clinopyroxene crystals, one
based on their rare earth element pattern, and the other on their H2O content.
This project will enable a female graduate student to complete her PhD work, and
will support undergraduate research at Boston University.&lt;br/&gt;
