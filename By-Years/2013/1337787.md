1337787&lt;br/&gt;Ren&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding for
the acquisition of a state-of-the-art fluorescence activated cell (FAC) sorter.
Syracuse University (SU) does not currently have a FAC sorter and this is a
limiting factor for many research projects in different SU departments. The
selected model is a Special FACS AriaTM system with 4 lasers from BD
Biosciences. It fulfills the needs of all confirmed users and has sufficient
flexibility to successfully incorporate future users. It will enable researchers
to sort both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells between 0.2 - 100 Ã¬m in diameter
with high speeds (up to 70,000 cells per second) and high accuracy (&gt;99%).
This major piece of advanced instrumentation will be a crucial resource for many
ongoing projects at SU in the areas of biomaterials (including cell-surface
interactions, drug delivery, and nanotechnology), molecular and cell biology
(including neuroscience, cell physiology, development, and inter-kingdom
signaling) and biofuels research involving algae cells.
