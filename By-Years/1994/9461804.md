The current available hydrogen storage methods have their limitations. The
compressed gas storage and metal hydride storage systems have relatively low
energy densities, and the liquefied gas storage requires costly cryogenics. The
hybrid carbon adsorption storage techniques have not lived up to their projected
potential partly due to low hydrogen adsorption capacities of activated carbons.
In the exploratory experiments conducted at MER, at the first time, to the best
of their knowledge, they have successfully hydrogenated fullerene mixtures up to
5.5% by weight of hydrogen using physical method. The hydrogenated fullerenes --
fullerene hydrides are stable at ambient conditions and release hydrogen gas at
elevated temperatures. Also, MER has converted fullerene mixtures into some kind
of carbon (they call it super carbon) which has much larger hydrogen storage
capacity than conventional high surface area activated carbons. In this
proposal, the feasibility of using the fullerene-hydrides or fullerene converted
super carbons as materials for hydrogen storage will be studied. In this work,
the best procedures to physically hydrogenate fullerenes, and the best
procedures to convert fullerenes into super carbons will be researched. The
dehydrogenation (degas) properties of fullerene-hydride, and hydrogen
adsorption-desorption properties of super carbons will be studied. And the
economic and performance comparisons of the new hydrogen storage methods with
other hydrogen storage methods will be made.
