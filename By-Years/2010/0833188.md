Scientific applications can model interactions of medicines with proteins,
predict the behavior of nano-materials, model the climate, and lead to better
understanding of physical phenomenon. These applications demand ever greater
computational resources, which can only be supplied by new parallel computers
with ever increasing capability and complexity. Parallel computing can bring
about new breakthroughs only if the complexity of efficient parallel programming
can be overcome. Yet developing parallel applications remains significantly more
difficult than serial development. Petascale machines with hundreds of
thousands(and possibly millions) of processors add to the complexity, as do new
sophisticated algorithms and multi-physics applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a new approach to
parallel programming which builds upon the automatic resource management and
composibility of the Charm++ framework. This approach includes development of
multiple, individually incomplete, programming models. Each model simplifies
parallel programming while still covering significant categories of
applications. This collection of interoperable models, supported by complete
models including Adaptive MPI and Charm++, provides a powerful environment for
developing future petascale applications. A compiler framework is being
developed which provides a common representation and facilitates compatibility
between models. In addition, the vision includes abstractions supported by
libraries for commonly needed data types and functionalities. These abstractions
will support and interoperate with domain specific frameworks. The results of
this project will enable the large community of computational scientists and
engineers to harness petascale machines with relative ease in order to generate
breakthroughs in scientific discovery and engineering
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
