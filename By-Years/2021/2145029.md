This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this work is to
understand how a class of biologically essential proteins known as ‘membrane
proteins’ are made in human cells. All cells are surrounded by a thin protective
‘skin’ known as a membrane, which is studded with proteins. These membrane
proteins allow cells to both transmit and receive information and nutrients, and
are thus are critical for how organisms respond and react to changes in their
environment. Because these membrane proteins contain waxy, hydrophobic regions
that must be guided-to and embedded within these membranes, they require
specialized machinery for their synthesis. This project seeks to understand the
cellular machinery used to make these membrane proteins. Coupled with this
research, an integrated educational and outreach plan will be used to both
highlight forgotten contributions from women and underrepresented minorities to
science, and increase exposure of diverse students to biological research.
American Rescue Plan funding will support this investigator at a critical stage
in her career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The defining structural feature of a
membrane protein is the presence of one or more transmembrane domains (TMDs)
that must be inserted into the lipid bilayer. For multipass membrane proteins,
these TMDs differ substantially in length and hydrophobicity, and thus rely on
an incompletely understood set of factors for their biogenesis. This project
seeks to identify and characterize the molecular players required for the
insertion, folding, and stabilization of diverse multipass membrane proteins in
human cells. Novel membrane protein biogenesis factors will be identified using
genome wide genetic screens and biochemical analysis of the interactome of a
panel of nascent membrane proteins. A combination of functional and structural
strategies will be used to dissect the molecular role of these factors in
membrane protein biogenesis using both in vitro reconstitution and single
particle cryoelectron microscopy. This research will establish general
principles of membrane protein biogenesis that will be relevant across all
kingdoms of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
