Currently two lecture-based courses are offered in biomedical engineering:
first, "Introduction to Biomedical Engineering" is a survey course open to all
science and engineering students at the university. The other course,
"Biomedical Instrumentation", is designed for senior-level electrical
engineering students. The objective of this project is to secure the necessary
equipment to realize an effective laboratory component for each of these
courses. For the introductory course, physiography units enable the student to
measure and analyze a variety of electrophysiological and transduced signals
from the human body. Aside from valuable "hands-on" experimentation, these units
would provide a unique perspective of critical biomedical engineering design
issues like patient safety, cost, and interference suppression. For the
instrumentation course, the personal computers and input/output boards enable
the student to design and build a complete electrophysiological data
acquisition, display, and analysis system. The student develops skills
applicable to a large variety of engineering problems. The realization of these
two laboratory components would significantly enhance the quality of
undergraduate science and engineering education.
