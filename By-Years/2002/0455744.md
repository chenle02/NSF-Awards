The research project is a three-year study to investigate mathematics and
science teacher turnover and retention framed using an organizational
perspective. The objective of this research project is to empirically address
three related research questions:

1.) What are the sources of mathematics and science teacher turnover?

2.) Why do particular types of schools, especially those in urban, high-poverty
and high-minority communities, have higher levels of mathematics and science
teacher turnover?

3.) What impact do preservice teacher preparation, beginning teacher induction
programs, inservice professional development and teacher assignment have on the
turnover and retention of mathematics and science teachers?

To address these research questions the project team will analyze data on public
secondary-level mathematics and science teachers from the National Center for
Education Statistics' (NCES) nationally representative Schools and Staffing
Survey (SASS) and its supplement the Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS).

This project builds on an established record of prior research by the principal
investigator with existing large-scale data from teachers. It seeks to expand
our knowledge in regard to a set of important, but not well understood, issues
central to the goals of the Teacher Professional Continuum Program: What
characteristics of districts and schools, especially those serving disadvantaged
students, impact their ability to retain qualified mathematics and science
teachers? Prior research shows that if schools are to ensure that qualified
mathematics and science teachers teach all students, as the No Child Left Behind
Act mandates, then they must focus more on improving teacher retention. This
project seeks to provide research results that will help provide direction to
policymakers and school leaders on how best to proceed in doing this, especially
with mathematics and science teachers and especially in disadvantaged schools,
as the existing research has provided limited direction.
