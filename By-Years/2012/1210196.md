This action funds Dustin Wayne Adams of University of California, Santa Cruz to
conduct a research project, entitled "Blind Friendly Word Processors for
Japanese Authors" during the summer of 2012 at IBM Research - Tokyo in Tokyo,
Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Chieko Asakawa.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is an investigation into the
problems that Japanese authors experience and the successful strategies for
layout and formatting work by Japanese sighted authors, the development of an
add-on for the Japanese version of Microsoft Word, and the development of an
accessible and blind-friendly interface to the Japanese version of Amazon's
Mechanical Turk.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.

The add-on to the Japanese version of Microsoft Word and the blind-friendly
interface to the Japanese version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk that will allow
Japanese blind authors to check and correct their documents without relying on a
small circle of friends and peers can have tremendous impact on their ability to
compete in various areas. The understanding of the problems they face can
benefit a variety of stakeholders, including developers of assistive technology,
the schools that teach blind students about good writing, and scientific
communities that try to understand blind persons' mental models, to name a few.
