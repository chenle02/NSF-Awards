Modern marketplaces, enabled by recent advances in information technology, are
becoming ever more complex, dynamic and interconnected. Customers are
increasingly more informed about the choices available to them and are thus able
to make better decisions. For firms, this presents both opportunities and
challenges. On the positive side, the firm has a bigger than ever array of tools
at its disposal that enable it to better sell to its customers. Such tools are
both computational (pricing algorithms, customer targeting data, social
networking information) and economical (dynamic mechanisms) in nature. The
challenging aspect for the firm is that modern technology also allows consumers
to easily learn the opinions of fellow customers and to be strategic in their
decision-making. Having such strategic and networked customers is not
necessarily a net negative for the firm, but it certainly makes the firm's
problem of how to sell its products a more complex one.

This project aims to develop a framework for understanding how to sell goods in
markets that are fundamentally dynamic and interconnected. The project will
research what mechanisms are revenue-optimal (or near-optimal, while being
simple and computationally tractable) in dynamic settings where customers can
learn from each other. The PIs will study the effect of network learning on the
firm's behavior and whether it forces the firm to share some of the costs
associated with consumer learning. The project will also focus on how the social
networkstructure affects the optimal mechanism and will try to understand
whether such network learning effects lead to lower (or higher) revenue for the
firm and aggregate consumer welfare.

Fundamental research in the dynamics of networked markets provides deeper
knowledge to a broad audience that includes firms, consumer groups and
regulators. Curriculum development at the interface of operations research,
information systems and computer science will benefit from this research
experience.
