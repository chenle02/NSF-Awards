This award will support the participation of graduate students and postdocs in
the "Seventeenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held at the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities from April 25-27, 2014.

This annual conference, of which the 2014 meeting will be the seventeenth in the
series, celebrates the mathematical legacy of Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B.
Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of
partial differential equations. The 2014 program will feature four principal
speakers (Alice Chang, Frank Merle, Maciej Zworski, and Alexandru Ionescu), each
of whom will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows ample time for
informal discussion among the participants.
