Support is provided for a research workshop in the interdisciplinary area of
direct contact heat and mass transfer. The workshop is to be held on the days
preceding the 1985 ASME/AIChE National Heat Transfer Conference, and the results
will be published as a guide to the research community on opportunities and
needs in direct contact heat and mass transfer. This area offers the potential
for improving the efficiency and reducing the capital investment in many
industrial processes, particularly in the chemical industry, in waste heat
recovery, and in low-temperature renewable energy conversion. Research in direct
contact heat transfer is currently in a growth stage. It is hoped that the
workshop will serve to ascertain the state of current knowledge, determine what
progress is impeded by lack of knowledge, and identify the specific topics that
need attention in future research programs.
