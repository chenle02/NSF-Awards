The role of biological interactions in determining the abundance, distribution
and persistence of rare plants, and their vulnerability to environmental stress,
is poorly known. This study will analyze the consequences of competition and
seed predation on the population dynamics of a federally-listed threatened
species, Cirsium pitcheri.The proposed research will use field experiments to
reduce the impact of biological factors and interactions along a climatic
gradient in the dune systems around Lake Michigan. The results of this study
will provide critical baseline information on plant population dynamics of a
threatened species. In addition, results from this work will contribute to
developing useful conservation and management protocols for rare and endangered
plant species.
