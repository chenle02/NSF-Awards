9314473 Kutzko This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in algebra and number theory between Philip C. Kutzko, University of Iowa, and
Guy Henniart, University of Paris, Orsay. The investigators will study a number
of problems related to representation theory of p-adic groups and applications
to Langlands' program. The Langlands' picture theorizes that fundamental objects
of arithmetic (elliptic curves) are connected with fundamental objects in
representation theory (classical modular forms). The U.S.investigator brings to
this collaboration expertise in the representation theory of p-adic groups. This
is complemented by the French investigators renown expertise in local Langlands
conjecture. This project will advance our understanding of representation theory
and will serve as a basis for future advances in number theory and arithmetical
algebraic geometry. ***
