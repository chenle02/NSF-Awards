9408739 Dufour This research involves a graduate student in anthropology from
the University of Colorado studying how Colombian Indians use different
varieties of manioc. This food plant is a staple in many tropical places, and
grows in a "bitter" (i.e., poisonous) and "sweet" variety. The bitter varieties
are often planted even though they require a long procedure of food processing
in order to extract the poisons. The student will study the productivity of the
plants, their disease resistance, how the people treat them and why they prefer
some varieties to others, using a series of techniques including chemical
analysis of the plants and cognitive tests of the farmer's perceptions of
differences in the plants. Yields and damages to roots will be measured for
sweet and bitter manioc in 20 family gardens and one control garden. This
research will enhance our understanding of human adaptation to tropical rain
forests, particularly to black water river systems. The knowledge to be gained
will be valuable for agricultural planners and economic development advisers in
all tropical areas where manioc is an important food plant.
