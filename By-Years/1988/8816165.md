This project has two objectives: to study the formation processes of the
intermediate depth water which has its origins in the Labrador Sea, and to study
the various solutions to the non-linear equations governing thermohaline
circulations in the ocean. In the former, an analysis of the data from the North
Atlantic suggests that buoyancy forcing is the primary cause of the water mass
formation. A simple model will be constructed to elucidate the physical
processes. In the second aspect, it is known that several mathematical solutions
to the thermohaline equations bear much similarity to the distribution of ocean
tracers. However, a number of solutions have yet to be obtained and tested
against the oceanographic data sets to determine other fundamental
relationships. This task involves the orderly examination of a number of such
solutions.
