Many security problems today stem from bugs in software. Although there has been
significant effort in reducing bugs through better testing, fuzzing, model
checking, and so on, subtle bugs remain and continue to be exploited. This
proposal explores the use of formal verification to prove security of a file
system implementation along with an example application in the form of a mail
server. Machine-checked verification is a powerful approach that can eliminate a
large class of bugs in software by proving that an implementation meets a
precise specification. As long as the specification rules out a certain class of
bugs, the machine-checked proof will ensure no such bugs can exist in the
implementation. This project develops techniques for proving security of
sophisticated applications, such as proving that a mail server will not
inappropriately disclose confidential email messages. At the high level, the
impact of this work will be a more secure software
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key technical challenge that this
project focuses on is data confidentiality. The project explores approaches for
specifying confidentiality of systems software, including a mail server and a
POSIX file system, as well as a framework for implementation and machine-checked
verification of confidentiality properties for these applications. The project
also develops common infrastructure that such applications depend on, including
a formal security specification for a POSIX file system and verified
implementations of a mail server and a file system with proofs of security,
which will be useful to the broader community. Finally, part of the project
involves developing course modules focused on machine-checked proofs of
correctness and security for systems software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
