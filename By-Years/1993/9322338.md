9322338 Sherman This award continues an active Research Experiences for
Undergraduates at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology for another three-year
period. The program involves six undergraduates working under the supervision of
the principal investigator for a period of seven weeks. The research problems
center on a group theoretic interpretation of confidence intervals and counting
problems in finite groups with the general area of computational finite group
theory. The primary tool in the program will be MAGMA, a high level programming
language which enables the user to define the algebraic structure in which one
wishes to compute and which is not generally available to undergraduates. The
problems have been selected and the format for faculty-student interaction has
been designed to encourage students to develop from receivers of mathematical
fact to providers of mathematical fact and conjecture. The participants will
learn group theory and algebra, gain experience in mathematical research and
mathematical exposition (written and oral) and develop the facility to use a
computer work station as a mathematical tool. The more successful projects will
be presented at future professional meetings and possibly be published in
appropriate journals. ***
