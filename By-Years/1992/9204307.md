This research is concerned with the arithmetic of function fields. The
principal investigator will study Heegner points on modular curves with a view
to proving an analog of the theorem of Gross and Zagier. This is research in the
field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
