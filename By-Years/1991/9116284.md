In this project, the PI's will attempt to detect and measure the major mean
deep currents paralleling the northwestern boundary of the North Pacific by
deploying nine current meter moorings on a line southeastward of Hokkaido,
Japan, for a period of 2 years. The direct current measurements will be
supplemented with some conventional hydrographic observations.
