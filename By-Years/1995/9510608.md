DMS-9510608 PI: Salamanca Riba Salamanca Riba will investigate the relation
between certain irreducible unitary Harish-Chandra modules for a group and
Zuckerman functor modules derived from a one dimensional unitary representation
of a subgroup. She will also consider the problem of classifying all genuine
unitary representations of the metaplectic group. In particular, she will
consider the Adams-Barbasch correspondence between these representations and a
set of unitary representations of certain inner forms of the metaplectic group
and determine if the representations go to Zuckerman functor modules under this
map. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician
Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics.
As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system,
the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon
mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics.
