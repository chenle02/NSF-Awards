The vascular flora of the Greater Antilles contains perhaps 10,000 species, a
rich resource for fundamental ecological and systematic studies as well as for
the immediate demands of biotechnology, conservation and environmental biology.
However, only a single, severely dated reference exists that covers the entire
region. The Flora of the Greater Antilles project has been initiated by the New
York Botanical Garden and the Smithsonian Institution. Its goal is to produce a
complete monographic flora of vascular plants, cryptogams and fungi. This
multivolume product will be published in the Memoirs of the New York Botanical
Garden. The Orchidaceae has been targeted for early treatment in the Flora
series. The family represents a large portion of the vascular flora of the
Greater Antilles, 6-7%, and is represented by at least 660 species native or
naturalized to the region. The objectives of this project are to (1) initiate an
intensive collecting program, particularly in areas that are poorly known, in
areas of high endemism, and of difficult and underrepresented groups; (2) vis it
herbaria and libraries with important historical collections; (3) prepare an
illustrated monographic treatment of the family for Flora of the Grater Antilles
(Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden); and (4) establish an electronically
available database of information on which the treatment will be based. All of
approximately 109 genera will be covered in a single volume. The final product
will serve to clarify and stabilize taxonomy of the region, and will be a
standard reference for those conducting future floristic, taxonomic, ecological
and evolutionary studies. The specimen database produced will offer greater
detail than can be provided by the printed flora. Both products will serve as a
guide for land use planners and conservation biologists faced with critical
decisions in areas where social and political pressures for habitat exploitation
are severe.
