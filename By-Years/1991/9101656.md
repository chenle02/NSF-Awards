CAD design tools, produced in research projects at the University of Pittsburgh
are being developed and enhanced so as to bring them into a state for
distribution to general users. These tools are designed to help researchers and
educators investigate synthesis of VLSI systems from VHDL descriptions. Specific
tools being enhanced are: 1) "Vcomp" a compiler for a subset of the VHDL
language, 2) "Vsim" the corresponding simulator, 3) A companion schematic editor
written for X11, 4) A companion netlist-to- schematic tool written for X11, 5)
"VF2VHDL" a reverse translator from netlists to VHDL. Tasks include: 1) Generate
documentation for the compiler and simulator with tutorials, examples, and
classroom aides; 2) Enhance the simulator to provide a graphical waveform
display package based on IRSIM/Analyzer from Stanford; 3) Convert the old
schematic tool from sunview to X11; 4) Clean up for distribution the netlist to
schematic tool for X11; 5) Update the netlist to VHDL tool. Technical support
via email will be provided. This grant is made under the Software Capitalization
Program.
