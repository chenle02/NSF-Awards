This project will collect and analyze original survey data on criminal
victimization in the city of Tianjin, China. The general objectives are to
examine the social patterning of criminal victimization in contemporary urban
China and to assess the applicability of Western criminological theories in the
distinctive context of a nation undergoing profound economic and social change.
Drawing upon routine activities theory, hypotheses about the relationships
between status characteristics, life styles, and individual victimization risk
are developed and tested. "Neo-social disorganization" theory informs the
formulation of hypotheses about the effects of neighborhood characteristics on
neighborhood levels of victimization. The survey is based on a multi-stage
cluster design, yielding a total sample of 2,500 households nested within a
sample of 50 neighborhoods. These data permit hierarchical multi-level modeling
to assess the hypotheses about individual risks and neighborhood levels of
victimization.
