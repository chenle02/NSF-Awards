An experimental determination will be made of the velocity and concentration
fields of buoyant plumes in an ambient turbulent cross-flow, and of mixing
across the stable density interface of an advancing saline wedge. Velocities
will be measured with LDV diagnostics using fluids with density differences but
matched index of refraction. Both configurations are of key importance in
turbulent transport in the atmosphere and marine environment. The results of the
research will find application both in computer codes for design and analysis,
and in turbulence modeling validation.
