In order to determine the existing conditions, strength and safety of
structures, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques are required for field
examinations. There are many types of NDE equipment available with varying
precision, convenience of use, limitations in application, and economy of use.
The objective of this project is to conduct a combined conference and workshop
in order to assimilate existing information on the current uses of
nondestructive evaluation and to project plans for subsequent research
activities. Researcher is qualified to perform this project. Project is
recommended for an award. This is a one time award.
