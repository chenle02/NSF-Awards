Abstract CTS-9500381 Chehroudi This proposal is for funds to purchase an Engine
Emission Analyzer from Rosemount Analytical Inc. The equipment will be used for
several research programs for example one is aimed at the reduction of NOx and
other emissions without the fuel penalty and a second is concerned with the use
of "Natural Gas" as a fuel in two-stroke engines. In addition the requested
instrumentation will be useful in several courses in applied combustion and
internal combustion engines.
