This award supports basic research on mathematical topics at the foundation of
nonequilibrium physics. Theoretical aspects of nonlinear and stochastic
dynamical systems will be studied using predominantly analytic techniques and
also numerical simulations. The work will focus on the effect of fluctuations on
non-linear wave propagation in diffuse- reaction systems and on turbulent
dynamics in continuum models represented by the Navier-Stokes and complex
Ginzburg-Landau equations.
