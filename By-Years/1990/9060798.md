A research and development program is proposed that would produce an instrument
capable of providing real time measurements of both NO and soot concentrations
in internal combustion engine exhaust. This instrument would be capable of
monitoring transients in emission with a resolution approximately equivalent to
one engine cycle. The necessity for this instrument is clear: federal and
international air quality standards are becoming stringent enough to mandate a
significant increase of emission production as a function of the specifics of
engine operation. Information derived from the proposed measurement system would
allow engine manufacturers to critically assess their engines performance over
their engine operating envelope. The key to the technical approach is to measure
concentrations of both NO and soot with absorption/extinction diagnostics in the
infrared and package the instrument in a fashion that facilitates its
application to engine test stands. This research is of direct interest to the
internal combustion engine manufacturing community. The outgrowth of the
proposed effort would be an instrument capable of monitoring transient emission
behavior in engines.
