9415797 Messina This award supports the infrastructure for the Scalable I/O
national project. This national project will investigate many of the issues
surrounding the scalability of Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) System input
and output systems. The national project consists of 18 application groups
involving more than 30 researchers. The equipment provided by this award
consists of I/O nodes for an MPP and a small MPP for crashable experimentation.
The infrastructure will be available to all of the application groups for their
experimental research needs.
