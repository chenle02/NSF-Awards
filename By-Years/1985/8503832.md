This project will investigate the two-dimensional electron systems in quantum
regimes. This experimental and theoretical research will include a study of
possible phase transitions at lower temperatures than previously used. The range
of electron densities and interaction strengths between the electrons will be in
a regime not accessible in current semiconductor systems or with previous metal-
liquid helium-vacuum surfaces. Fundamental questions of the crystallization of
the electron fluid and the conditions of the melting process will be determined.
