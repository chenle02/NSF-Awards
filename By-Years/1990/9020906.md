This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Design for Recognizability in
Flexible Manufacturing" at Tuskegee University in support of Georgia Institute
of Technology's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Material
Handling. This two year project is approved by and reporting to the Center's
Industry Advisory Board. The research is 1.) developing the guidelines for
designing or modifying a part to comply with a proposed new method for easy and
reliable recognition of an isolated object on a flat surface, by a robot fitted
with a retroreflective vision sensor; 2.) designing and modifying specific
components, suggested by the interested member companies of the Material
Handling Research Center of Georgia Tech, using above guidelines; 3.) conducting
experiments in part recognition and handling using an IBM robot, IBM AT, and
Georgia Tech's Landmark Tracking Camera with retroreflective vision sensing; and
4.) developing preliminary metrics to compare alternate designs of a part on the
basis of recognizability and cycle time for handling by going through the
iterative procedure of guidelines, design, test and metrics. The researcher is
competent and has the facilities available to perform the research. The Program
Manager recommends Tuskegee University be awarded $100,000 for two (2) years.
