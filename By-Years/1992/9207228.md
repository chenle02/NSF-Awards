This research examines the effects of prey immigration/emigration rates and prey
density on stream predators using both theoretical and experimental approaches.
Observational work will describe the sizes, differences, and overlap in patches
of predators, trout, stoneflies, and prey (aquatic insects). the research will
indicate how results of small-scale experiments can be applied to larger
systems, with implications for testing and analyzing the impacts of populations
or introduced species on natural systems. By examing resources- consumer
interactions, and the effects of arena size and immigration on the persistence
of natural populations, the research relates to problems in conservation biology
and resources management (e.g. fishery management, conservation of species).
Knowing the effects of top predators (trout) on invertebrate prey and, in turn,
on the prey's food (algae) will indicate the effectiveness of manipulating top
predators to control algal blooms in streams.
