Our closest living relatives, the apes, reveal remarkable cognitive and social
abilities in the wild, but it is unclear whether they show correspondingly
advanced vocal skills. To resolve this issue, this proposal is the first
comparative field study of great ape vocal communication. Field observations and
experiments will be used to investigate the ontogeny, semantics and function of
ape calls. The research promises to clarify the similarities and differences
between human and animal vocal communication and to contribute to our
understanding of the evolution of speech.
