9634140 Stein This collaborative project between researchers at Lamont-Doherty
Earth Observatory of Columbia University in the City of New York and the
University of Illinois at Chicago will prepare and produce a synthesis on CD-ROM
of geothermal data collected over ten years of the Ocean Drilling Program. The
investigators will evaluate the quality of all measurements of downhole
temperature and thermal conductivity of the sediments and rock. They will
prepare a report on the quality of the data, a discussion to place them in
global context, and a bibliography. The completed CD-ROM will be provided to the
Ocean Drilling Program and the National Geophysical Data Center for distribution
to interested researchers, as well as to the International Heat Flow Commission
for inclusion in their worldwide database. ***
