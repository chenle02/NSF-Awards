New light has been shed on sabkah (evaporite) processes by chemical and
hydrologic analyses. The principal Investigator completed geochemical studies
and measurement of direction and rates of movement of saline groundwaters and
surface waters for several sabkahs in the region. She plans to extend and test
observations in two coastal evaporitic basins known to have gypsum- anhydrite-
halite deposits. The goal of this project is the development of criteria for
recognizing sabkah deposits in the geologic record, setting the groundwork for
future research in developing accurate focus models of sabkahs and related
depositional environments.
