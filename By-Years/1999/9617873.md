Distortion of Information During Decisions Upon having made a choice between
alternatives, individuals provided with additional information on the options
are more likely to judge it as favoring (disfavoring) the option they selected
more (less) than individuals who have not made a choice yet. This tendency to
interpret information in a manner consistent with ones choices and decisions is
often attributed to individuals' desire to minimize cognitive dissonance. In
recent experiments conducted by the PI and co-authors, they find that this same
type of distortion occurs even before an alternative has been selected. In
essence, the fact that an alternative is judged preferable on the basis of an
initial piece of information about the various alternatives (e.g., x is less
expensive than y) biases the interpretation of additional information on the
alternatives in favor of that option. To the extent that a choice has not been
made yet or is not requested, this bias in the interpretation of information
cannot be attributed to a desire to minimize cognitive dissonance. The PI
outlines a series of experiments to further probe the nature of this bias in
information evaluation, attempt to identify its underlying cause or causes,
evaluate its prevalence in natural decision making environments and explore
possible means of ameliorating the tendency. _???/?` ????%/¥??>¢
