CCR-0234603&lt;br/&gt;Whitehead, Emmet James&lt;br/&gt;Univ. of Calif. - Santa
Cruz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software today is tightly woven into the daily fabric
of business, government, and homes. This software is maintained for many years
to accommodate changing operational environments and to add new capabilities. An
increasing body of evidence shows that the structure of software decays over
time, leading to a cluster of related problems: changes take longer to implement
since they touch more files, modular boundaries soften, and large recent changes
are a good predictor of software faults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims
to improve the effectiveness of perfective software maintenance techniques by
developing a novel tool called IVA (Instability Visualization and Analysis) that
allows the rapid identification and ranking of unstable code regions, so they
can be redesigned first. The concept of an instability region is introduced as a
set of dependent software fragments that have been frequently modified together,
and the project uses analysis and visualization techniques to show the locations
and relative severity of these instabilities utilizing Instability
Identification, Analysis, and Visualization. It is expected that this approach
will dramatically reduce the time required to identify and prioritize
instability regions. The project takes full advantage of the NASA testbed to
perform activities related to validating the correctness, usability,
scalability, and performance of the IVA system. Furthermore, the project will
validate that IVA would have provided much earlier identification of code
regions that were ultimately refactored. In addition, IVA will be incorporated
in undergraduate and graduate teaching and research.&lt;br/&gt;
