The proposal will fund a four-day interdisciplinary workshop on "The Great
Plains: An Environmental History." The University of Oklahoma will host the
workshop in May 2017. This interdisciplinary workshop will explore the
environmental history of the North American Great Plains from western Texas to
southern Canada. This workshop will enhance interdisciplinary dialogue in
environmental studies. It will expand academic knowledge of the Great Plains.
The workshop will be free and open to the public. It will be podcast and tweeted
live. The published book will inform contemporary policy debates on the
environment. It will explain why certain technologies succeed and others fail in
regards to human habitation and resource management. It will provide an
opportunity to members of the public to consider the Great Plains as a complex
ecosystem that includes human interactions from a historical
perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary workshop will offer a
scholars the opportunity to re-conceptualize the Great Plains from the
perspective of technological adaptations rather than only ecological disasters.
By exploring the elemental and persistent themes of water, grasses, animals, and
energy, the workshop will discuss the complex ways in which shifting
technologies sustained human life, advanced diverse societies, and altered human
relations with the region's myriad ecologies. The workshop will integrate the
perspectives and research methodologies of different fields to forge an analysis
of the Great Plains at the intersection of environment, culture, and technology.
The workshop will involve scholars from environmental history, energy history,
anthropology, geography, sociology, Native American studies, and environmental
science, policy and management.
