Dr. Baldwin will continue his investigation of the stabilization forces of
short helical peptides. He has previously shown that short peptides are able to
form monomeric -helices in aqueous solution. Helical stability depended strongly
on residue spacing in this set of peptides and therefore helix stabilization by
salt bridges was likely. He will now extend this study to include other pairs of
charged residues potentially able to form salt bridges in order to evaluate the
helix-stabilizing properties of these salt bridges, if they exist, and to
investigate further the mechanism of -helix stabilization by salt bridges and
non-H- bonded ion pairs. Salt bridges formed by short helices of de novo design
are being studied by only a few scientists. The study of designed helices is
closely related to the study of -helix formation by naturally occurring peptides
derived from helix- containing segments of peoteins. The broad significance of
this work is that short helices, formed at early stages in the folding process,
have the ability to play a directing role in the pathway of protein
folding.***//
