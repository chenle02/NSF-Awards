The focus of this mathematical research is on affine varieties in the space of
several complex variables. Varieties are the locus of points where analytic
functions vanish; they have many similarities with surfaces. The object of the
work concerns the Lojasiewicz inequality for complex polynomials. The inequality
relates the distance of any complex variable (n- dimensional) from the zero
locus of an analytic function to the value of the function. In its sharper form,
one wants to know the highest power of the distance function which can be
compared with the function value, and, instead of a single function, the zero
set belongs to that of a finitely generated ideal. If the generators are
polynomials, then a recent result gives a power in terms of the product of the
polynomial degrees. A better exponent is conjectured depending on whether the
number of polynomials exceeds the dimension of the underlying space or not. Work
will be done to establish the conjecture. A second line of investigation relates
to the development of a Nevanlinna theory in several variables. That is, the
study of value distribution theory or the measure of the affinity of complex
meromorphic functions for complex numbers. The specific objects of study are
maps from one complex domain to another. The components of the maps are
polynomials. This work will continue recent investigations into the Jacobian
conjecture to the effect that if the Jacobian of such a map is unity, then the
map is an automorphism. While this conjecture may not be settled for some time,
accomplishments of the past year suggest that substantial insights may be gained
with further research using Nevanlinna-type arguments.
