This award will provide one-half of the funds required to acquire equipment for
an automated optical microscopy laboratory for the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University. The University is committed
to providing the other half of the funds required. The optical system will fill
the need of an active research group at Johns Hopkins in a variety of research
projects in the fields of metamorphic petrology, igneous petrology and
structural geology.
