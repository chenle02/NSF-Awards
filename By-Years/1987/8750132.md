The Geographic Information Systems Laboratory at Central Washington University
provides computer hardware and software support for geographic information
systems applications, allowing users to store, retrieve, display, manipulate and
analyze maps and other spatial data. A state-of-the-art tool for data processing
in the earth sciences and in resources management fields, the GIS Lab heretofore
has been used primarily as a research facility; equipment needed for purposes of
undergraduate instruction has been lacking. The University will buy a Masscomp
computer system, 3 color and 6 monochrome terminals, software, and
communications hardware. By providing necessary equipment, the project will
enable the University to realize the GIS Lab's great potential as an
undergraduate teaching facility, and thereby respond to growing student interest
reflecting the rapid expansion of GIS application in academic research,
government, and industry.
