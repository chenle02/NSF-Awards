This project provides three years of partial core support of the Board on
Mathematical Sciences (BMS) and full core support of its Committee on Applied
and Theoretical Statistics (CATS), both groups being committees of the National
Research Council. The BMS is the only prominent group in the United States
wherein representatives from all the mathematical sciences---core mathematics,
statistics, applied mathematics, operations research, and scientific computing
---regularly meet to discuss ways to ensure and improve the intellectual vigor
of the field. CATS is perhaps the premier assemblage of statistical researchers
in the country, and it is similarly concerned with the intellectual vigor of its
field. Both the BMS and CATS actively promote that vigor by organizing workshops
and studies that focus attention on research opportunities that are ripe for
exploration and, often, help to build links between the mathematical sciences
and other fields of science, engineering, and medicine. To a lesser extent, they
occasionally study policy issues that directly affect the health of the
mathematical sciences. The requested core funding provides for two meetings each
year of both CATS and BMS, an annual Department Chairs Colloquium, initiation of
all projects, continuous oversight of all activities, and continuing cognizance
of issues that need the attention of BMS and/or CATS.
