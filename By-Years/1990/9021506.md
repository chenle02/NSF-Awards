Trinity University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line through the THENET mid-level network. Examples of enhancement of
Trinity>s research programs include: direct control of observing programs at
remote telescopes for radio astronomy, rapid access to digital data for
earthquake seismology, access to climate modeling programs on the Cray Y-MP at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research for solar energy, and exchange of
software with the National Institutes of Health for cell imaging research. This
award provides partial support for installation of the connection and the first
year of operation.***//
