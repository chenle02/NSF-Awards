This project studies Internet censorship using novel measurement techniques,
ranging from low-level packet filtering on Internet Protocol (IP) networks to
high-level censorship of social media content. Collectively these techniques can
provide greater situational awareness of censorship dynamics. The project
focuses on a suite of advanced inference techniques for when ?direct
observation? is unavailable or impractical such as, for example, methods for
detecting IP tunnels based on per-hop Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) inference
techniques in order to reason about the physical characteristics of a given IP
network and, for example, measurement on social media postings of redactions and
the speed of redactions. This research has broad implications on studies of
methods to provide awareness of restrictive control of information and content
on networks, which would be of interest to software developers, system
administrators, and policy makers alike.
