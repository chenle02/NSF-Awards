Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0100579&lt;br/&gt;L. Archer, Cornell
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to explore the effect
of entanglement density on polymer dynamics in terms of damping function, time-
strain factorability, and orientation angle. The investigation will include
experiments to identify nonlinear rheological characteristics of entangled
polymer systems in shear and extensional flows. Furthermore, experiments will be
designed to examine aspects of specific molecular scale phenomenon in the
nonlinear polymer flow behavior. Based on the information obtained, molecular-
based constitutive equations will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;
