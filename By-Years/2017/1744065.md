This EAGER award provides pilot funding for a new kind of software repository
that could help data scientists create better ways to combine existing data
sets. The goal is to encourage collaboration between scientists who consider
data methodology, users and builders of integrated data sets, and data
custodians. The result may be new high-quality methods for record linkages and
better use of existing data. Common, transparent, and reproducible approaches to
linkage methodology and privacy preservation will help data analysts meet the
highest scientific standards. The project may decrease the gap between research
and practice in data science, resulting in better evidence for U.S.
policymakers, businesses, and citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will
establish a common benchmarking repository of linkage methodologies, Data Link
Repository (DLRep) at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social
Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan. Participants in the repository
will be able to add comments and ask questions, allowing for engagement between
data custodians, providers, producers, holders and data users, as well as
between various groups of data users. In addition data users will be able to
upload and share code snippets related to the data, allowing for knowledge
sharing and better reproducibility. Data users will be able to link related
publications and citations via DOI import or by manually entering citation
information. This will provide feedback to data providers and other data users
about how the data have been used. The repository will accelerate the
development of new record linkage algorithms and evaluation methods by providing
access to both methods and relevant data. This community effort will improved
the reproducibility of analysis conducted on integrated data. The repository
will facilitate comparisons of alternative linkage methodologies when using the
same and different data, and move forward the provision of privacy-aware
integrated data.
