In animals, normal limb movements such as walking or reaching require sensory
information from the limb regarding their movements and mechanics. While fishes
use their limbs (or paired fins) for a diverse array of behaviors, little is
known about the role sensory abilities plays in those functions. This project
examines the fundamental question of how the sensory and motor elements of the
fin propulsive system co-adapt to generate a functional neuromechanical system.
In particular, it will determine how physical properties of the fins such as
stiffness, size and shape, are reflected in the biological instrumentation of
the fins for sensation. In addition to providing a new tractable model for
studying integration of sensation and movement, data from this project will
inform the design of fin-inspired propulsive devices for underwater vehicles.
The broader impacts of this project will provide outreach experiences for
children on the South Side of Chicago as well as opportunities for undergraduate
and graduate training in the laboratory and builds educational activities at the
Field Museum of Natural History.
