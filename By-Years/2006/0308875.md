The PI will spend a year in Departments of Radiology and Genetics at Case
Western Reserve University. During this period, the PI will attend some courses,
seminars and spend some time with research groups from MRI, nuclear medicine
(PET), anticancer drugs and genetics. She will conduct related research, develop
new research projects and collaborations of interest to her. In particular, they
will develop new image reconstruction and segmentation tools that take an
advantage of the state-of-the-art simultaneous PET and MRI imaging, and new
techniques that are helpful for finding disease genes from large data. The PI
will also attend professional conferences, and make short visits to national
centers, and other top departments with international and national reputation.

The new research is interdisciplinary among medicine, imaging, genetics and
statistics. The advances in these areas will impact our knowledge of science.
The PI will continue supervising her Ph.D. students and enrich their educational
experiences in bioinformatics and imaging. The new computational tools will be
made available via webpages and integrated to her modern data analysis classes
and statistical computing class after the grant period.

This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
