Meharry Medical college proposes the continuation of its Research Centers of
Excellence in Cell and Molecular Biology. The overall goal of the Center is to
continue a strong research effort in membrane biology as a vehicle through
minority junior high, high school, and college students can develop strong
interest in a science career. In addition the center will continue to develop
strategies to strengthen partnerships with industry and academic. Research
results have shown an explosion of knowledge which elucidates the molecular
mechanisms and structures that are responsible for complex processes such as
cell growth and division, metabolism, differentiations, and development. More
significantly, the new methods that have developed concurrently with this
knowledge provide a way to manipulate molecules and observe biochemical changes
in living systems. The project meets the major goal of the Minority Research
Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program: to increase the minority presence in
science and engineering by making substantial resources available to upgrade the
research capabilities of strong and productive minority institutions. This
project will allow the institution to continue to use research as a tool to
increase the effectiveness of related science and engineering activities for
minority group in its region. In addition, the project will provide
opportunities for minority faculty and students at Meharry and nearby
institutions to engage in meritorious research that leads to publications in
refereed journals.
