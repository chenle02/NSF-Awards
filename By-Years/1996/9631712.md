Alberto J. Trejos Northwestern University SBR-9631712 This research will
undertake three monetary search theory related projects. The first project will
examine the purchasing power of money and the determination of exchange rates
for countries whose currency circulates abroad. The second project will study
the strategic interaction between a group of central banks, where each has to
decide a monetary policy. The decisions of the central banks are linked by the
common realm of circulation of their currencies. The third project will
undertake exploratory research on a computable search model with divisible
money.
