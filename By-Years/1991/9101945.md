This applicant proposes to study the impact of race and poverty on access to
needed medical care. More specifically, the study will integrate dissatisfaction
with medical care, structural barriers to medical care, and social roles into a
consolidated research approach to explain race and poverty status differences in
access to needed medical care. The work will be carried out in conjunction with
Dr. William Rakowski at Brown University.
