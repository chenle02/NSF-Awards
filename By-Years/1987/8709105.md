This award is to support US participation in a joint workshop for scientists
from the US and Taiwan to explore recent advances in computational fluid
dynamics. The workshop is to be held September 1987 in Princeton, NJ. This
workshop will be held under the auspices of the cooperative science program
between the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Coordination Council for
North American Affairs (CCNAA). Computational fluid dynamics is a field which
has demonstrated rapid growth as computational efficiency and improvements in
computer hardware and computer science have opened up new areas of research. To
share developments from a variety of disciplines and to understand the advances
being made in Taiwan in this and related fields, US scientists from a wide
variety of backgrounds will meet with their colleagues from Taiwan to discuss
recent advances and to explore opportunities for cooperative research.
