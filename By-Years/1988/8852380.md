The instruction in general chemistry is being improved by using technology which
permits interaction by the students. An integrated system consisting of two
computers connected to laser disc players with special touch sensitive monitors
have been added to the chemistry instructional program. The technology is
providing remedial instruction for the marginal students, supplemental
instruction for the better students, and laboratory simulations for all of the
students. As a result, students are having experiences that were not previously
possible because of the potential danger they present. The grantee is matching
the award from non-Federal sources.
