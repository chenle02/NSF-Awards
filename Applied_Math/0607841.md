This award furnishes travel support for participants in the Conference on
General Relativity and Shock Wave Theory, held April 29 to May 1, 2006 at
Stanford University. The primary theme of the conference is research in
mathematical general relativity at the interface between differential geometry
and fluid mechanics. Significant funding is allocated to support participation
of students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty.

This meeting provides an opportunity for interaction among leading experts and
junior researchers working at the interface between important related areas of
mathematics. The conference will provide a valuable opportunity for postdocs and
students to broaden their understanding and to learn about open problems in
these areas.
