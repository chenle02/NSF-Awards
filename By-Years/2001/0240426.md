Ernie Davidson of Indiana University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop new quantum chemical techniques for
understanding chemical concepts applicable to entire classes of reactions.
Specifically, density functional theory (DFT) will be reformulated for
intermediate spin states, and applied to small magnetic manganese clusters. DFT,
Green's function methods, and conventional quantum chemical methods will all be
used to investigate photoelectron processes in hydrocarbons and small inorganic
anions. Insight is expected to be gained for both spectral assignments and the
possible breakdown of orbital interpretations. Other applications include
inorganic reaction mechanisms involving ruthenium complexes, and the
photofragmentation of small peptides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational quantum
chemistry is very proficient at describing the properties of stable species, but
is less accurate for reacting molecules. Part of this research aims to develop
methods that are designed to follow chemical reactions and predict their
outcomes. This will have implications in catalysis, laser ablation in computer
chip manufacture, and peptide sequencing by mass spectral methods. Another part
of this research focuses on improved theoretical descriptions of magnetic
materials such as molecular magnets.&lt;br/&gt;
