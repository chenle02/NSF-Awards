Main Campus Dr. K. B. Schowen and other members of the Chemistry Department at
the University of Kansas are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn broadly from the traditional areas of chemistry
and biochemistry. Projects are designed to allow both direct experience with
current experimental methods, as well as rewarding progress on interesting and
significant problems. Participants are recruited from the region.
