*** 9732533 Shleser This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project focuses on genetic improvement of the Black Tiger shrimp, Penaeus
monodon. This species represents 75% of world production of farmed shrimp valued
at more than 3 billion dollars annually. The overall objective is selective
breeding of this shrimp for performance in a farming environment. Specific
pathogen free stocks will be genetically identified for selective breeding. The
ability to identify members of full-sibling families to establish and maintain
pedigree records over several generations is essential to a selective breeding
program. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of introns in conserved
nuclear genes will be used to identify alleles that can be used to manage the
breeding program. Phase II will identify specific pathogen free stocks; identify
alleles that can be used to direct the selection process; develop cost effective
methods to monitor populations; and develop additional markers to monitor
heterogeneity and reduce inbreeding. Commercial application is expected in
genetically improved broodstock for export and post larvae producion in Hawaii
to shrimp producers worldwide. ***
