Tuchman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: Elevated Atmospheric CO2
Alters Plant Detritus Nutritional Quality: Effects on Microbial and Detritivore
Food Webs in Aquatic Ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elevated atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO2) resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels, directly
affects the photosynthesis rate, growth, and chemical make-up of tree foliage.
The investigators have demonstrated that when aspen trees are grown under
elevated CO2 levels, their leaves contain less nitrogen and higher
concentrations of plant defense compounds (phenolic compounds, lignins and
tannins), which renders them less nutritious to their animal and microorganism
consumers. Since small headwater streams in forested landscapes rely heavily on
tree leaf litter to fuel their food webs, parallel field and laboratory studies
will measure the effect that the CO2-induced change in food quality of aspen
leaf litter will have on the growth and reproduction of stream bacteria, fungi,
and invertebrate consumers. The difference in microbial and invertebrate growth
rates in turn could affect food web structure and functions and carbon dynamics
in aquatic ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
