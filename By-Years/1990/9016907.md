Theoretical research will be conducted on quantum spin glasses, the finite
connectivity spin glass and on self-organizing critical phenomena. For quantum
spin glasses investigations will be made of the quantum Heisenberg spin glass in
a field, the Potts spin glass in a transverse field and the quantum spin glass
on finite connectivity lattices. For the finite connectivity spin glass we will
look at static and dynamic properties, patterns of replica symmetry breaking and
their stability, behavior of correlation functions and fluctuations, as a step
toward understanding the short range model. We will include small loops as a
means to go beyond the Bethe approximation toward behavior on a Bravais lattice.
We will also look at field theoretical models corresponding to non-equilibrium
stationary states displaying self- organized criticality for which cellular
automata exist and at dynamical behavior of systems driven by an external field
near their critical point.
