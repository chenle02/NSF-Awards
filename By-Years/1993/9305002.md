9305002 Biltonen A study of the activation of the phospholipase A2 from
Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus will be undertaken utilizing site directed
mutagenesis and a variety of biophysical techniques. It is hypothesized that
dimerization is required for full activation of the interfacial enzyme.
Multidimensional NMR, calorimetry, thermal denaturation, and fluorescence
kinetic studies will be involved. %%% Major controversy surrounds the mechanism
of interfacial catalysis by phospholipase A2s. These enzymes are involved in a
wide variety of physiological responses. The studies planned here will test the
hypothesis that the enzyme functions as a homodimer. DIrect physical
characterization of the physical state of the enzyme will be used to answer this
question. ***
