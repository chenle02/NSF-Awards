Processes resulting in the formation of organic aerosols in the natural and
polluted ambient atmosphere are important yet relatively difficult to
characterize and remain poorly understood. Under the Major Research
Instrumentation Program an interdisciplinary group of Science and Engineering
faculty will acquire two research grade instruments: a Proton Transfer Mass
Spectrometer and an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer and use these in collaborative
projects addressing research issues of high importance to atmospheric chemistry
and air quality. Particular emphasis will be placed on laboratory and field
studies characterizing the chemical production, growth, transformation and fate
of ambient atmospheric gas-phase organic compounds and fine particulate
aerosols. This research has broad implications for climate, human health and
public policy. Additional broader impacts of the project include advancements in
instrument technology and application and cutting-edge research opportunities
for graduate and undergraduate students under the direction of the project
investigators.
