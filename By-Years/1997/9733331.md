Time varying environments and limited battery energy are two key hurdles on the
route to distributed multimedia systems with wireless network links. This
project is exploring architectures, protocols, and algorithms to overcome these
hurdles for mobile users. In particular, the research is exploring the use
reconfigurability in wireless nodes to allow algorithms and protocols to adapt
to evolving environments. The reconfigurable wireless node leads to interesting
system-level concepts such as hardware applets, in which hardware datapaths can
be downloaded and instantiated on demand from network servers. The educational
component of the project is based on tightly integrating the proposed research
with new graduate and undergraduate courses. The research topics will be
explored in project-oriented graduate courses on mobile multimedia information
systems and wireless terminal design. Selected prototyping tasks will be used as
projects in undergraduate design courses.
