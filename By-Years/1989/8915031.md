The study will examine radiolarian lineages and their speciations in high and
low latitudes to answer the following questions: 1) Where and when did each
speciation take place? 2) If branchings have occurred in both regions, is the
evolutionary pattern of speciations and anagenetic change the same? Are the
rates different in high and low latitudes? 3) How can evolutionary appearance
best be differentiated from migrational appearance of species in different
latitudes? How can this be reflected in a taxonomic framework? Integration of
existing biostratigraphies and taxonomies in the different regions will be a
byproduct of answering the above questions. The study will provide fundamental
insights into the nature of evolutionary processes in marine plankton.
