The goal of this research is to elucidate the structure- function relationships
involved in the interaction between the pituitary hormone prolactin and its
cellular receptor. Escherichia coli cells have been engineered to synthesize
bovine methionyl-protactin. The bacterially-produced hormone is fully active in
the Nb2 cell bioassay for lactogenic hormones. Comparison of the published amino
acid sequences of ten lactogenic hormones aligned so as to maximize homology
reveals that there are approximately 30 sites at which the same amino acid is
conserved. Bovine growth hormone, which is not a lactogenic hormone, and is
inactive in the Nb2 cell bioassay, has a different amino acid present at only
six of these sites. In this study site directed mutagenesis techniques will be
used to introduce specific amino acid changes at these six positions. Mutant
hormones will be isolated, and their bioactivities analyzed. Prolactin is an
important hormone excreted by the anterior pituitary gland. It regulates growth
and development of the mammary gland and is essential for the production of
milk. The results of this research will provide useful information on how
prolactin functions at the molecular level.
