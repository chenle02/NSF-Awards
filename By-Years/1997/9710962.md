Villa Maria College will use this grant to connect its Buffalo, NY campus to the
Internet using NYSERNET, a New York based ISP. Villa Maria College is a two-year
college with a wide range of programs. The college needs the Internet connection
to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and
the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this
institution as well as the community in general. The award provides partial
support of the project for two years.
