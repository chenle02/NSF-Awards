Howard University requests support for an HBCU-UP Broadening Participation
Research in STEM education project entitled Minority Status and Stereotypes: The
Benefits and Consequences as they relate to STEM Participation and Success at an
HBCU. The proposed project will employ a mixed-methods research design to
examine within-group ethnic differences between domestic and international black
STEM undergraduates relative to academic achievement. It will investigate
factors that impact the academic experiences of these students. Specifically,
the study will apply cultural ecology theory and identity theory to understand
within-group distinctions; explore minority status, stereotypes, and stereotyped
expectations, and academic and ethnic identity among black STEM students; and
examine students familiarity with experiences characterized by the model
minority stereotype in conjunction with their participation and success in STEM.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research can potentially advance the
knowledge about how to better prepare faculty to teach in multi-cultural
environments. The results can be used also to mitigate stereotyping of both
domestic and international black students and has implications for multiple
disciplines.
