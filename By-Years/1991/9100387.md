Professor Edith J. Parsons and other members of the Chemistry Department at
Clemson University are being supported to start a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, ten
undergradaute students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Some of the projects involve use of microwave
energy to effect chemical reactions, synthesis of organocopper and
organophosphorous compounds, analysis by atomic spectroscopy, and
characterization of metal oxides formed using sol-gel procedures. Faculty-
student interactions will be fostered through activities such as informal
luncheon presentations, departmental seminars, and optional minicourses.
Students will present the results of their research at a closing symposium.
