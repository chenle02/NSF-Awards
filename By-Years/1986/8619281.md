This research investigates the limits of transaction system performance on
computer systems with a high degree of parallelism. The performance of a
database management system is dominated by its recovery component. The proposed
work will address methods of minimizing the time taken by the recovery component
of a database management system. The methods to be investigated are of two
types: one type is the use of "non-blocking" methods of guaranteeing
recoverability. The other type uses knowledge of transaction semantics,
including the implementation of concurrency control and recovery separately for
different levels of abstraction. The importance of this work is that many
industries such as banks, financial markets, and reservation systems are making
heavy use of large-scale shared databases. The databases that make this possible
must be updated quickly and correctly, even when many customers are accessing
the same data. Also, the shared databases must function reliably, even when some
of the computer components fail. The research conducted here will lead to
reducing the time required to reliably process a request, below the time
required by present day state-of-the-art systems.
