This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of producing a novel, needleless drug injection system for
widespread vaccination applications. The key element in the technology will be a
novel high pressure pumping device. This device will enable high pressure flows
to be precisely and easily controlled by the user in order to control injection
drug amount. This is a capability currently lacking in existing low cost
needleless injector technology. The Phase I project will show that the high
pressure pumping device actually works. The follow on Phase II effort will focus
on building a prototype system that will integrate the pump with the control
electronics and injection nozzle for subsequent testing.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of drug delivery. The
proposed needleless injection device is expected to be reused thousands of times
with a single low voltage battery source and will be invaluable for widespread
vaccination use in the field for domestic as well as foreign markets. The unique
ability to precisely meter injection volume will enable the device to be easily
adjusted in the field to deliver a dosage appropriate for the associated weight,
age, or physical condition of the patient.
