This action will provide continued support for an active group of two senior
investigators and students for experiments on the scattering of high energy
muons from nuclei. The data is collected at Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator.
Fermilab experiment E665, "Deep Inelastic Muon Scattering with Hadron Detection"
was first exposed to the muon beam in the summer of 1985. In March of 1990 the
experiment was prepared to begin its final run. To date, scattering studies have
been completed with heavy nuclear targets. By January 1992, the scattering data
from hydrogen and deuterium should be complete and the final analysis begun.
These experiments probe the structure of nuclear matter and the formation
processes for strongly interacting particles. It is closely related to the
scattering of neutrinos by nuclear matter and electron proton collisions, also
supported by the National Science Foundation. In the out years of the grant
period, other activities will be started including instrumentation development
for the Superconducting Super Collider.
