This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will help the Department of Chemistry at Montana State University upgrade its
x-ray diffraction laboratory. Major projects supported by acquisition of this
equipment will include: Organic Synthesis; Organometallic Transformations of
Organic Systems; Preferred Structures of Non-Rigid Molecules; Rare Earth Doped
Crystals for Laser Materials; Characterizations of Bioactive Metabolites from
Plant Microbes; Polynues; Polynuclear Bridged Mixed Valence Platinum Compounds.
Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the
knowledge of the molecular composition and structure helps to develop new
reactions of potentially general intereral interest in catalysis or synthesis.
