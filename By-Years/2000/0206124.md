The Francis College of Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell,
will provide 126 middle school students with a series of challenging learning
opportunities at an after school "DESIGNCAMP" program. The students,
particularly females, will be recruited from Lowell and Lawrence communities
with large Hispanic and Southeast Asian populations. Three "DESIGNCAMP" modules
will be used during the summer term and the following two trimesters at an after
school program where students participate for two hours once a week. The three
"DESIGNCAMP" modules are Electrical and Mechanical Gizmos, Flight School, and
Building a Better Contraption. The activities in these modules will immerse the
students in inquiry, design-based, and hands-on problem-solving environments.
The Francis College of Engineering offers the facilities for instruction and the
access and use of engineering tools, equipment and technology as integral to the
learning experience. Parents will be organized into a Parents' Council to
provide continued support of students at home and to serve as an advisory body
to the project. The project will utilize the existing partnership among U Mass
Lowell College of Engineering, school districts, and business and industries.
The results of this three-year project will be disseminated nationally through
publications of youth and community-based organizations and presentations at
science and engineering education conferences.
