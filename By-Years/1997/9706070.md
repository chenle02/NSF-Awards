The objective of this research is to help engineers build confidence in the
correctness of their specifications of reactive systems (such as those that
appear in airplanes, automobiles, power plants, etc.). Our specific approach
applies model checking---a technique that has proven to be extremely successful
in the hardware domain---to the specification of systems that include
significant amounts of software. A defining characteristic of the research is
the use of hierarchical finite state specifications of real systems, including
the specification of TCAS-II, an airborne collision avoidance system. The case
studies establish the range of properties that can be evaluated using model
checking, showing how model checking can be used in an iterative process to
design or analyze specifications. The research defines tools (including
translators from specifications to model checkers, analysis tools for
interpreting counterexamples, and tools to support iterative development), as
well as model checking algorithms that increase the size of the state space
which is feasible to check and that extend the capabilities of model checkers
for handling arithmetic operations. Improving the ability to define
specifications in which there is increased confidence will improve the quality
of and reduce the cost of building specifications of reactive systems that
include software.
