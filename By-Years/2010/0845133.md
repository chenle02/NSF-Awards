This project provides continuing support to enable extension of previously
funded investigation of the interaction of fast flowing plasma with non-
magnetized solar system bodies. In the previous project, comprehensive numerical
schemes that had been developed for terrestrial space weather applications were
modified to be used for a variety of solar system applications. A significant
fraction of the effort centered on the development, in a systematic fashion, of
the "best possible" magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models to describe these
interactions and ionospheric phenomena at Titan and Mars. The result is a high
spatial resolution, multi-species, spherical, Hall, magnetohydrodynamic model
that can calculate the solar wind interaction processes, escape fluxes, and
associated ionospheric phenomena. The spherical model has a grid resolution of
about 10 km and 35 km in the ionospheric regions of Mars and Titan,
respectively, providing very good simulations of the measured densities. This
project will expand the effort to include other solar system bodies in order to
undertake comparative studies; of particular interest are Io, Europa, Callisto,
and Enceladus. The MHD code will be modified to be multi-fluid by solving
separate momentum and energy equations for the different species. The codes will
be applied to investigations of the many similarities and the important
differences in the chemical and physical processes associated with the different
solar system bodies. The numerical schemes to be used originated in the field of
computational fluid dynamics and will likely find applications outside the field
of planetary and comparative aeronomy, such as global climate change modeling.
The basic MHD code that is being continually improved will be useful in current
space weather efforts. The project will provide partial support for a female
graduate student.
