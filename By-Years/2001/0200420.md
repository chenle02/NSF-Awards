The PI will continue her investigations on the decompositions of ideals and how
different operations on the ideals interact with the decompositions. The
particular operations in the proposal are integral closure, tight closure,
adjoints, Rees valuations, symbolic powers, Groebner bases.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI works in the area of mathematics known as
commutative algebra, with applications to the area of algebraic geometry. In
particular, there are algebraic constructs that describe geometric objects, such
as spheres, cones, cylinders, etc. The (non) "smoothness" as well as many other
geometric properties of a geometric object are reflected in the properties of
its corresponding algebraic construct, which is useful because the latter is
much more susceptible to manipulation. A familiar example might be the prime
factorization of integers or polynomials, such as used in cryptography, but in
more general situations the corresponding "factorizations" are more complex and
highly non-unique.&lt;br/&gt;
