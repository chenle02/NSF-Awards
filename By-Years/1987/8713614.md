This award will support a conference to be held at the Regional Research
Institute at West Virginia University. The conference will bring together
experts from a number of nations to refocus attention on and reexamine the use
of input-output models in regional economic modelling. Input-output modelling
has declined in importance for some years, but new microcomputer-based software
and new databases are producing a resurgance of interest in the technique,
especially partial-survey and survey-based models. The conference will be an
important step leading to the availability of reliable and timely input-output
tables for regional analysis. Such tables will in turn enhance research
capabilities in geography and regional science.
