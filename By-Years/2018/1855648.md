This award supports the principal investigator's research projects within the
general framework of definable equivalence relations on Polish spaces, which is
a modern focus of descriptive set theory. This theory provides a general
framework for understanding the nature of classification of mathematical objects
up to some notion of equivalence, and, due to its broad scope, it has natural
interactions with many areas of mathematics. A central place in this theory is
occupied by countable Borel equivalence relations (CBERs), which arise via
actions of countable groups as well as via locally countable graphs. These
connections between equivalence relations, group actions, and graphs create an
extremely fruitful interplay between descriptive set theory, ergodic theory,
measured group theory, and descriptive graph combinatorics. The overarching goal
of the reseach is to deepen the understanding of these connections and further
the theory of CBERs having major open questions as guiding
targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects can be grouped into four topics. The
first concerns closure properties of the class of treeable CBERs, namely,
whether abstract quasi-isometries and finite index extensions preserve
treeability in the Borel or measurable contexts. Next is the investigation of
the quasi-invariant setting aiming to develop a theory of quasi-invariant cost.
The third topic is the existence of desirable subgraphs of graphings of a CBER,
e.g., the existence of cost-approximating subgraphings or subtreeings, as well
as that of maximal hyperfinite free factors. The last part is devoted to the
pointwise ergodic theorems, namely, proving new instances and finding new proofs
of known ones using a pointwise-combinatorial tiling argument in the style of
the PI's recent proof the Birkhoff ergodic theorem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
