Professor Seyferth of MIT will conduct research in the field of organometallic
chemistry with funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Program of the Chemistry Division. He will investigate the reactions of a group
of organic dianions with early transition metallocene dihalides and related
compounds. The dianions are species in which the charge is delocalized over a
trigonal array of four atoms, with the acetone dianion being typical. They can
react as C,C or C,X nucleophiles to generate four-membered metallacyclic ring
systems. Seyferth will explore the scope of synthesis of these systems as well
as their reactivity. He will also investigate metal exchange reactions of
organolithium compounds with transition-metal carbonyl complexes bearing heavy-
metal substituents. %%% A variety of strongly basic organic compounds will be
prepared, in which two protons have been removed. The chemical reactions of
these bases with compounds containing transition metal ions will be
investigated, because they lead to unusual four-membered rings containing the
metal ion and the organic base. Of special interest is the question of which
atoms of the organic bases will be incorporated in the rings. It is anticipated
that these unusual compounds will find use in the synthesis of organic
substances.
