0116106&lt;br/&gt;Reed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plant hormone auxin controls
multiple developmental processes including elongation of stems, branching of
shoots and roots, bending toward or away from light or gravity, and patterning
of various tissues. Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) are a family transcription
factors that regulate induction and repression of genes in response to auxin,
and therefore have key functions in mediating these developmental processes.
This project will focus on functions and interactions of ARF6 and ARF8, two ARFs
in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that activate genes in response to
auxin. The aims of the project are i) to discover developmental functions of
these two transcription factors by characterizing phenotypes of arf6 and arf8
mutant plants and of transgenic plants that overexpress epitope-tagged ARF6 or
ARF8; ii) to identify genes that ARF6 and ARF8 regulate by hybridizing probes
made from untreated or auxin-treated wild-type and mutant plants to gene chips
containing DNA representing thousands of Arabidopsis genes; iii) to explore
functional interactions between ARF6 and ARF8 and selected proteins of the
related Aux/IAA family, by constructing double mutants between arf6 and arf8 and
selected mutations in IAA genes and examining their phenotypes; iv) to raise
ARF6- and ARF8-specific anti-peptide antibodies; and v) to use these antibodies
and the epitope-tagged proteins to study whether ARF6 and ARF8 interact with
other proteins in vivo. These studies will provide a multifaceted view of the
functions of ARF6 and ARF8, setting the stage for similar analyses of other
