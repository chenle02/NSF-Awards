Searching for objects in physical space is one of the most common tasks for
robots. Transient targets refer to a class of objects which are not identifiable
unless momentary sensing and/or signaling conditions are satisfied. The
transient property is often introduced by target attributes, privacy concerns,
environment constraints, and/or sensing limitations. For example, searching for
a black box on the ocean floor after an airplane crash is a typical transient
target search (TTS) task because the search relies on the transient radio/sonar
signals emitted from the black box. This project develops the theoretical
foundations for TTS problems that will impact a large group of real world
applications. Due to their stochastic nature, TTS problems are challenging
because the transient property is often coupled with factors such as sensing
range limits, various coverage functions, constrained mobility, signal
correspondence, limited number of searchers, and a vast searching region.
Extensive modeling and analysis will be performed to understand the various
factors in the searching process. As the result, a new computation framework
consisting of models, metrics, and algorithms that integrate the resource to
improve TTS performance will be developed with three focuses: searching time
analysis that addresses the critical performance issue, multi-target search that
focuses on unique signal correspondence and collaborative sensing issues, and
planning for coordination of robots which includes both centralized and
decentralized approaches. This project also develops new course materials for
undergrad and graduate students to better understand algorithms and robust
intelligence in robotic searching applications.
