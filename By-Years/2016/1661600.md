The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the
introduction of a new technology that provides a unique and cost-effective
solution for the multibillion dollar stem cell industry. Stem cell therapy is a
fast growing global market, with an estimated 40% annual growth in the next five
years. Cell-based therapy has the vast potential to provide transformative
healthcare to many currently incurable diseases, providing broad societal
impact. This project will also impact more broadly to other biotechnology
sectors, such as antibody production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
addresses a major current limitation in the production of stem cell-derived
technologies, namely cellular aggregation. The technology provides an automated
and well-controlled disaggregation of multicellular stem cell spheroid clumps
into single cells via gentle mechanical forces. Proof-of-concept of the
technology was previously demonstrated using multiple types of adult stem cells.
Cell death was minimal and cell quality remained high, providing promise for an
economical alternative to current disaggregation methods with reduced operating
time and reduced batch-to-batch variations.
