The physics department at Whittier College is creating a versatile computer
laboratory with 10 Macintosh SE's and assorted hardware and software. This
laboratory will be the foundation for the newly re- established physics major on
campus. The laboratory will be used immediately in the introductory calculus-
based and algebra-based physics courses. The curriculum and laboratories in the
calculus- based course are being redesigned to take advantage of the pedagogical
benefits of computer technology. Students will be allowed to explore lecture
material on computers during the same class session the material is introduced
in lecture. Because of the laboratory's versatility, much of its equipment will
continue to serve the students as they progress through their undergraduate
careers. Project personnel will actively disseminate their experience
establishing the computer laboratory and re-establishing the physics major. The
college is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
