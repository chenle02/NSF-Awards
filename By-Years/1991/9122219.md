Research will be conducted to elucidate basic mechanisms and evolution of
acoustic communication, using treefrogs as a model system. These animals produce
stereotyped vocalizations and respond selectively to playbacks of synthetic
signals that contain features that carry information about the species and
quality of a potential mate. The goals of this project are: (1) to quantify the
degree of selectivity of female treefrogs in the presence and in the absence of
a closely-related species with similar calls; (2) to determine the extent to
which females avoid a nearby sound source that emits calls of another species in
order to reach a distant source of attractive calls of the same species; and (3)
to determine if artificially-induced changes in chromosome number affect key
features of the calls of males and the selectivity of females for those key
features. The last study is aimed at learning if the natural difference in
chromosome number in two species of gray treefrogs is responsible, at least in
part, for differences in their communication systems. The acoustic communication
of treefrogs is easier to study than that of many other kinds of animals, but
the general principles that emerge from Dr. Gerhardt's research will contribute
to growing scientific understanding of communication systems and how they work
in reproduction and survival of a wide range of diverse species. Such
understanding is valuable for control of pest species as well as for protection
of endangered or economically valuable species.
