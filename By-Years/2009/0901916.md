The Principal Investigator will perform a unique experimental investigation of
the topological and free-energy evolution of twisted magnetic flux in plasmas.
Specifically, he will investigate the consequences of a high-speed collision
between a plasma and a neutral gas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
advance our understanding of the non-equilibrium dynamics of plasmas having
complex, evolving morphology, such as solar corona loops and astrophysical jets.
These experimental results will be relevant to a wide variety of actual plasma
phenomena in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The validity and accuracy of several
numerical simulations in the wider plasma physics community will be tested
against these experiments. This research will involve a high school student and
two female graduate students, and it will also lead to the development of new
experimental techniques in plasma physics.&lt;br/&gt;
