9419373 Schiffman This award provides one-half the funding for the upgrade of an
electron microprobe system housed and operated in the Department of Geology at
the University of California at Davis. The institution is committed to providing
the remaining funds necessary to carry out the project. The upgrade will consist
of replacing the operating system computer and making improvements to the
machine's imaging system. The upgrade is necessary to carry out a number of
research and teaching projects requiring the analytical capabilities of a modern
electron microprobe. Research topics include hydrothermal metamorphism of clay
minerals in the oceanic crust and terrestrial geothermal systems, the
metamorphic geology of accretionary prisms and forearc regions in Alaska and
South America, low-grade metamorphism in the Sierra Nevada and Franciscan
complexes, phase equilibria and kinetics of silicate systems at elevated
temperatures and pressures, properties of silicate melts. In addition, the
electron microprobe at UC-Davis is used by students and staff from the
departments of chemistry, material sciences, soils, and the School of Veterinary
Medicine. ***
