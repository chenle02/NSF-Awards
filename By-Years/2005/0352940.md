The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology will host an REU site in mathematics for
the summers of 2004-2006. Each summer two faculty members will each mentor a
team of four undergraduates, a total of eight students, for eight weeks.
Research topics stem from the senior personnel's expertise: inverse problems for
partial differential equations; ``prescribed curvature'' problems leading to
nonlinear partial differential equations; and ``cwatsets'', a rich concept that
originated in this REU and which has gained a considerable following in the
mathematical community.

The program is designed to develop the participants as ``complete''
mathematicians, capable of making and proving original conjectures, learning
independently, working as part of a team, and communicating their results
clearly to others, both orally and in writing.
