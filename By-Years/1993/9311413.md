Much of the information on the geochemical evolution of groundwater has been
conducted in relatively deep aquifer systems. Many of the biogeochemical
reactions that influence nutrient cycling, concentrations of greenhouse gases,
and degradation of contaminants, however, are redox reactions that occur in
near- surface groundwaters. Redox boundaries can be either diffuse and extremely
sharp under various situations. The nature of these redox boundaries are
influenced by sediment chemistry, the kinetics of the redox reaction (including
mediation of the reactions by bacteria), groundwater flow paths and mixing of
groundwater, or combinations of these factors. In most studies of nitrate
concentrations or other solutes involved in redox reactions, the possible
physical and chemical systems have not been examined simultaneously or in
sufficient detail to identify major influences on groundwater oxidation-
reduction reactions. We propose to use extensive field monitoring to physical
and chemical characteristics of the aquifers and water at sites with different
physical characteristics and sediment chemistry. Nested piezometers and
tensiometers will be used to monitor groundwater flow paths, multi-level
samplers will be used to determine water chemistry. Groundwater ages will be
determined by measuring concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) dissolved
in the water. Measurements of nitrogen and other biologically fractionated
isotopes will be made to determine whether reductions in solute concentrations
are due to biologically mediated processes or due to dilution via groundwater
mixing.
