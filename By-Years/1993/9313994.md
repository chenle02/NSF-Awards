9313994 Wynblatt This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in metallurgy and electronic materials between Paul Wynblatt of Carnegie Mellon
University and Dominique Chatain of the French National Center for Scientific
Research, Campus de Luminy, Marseille, France. The objective of their research
is to combine new, yet complementary approaches to studies of critical wetting
phenomena in co-exiting liquid metal alloys. The proposed experimental research
involves liquid gallium and lead. The U.S. investigators bring to this
collaboration expertise in surface analysis techniques. They will look at
surface composition measurements. This is complemented by novel French
techniques in wetting measurements. The research is relevant to various liquid
metal processing techniques, including soldering, brazing, welding and other
liquid metal processes. ***
