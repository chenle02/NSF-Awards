Atomic nuclei are made up of protons and neutrons. For the lighter elements the
number of protons is very often equal to the number of neutrons in the nucleus.
However, nuclei also exist in which there are extra neutrons, or neutron-rich
nuclei, which are unstable and undergo nuclear decay. This project focuses on
the study of these neutron-rich unstable nuclei and will investigate key
questions in nuclear science related to the overall structure of nuclei: What
are the fundamental properties of extremely neutron-rich matter and what is the
limit of nuclear existence? The project will be carried out by Gettysburg
College undergraduates and a faculty member with the Modular Neutron Array
(MoNA) Collaboration and Large area multi-Institutional Scintillation Array
(LISA) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). Gettysburg
College students supported by this funding will learn significant new physics as
they develop the tools necessary to be researchers in academia and industry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students and their faculty are advancing the
field in various ways, ranging from how beams of rare isotopes interact with
matter to the exciting possibility of two-neutron radioactivity. Objectives
include creating He-9 two different ways experimentally at the NSCL to not only
shed light on conflicting prior results but also to better understand the "halo"
nucleus He-10. Measuring the lifetime of O-26 could confirm a new mode of
radioactivity. An analysis project focusing on the production mechanism for
projectile fragmentation will impact the physics community's currently limited
understanding of beam production mechanics at radioactive beam facilities. All
proposed work will involve undergraduate researchers.
