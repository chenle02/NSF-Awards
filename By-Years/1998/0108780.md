The goal of this study is to determine how characteristics of the landscape and
species life history traits (i.e., annuals vs. perennials and rare vs. common
species) interact to determine the large-scale (i.e., 10 km to 100 km)
distribution and dynamics of plant populations. Factors such as habitat patch
size and the distance from the nearest neighboring population are thought to
control the probabilities of population extinction and the subsequent re-
colonization of a vacant location. Very few field studies have been performed to
test these predictions. This investigation will focus on coastal wetland plants
in Narragansett Bay, RI, USA. GPS technologies will be used to map out the
location of wetland habitats and yearly surveys of 350 habitat patches within a
20 x 30 km study area will document population extinction and patch re-
colonization by 12 plant species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how
landscape characteristics affect the large-scale dynamics of populations is
fundamental to biological conservation. For example, such information can be
used to optimally design marine reserves, ensuring that networks of protected
areas are large enough and close enough to each other to maintain stable
populations of rare and endangered species. This study will also enable resource
managers to detect and mitigate the effects of environmental impacts to this and
other wetland habitats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
