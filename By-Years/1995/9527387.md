9527387 Zeng Coal processing waste dams are used to store coal slurry, and as
such have many characteristics in common with a broader class of structures
known as tailings dams. Tailings dams are characterized by hydraulically placed
fills held in place by an embankment. Failure of tailings dams due to
earthquakes has occurred many times in the past, causing significant loss of
property and human lives as well as severe environmental problems. Despite the
damage caused by such failures, there has been little research conducted to
evaluate the stability of such structures under earthquake loading. Coal waste
is a fine grained material which is sensitive to cyclic loading. High excess
pore pressure, and in the worst scenario liquefaction of the tailings, can cause
large pressure on the supporting embankment and initiate catastrophic failure.
This project uses a geotechnical centrifuge modeling technique to study the
mechanism of failure of coal-waste tailings dams and to generate physical data
for the evaluation of current design procedures. The project involves: 1. Two
centrifuge tests on tailings dams constructed according to two different
construction methods currently used in practice 2. Comparison between the data
from centrifuge tests with the results obtained from numerical simulation The
results of this study will provide engineers with valuable information
concerning the stability of existing tailings dams and guidelines for
improvement of future designs. HD/ Data/ Files/ Awards/ Award-FY 96/
