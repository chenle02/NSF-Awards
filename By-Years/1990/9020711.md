In this collaboration, investigators from GMU and MIT will pursue a
computational tutoring and learning environment for foreign language learning.
GMU will enhance its naturalistic, immersion- style foreign language experience.
Based on the premise that language is most thoroughly and memorably learned in
the course of meaningful use, this system integrates dialogue and rich graphical
interaction in the context of everyday scenes. The MIT group has over four years
built extensive theory-based natural language processing software with language
independent semantics and multi-level error handling especially designed for
tutorial purposes. The collaboration will have important research benefits in
both directions. The MIT language software will greatly enhance the GMU
immersion system and permit a proper study of its efficacy. The error diagnosis
capabilities will permit an investigation of student modeling, with potential
long- term consequences for the study of both intelligent tutoring systems and
psycholinguistics.
