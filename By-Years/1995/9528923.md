Professor Stuart A. Rice is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies of quasi-two dimensional
systems. Rice will use a combination of theory and experiment to perform studies
of: 1) polymer spheres and dimers in very thin cells or adsorbed on liquid
surfaces; 2) Langmuir monolayers; and 3) the liquid-vapor interfaces of mixtures
of metals. Experimental techniques to be employed include evanescent wave
dynamic light scattering, digital video microscopy, and grazing incidence X-ray
diffraction and X-ray reflectivity. Simulations will involve the use of
Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques as well as Car-Parinello theory.
Very little is known about the structure of the interface between two immiscible
phases. Many chemical and biological phenomena depend on the nature of this
interface. For example, the interface between long chain amphiphiles and water
is a model for biological membranes found in the cell wall. Rice is using a
combination of theoretical and experimental methods that have only recently
become available to explore the detailed structure of these phase boundaries and
the factors that influence their structure.
