This modestly high power dilution refrigerator will be used for studies of
spin-polarized quantum systems. This refrigerator will be used in collaborative
efforts to study atomic hydrogen with a Lyman-alpha laser, to study and develop
a cryogenic hydrogen maser (CHM), to study atomic scattering at low
temperatures, and a number of other experiments. The laser experiment is
directed at obtaining conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation, which would be
of fundamental significance for physics. In addition, the laser provides a
valuable diagnostic tool for the study of atoms in magnetic traps. The CHM
promises not only to be more stable than any existing oscillator, but by virtue
of its stability will enable precise measurements of interaction constants in
this fundamental system. Scattering experiments will enable the determination of
many very important cross sections never before measured. A number of other
experiments promise to yield rich new phenomena.
