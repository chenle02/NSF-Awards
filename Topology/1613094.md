This NSF award will support a conference on "Topology, Geometry, and Data
Analysis" at Ohio State University in May 2016. Topology and geometry provide
novel and robust methods for understanding the shape and structure of complex
data sets. This meeting will gather a number of experts in algebraic topology,
computational geometry, and related areas, as well as researchers in more
applied scientific domains. The main aims are to exchange ideas and to
consolidate synergistic activities through fostering collaborations. The
organizers will encourage participation by a number of junior participants,
introducing this emerging field to the next generation of researchers. Most of
the funding will support travel and local expenses of conference participants.

Applied algebraic topology is a rapidly developing area. This meeting will focus
on a few of the most promising fronts. It will bring together specialists in
computational topology and geometry (mesh generation and manifold
reconstruction, persistent homology and cohomology), experts in the theoretical
underpinnings (algebraic and categorical views of persistent homology, stability
and inference), and researchers working in more applied areas (mathematical
neuroscience, molecular biology, material science). The organizers are
especially interested in new collaborations across disciplines, for example in
applying topological methods to detect previously unknown structure in
biological datasets, so the focus of this meeting is coherent but broad. The
