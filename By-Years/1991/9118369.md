A structural investigation by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of
RNA-protein interactions will be carried out. These interactions are poorly
understood, and their importance in areas such as RNA processing and RNA viruses
is rapidly becoming appreciated. The systems to be studied include the
prokaryotic ribosome, the eukaryotic spliceosome and the regulation of
transcription in bacteriophage T4. In the ribosome and spliceosome, specific
RNA-protein interactions are crucial to structure and function, and components
of each including individual proteins, RNA fragments and complexes will be
isolated and studied. In addition, the structure of the putative DNA- binding
domain of a vital protein that controls transcription in bacteriophage T4 will
be determined. %%% Interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are central
to many cellular processes and the results of this research will provide
important insights into the mechanisms by which proteins recognize specific
nucleic acid sequences.
