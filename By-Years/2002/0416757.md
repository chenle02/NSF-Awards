This project creates a Reconfigurable Attack-Defend Instructional Computing
Laboratory (RADICL) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of
Idaho (UI). The UI is a NSF Scholarship for Service (SFS, aka CyberCorps) school
and a NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education
(CAE/IAE). The UI Department of Computer Science played the lead role in both of
those efforts and designations. However, while the institution and department
have adequate facilities for nominal Computer Science and Information Assurance
(CS/IA) education, there are almost no instructional computing facilities to
enable state-of-the-art pedagogy in attack-defend scenarios. Hands-on experience
with these topics requires a laboratory computer network that is both isolated
(so it won't impact or contaminate day-to-day computing facilities) and
reconfigurable (to allow diverse operating systems, network topologies, and
defensive strategies). There is currently no such facility available to UI
faculty specializing in CS/IA education. This SFS Capacity Building grant
creates such a facility, dubbed RADICL, housed within the UI CS Department and
supports all existing CS/IA faculty and classes.
