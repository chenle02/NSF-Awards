Filippenko 9417213 This research represents a concentrated effort to determine
the nature of the progenitor stars, the explosion mechanisms, and the
nucleosynthetic products of different types of supernovae. The results will have
broad implications for topics as diverse as the chemical evolution of galaxies,
the birthrate of pulsars, and cosmology. The adopted approach is largely
observational, coupled with theoretical modeling. A vigorous search for new
supernovae in nearby galaxies will be conducted with an automated imaging
telescope at Leuschner Observatory, thereby extending an effort that began over
a year ago. Multi-color, long-term light curves of all sufficiently bright
supernovae will be obtained with a second robotic telescope at Lick Observatory.
High-quality optical spectra will also be obtained with state-of-the-art
equipment in order to study the temporal evolution and statistical properties of
supernovae. Thorough analysis of the data should lead to the development of a
more complete classification scheme that focuses on fundamental parameters.
Besides providing deeper insights into their origins and physical
characteristics, quantitative assessment of the observed properties of nearby
supernovae should improve the potential of supernovae for cosmological distance
determinations. The newly commissioned Keck 10-meter telescope will be used to
obtain spectra of very distant supernovae, in an attempt to measure the
expansion rate and overall curvature of the Universe. ***
