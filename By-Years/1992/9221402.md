Beam dynamics problems relevant to the understanding of the coherent beam
instabilities and the nonlinearity in the Cooler Ring will be investigated.
These research topics are indispensable to the effort of increasing luminosity
at the IUCP Cooler Ring and are also important to modern high brightness storage
rings. The proposed research is also important in training the accelerator
physics graduate and undergraduate students. The task A studies "Impedances and
Instabilities measurement of the Cooler". Topics of interest are coherent
instabilities and preservation of small emittance beam in high energy (and high
brightness) accelerators. Using the measured beam transfer function, the
impedance can be deduced. Model simulation and analytic evaluation of the Vlasov
equation will be compared with experimental data. These experiments will help to
understand better the current limitation of the Cooler Ring. It will also
provide information for the design of damper system. Through this series of
experiments, we will be able to understand the dynamics of coherent instability
and multidimensional Landau damping on the coherent growth. These experiment can
also be important to Plasma physics. The task B studies "Phase and Amplitude
Modulations in Parametric Resonances". The experiment is to measure beam
responses to the phase or amplitude modulations in the rf system. These response
functions are solutions of parametric resonant equations. These experiments are
important to understand the diffusion process in the longitudinal phase space.
Using the phase feedback loop, highly damped parametric resonant system can be
studied as well. Phenomena such as chaos, strange attractors, and bifurcations
can be measured. With these experimental tools, we can set up an excellent
laboratory for nonlinear dynamics.
