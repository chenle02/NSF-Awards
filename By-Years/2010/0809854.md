The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Paul Cremer of Texas A&amp;M
University. Prof. Cremer and his students will study the fundamental mechanisms
of the interactions of salts with model polypeptide systems. The study will
reveal the profound effects that salts have on the physical properties of
proteins. These interactions play crucial role in many processes including
protein folding, enzyme turnover and supramolecular ordering. The study will
involve the use of a wide variety of analysis tools including vibrational sum
frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) and a novel temperature gradient microfluidic
device which was developed by Prof. Cremer and his students. The study will
provide an excellent educational opportunity for graduate students and
postdoctoral trainees to carry out a fundamental protein dynamics study using
state of the art analytical techniques. The study will be applicable to a wide
variety of problems ranging from polymer physics and medicine to colloid
chemistry and protein isolation.
