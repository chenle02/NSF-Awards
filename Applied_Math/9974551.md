The award will support a conference on mathematical models for interfaces in
fluid mechanics and materials processing, to be held on August 16-18, 1999 in
Monterey, CA. The meeting will bring together leading researchers in interface
problems in order to discuss the current state of the art and to assess the
commonality of approaches used to model interfaces and solve for their
evolution. The participants will include applied mathematicians, engineers, and
scientists from academia, government laboratories, and industry who are working
on these problems. This conference will present a unique and timely opportunity
for these communities to come together in an informal atmosphere to assess the
current state of the art and to identify the important research problems for the
future.

Interfaces are free or moving boundaries that occur between two different
material phases. They are found in a wide range of fluid mechanics and materials
processing problems in a variety of different industrial processes and everyday
phenomena, ranging from water drops in a hot pan to coating films on a solid
surface. A better understanding and the successful manipulation of such
boundaries could lead to process improvements with wide benefits.
