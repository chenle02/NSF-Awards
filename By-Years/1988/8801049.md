As priorities change at many smaller universities and colleges, herbaria
containing important research collections, including many types and other
historical material, are no longer useful to the institution. It becomes the
responsibility of the nation's large herbaria to rescue these orphaned
collections and make their important research material available for taxonomic
research throughout the world. Two such herbaria have just been transferred to
the New York Botanical Garden. One of these, the Truman G. Yuncker Herbarium of
DePauw University, contains ca 135,000 specimens, including the important
research collections of Truman F. Yuncker (world authority of Piperaceae and
Cuscutaceae) and Winona J. Welch (world authority on Fontinalaceae and
Hookeriaceae). The other, the Wabash College Herbarium, contains ca 20,000
specimens, including the collections of John M. Coulter (well known for his work
on the Rocky Mountain flora) and the Hayden Geological Survey of the Rocky
Mountains in the 1870s. This project will provide funds to hire two temporary
curatorial assistants to process the specimens and incorporate them into the
Garden's Herbarium.
