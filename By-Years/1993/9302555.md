This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
William M. Jones at the University of Florida, Gainesville to study three
related topics in organometallic chemistry. The first concerns the development
of carbene migratory insertions in the iron triad. This chemistry concentrates
on the use of carbene complexes of the late transition metals iron, ruthenium,
and osmium and aims to explore catalyzed migratory insertions and rearrangements
of unstabilized complexes, and also will compare their aptitude for migratory
insertions. The second topic of study concerns the synthesis of mainly zirconium
complexes with molecules containing highly strained multiple bonds with
particular emphasis on cyclic cumulenes and cyclopropenes. The third area deals
with the formation and reactions of transition metal complexes of tropynes,
metalloazulenes, and metallobenzenes. In this project Professor William M. Jones
will study reactivity aspects of carbene complexes of the late transition metals
iron, ruthenium, and osmium. The work will concentrate on carbene migratory
insertions, on structural and synthetic aspects of complexed strained alkenes
and alkynes, and on the synthesis of novel metalloaromatics.
