9514885 Tabakin The new continuous electron beam facility (CEBAF) generates an
electron beam that is not only energetic (4 GeV), but provides a large, steady
current. With that beam, plus state-of-the art detectors, experimentalists will
perform precision, innovative experiments to determine what happens when high-
energy electromagnetic radiation (provided by the electrons) strikes a proton.
Protons and electrons, which are prime building blocks of matter, have spin. At
CEBAF, it will be possible to orient and measure their spins. Our goal will be
to predict, using quark-models of the proton structure, the angular distribution
of the mesons that are produced in such experiments. Mesons are the particles
that generate the strong interactions that provide the nuclear or strong force,
also called hadron dynamics. Some mesons are spinless, some have a spin of one,
in some cases spin 2. We will predict, not only the likelihood of the production
at various angels (their cross- sections), but also how their production is
influenced by the initial electron and proton spin orientations and what final
proton and meson spin orientations are predicted by the best available
electromagnetic and strong interaction theories. Thus, we will be testing the
validity of present formulations of hadron dynamics. ***
