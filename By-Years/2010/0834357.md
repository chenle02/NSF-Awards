Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0834357&lt;br/&gt;PI: Anand
Tripathi&lt;br/&gt;Critical infrastructure services over the Internet are
subject to constantly increasing threats posed by attackers. The goal of this
project is to investigate a system architecture for building highly available
Internet services using the mobile agent paradigm. In this research, mobile
agent based techniques are being investigated for replication of critical
components in different domains, dynamic regeneration of service components in
case of attacks and failures, and distributed mechanisms to actively monitor the
components of a service in different domains. Mobile agent-based mechanisms are
utilized for dynamically replicating, regenerating, or migrating a service from
one domain to another to ensure its continued availability, cognizant of
network-wide and service-level operating conditions. Mobile agent based
techniques are also used for detection and notification of critical conditions
-- such as failures, intrusions, and overload conditions -- across different
network domains for building resilient services over the Internet. A secure
overlay network is used for isolating service components from clients, and for
providing location-transparent access to migratory services. The overlay network
also serves as a registry for storing service access policies and different
communication models. Towards the broader impact, this projects aims to
contribute to the research infrastructure in the form of an experimental system
to serve as a testbed for building and experimenting with secure and resilient
services.
