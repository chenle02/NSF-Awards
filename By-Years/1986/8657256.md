The PI has received a Presidential Young Investigator award and describes his
research as follows: The goal of this project is to study the nonlinear dynamics
of optical fibers and of semiconductor lasers. The intensity-dependent
refractive index of optical fibers leads to certain instabilities of the
polarization state of a light beam in the fiber. We plan to extend our
theoretical studies of this phenomenon to include group velocity dispersion,
dissipation, fiber perturbations, and counter-propagating pulse geometries.
Recent work on chaos in modulated semiconductor lasers will be extended to the
dynamics of semiconductor laser arrays. Theoretical studies will be aimed at
elucidating parameter ranges that lead to a spatio-temporal chaotic output of
these lasers. Stabilization by means of an injected signal will also be studied.
This PI has received a Presidential Young Investigator award. He will conduct
research on the nonlinear dynamical behavior of semiconductor lasers and of the
optical fibers used for their transmission. Theoretical studies of chaotic
behavior in semiconductor lasers will be conducted and methods to stabilize the
laser output will be investigated.
