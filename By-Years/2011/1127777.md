The proposal seeks to establish a means to do high performance 3-D multiviepoint
gaming in the cloud as a foundation for a fundamental change in the gaming
industry now dominated by specialized hardware local to each gamer. The approach
uses PLASM (Parallel Lighting and Animation Subscription Model), an architecture
for multi-viewpoint computer graphics designed for large-scale computer systems,
to exploit graphics computations across multiple users drawing on cloud data
center and computational resources. The proposed method has the potential to
achieve orders-of-magnitude increases in graphics computation at constant
hardware cost for multiple concurrent users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
intends to create a startup company around this technology which has the
potential to be disruptive to the current gaming solutions. The license by usage
time suggested seeks to obtain a market share of the current 3B playing hours
per week of gamers. PLASM has the potential to be enabling to the migration of
other important graphics applications to the cloud computing environment
including real time interactive maps, e-design, visualization and medicine
involving multiple users and collaborators. The effort is linked with Project
Olympus at CMU school of computer science aimed at bridging research and
commercialization.
