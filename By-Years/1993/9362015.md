9362015 Buck Measurement of trace amounts of water vapor is critical to
industrial processes such as semiconductor fabrication, where moisture in gases
must often be below a few parts per billion (PPB). Water in trace amounts is
also critical in high altitude atmospheric chemistry, affecting global climate
change and ozone depletion. Current instruments for measuring trace moisture are
severely limited. Some cannot maintain calibration; others have slow response
times. Most have limited sensitivity. A cryogenic chilled-mirror hygrometer
capable of extremely high sensitivity (below one PPB) and very fast response
time (a few seconds) has been developed. It is accurate and simple to operate.
However, to be fully useful in industrial processes, the relationship between
dew/frost point and vapor pressure (enhancement factor) must be defined for
industrial gases. This instrument provides direct means to determine enhancement
factors at very low moisture levels in a variety of gases. This research is to
test and optimize the instrument for use as a trace moisture sensor in
industrial gases. This work will make possible fast, accurate measurements of
trace water vapor in industrial gases and the atmosphere.
