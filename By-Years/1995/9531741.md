This project will combine Wilcox Solar Observatory field data and spacecraft in-
situ data or coronagraph activities to examine at least three questions related
to the connection between evolution of the solar field and coronal and
interplanetary phenomena. These questions include: (1) What is the relationship
between the solar cycle variation of the flux out of the source surface and the
occurrence rates of coronal mass ejections and their opposite counterparts,
interplanetary solar wind heat flux dropouts? (2) What is the relationship
between the coronal field structure evolution, as seen in the coronal field
models, and the locations and characteristics of coronagraph CMEs? (3) What is
the relationship between the appearance of interplanetary coronal mass ejection
fields and the structure of the coronal fields in their projected source
regions? Results of these studies will provide new ways of exploiting global
solar magnetic field observations as a multi-purpose tool for understanding and
predicting interplanetary transient phenomena.
