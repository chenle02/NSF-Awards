9413732 Verosub This award provides one-half the funding required to construct
an instrument system for making continuous high- resolution measurements of
cores of lake and marine sediments and of soil profiles. The system will be
installed and operated in the Department of Geology at the University of
California-Davis. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds
required to complete the project. When magnetic mineral grains are deposited as
sediment at the bottom of water bodies under quiet conditions or become
incorporated in developing soil profiles, the grains are aligned parallel to the
geomagnetic field, and their alignment can later be used to decipher the past
history of the magnetic field during the time represented by the accumulation of
the sediment or soil profile. The primary goal of the new instrumentation will
be to obtain continuous interpretations of climate change using the variation of
magnetic parameters measured along the length of sediment cores. A complementary
scientific goal of the facility will be to obtain a history of the behavior of
the Earth's magnetic field, including variations in the direction and intensity
of the field. ***
