Dr. Sandra J. Rosenthal has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Rosenthal's doctoral degree was from the University of Chicago
under the supervision of Professor Graham Fleming. Dr. Rosenthal will continue
research at the University of California/Berkeley under the sponsorship of
Professors Charles Shank and Richard Mathies. Dr. Rosenthal's postdoctoral
training will study the role of vibrational and electronic coherence in
nonlinear optical phenomena and the photoisomerization of rhodopsin, using
ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy and theory. Longer term she plans to study
the mechanism and timescale of electronic dephasing processes and investigate
the formation and relaxation of biexcitons in semiconducting nanoclusters. The
information gained from these studies will lead to an understanding of exciton
relaxation and the origin of nonlinear susceptibility, provide a blueprint to
tailor the optical properties of new systems and, and initiate the use of
semiconducting nanoclusters in the field of molecular electronics. %%% The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of
recent Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
