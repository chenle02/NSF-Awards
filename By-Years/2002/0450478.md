This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
commercialize the holographic multi-spectral filter technology developed during
the SBIR phase I project. The objective of this project will be the industrial
fabrication of holographic multi-spectral filters by using the methods developed
and demonstrated during the phase I SBIR research. There is a strong scientific
and public push in astronomy to look deeper into the universe to discover and
observe fascinating phenomena such as the birth of stars and exo-planets. In
observations of celestial bodies from ground telescopes, the signal is faint and
surrounded with unwanted optical noise from the atmosphere. The hydroxyl (OH)
radicals present in the atmosphere emit light in hundreds of narrow lines that
dominate the inter-line sky emission by many orders of magnitude. The multi-
spectral rejection filter demonstrated in phase I discriminates the narrow
spectral features of the OH emission lines from the atmosphere which increases
the image sharpness by increasing the signal to noise ratio.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The narrow band grating filter technology is a core
platform that has a scientific and economic impact on ground-based astronomy as
well as in laser diode systems. To date $3.8 Billion has been spent deploying
and maintaining the Hubble Telescope. An estimated $2.2 Billion is required to
see it to its final scheduled retiring date of 2010. It is believed that the
introduction of the these multi-line filters combined in some cases with
adaptive optics, can boost the performance of ground based telescopes so that
they can approach the performance of space telescopes at a price more than 1000
times lower.&lt;br/&gt;
