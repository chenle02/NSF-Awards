The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to
recent recipients of doctoral degrees. The fellowship is designed to provide 24
months of support divided into 18 academic months and 3 periods of two summer
months. The recipient has the option of a Research Instructorship which allows
the 18 months of academic support to be taken as 9 months of full-time support
and 18 months of half-time support. Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship awards allow fellows to choose research environments that will have
maximal impact on their future scientific development. Vallorie Peridier will
receive her doctoral degree from Lehigh University, and will pursue research in
the area of applied mathematics, specifically, mathematical characterization of
blood product transport and exchange in the complex porous structures of micro-
circulatory physiology, under the guidance of Eric Salathe at Lehigh University
while located at Temple University.
