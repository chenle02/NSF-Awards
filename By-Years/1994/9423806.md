This grant provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V CAPE HATTERAS,
a 135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the University.
Instrumentation to be acquired includes a bench salinometer, an altimeter, a
radiation sensor, a Multi-corer and digital seismic software. The
instrumentation requested is for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the CAPE
HATTERAS during 1995 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in
the future. ??
