This award funds work on two separate projects. The first project develops new
methods in dynamic game theory. The PI works to extend the definition of Markov
perfect equilibrium to the case of imperfectly observable actions. He also uses
the concept of evolutionary stability to examine whether it will prove to be a
powerful method for sharpening the ability of the theory of repeated games to
make firm predictions.

The second project addresses issues in the theory of political economy, again by
using techniques and methods from game theory. The research characterizes what
voting rules satisfy four key criteria (anonymity, neutrality, the Pareto
property, and strategy proofness) for the widest possible set of voter
preferences. This project shows what voting rules are most preferable in
electoral systems. In addition, the PI builds and analyzes a model of
legislative bargaining.

The broader impacts of this project include developing new methods for the many
different communities in social science, computer science, and biology that use
game theory as a fundamental method. The work in political economy will be
helpful to those envisioning reform of electoral systems.
