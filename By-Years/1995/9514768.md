This program supports the activities of the Plasma Science Committee of the
National Research Council. This committee is the standing committee of the NRC
charged with monitoring the health of the field of plasma science in the United
States. It does this through regular meetings, panels, and workshops, with
participation by active researchers in the plasma science community. It
disseminates the results of its deliberations through reports and through direct
conversations with community members and with representatives of funding
agencies.
