A five-day international conference entitled "Reflections on Geometry: 3--
Manifolds, Groups and Singularities" is to be held at Columbia University in New
York City on June 8-12, 2020. Research on the three main topics of the
conference has proceeded at a remarkable pace, in a multitude of directions, and
using diverse methods of study and application. Many exciting possibilities for
current and future research lie at the interface of these areas, with important
potential applications in other subfields of mathematics and physics. The main
objective of this conference is to provide a single forum for a comprehensive
meeting, which will create many opportunities for cross-fertilization of these
blossoming research directions and methods across diverse
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on new developments
that highlight connections between these fields, and help create new avenues for
collaboration. All conference participants will benefit from the unusual breadth
of this conference, and the opportunity to see connections between topics that
first appeared in distinct research fields. Graduate students and junior
researchers will especially benefit by meeting distinguished researchers,
gaining perspective, learning the current developments, setting goals for
further research, and exploring applications to different fields of mathematics.
