In developing countries such as India, as much as one-third of the population
lives below the poverty line. Since most of the poor live in rural areas,
national and state governments have directed their economic development policies
for alleviating poverty to rural localities. The relative success of alleviating
poverty is geographically variant and seems to be related to the constraining
and enabling effects of the local ruling class. This project will attempt to
answer why programs for the alleviation of poverty in rural India are more
successful in some villages and states than in others, and it offers a
theoretical framework for evaluating this geographical variation. Two specific
rural development programs will be examined. A multivariate analysis will
establish the degree to which sub- districts with high levels of success in
implementation of these programs have lower incidence of poverty. Areas of very
high and very low success rates will be studied in detail in terms of the
relations among local state officials, local ruling classes, and party leaders,
and local organizations representing lower classes. Unstructured interviews and
data from local archives will serve to illustrate that local variation in policy
implementation success rates depends upon local social and political structures.
The results from this project should demonstrate the relative importance of
local elites, bureaucracies and organizations representing the poor in
explaining the geographical variation in the success of various policies to
alleviate local poverty. These results will have important implications for
rural economic development policy makers in developing nations in terms of
designing implementation programs to raise the standard of living of large
numbers of poor households.
