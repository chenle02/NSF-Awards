9416620 Hart This project will address a long-standing problem of excessively
high Sr isotopic ratio in oceanic peridotites by testing the hypothesis that
this signal results from the presence of particles derived from continental
crust and carried deep into the peridotites by circulating seawater. The
hypothesis will be tested by analyzing other isotopic systems, including Nd, Pb,
Os and Be. Confirmation of the hypothesis would have major implications for
global, and oceanic, biochemical cycles and fluxes. ***
