Abstract Proposal: CNS 0454170 PI: Bin Wang Institution: Wright State University
Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure Title: CRI:
Instrumentation of a Hierarchical Wireless Sensor Network Test-bed for Research
and Education

Project: The PI's will acquire a two tier, hierarchical sensor network based on
motes. The testbed will have a core network, core access network, and sensor
field. The core network is the wireless LAN already in existence; the core
access network will consist of several network service access points emulated by
laptop computers, and the sensor nodes will be constructed from motes, sensor
boards and network interface boards. Research supported will include
development, analysis and deployment of sensor network protocols and
applications. The PI's will study whether a proposed hierarchical architecture
improves connectivity, energy conservation, and reliability; they will evaluate
security protocols; they will design new security mechanisms and resilience
schemes in defense of faults and attacks; and develop region-based event
monitoring applications. The infrastructure will support education at Wright
State University by use in undergraduate capstone courses and graduate level
independent research.
