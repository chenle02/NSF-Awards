The Anchorage Science/Technology Alliance Project aims to improve precollege
science education for the 40,000 students in its district. The project will work
in five program areas: (1) coordination, communication, outreach, and planning;
(2) internships for teachers; (3) a Scientists in Schools program; (4) review,
synthesis, and dissemination of curricula; and (5) a cross.training program to
provide access to educators to technical and management seminars and to open
professional development training in the School District to people from the
Alliance. An outcome of the project will be the establishment of a statewide
network for science and technology education.
