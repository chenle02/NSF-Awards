Brantley &lt;br/&gt;EAR-0114858&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER proposal is
designed to take a unique opportunity to assess the use of eddy correlation
(EC), a micrometeorological technique, to measure CO2 fluxes at the Solfatara
crater in Campi Flegrei, Italy. The choice of locality was made in order to take
advantage of a field season where chamber fluxes will measured concurrently with
another methodology by an Italian collaborator, Dr. G. Chiodini. This project
has as a goal, to collect data that will convince atmospheric scientists and
geologists worldwide of the potential of EC for assessment of volcanic fluxes
and surveillance of volcanoes. Funding of the project will allow a student to be
involved in the early developmental stages for using EC for volcanic work and
will allow her to be involved in an international collaborative setting to study
a problem with potential implications for global change and volcanic
hazards.&lt;br/&gt;
