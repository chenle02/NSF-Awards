Work on this project combines geometrically motivated problems set in an
analytic framework. It represents a continuation of research in four areas. In
the first, work will continue in establishing existence and describing
properties of conformal metrics with prescribed scalar or Gaussian curvature on
complete manifolds. This is equivalent to finding positive solutions of an
elliptic, nonlinear equation on the manifold, whose linear term is the Laplace-
Beltrami operator in the metric with scalar curvature appearing as a multiplier
of the unknown function. Although much is known about the compact case,
relatively little has been done in the non-compact setting until recently. A
second line of investigation will focus on developing a complete understanding
of finite mass solutions and infinite mass solutions of the Matukuma equations
in astrophysics. These are semilinear equations, first proposed in 1930, to
model the dynamics of global star clusters. These equations are believed to be
an improvement of Eddington's 1915 model. The unknown function here is the
gravitational potential which, for the finite total mass case, has only recently
been shown to have positive entire solutions (the corresponding Eddington
equation has none). Many questions remain unanswered regarding the two models
and discrepancies observed between their solutions. Work will also be done in
determining whether the Lane- Emden equation of astrophysics has oscillatory as
well as non- oscillatory solutions and analyzing the asymptotic behavior of
singular radial solutions. In addition, relatively recent work on chemotaxis has
led to new results on solutions of parabolic systems describing the oriented
movement of cells in response to chemicals in the environment. Further work
remains in determining how the cells move toward places of higher concentration
and then aggregate.
