0305330&lt;br/&gt;RUI: Amorphous Program Slicing&lt;br/&gt;Dave
Binkley&lt;br/&gt;Loyola College in Maryland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software is
given ever increasing responsibility for safety-critical systems (e.g., the
control of nuclear power plants, medical devices, electronic banking, and air
traffic control), which necessitates the production of high-integrity software
(i.e., software that can and must be trusted to work dependably). The growing
complexity of this software requires increased comprehension, which is
obtainable through improved tool support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
objective of this research is to improve programmer productivity by improving
comprehension through the use of semantics-based software analysis tools. This
particular research will investigate the use of amorphous program slicing in
semantics-based tools. A tool that understands and conveys the semantics, or
meaning, of a program, provides unique and useful information to a programmer.
Program slicing is a program decomposition technique that identifies
semantically meaningful portions of a program. Amorphous program slicing is a
recent variant of program slicing that reduces the amount of code&lt;br/&gt;a
programmer must consider. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achieving these objectives
requires building an amorphous slicing tool and then conducting experiments with
it. An effective tool will improve programmer productivity; thus increasing
programmer understanding, reducing software costs, and, perhaps more
importantly, increasing the integrity of software.&lt;br/&gt;
