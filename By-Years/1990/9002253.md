This project will continue research on the semantics of computation. The
emphasis during the coming period will be on methods for proving the correctness
of compilers. The use of higher-order assembly language rather than combinators
as a model of a compiler's target code allows great flexibility in the
architecture of the compiler's abstract machine; this flexibility will be used
to prove the correctness of a variety of different environment and code
representations. A second thread is a continuation of work on strong typing for
object-oriented systems; here a variety of issues concerning subtyping and
coercion will be studied.
