The investigator will continue long-term research into the study of symmetries
and some of their applications. Symmetry is a mathematical concept with direct
applications in other sciences such as chemistry, physics, biology, and
engineering. The study of algebra, of which this research is a part, is in many
ways the study of symmetries. This project aims to advance understanding of
important algebraic structures, with potential applications to number theory and
theoretical physics.

This research project is concerned with symmetry breaking, that is, obtaining
representations of a smaller Lie group from the representations of a large
reductive semi-simple Lie group. The representations of the large group are
usually infinite dimensional, and the representations of smaller groups are
related to quotients of the original representation of the large group. Symmetry
breaking of representations is far from well understood, and so the
constructions and the understanding of examples are very important. This
research has applications to number theory and possibly to theoretical physics.
Many of the techniques used in these constructions are analytic, and thus some
new, interesting, and challenging problems in analysis arise and need to be
solved.
