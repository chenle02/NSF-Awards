9601859 LaBerge This Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) award provides
partial support for the purchase of a testing system for the study of
orthopaedic bearing surfaces. The system consists of a knee joint simulator
permits the non-contact surface profilometer. The knee joint simulator permits
the simultaneous bench assessment of implant performance of up to six joints.
The non-contact surface profilometer will be used in reconstructive surgery. The
equipment will be used in an interactive academic research program in orthopedic
materials and tribology where both undergraduate and graduate students are
involved. ***
