1560664&lt;br/&gt;Young&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of
a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) dedicated to the analysis of
sulfur isotope ratios. Specific research that would immediately benefit from the
proposed SIRMS includes study of paleo-redox conditions in ancient oceans,
marine food web dynamics, and linkages between sulfate-reducing microbes with
production of methyl-mercury. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument would be
housed in the NSF-supported FSU National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL)
that benefits students, faculty members, and researchers across FSU as well as
numerous visiting scientists from other universities and the surrounding
community. In addition to student training in methods of stable isotopic
analysis as applied to paleorecords research the investigators plan local K-12
outreach utilizing the instrument. This support is congruent with NSFs mission
of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national welfare given
the importance of student training in analytical techniques in geochemistry and
chemistry to support future scientific workforce needs.
