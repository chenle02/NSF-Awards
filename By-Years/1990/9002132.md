Initial experiments with a graph reduction model for nondeterministic program
control indicate that this is a viable and natural approach. Appropriate
reduction rules for and and or combinators together with a new type of tagged
node (alt nodes) enable the straightforward compilation of declarative language
statements to graph sections whose reduction by simple rewrite rules will effect
backtracking. Other graph reduction approaches to logic languages place this
burden on the metalanguage. The matching of an operational graph reduction model
with a denotational semantics for the declarative language B provides an elegant
framework for extension to full logic programming and the future incorporation
of more advanced control structures. Although the current model abstracts the
complexities of state by making explicit a state argument, there are appropriate
alternative strategies that can be employed in the extension. Other
investigators are currently producing graph reduction models incorporating
appropriate behavior for logic variables, which will be considered in our
extension. The main objective is to develop the current model to correctly and
efficiently model sophisticated control for declarative languages. Investigation
of methods to superimpose Prolog's cut is already underway. The model will seek
ways to incorporate the necessary control information into the graph. The
success of simple alt nodes in modeling nondeterminism is an encouraging start.
