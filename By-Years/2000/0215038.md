This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
demonstrate the feasibility of developing a magnetic microscopy technique for
real-time imaging of electrical current densities with sub-micron resolution for
the analysis of electromigration (EM) processes. EM failure remains one of the
most challenging problems facing the semiconductor industry. The microscopy
technique uses specially designed magnetic sensors called magnetic tunneling
junctions. By non-invasively measuring and analyzing the magnetic fields
generated by current-carrying elements, one can image EM processes in real-time,
with high sensitivity and resolution under ambient conditions. The Phase I
research will focus on two critical issues for the commercial viability of this
technique: 1) the design and fabrication of sensors with low noise and high-
temperature tolerance for real-time operation; 2) optimization of electronics
and algorithms for application to multi-level and deep sub-micron ICs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EM-induced failure analysis remains one of the most active
fields of study in the semiconductor industry. It is important to any chip
manufacturer that it be able to characterize EM in real-time and on-site. The
research results will have numerous potential applications in electronics-
related fields including semi conductor integrated circuits and data storage.
