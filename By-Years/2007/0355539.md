A planning meeting will be held for the Center for Child Injury Prevention
Science (C-ChIPS) to become an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center.
Its mission will be to ensure the safety of children by conducting scientific
research on the prevalence and predictors of child injury, and evaluation,
development, testing and dissemination of commercial technology and public
education programs for prevention. Work will build on existing collaborations
that leverage the capabilities, interests, and expertise of the Center faculty
and its industrial partners. The Center's research projects will address three
scientific themes: Safety Monitoring and Risk Assessment; Hazard Evaluation and
Testing; and Prevention Technology Development.
