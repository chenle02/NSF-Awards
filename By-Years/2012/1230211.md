Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will bring together an
international group of scholars to discuss the social studies of science and
technology in Latin American contexts. In doing so, it will form new networks
among North American, South American, and European scholars who use concepts and
frameworks from science and technology studies (STS) to study science and
technology in Latin America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international focus of this workshop will provide
new perspectives and ways of thinking about science and technology, including
the role of adaptation and translation of science and technology across
cultures. Workshop participants will analyze how Latin American experiences
broaden our understandings of science and technology; make visible the
assumptions, values, and ethical dimensions of science and engineering
practices; and push the interdisciplinary field of STS in new directions. The
proposed workshop will also advance a new wave of new scholarship and showcase
and make accessible some of the best STS scholarship by Latin American
academics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will engage members of the
Indiana University at Bloomington community with STS scholarship on Latin
America. More broadly, it will enhance infrastructure for research and education
by advancing the formation of an intellectual community dedicated to the study
of science and technology in Latin American contexts. It will benefit society by
providing information for science and technology policy formation once the
revised workshop papers are published. It will also broaden the participation of
underrepresented groups, since academics from Latin American institutions (and
North American scholars who study STS in the global south) are underrepresented
in the international STS community. The workshop findings will be compiled in an
edited volume, which will be distributed internationally by MIT Press.
