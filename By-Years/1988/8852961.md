This award will help fund the creation of a 12-station, computer- controlled
laboratory for the teaching of labs in Psychobiology, Hearing, Vision, Human
Information Processing, Statistics, and Research Methods in the Department of
Psychology at Loyola University of Chicago. The twelve stations will be
networked so that software can be shared among the stations and so each can
access the University's mainframe computer and the library's on- line data base.
All courses offered in the facility emphasize "hand-on" approaches to learning,
with students required to participate in the running of experiments, graphic
presentation of the data, and data analysis. The proposal seeks to expand and
supplement the existing facility, which has been used for Lab in Psychobiology,
Lab in Vision, and Lab in Hearing. Software will be acquired that turns each of
the twelve computer stations into a fully-functional laboratory, with four of
the stations equipped with measurement, signal-generation, and physiological
recording equipment necessary for the two sensory labs and Lab in Psychobiology.
The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal
sources.
