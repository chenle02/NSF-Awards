Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0406581&lt;br/&gt;Earl Dowell (Duke
Univ.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the annual International
Conference on Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics: Dynamics Dates 2004 to be held in
Chapel Hill, NC, on January 2-5, 2004. The conference have been an important and
productive activity to advance the growth of dynamic systems and control.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's program will bring selected undergraduates
into this conference, thus providing an lead-in to such young students in this
vast, challenging engineering field.&lt;br/&gt;
