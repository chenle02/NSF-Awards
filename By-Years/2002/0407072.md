AST-0407072&lt;br/&gt;Klypin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the so-
called crisis in cosmology on small scales, using satellites of isolated
galaxies, galaxies in nearby voids, and detailed models of rotation curves.
Combining the analysis of observations with theory, methods will be used that
complement and expand the traditional approach. A full scale Bayesian
probabilistic analysis of satellite galaxy kinematics, using the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey data, will probe the (mainly dark matter) mass distribution in the
peripheral regions of isolated galaxies. A related part of the crisis, the
galaxy content of nearby voids, will be analyzed with shallow samples over a
large magnitude range, which will then be compared with cosmological
simulations. Finally, the accuracy of the reconstruction of mass profiles from
rotation curves must depend on galaxy type, and small variations can
significantly mar the mass estimates. Therefore, the present research includes
the production of publicly available models of disk galaxies embedded in
realistic cosmological dark matter halos. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent is to
raise the quality and reliability of results coming from satellite dynamics, and
along the way train two female graduate students and provide catalogs and
numerical models to the entire community.
