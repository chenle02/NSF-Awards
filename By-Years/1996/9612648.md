occurring through out the world, led by the United States. Very little is
understood about the social, economic and industrial implications of this

investment and application decisions; and data of value to policy makers in
guiding and controlling this explosive growth. This planning grant is studying
the economic viability of forming an Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Information Technology and Organizations at the University of
California, Irvine. The research projects to be proposed for industrial support
in the proposed Center are: Online Information Resources and Interorganization
Relationships; Computers and Multimedia: The Impact on American Households;
Business Value of Information Technology; A Cost-Benefit Investigation of
Groupware Usage by Financial Statement Auditors; Information Technology and
Organizational Form; Enhancing End User Computing for Knowledge; Mapping
Organizational Memory; Deployment of IT for Competitive Advantage; Scheduling
and Patters of Meetings in large Organizations; High-Level Requirements Analysis
for Information Systems Design.
