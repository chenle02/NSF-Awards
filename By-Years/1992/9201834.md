A hierarchy of lead-free solders are scientifically designed using
thermodynamic calculations of ternary and quaternary phase diagrams. Metal
elements under consideration include Sn, Sb, Cu, Ag, Bi, Zn, Al, In, and Au.
Solders are processed and analyzed for the phases present. Wettability,
mechanical strength, and fatigue properties are measured. An iterative approach
is taken to assist in the materials selection. In a later phase promising
solders will be investigated with the assistance of electronic device
manufacturers with funding from industry. %%% This research is aimed at creating
lead-free solders for industry/environmental improvement. Processing and
reliability of the solders are addressed.
