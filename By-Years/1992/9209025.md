This project investigates image signatures which are compact representation of
images. The research focuses on the investigation of different neural network
architectures, such as backpropagation or cascade-correlation, for their
capability to generate image signatures. The project is based on two ideas. One
idea is to use the notion of atomic images (images containing one object) and
their corresponding atomic signatures, as well as composite images (images
containing more than one object) and their composite signatures. Another idea is
to train neural networks on atomic images and/or their signatures and then to
have such networks to recognize arbitrary composition of atomic images and/or
their signatures. The results of this research will form the foundations for an
efficient access of images in databases and retrieval of images by their
content.
