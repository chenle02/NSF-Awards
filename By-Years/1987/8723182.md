The general focus of this work is on the microscopic description of nuclear
properties. While nuclei have many degrees of freedom, only a few are important
in describing available experimental data, such as low-lying excitation spectra.
The theorist must determine which degrees are important and why. Here the focus
is on nuclear collective motion, for bosonic degrees of freedom (interacting
boson model model-IBM and fermion degrees of freedom (nuclear shell model).
Proposed research efforts include (1) an analysis of exact shell-model
calculations for various systems to resolve questions concerning the suitability
of the S and D pair approach to describing nuclear structure, (2) determination
of the 0(6) classical limit of the IBM, (3) improved determination of the IBM
parameter valves, (4) investigations of beta decay within the IBM, and (5)
extensions of the scheme to odd-A nuclei.
