This project investigates the computational conformal geometric methods applied
for computer vision. The research team develops novel algorithms for shape
analysis, surface matching and registration based on Ricci flow, and compared
with conventional vision methods thoroughly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic of
idea of the research is to conformally deform all surfaces as one of three
canonical shapes, and then perform matching and registering these 3D surfaces in
2D planes. The research team uses the Ricci for shape analysis to preserve the
intrinsic geometric characteristics, and to map the surfaces to the canonical
shapes.. Ricci flow is the process to deform the metric proportional to the
curvature, such that the curvature evolves according to a heat diffusion
process. The research team conducts thoroughly comparison with conventional
vision methods through extensive experiments using real world datasets. The
research benefits many computer vision and visualization applications with
methods for computing and visualizing conformal structures and conformal
invariants on surfaces. The project also provides opportunity for training
students in the areas of differential geometry, hyperbolic geometry, Riemannian
geometry, computer vision.&lt;br/&gt;
