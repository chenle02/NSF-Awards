This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic chemistry program
supports research in the laboratory of Dr. James A. Larrabee at Middlebury
College under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) initiative. Dr.
Larrabee's research group will investigate coupled binuclear cobalt complexes as
models for the active site in methionine amino peptidase (MAP). Variable-
temperature, variable-field magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) will be used to
probe the ground state electronic structure of this recently discovered enzyme.
Zero-field splitting and magnetic exchange constants will be determined for
model compounds and protein systems. Since substrate molecules may bind across
the cobalt ions, changes in metal-metal exchange coupling may be important in
the functioning of the enzyme. An unusual cobalt-cobalt active site in a newly
discovered enzyme, methionine amino peptidase, will be probed by magnetic
circular dichroism. These spectroscopic studies will be carried on model
compounds and other proteins, which have a dinuclear cobalt site substituted
into them. Comparisons between the model compounds, theoretical models and the
actual enzyme will be made in order to understand the functioning of the active
site in the enzyme.
