This award creates a new NSF REU site focused on climate change and sea level
rise (SLR) within the Department of Ocean, Earth and Atmospheric Science (OEAS)
at Old Dominion University (ODU), in Norfolk, VA. ODU is located in a coastal
urban environment that is directly affected by coastal flooding and hazards. The
PI's will bring 10 students to OEAS each summer for two years to complete a 10
week REU program. Students will be engaged in research projects in the
laboratories of their mentors. To garner a broader understanding of climate
science and SLR, students will be informed with lectures from each mentor on
their respective research related to urban climate change and SLR and a variety
of lab tours and field trips. The PI's will also conduct tutorials on: 1)
keeping a proper laboratory notebook, 2) writing a research prospectus, 3)
critically reading journal articles, 4) creating effective presentations, and 5)
delivering oral and written (e.g., poster) scientific presentations. Students
will present their research in a final paper and a symposium.
