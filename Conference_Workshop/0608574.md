The proposed conference brings together world-class researchers from biology,
mechanics, applied mathematics and computational science. It provides an
excellent and unique opportunity for scientific discussions, stimulating
interactions, and initiating collaborations in the exciting interdisciplinary
research area.

The focus of the conference will contribute to the much needed enhancement of
the quantitative research on biological phenomena. The conference program will
provide opportunities for interdisciplinary training at the interface among
biology, mechanics, applied mathematics and computational science for graduate
students and young researchers. Given that UCI is designated as a Minority
Institution by the U.S. Department of Education together with the conference
organizers strong commitment to diversity programs, the proposed conference will
have a substantial impact on the training of female and underrepresented
minority students.
