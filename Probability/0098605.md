0098605 Kuelbs The program is designed to stimulate and encourage the scientific
development of young researchers in the areas of probability and stochastic
processes. The participants will spend the summer together in Madison, Wisconsin
in day-to-day interaction with senior researchers from the University of
Wisconsin as well as with senior visitors. Participants will benefit from access
to the major research library and other research facilities at the University,
opportunities to establish continuing contacts and collaboration with other
participants in the program, and advice and support in developing long term
research programs. The Summer 2001 program will focus on the study of
probabilities of both large and small deviations in random systems, in 2002 the
program will be devoted to shapes, waves, and interfaces generated by spatial
interactions, and in 2003 the focus will involve spatial processes and
stochastic geometry. Each of these programs will begin with survey lectures in
the given areas of focus by experts from the U.S. and abroad. Three such lecture
series are typically planned to begin each program, with each series consisting
of five to eight hours of material. After the opening lectures there are follow
up lectures on related material, and additional talks by participants, visitors,
and local experts. In addition to the lectures, the intern program seeks to
generate interactions between senior faculty and participants, as well as those
between the participants themselves. These interactions can take the form of
study groups, small group discussions, and sometimes one on one discussions. The
program lasts about eight weeks.
