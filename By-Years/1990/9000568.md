The principal investigator will study the global properties of almost periodic
systems, stability and periodic solutions in the elliptic restricted three body
problem, and generalizations of the Sternberg-Moser normalization theorem.
Additionally he will investigate chaotic and stable behavior of almost periodic
trajectories. The starting point for these studies will be normal form theory
for the Lagrange equilibrium point of the three body problem. Roughly between
the Earth and the Moon lies two so called Lagrange points. These are stable
points where it is believed bits of matter have accumulated. The investigator
will search for other such points as well as for chaotic trajectories.
Information concerning these locations in space should prove valuable to human
exploration of the Moon and planets.
