EIA-0223737&lt;br/&gt;Soffa, Mary L.&lt;br/&gt;Univ of
Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group Travel Grant For Faculty at Minority
Institutions to Attend FSE-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, supporting
travel by faculty from institutions with a large minority or female enrollment,
represents an effort to improve the representation of women and minorities in
CS. Organized by the ACM SIGSOFT, the Conference on the Foundations of Software
Engineering (FSE-10), will be held in Charleston, South Carolina, November
20-22, 2002. Its organizing committee for 2002 developed a plan to help increase
the participation of faculty from institutions with a large minority and/or
female student enrollment. Faculty actively involved with the education of women
and minorities will be invited to attend FSE-10 tutorials and conference.
Institutions that include Historically Black Colleges, current and former
women's colleges, and other colleges with large minority enrollments will be
targeted. As part of the tutorial series, tutorials will be provided for the
selected faculty that contribute in teaching and stimulating interests in
software engineering. The effort is expected to transitively develop the
student's interest.&lt;br/&gt;
