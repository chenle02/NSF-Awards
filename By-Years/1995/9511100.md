Crime and violence have pervasive impacts on the development of America's human
capital. The fear, disruption of activities, physical mayhem, and financial
losses that they produce clearly reduce the productivity of the workforce, limit
the effectiveness of our schools, destroy our families, weaken our
neighborhoods, increase disadvantage, and pose the most serious threat to those
plagued by poverty and deprivation. The development of a scientific
understanding of the causes and consequences of crime and violence, how to
prevent them, protect their victims, and justly punish their perpetrators should
be a top public priority. Media coverage of crime tends to be sensationalistic
and episodic, focusing on crimes that are heavily laden with violence and/or
racial elements. The increasingly sensationalistic tendencies of the mass media
and continued racial divisions within American society have fueled public debate
over the meaning of crime and the appropriate social responses. This study the
links between media coverage of crime and attitudes about race and attitudes
about violence. The general premise is that race-related considerations play an
important role in the public's understanding of crime and that these
considerations account for the general shift toward a punitive and retributive
orientation. A set of experimental manipulations of TV news stories is designed
to examine their impact and focus of public attention. Two classes of
explanations are distinguished in these experiments. The first rests on the
pattern of news coverage. The second set rests on effect of longstanding racial
stereotypes in addition to racial cues provided by the media on public
interpretation of the news.
