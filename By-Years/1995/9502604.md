Barbara Wyslouzil is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental studies of binary
nucleation along thermodynamically unfavored paths. The thermodynamically
favored path for nucleation crosses the free energy surface through the saddle
region with the lowest free energy. However, the combined effect of the monomer
impingement rates and the shape of the free energy surface can drive the flux
over a ridge in a miscible binary system. The flux can also be driven through
the saddle with the higher free energy in a partially miscible system. In both
cases, the analytical theories based on a saddle crossing will not predict the
correct nucleation rate behavior. The proposed work has two goals: 1) to
identify real chemical systems and conditions where binary nucleation proceeds
primarily along a thermodynamically unfavored path; and 2) to design and conduct
experiments that clearly demonstrate binary nucleation can occur in this manner.
The experimental part of this project will use a two pulse expansion cloud
chamber to conduct nucleation rate measurements. Careful modeling of particle
formation processes in the chamber, together with knowledge of the composition
of the critical nucleus, should make it possible to distinguish whether
nucleation has followed the thermodynamically favored path. The deliberate
enhancement or suppression of the formation of a thermodynamically favored phase
is important in many fields of engineering. In material science for example,
processes which produce submicron ceramic particles by vapor phase nucleation
from a volatile precursor can lead to materials with lower sintering
temperatures over conventionally produced ceramic powders. In the chemical
processing industry the rates of nucleation, growth and recrystallization affect
the purity, quality, and sales value of bulk products such as common as sugar
and salt as well as specialty products such as zeolites. In metallurgy,
different and potentially useful forms of metals may be produced if large
undercoolings are achieved without nucleation of a crystal phase. A better
molecular level understanding of the nucleation could have a potentially large
impact on chemical processing in a large number of manufacturing areas.
