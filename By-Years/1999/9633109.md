Reflection has been explored in an interpreted framework and has tended to
assume the availability of particular pieces of the state of a program's
interpretation, even the current source code expression. Instead of programs,
this research emphasizes computations as the primary elements of reflection. The
research has two facets. The first is to formalize and continue the theoretical
development of a system for computational reflection that is free from
interpreter-based constraints. This system supports the introduction of multiple
user-defined reflective properties that can be designed independently and
combined in arbitrary fashion. Furthermore, new reflective properties can be
introduced after the programs in which they are to be used have already been
compiled. The second facet is to explore the many uses of such a system. In
addition to the simple, but powerful, uses already explored, the system is
expected to be useful for rapid prototyping of language features, collaborative
software development, and static analysis of programs for intense optimization.
Prior research in programming with first-class contexts has investigated the
meaning and use of static meta-level contextual information. The word static
here is intended to refer to that information available in the text of a
program, without running it. The current research extends the previous work by
exploring the meaning and use of dynamic meta-level contextual information,
which is that information available in the meta-level of a running process. As
in the previous work, this project emphasizes modularity, allowing many
different kinds of meta-level knowledge to be utilized simultaneously. ***
