This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5) and funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY
2009. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Integrating
genome-wide polymorphism and satellite remote sensing data to explore patterns
of adaptive genetic variation" for Adam Freedman. The host institution for this
research is the University of California Los Angeles, and the sponsoring
scientist is John Novembre.

Understanding the causes of spatial genetic variation is central to
understanding the process of evolutionary diversification as well as the extent
to which human activities are altering patterns of biodiversity. Because
environment can play a large role in genetic differentiation among populations,
methods for establishing the link between genetic and environmental variation
are of great interest to evolutionary biologists. This research identifies
variation in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) detected in wild populations
of an Afrotropical lizard, in order to detect selection on and identify linked
candidate genes. Secondly, this research employs recently-developed spatial
analysis methods to identify the environmental gradients underlying variation in
these genes.

Training goals include laboratory shotgun sequencing and the computational
methods for handling large data sets. Broader impacts include providing a
framework for whole-genome analysis in non-model organisms to elucidate the
mechanisms that permit species to adapt in the face of global climate change.
The results of this work are being broadly disseminated through publication in
peer-reviewed journals, at scientific meetings, and briefings directly to
policymakers, government agencies, and non-governmental conservation
organizations.
