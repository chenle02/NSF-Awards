It is proposed to conduct a research program featuring a concept for treating
structural engineering problems involving structures with uncertain (random)
properties and loads. The proposed concept hinges upon the approximate
representation of random processes describing the material properties or the
structural loads by a finite number of random variables. This will be
accomplished using the classical concepts of the Karhunen-Loeve and the
Polynomials Chaos expansions. In the proposed program, these expansions will be
incorporated into spatial discretizations of structural elements such as beams
and plates, in accordance with standard finite element procedures.
