This award funds a series of workshops that will be hosted by the University of
Minnesota in collaboration with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. The
workshops bring together junior and senior researchers to concentrate on
theoretical issues in macroeconomics and dynamic economic modeling. Young
researchers use the workshops as an opportunity to get feedback on preliminary
research and also form new collaborations. The research presented focuses on
fundamental questions facing macroeconomic policy makers, including the design
of the tax system, monetary policy, and the role of social
insurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each summer's topics are chosen by an organizing
committee coordinated by the Principal Investigators. Topics may include debt
and international lending, heterogeneity and inequality, labor market behavior,
health and social insurance, financial markets, technology and firm dynamics,
development and financial inteagration, monetary policy, fiscal policy, long run
growth, and macroeconomic consequences of contracting frictions.
