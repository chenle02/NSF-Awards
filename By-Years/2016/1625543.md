With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and
support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor
Tong Ren from Purdue University and colleagues Matthias Zeller and Suzanne Bart
have acquired a single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a molybdenum
source. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise
measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including
bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial
arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. These studies
impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as
well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in
chemistry and biochemistry at this institution that awards one of the largest
number of PhD degrees in the country. The X-ray facility has a tradition of
providing data collection and structure solution services for faculty and
students from small colleges (PUIs) in the surrounding area. The diffractometer
allows this courtesy to remain and be expanded. Finally, building on Purdue's
ongoing efforts of making modern research instrumentation available at K-12
levels through the Purdue Science Express Program, the use of X-ray diffraction
for K-12 educational purposes is being explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award
is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas
such as (a) synthesizing conjugated metal acetylides, (b) studying
organometallic chemistry of uranium complexes, (c) designing, preparing and
investigating single-site catalysts used in green and sustainable chemistry
transformations, (d) synthesizing bioactive molecules, (e) designing new HIV-1
protease inhibitors and (f) synthesizing highly reactive radical species.
