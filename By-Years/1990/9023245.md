This award supports Dr. J. Bruce Overmier of the University of Minnesota for a
long term visit to work with Drs. Robert Murison and Holger Ursin of the
Institute of Physiological Psychology of the University of Bergen, Norway. These
individuals share an interest in the effects of stress on the behavioral,
physiological and immunological functioning of an animal. Dr. Overmier's primary
area of research has been in behavioral experimental psychology and defensive
conditioning, while Dr. Murison's has been in physiological psychology and Dr.
Ursin's in medicine and stress. The research they propose to carry out
collaboratively requires that each become familiar with the other's areas and
that they adopt an integrative approach to the psychobiology of stress. It has
been well demonstrated that stress has a wide variety of effects upon the
funcioning of an animal. In addition, exposure to a prior stressor can have
either an ameliorative or a sensitizing influence upon the response to a second
stressor. It is important to determine the explicit conditions under which such
prior exposures have these two different influences and whether these conditions
are the same or different for the behavioral, physiological, and immunological
systems. These three lines of research are pursued in this collaboration.
