The overall goal of this project is to develop flexible topological methods
which will allow the analysis of data which is difficult to analyze using
classical linear methods. Data obtained by sampling from highly curved manifolds
or singular algebraic varieties in Euclidean space are typical examples where
our methods will be useful. We intend to develop and refine two pieces of
software which have been written by members of our research group, ISOMAP
(Tenenbaum) and PLEX (de Silva-Carlsson). ISOMAP is a tool for dimension
reduction and parameterization of high dimensional data sets, and PLEX is a
homology computing tool which we will use in locating and analyzing singular
points in data sets, as well as estimating dimension in situations where
standard methods do not work well. We plan to extend the range of applicability
of both tools, in the case of ISOMAP by studying embeddings into spaces with
non-Euclidean metrics, and in the case of PLEX by building in the Mayer-Vietoris
spectral sequence as a tool Both ISOMAP and PLEX will be adapted for parallel
computing. We will also begin the theoretical study of statistical questions
relating to topology. For instance, we will initiate the study of higher
dimensional homology of subsets sampled from Euclidean space under various
sampling hypotheses. The key object of study will be the family of Cech
complexes constructed using the distance function in Euclidean space together
with a randomly chosen finite set of points in Euclidean space.

The goal of this project is to develop tools for understanding data sets which
are not easy to understand using standard methods. This kind of data might
include singular points, or might be strongly curved. The data is also high
dimensional, in the sense that each data point has many coordinates. For
instance, we might have a data set whose points each of which is an image, which
has one coordinate for each pixel. Many standard tools rely on linear
approximations, which do not work well in strongly curved or singular problems.
The kind of tools we have in mind are in part topological, in the sense that
they measure more qualitative properties of the spaces involved, such as
connectedness, or the number of holes in a space, and so on. This group of
methods has the capability of recognizing the number of parameters required to
describe a space, without actually parameterizing it. These methods also have
the capability of recognizing singular points (like points where two non-
parallel planes or non-parallel lines intersect), without actually having to
construct coordinates on the space. We will also be further developing and
refining methods we have already constructed which can actually find good
parameterizations for many high dimensional data sets. Both projects will
involve the adaptation for the computer of many methods which have heretofore
been used in by-hand calculations for solving theoretical problems. We will also
initiate the theoretical development of topological tools in a setting which
includes errors and sampling.
