Computational algebraic geometry is the study of efficient ways to manipulate
solution sets of algebraic equations on a computer. The origins of the field,
starting from Buchberger’s algorithm in the 60’s, focused on exact computations
on polynomial equations with integer coefficients. The goal of this research is
to study computations on polynomial equations with real and complex number
coefficients from a modern computational perspective. This research is inspired
by the emerging applications of multivariate polynomials (with real
coefficients) in engineering, and has its roots in basic questions of complexity
theory. The educational component of the research includes training of
undergraduate students from different disciplines, creation of a student-
accessible research seminar, and development of multiple undergraduate and
graduate courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the large
discrepancy between practical performance of algorithms on real polynomials and
the worst-case-based complexity estimates from computational algebraic geometry.
The investigator aims to develop average-case upper bounds for complexity of
sparse polynomial system solving over the real and complex numbers, upper bounds
for the complexity of multivariate polynomial based algorithms on random
networks, and average-case lower bounds for convex programming based approaches
to algebraic computations. Progress made in this project will benefit
applications of polynomial computations with numerical data, and develop
foundations of average-case complexity theory for polynomial computations on
real and complex numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
