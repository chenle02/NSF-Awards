A peptide called Neuropeptide Y has been known for some time to be present in
brain and peripheral nerves of vertebrates, including in nerve fibers
innervating the pancreas. It has been reported to have a number of actions,
including effects on insulin release from the pancreas (islets of Langerhans).
An analog of Neuropeptide Y, known as "aPY", has been characterized and was
found to be synthesized as a precursor, pro-aPY, in one cell type of the
anglerfish islets of Langerhans. (The anglerfish islets are an ideal
experimental system for these studies because they are anatomically distinct
structures in contrast to other vertebrates where the islet tissue is mingled
with tissue of the exocrine pancreas.) A distinct form of Neuropeptide Y-like
peptide has been identified in peripheral nerves present in the anglerfish
islets. The objectives of the proposed research are: 1. To determine whether aPY
is amidated (Amidation is necessary for maintainance of biological activity of
many peptide mediators.) and, if so, to determine the characteristics of the
enzyme responsible. 2. To determine the primary structure of the Neuropeptide
Y-like peptide found in the islet neuronal tissue. 3. To determine the
neurotransmitter in the neuronal processes that contain the neuronal form of
Neuropeptide Y. 4. To study the effects of Neuropeptide Y, aPY, and the neuronal
Neuropeptide Y-like peptides on islet hormone release. The results will provide
the first information about the biologically active, distinct forms of
Neuropeptide Y-like peptides from islet cells and from peripheral nerve fibers
present in the islets, about the neurotransmitters which may be released
coordinately with the peptides , and the roles of cellular and neuronal forms of
NPY-like peptides in regulating insulin release from the islets.
