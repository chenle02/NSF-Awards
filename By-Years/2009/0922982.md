&lt;br/&gt;This three-year grant will purchase two pieces of equipment for
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain at the California Institute of
Technology. One equipment piece provides the best resolution in a horizontal
orientation; the second provides imaging of behaving monkeys in vertical
position. This will provide state-of-the-art tools for investigating brain
structure and function in monkeys with noninvasive methods, and also provide
opportunities for imaging post-mortem human brains. The technology will make
possible a set of research studies on how the brain processes information,
including how it sees faces, how it weighs different choices, and how it makes
decisions and guides action. These are important questions in neuroscience, and
the new equipment will greatly enhance science at the Caltech Brain Imaging
Center. The grant will also provide opportunities for training of students and
post-docs on the new equipment. This will include classes taught at Caltech as
well as participation in individual research projects. The development of these
new scientific tools will lead to a better understanding of how the brain works,
and how it is "wired up." That knowledge, in turn, will contribute to efforts to
build artificially intelligent systems. Taken together, the cutting-edge science
enabled by the new equipment, and the training of the next generation of young
scientists on it, will contribute substantially to cognitive neuroscience in
America and worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;
