This grant provides continued support for Project Upper Crust, a program of
enhanced retrieval and analysis of samples from the Precambrian basement of the
continental interior of the United States. The major scientific goals of Project
Upper Crust are to define the structure and composition of the lithosphere in
the continental interior of North America and to use that information to refine
models for the geotectonic development of the North American continent during
the early and middle Proterozoic. These goals will be implemented by
acquisition, curation, and distribution of samples from the buried Precambrian
basement that would normally be discarded at drill sites, including promotion of
increased sample sizes from many of the sites through collaborative cost-
sharing.
