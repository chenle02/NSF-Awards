Project FOCAL Point is a multi-strand project encompassing models that have been
shown to be effective in encouraging girls and young women in non-traditional
fields. Twenty high school computing teachers from Wisconsin and surrounding
areas will gather at the University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point for a two-week
summer workshop in which they will receive training in gender issues, electronic
communication, and information systems concepts. They will develop female-
friendly lessons to be piloted with high schools students in a following two-
week summer computer camp targeted for young women. University women serve as
mentors to the high school students during the summer session, as well as
teaching assistants. Gender related technology projects, funded through sub-
contracts to teacher participants, extend the impact of the project beyond the
immediate participants. All project participants are electronically connected to
a "virtual community of learners."
