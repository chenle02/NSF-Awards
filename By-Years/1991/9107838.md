The fish family Cichlidae, is a model system for the study of many biological
phenomena. Systematists, geneticists, ethologists, comparative and functional
morphologists have studied this family probably more than any other teleostean
group. The extraordinary adaptive radiation of cichlids in the East African Rift
Lakes make them an important subject for the study of morphology, speciation,
and sexual selection. Members of this family of fishes also live in Africa,
Central and South America, Madagascar and India. The general aim of this study
is to determine the systematic relationships among the major lineages of cichlid
fishes. Current phylogenetic hypotheses about this family and its sistergroup
relationships are exclusively based on morphological characters, but evidence of
morphological convergence suggests that it will be important to have independent
evidence of phylogeny. Recent advances in DNA technology have made it possible
to address phylogenetic questions of the scope proposed here with molecular
characters. Mitochondrial genes will be sequenced and the phylogenetic
information used to construct phylogenetic relationships among the major
lineages of cichlids.
