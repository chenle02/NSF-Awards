The project is developing new theoretical models for the formation of extrasolar
gas giant planets in different planet formation environments. The models follow
the growth of a planetary core in an evolving protoplanetary disk up to the
epoch when rapid gas accretion ensues yielding a giant planet. How fast growth
occurs depends upon the physical conditions in the protoplanetary disk
(temperature, density etc.), and on the mobility of planetary cores and
planetesimals which can migrate in orbital radius as a consequence of
gravitational torques from the disk. Multidimensional numerical simulations of
turbulent magnetized disks are used to characterize this mobility, and the
results incorporated into one-dimensional time-dependent models for planetary
growth via core accretion. The timescale for the growth of gas giant planets is
being evaluated in different environments, for example around stars of different
masses and metallicities. These theoretical estimates of planetary growth times
may be compared to observational determinations of protoplanetary disk lifetimes
to predict how the frequency of massive planet formation varies across disk
environments. Existing observations are used to constrain the models, while the
broader predictions will be testable using data from forthcoming ground and
space-based searches for extrasolar planets.
