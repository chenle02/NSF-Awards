There has been a lack of reliable information on the magnitude and polarity of
the electric charges being carried by various kinds and sizes of precipitation
particles. Although microphysical measurements have been made frequently from
research aircraft, concerns for safety preclude routine flights in electric
storms. An alternative is to use instrumented balloons. Scientists at the
National Severe Storms Laboratory have recently been quite successful with
balloon launches from a mobile balloon facility, even in high winds. Under this
award, Dr. Rust will modify existing designs of particle size and charge
instruments and an electric field meter for balloon use. He will fly these
instrumented balloons in Oklahoma during the spring severe storm season. The
measurements will be extremely important to the examination of existing
hypotheses on charge separation in thunder clouds. //
