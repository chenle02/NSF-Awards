This project is awarded under the program: Career Advancement Awards for Women
Scientists and Engineers. The Principal Investigator will travel to the Tree
Ring Research Laboratory at the University of Arizona (Tucson) to be trained in
the latest analysis techniques that can be applied to fossil material. The
paleoclimate information that is obtained from this analysis will be correlated
with data from sedimentological and floristic work high southern latitudes
during the Triassic and Permian. This work will facilitate a comparison of
paleoclimate models which are based primarily on physical data with data from
plant biology and growth.
