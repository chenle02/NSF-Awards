Technologies, especially computer-based assistive technologies, hold promise of
enabling people with disabilities to participate more and more effectively in
social life. Realization of this promise depends upon the development of
appropriate policies as well. This conference will address the range of issues
-- ethical, social, economic and technical -- necessary to fashioning effective
disability technology policies. The approach is to identify these issues through
a structured discussion involving leading disability and technology scholars and
practitioners and then to expand the discussion to involve "grass roots" service
providers, consumers, and activists. The first day of the conference is devoted
to presentation of papers and discussion among the small group of invited
partipants. On the second day, the workshop will merge with the annual
conference of the Resource Center for Independent Living in Utica. RCIL is a
member of the National Special Education Alliance and an important provider of
services for disabled persons in New York State. Funds from NSF will be used to
support some administrative and organizational conference costs, as well as the
participation of eleven invited scholars and practitioners. Results will be
widely disseminated in appropriate journals and professional meetings. Efforts
will continue after the conference, through the Project on Disability Technology
Policy of the SUNY Institute of Technology. This proposal is a modest request
for support to enable leading scholars and practitioners to begin to address
more deeply and directly issues of equity and access to technologies for
disabled persons. The principal investigators and project associates are well
qualified; institutional support is very good; the conference plans are good and
integrated appropriately with related activities; dissemination is likely to be
broad and to reach a wide range of audiences. Support is highly recommended.
