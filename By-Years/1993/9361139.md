9361139 Shaffer In the near future, our children will make choices that will
significantly change all life on earth. Thus, it is imperative that they obtain
a coherent overview of how the biosphere operates and of how they are
participants in that operation. A fascination for children of all ages and
attitudes, Closed-Ecological-Systems (CES)--developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory for Life- Support Studies and further researched for the past two
decades at the University of Hawaii--are a gallon-sized simplified analogue of
the biosphere that will autonomously recycle its elements and support life for
decades. While CES, which are considered authentic "mini-planets," have obvious
instructional value concerning global ecologic topics, currently marketed CES
novelties are static and of limited usefulness. This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to investigate the feasibility of
developing a specialized interactive CES- photobioreactor containing shrimp-
algae and even fish-plant ecosystems and incorporating accurate but inexpensive
instrumentation; accompanied by defined media; experimental protocols; and short
instructional text modules to serve as a supplemental educational aid applicable
to grades K-12. The project has the potential to contribute a hands-on approach
to explore a variety of major ecologic principles from the simple to the
sophisticated and to offer the educator a vehicle for which to introduce related
environmental subjects. ***
