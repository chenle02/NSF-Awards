9522208 Butler The current research involves planning activities that will lead
to a subsequent proposal for funding of the research to develop an incipient
fault detection and predictive maintenance method for power distribution
systems. The major objective of the planning activities is the development of
the architectural framework for the incipient fault detection and prediction
scheme. Also a scheme for predicting the useful remaining life of transformers
will be developed. Then the appropriateness of extending this methodology to
other distribution equipment will be shown. Also a thorough literature review of
existing distribution predictive maintenance systems will be written.
Mathematical techniques utilizing approximate and detailed models, expert
systems and neural networks will be employed to develop the transformer
remaining life prediction scheme. The development of this scheme is significant
because transformer failure can be catastrophic and expensive. ***
