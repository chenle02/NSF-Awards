Sea Education Association will underake a Research in Undergraduate Institutions
(RUI) instrumentation acquisition project as described in NSF document
instrumentation will be placed in a pool of shared use equipment and made
available to students and visiting users of the Associa- tion's new Sailing
School Vessel, the SSV CORWITH CRAMER. The vessel will be used for undergraduate
education and research through SEA's ongoing programs. The new instrumentation
will upgrade educational programs by enabling students to have pract- ical,
hands-on experience with modern oceanographic instrumenta- tion, and will
provide visiting scientists with a well equipped facility for conducting
research. Requested instrumentation are basic to physical, biological, chemical,
and geological oceanographic investigations and commonly found on many research
vessels.
