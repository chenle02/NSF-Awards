This is an equipment request to upgrade an existing Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE)
Facility. The existing system (Varian 360, 1980 vintage) lacks many of the
features that considered necessities to sustain a state of the art crystal
capability. The proposed upgrade includes computer controlled effusion cells, a
rapid pumping system, residual gas analyzer, cracking effusion cell for arsenic
and high temperature cell for dopants, and new electronics for a Hall Effect
system. These improvements are necessary to maintain our continued productivity
and to be sure that the graduate students are versed in state of the art crystal
growth technology.
