Most coding schemes developed in network information theory are combinations of
a handful of basic components using Shannon's random coding technique. With the
goal of advancing our understanding of these random coding schemes and making
them applicable in practice, this research explores three important problems in
network information theory. First, this project investigates the simultaneous
decoding rule that is easy to analyze, yet powerful enough to achieve the
maximum achievable rates of random coding over interference channels. Second,
this project applies the insights thus gained on random coding and simultaneous
decoding to the index coding problem, in which multiple messages are
communicated through a single, noise-free link to multiple receivers with
different pieces of side information. Third, this project develops a
concatenated coding architecture based on random coding, product codes, and
iterative decoding that can provide a systematic method for translating random
coding schemes to practical, implementable coding techniques for real-world
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing an ever-increasing role in our networked
society, network information theory studies the fundamental limits on
information flow over networks and the optimal coding techniques, protocols, and
architectures that achieve these limits. This research investigates canonical
problems in network information theory that involve interference and broadcast,
offering fresh insights and new mathematical tools for optimal information flow
in several important applications such as network coding, wireless
communication, peer-to-peer networking, and content broadcasting. The
concatenated coding architecture developed in this research has potential to
provide a new framework for transforming theoretical concepts in network
information theory into practical algorithms for applications.
