A dusty plasma, containing negatively charged, micron sized, dust grains in
addition to the Usual collection of ions and electrons, is studied using a
Q-machine modified to levitate the dust grains. The laboratory work focuses on
the steady state properties of the dusty plasma, waves in the dusty plasma and
plasma instabilities created by the dust grains.
