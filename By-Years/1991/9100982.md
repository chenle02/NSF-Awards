The Geology Departments of Bryn Mawr College, Bucknell University, Lafayette
College, and Lehigh University propose to form a consortium that fosters
undergraduate geologic research in Pennsylvania. Important research
opportunities in subjects as diverse as tectonics and hydrogeology are available
in Pennsylvania for students from these and other high-quality institutions. The
program will foster cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary studies as
students work closely with one or more faculty mentors. Not only will the
program provide research experience and career guidance to undergraduate geology
majors, but we also expect that significant advances in our understanding of
Pennsylvania geology will result from the coordinated undergraduate research
activities.
