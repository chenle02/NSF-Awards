This award will support students at U.S. institutions to attend the Workshop on
Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2017). HotMobile,
sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE, will be held in February, 2017 in Sonoma, CA.
HotMobile 2017 is an important workshop targeting mobile computing and system
integration fields and attending this event will benefit the scientific progress
of the student's research. The exposure to the technical content of HotMobile
2017 will inspire students to address the tough problems in their respective
fields, with a long-term benefit of scientific advances in these types of
networks.

Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this
workshop, but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel
funding. In addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in
networking research will be strongly encouraged. Up to fourteen students will
receive travel grants from this award to attend HotMobile 2017.
