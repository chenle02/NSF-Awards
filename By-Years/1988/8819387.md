In this project in the Theortetical and Computational PhysicalChemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Berry will calculate the behavior of few-body
systems at the atomic level. The work will examine vibration-rotation states of
small molecules and freezing and melting in clusters of molecules. Electron
correlation in atoms, especially the determination of the best approximate
quantum numbers for particular states, will be quantified. The dynamics of
highly excited rotation- vibration states will be used to predict spectra
involving large amplitude motion and nonrigid behavior. Analysis of how chaos
and ergodicity develop as functions of energy will be examined during solid-
liquid phase changes in small clusters.
