Dr. Merritt and his collaborators will use the special-purpose hardware GRAPE to
run direct N-body simulations with roughly a million particles, to study the
motion of stars and of less massive black holes in a cusp around the Milky Way's
central black hole, a few million times as massive as the Sun. This will be the
first set of simulations that can represent each star near the Galactic center
by a single particle. The simulations will use a new regularization scheme to
follow stars that make close approaches to each other or to the black hole; this
is adapted to handle extreme mass ratios between the approaching particles, and
includes some relativistic effects. The code will be used to investigate how an
intermediate-mass black hole of about 10,000 times the Sun's mass would affect
the orbits of nuclear stars, and the build-up of the central supermassive black
hole, as it spiraled inwards. The simulations will be used to test models for
the origin and dynamical evolution of the observed stellar disks on scales below
a parsec. Finally, the team will model relaxation of the stellar orbits in the
vicinity of the central black hole, which controls how fast stars are nudged
onto orbits from which the black hole will swallow them.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will be carried out with international
collaborators in Europe and Israel, as well as colleagues and students at the
Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The 'GRAPE group' of undergraduates and
master's students from computer science and other disciplines will work on the
visualization software. Dr Merritt will also work with the National Technical
Institute for the Deaf on the RIT campus to attract deaf students into the GRAPE
group.
