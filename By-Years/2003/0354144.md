Institution: Columbus State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0354144&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mei Yang&lt;br/&gt;Title: REU Site: Research Experiences
for Undergraduates - Emerging Issues in Computer
Networking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes an REU site for eight
undergraduates yearly for two years to conduct research in computer networking.
Research topics will include switch scheduling, QoS in networking, wireless
applications, network security, grid computing, and web services. In addition to
the summer, fulltime research internships, a unique feature of this proposed
project is an independent study course for one to three credit hours for
students in the Spring semester before they begin their internships. The course
will be guided by one of the summer faculty mentors, and will be designed to
help students develop an interest in one of the research topics offered in the
summer project. The PI will reach out to regional 2- and 4-year institutions to
recruit her interns, thus creating positive relationships among the higher
educational institutions in this rural region. &lt;br/&gt;
