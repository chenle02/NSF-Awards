Minimal surfaces are essential objects studied in differential geometry and
considered as the mathematical model of, for example, soap films. Being locally
area minimizing, they are quite special and have applications in various
domains, e.g., chemistry, materials science, biology, low dimensional topology
and mathematical physics. In general relativity, minimal surfaces appear as
models for the apparent horizons of black holes. In biology and material
science, minimal surfaces are used in the design of materials with key
applications. Recently, the PI used well-known notions about minimal surfaces to
explain some fundamental questions in topological data analysis which have
powerful applications in several fields in data science. In addition to this
research, the PI aims to focus on teaching and training of undergraduate and
graduate students as well as advancing the field by organizing seminars,
conferences and writing expository materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the project will study the existence and significant
properties of minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Hyperbolic 3-manifolds
are one of the most important families of manifolds in the low dimensional
topology. Unfortunately, as the topological understanding of these manifolds is
quite challenging, the study of minimal surfaces in this setting have not been
considered by those in geometric analysis for many years. Even though there are
several breakthrough results in geometric analysis in the past decade, minimal
surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds are still an uncharted territory, and many
fundamental questions are still open. In this project, the PI aims to completely
resolve the existence question of minimal surfaces in infinite volume hyperbolic
3-manifolds, and study one of Thurstonâ€™s famous conjectures about the minimal
foliations in closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
