9310413 Pazzani The objective of the proposed research are to investigate the
utility of algorithms that learn probabilistic relational concepts from noisy,
relational data, concentrating on algorithms that perform classification using
evidence combination. Of particular interest is the potential improvement in
classification accuracy that can be obtained if the reliability of rules is
taken into account. An additional objective is to extend noise-tolerant learning
algorithms to take advantage of incomplete or uncertain knowledge of the concept
to be learned. Such knowledge may be expressed as a partially incorrect or
incomplete domain theory. These algorithms will be tested on a number of data
sets from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning data sets and on three new
relational data sets involving spinal injury identification, mineral spectra
identification, and oil spill analysis. In addition, they will be tested on a
number of synthetic domains, where variation of parameters will allow insight
into the general behavior of these algorithms. The system HYDRA (Ali &amp;
Pazzani, 1993), which has already shown some promise on a limited number of data
sets will be significantly extended for these investigations.
