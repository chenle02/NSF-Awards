This award continues experimental and theoretical study of the constitutive
behavior of rock friction and its implications for understanding earthquake
instabilities. At present little fundamental understanding exists concerning the
micro-scale processes that are responsible for observed constitutive behavior.
The physical meaning of the state variables is unknown. Consequently,
extrapolation of laboratory results to time and length scales relevant to
earthquakes cannot be done with confidence. This research will focus on
discovering the fundamental micro-scale processes responsible for the observed
behavior and using this information to formulate constitutive descriptions with
a sound physical basis. The approach is to apply recent advances in the fields
of intermolecular and surface forces and subcritical crack growth to
understanding frictional resistance.
