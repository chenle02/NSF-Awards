This project will investigate techniques for the display of importance-varying
data in both two-and three-dimensional data domains. The approach to this
problem will emphasize consideration of a) the perceptual characteristics of
human viewers, b) dynamically manipulable display environments to increase the
number of variables that can be clearly displayed, and c) experimental
validation of the techniques developed. Portions of the project will be
conducted in collaboration with the researchers in application fields such as
meteorological monitoring, medical imaging, and public health decision-making.
Specific project objectives include construction of a survey of existing
importance visualization techniques, development of new techniques to represent
importance-varying data, comparison and validation of techniques identified or
developed, construction of a dynamic environment for the exploration of
importance-varying data and the development and dissemination of perceptual
principles for effective multivariate display.
