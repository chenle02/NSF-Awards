ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EF-0312459&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Batzoglou,
Serafim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal considers the problem of
computational folding and detection of noncoding RNA genes in DNA sequences. RNA
genes are among the most important biological features in DNA, but at the same
time they are very challenging to detect experimentally or computationally.
There is a significant body of work in algorithms and tools for folding and
detecting RNA genes. Their practical application is limited, however, because of
high computational demands. At the same time, recent advances in DNA sequencing,
such as the completion of the entire human, mouse, and rat genomes, suggest that
sequence comparison is a promising direction. Unfortunately, comparison-based
algorithms are considerably more time-consuming. The goal of this research is to
develop a framework, and a collection of individual algorithms and tools, for
efficient folding and detection of noncoding RNA genes. New algorithms that are
significantly more efficient than existing ones will be developed by exploring
the structural properties of RNA genes and excluding a large set of "unlikely
structures" from the search space of possible configurations. The added
efficiency will allow development of more accurate algorithms, practical
application at a whole-genome scale on the human genome, and development of
algorithms based upon sequence comparison. This research will help educate
students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Undergraduate students
through the CURIS undergraduate research program at the Computer Science
department will be part of the project, located at the Clark Center, which is
part of the BioX initiative whose goal is to foster cooperation across
disciplines such as biology and computer science, and to educate a new
generation of students that will be "bilingual" in computational and biological
sciences. Software will be disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;
