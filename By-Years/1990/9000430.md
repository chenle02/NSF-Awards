The high latitude plasma structure campaigns (HLPS) are aimed at the
understanding of the general morphology of ionization structures that are
observed in the high latitude polar cap thermosphere. Many of the different
phenomena that are studied are solar cycle dependent with some of the key
processes apparent only at solar maximum. Since the next few years are at the
peak of one of the largest solar activity cycles a unique opportunity exists to
study these phenomena with extensive coordinated observations at many different
polar locations with many different diagnostic instruments. This proposed
project will enable scientists to take full advantage of two recently installed
modern digital ionosondes (Digisonde) at two remote locations in Greenland
during HLPS campaigns in 1990 and 1991.
