Casts of the interiors of skulls (endocasts) of our early ancestors indicate the
volume and shape of their brains, and reproduce features of the cerebral cortex
that were imprinted on the walls of their braincases during life. These features
include convolutions, sulcal patterns, and blood vessels, which are sometimes
correlated with known functions such as speech and right-handedness in living
people. Endocasts are therefore useful for addressing questions about the
origins of certain behaviors. Skulls of important Pleistocene fossil hominids
are currently being CAT-scanned by an international team, and the resulting
three dimensional (3D) CT data are available for generating and measuring images
of endocranial surfaces from a computer screen. In order to validate use of
3D-CT to investigate brain surface morphology, a set of measurements will be
obtained and compared from 3D-CT images and the corresponding traditional
endocasts of several key hominid skulls. Additionally, the application of 3D
geometrical methods for analyzing endocasts will be explored in an ape and human
skull series. Once validated, these methods can be applied to new specimens,
leading to further insights about brain evolution.
