Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0428397&lt;br/&gt;PI: P. Pagilla&lt;br/&gt;Oklahoma State
Univ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term web is used to describe materials, which are
manufactured and processed in a continuous, flexible strip form. Examples
include plastics, paper, textiles, metals, and composites. A novel laser-based
fiber optic sensing system for monitoring and control of a web is developed in
this project. The sensing technique uniquely combines concepts from Doppler's
frequency shift of scattered light from the web edge, directional sensitivity
property of the optical fibers, and collimated laser light. This technical
integration will lead to the development of a versatile web sensing system that
can measure web lateral position, lateral velocity, transport velocity, flutter,
and profile. Since the sensing scheme uses the scattered light from the web
edge, the technique is equally suitable for use with transparent as well as
opaque web materials, which is not the case for existing web sensing methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is expected to advance the science
of web handling and sensor technology, and improve operation of web process
lines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project supported under Sensors
Initiative NSF 04-522&lt;br/&gt;
