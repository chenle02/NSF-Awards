In the proposed research we will develop methodologies and products for mapping
very large pieces of DNA by determining the overlapping relationships between
clones derived from a partial digest of the DNA. The method will create the
possibility of ordering end-to-end a large number of partial- digest cosmid
clones derived from segments of DNA as large as an entire human chromosome. The
proposed method involves crosshybridization of the inserts from a large number
of cosmid clones to each other independently in all combinations by applying
cloned DNA or probes generated from the clones to short pieces of thread. These
threads are subsequently woven in order into cloth. The intersection points of
the threads crossing each other in the cloth allows for discrete hybridization
of all cloned DNAs separately and independently to all probes generated from the
same set of clones and, therefore, allows for simultaneous determination of the
overlap between all clones in the set. The proposed method, if implemented,
would be very powerful for its intended purpose and would reduce the clone
ordering task into a simplified, standardized, and easily repeatable protocol.
In phase I work, we propose to try the method on the E.coli genome so that the
procedure can be verified and optimized before attempting an entire human
chromosome overlapping clone determination from a preexisting flow-sorted,
chromosome-specific library.
