9355558 Koopman The American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI) in 1990
initiated a program to enhance U.S. high school science education, establish new
links between high schools and biomedical investigators, and attract more
students into scientific careers. High school science teachers are provided a
stipend to work in the laboratory of an ASCI sponsor for 1-2 summers, during
which they receive instruction in state-of-the-art techniques in the context of
hands-on participation in a research project. Continued interaction throughout
the school year with ASCI sponsors, accomplished physician-scientists who are
excited about their work, is a central feature of the program. In addition,
teachers will attend workshops directed toward translating the summer research
experience into effective classroom activities and to train teachers to become a
training resource for their peers, especially minority teachers working in
schools with primarily minority/disadvantaged/underrepresented students.
Applications are judged upon the scientific merits of the proposal, the
motivation, leadership skills and qualifications of the teacher and ASCI
sponsor, support of the high school administration for the program, and the
impact that the teacher's participation is anticipated to have upon science
education at the local level. Follow-up reports are required from program
participants, and an external evaluation component has been established for
ongoing evaluation of the program. The ASCI funded the program itself in 1991
and is committed to providing ongoing support. In addition to seeking NSF
funding, the ASCI has secured and continues to seek funding from industry.
