9409513 Tasch This is an Engineering Deployment Teaching Initiative grant in the
field of compliant motion control and robotic assembly. MATLAB computer
simulations will be used to illustrate problems in robotic assembly, which
require high positioning accuracy and low contact forces. These are conflicting
requirements for conventional industrial robots. New actuators have been
proposed that solve these problems. These actuators independently control the
position and stiffness of a joint. To enhance the teaching of robotics, computer
simulations and graphical interfaces will be made available to students. This
activity is expected to lead to improved engineering education in the field of
robotics.
