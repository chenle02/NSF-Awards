Crop yield, responses to high CO2 in the atmosphere, and other aspects of plant
growth are partially limited and regulated by the transport of nutrients from
leaves to distant plants parts, such as roots and grain. The first step in this
process, and an important control point, involves loading sugar and other
nutrients into the long-distance transport tissue, the phloem. To date, two
phloem-loading mechanisms are known, both of which require metabolic energy. In
this project the investigators suggest that there is a third mechanism that does
not require energy, one that may be used by as many as half of all flowering
plants, especially trees. This could explain why some trees are able to use
additional atmospheric CO2 without feedback inhibition, which limits growth of
herbaceous crop plants under these conditions. The hypothesis will be tested by
genetically engineering poplar trees to inhibit active phloem loading. The
prediction is that, although such inhibitory treatments severely retard the
growth of plants that load actively, they will have little, if any, effect on
poplar. Methods of altering transport through the fine pores that connect plant
cells, and serve as conducting channels for virus movement, will also be
explored. Broader impacts include, 1) testing and potentially restructuring a
key tenet of plant nutrient transport, namely that energy is required to load
the phloem in preparation for export; 2) determining how some plants use
additional CO2 more effectively than others; and 3) potentially developing a
transgenic method of restricting virus movement across specific cellular
interfaces. Educational broader impacts include training exceptional
undergraduates for careers in science, leading a prison education program,
teaching a large introductory biology course for non-biology majors, and writing
scientific articles for the general public.
