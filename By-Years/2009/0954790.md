Objective: Detection and quantification of large numbers of proteins and
determination of their functions is fundamental to our understanding of cellular
physiology. Identification of interactions among large numbers of proteins is
also crucial for diagnostics of complex diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's
as well as for discovery of novel drugs. Although large-scale study of proteins
is significant due to such far-reaching implications, its realization is
challenging. The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate new bio-
detection systems for complete profiling of proteins ranging from identification
of their functions to multiplexed detection and kinetic analysis of proteins.

Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the
investigation of fundamentally new concepts in plasmonics and exploration of
plasmonic interactions in coupled and multi-layered metallic nanostructures for
the invention of powerful bio-detection platforms. To experimentally demonstrate
the introduced concepts, PI will also develop innovative fabrication schemes;
integrate nanophotonic detection systems with nanofluidics and bio-patterning.

Broader Impact: The proposed methodologies can be adapted to detect other
biological entities as well as chemicals and gases. Thus, the detection systems
explored in this project could find applications not only in biological sciences
but also in public health and national security. The proposed educational
activities will disseminate the developments in nanotechnology and research
results to the public and also increase the society's awareness on exciting new
challenges in engineering. To make a broader impact on public education, PI will
work with Boston?s Museum of Science. To reach women and underrepresented
minorities, PI will continue to contribute to the local educational programs
such as Boston Upward Bound Math and Science and Boston University?s Summer
Challenge program on engineering. For undergraduate education, PI will add
experimental modules to the new courses that she introduced for the recently
implemented nanotechnology concentration in Boston University College of
Engineering.
