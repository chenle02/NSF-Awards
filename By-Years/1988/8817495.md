Dr. Janice Moore requests support for a comparative study of behavioral changes
in host cockroach species caused by acanthocephalan worm parasites. Previous
studies have postulated that parasite-induced behavioral changes may increase
the probability of transmission of the worms to vertebrate hosts, raising the
possibility of adaptive significance of the behavioral changes. This project
will establish the degree and kinds of behavioral changes induced in ten
cockroach species by a single parasite species, and will investigate the extent
to which closely-related cockroaches have similar responses to being
parasitized. Behavioral changes will be measured relative to five environmental
tests (substrate color and orientation, shelter choice, activity level, and
responses to air currents). The project has wide implications for the study of
host- parasite coevolution. If behavioral changes are highly coincident with
evolutionary relationships, then parasitism can be viewed as a noteworthy factor
in the evolution of the group. If they are not well-predicted by evolutionary
relatedness, then species would appear to be more generalized in their
responses, and therefore more directly adapted to their ecological
circumstances.
