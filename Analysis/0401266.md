Abstract DMS-0401266 PI: John W. Milnor CoPI: Mikhail Lyubich, Saeed Zakeri

Since its founding in 1989, the Institute for Mathematical Sciences at Stony
Brook has carried on an active program of research and education in dynamical
systems, and related areas of geometry, ergodic theory, and complex analysis,
with particular emphasis on low dimensional dynamics over the real and complex
numbers. It has supported a number of junior and senior visitors, organized nine
conferences, worked with graduate and undergraduate students, and helped promote
communication in this field by maintaining a dynamics web site and an active
preprint series. The present proposal outlines a further program of exploring
all aspects of low dimensional dynamics: combinatorial and geometric issues of
holomorphic dynamics, its interplay with one-dimensional real dynamics
(particularly in the rigidity and renormalization theories), interaction with
three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, analytic and geometric aspects of two
dimensional complex and real dynamics.
