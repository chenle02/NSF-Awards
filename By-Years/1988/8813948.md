Description: This project supports travel of four Indian scientists to attend
the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Baltimore and the IAU Symposium
No. 134 on "Active Galactic Nuclei" in Santa Cruz, California in August, 1988.
The symposium will provide an opportunity to bring together Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) research workers from all over the world to exchange ideas and
results on this very important topic. AGN are quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and
other extra galactic objects with highly energetic nuclei. Scope: Four Indian
participants will be provided travel support to attend the IAU meeting in
Baltimore and the Symposium No. 134 in Santa Cruz. Four other Indian scientists
who plan to attend the IAU meetings are expected also to attend the Symposium.
The participation of these eight would add significantly to the value of the
deliberations and benefit all participants.
