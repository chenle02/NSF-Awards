This NSF award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program
supports the development of novel theory, computational methods and experimental
verification to enable the design of proteins capable of electron transfer.
Electron transfer reactions are central to bioenergetic processes, such as
hydrogen production, photosynthesis, and cellular respiration. Electron transfer
in living organisms is analogous to an electrical current that powers a
household appliance in that there must be a source of electrons (an outlet) and
a pathway for the current to follow in order to supply energy to the electrical
device so that it can function. The ability to understand and control the
biological machinery ? i.e., the source and pathways ? involved in the process
of electron-transfer will allow bioengineers to develop microscopic electronic
devices that can be used to benefit society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will
establish and interdisciplinary program that is complementary to this research
initiative, while promoting diversity and increasing the involvement of
underrepresented groups&lt;br/&gt;in biological engineering and science .
