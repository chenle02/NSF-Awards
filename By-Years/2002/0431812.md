This project is developing the best possible undergraduate curriculum for Duke
students, and is providing a model for peer institutions by streamlining the
entire ECE curriculum and updating it with particular focus on the students. The
goals of this effort are to maintain curricular flexibility while introducing a
theme-based structure focused on major concepts and principles, and to integrate
this theme throughout the core and the technical focus areas. This theme,
Integrated Sensing and Information Processing (ISIP), reflects the active
research areas of the majority of the ECE faculty, embodies the key concepts of
all critical components of electrical and computer engineering within an easily
understandable real-world framework, and reflects the future of electrical and
computer engineering. As such, it is providing a unique and innovative
educational platform upon which to educate Duke students, and thus it can become
a model of ECE education for years to come. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major
tasks associated with this innovative curricular reform effort are: 1)
Developing a theme-based introductory course that introduces fundamental
concepts of ECE through coursework and a real-world design project and
laboratory experience; 2) Restructuring the core curriculum so that it is more
balanced and emphasizes fundamental ECE concepts within the construct of the
instructional theme; 3) Modifying the structure and/or content of upper-level
technical courses to be consistent with the curricular theme; 4) Developing new
theme-based design courses that integrate core technical competency achieved in
the various technical tracks and draw upon the active research programs of the
faculty; 5) Integrating MATLAB throughout the curriculum in order to provide a
modern cohesive simulation and analysis platform.
