The project consists in applying model theory to questions in other branches of
mathematics. More precisely, the principal investigator will apply model
theoretic techniques to problems in representation theory of generalised linear
groups, compact complex manifolds, and the algebraic theory of differential
equations. Model theory has already made substantial contributions in all three
areas, and the principal investigator plans to further extend these
contributions, and come up with new ones.

Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, which studies sets defined by
formulas in a formal language from the point of view of their geometry. As a
result, it allows one to treat geometrically concrete situations in which
geometry is not apparent otherwise. Conversely, it allows the application of
logical and combinatorial tools to geometric questions. The proposed project
will apply such techniques to problems in algebra, geometry and differential
equations.
