NSF is providing partial support for the twenty-sixth biennial International
Conference on Photonic, Electronic, and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC XXVI) in
Kalamazoo, Michigan, July 22-28, 2009. NSF funds provide for a group of United
States students and young scientists to attend the meeting. The ICPEAC series of
conferences was initiated in the United States in 1958, soon achieved
international standing, and later was recognized by the International Union of
Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). The conference is run by an independent and
self-governing organization, acquiring its funding mostly from governmental
subsidies, especially from the host nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
enables a number of young U.S. scientists to attend a major international
conference, which has become the predominant venue for reporting new
developments and exchanging scientific information in the field of atomic
collision physics on an international scale. Due to the large presence of
non-U.S. participants, particularly from Europe and Japan, students and
postdoctoral associates meet and interact with their international counterparts,
enabling these young scientists to carry out and advance atomic collision
research of the highest caliber into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
