Taste is a complex process beginning in the tongue, where the surface layer of
cells, the epithelium, contains taste buds. Many taste compounds probably bind
to specific receptor molecules on membrane of the taste sensory cells. But salts
form a whole class of tastants that produce ions in solution, and now are
thought to stimulate the cells of the taste buds directly, by transport
processes across the cell membrane. These ions may use specific channels in the
membrane in a way similar to the use of ionic channels in to stimulate excitable
membranes of nerve and muscle. Understanding taste transduction, by which a
particular stimulus specifically excites a sensory cell, is a major goal of
chemosensory systems research. This project will approach taste transduction by
linking experiments on the physiology of tongue epithelial tissue with
neurophysiology of taste receptors. In vitro tongue tissue will be tested to
precisely measure ionic flows, and a mathematical model of ionic transport
processes across the epithelium will be refined and expanded by comparisons to
data from experiments. These data will be compared to known data on excitation
of taste nerves from neurophysiology experiments. Experiments and modelling
should resolve which aspects of taste transduction can be explained by
properties of the tongue epithelium. The model incorporates organization of all
the component membranes, and the topology of the epithelium in which the taste
buds are imbedded; the model can be extended to include different cell types and
different ions. This study involves a novel quantitative approach to taste
mechanisms, with a powerful merging of mathematics, chemistry, and biology; it
may be useful in analyses of tastant interactions by the food industry, and will
have high impact in chemosensory science and neurophysiology as well.
