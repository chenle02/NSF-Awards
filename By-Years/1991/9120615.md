ABSTRACT The syntax of a very large number of Romance languages from France,
Italy, Belgium and Switzerland will be studied with the aim of elucidating the
primitives of syntactic variation. Data will be accumulated from written sources
and from native speaker judgments, and an attempt made to bring to light
significant clusterings of syntactic properties. It is expected that comparison
of a great many very closely related languages should facilitate the discovery
of syntactic parameters, and simultaneously provide unique evidence bearing on
the universal syntactic principles postulated to interact with such parameters.
The areas of syntax to be emphasized will include: clitics, infinitives,
participles, complementizers, reflexives, imperatives, quantifiers, adverbs,
agreement, causatives, control and auxiliaries. The hypothesis that syntact
variation can be reduced to a relatively small number of parameters will be
tested, as will hypotheses concerning the form of such parameters. Results
concerning such parameters will bear in important ways on questions of syntax
acquisition and on questions of syntact change.
