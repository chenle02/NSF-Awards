This project focusses on the significant role of the liberal arts colleges in
maintaining America's scientific and technological productivity. Called Project
Kaleidoscope (PKAL), the goal is to deduce from the best in undergraduate
science and mathematics education evidence for the most effective models for
teaching and learning in science and mathematics. The project is led by a
9-person executive committee, and assisted by a 20-person advisory committee of
prominent scientists and scientific administrators from a variety of kinds of
liberal arts institutions. Project activities consist of leadership planning
meetings, research into the state of and opportunities for undergraduate science
and mathematics education, identification of exemplary programs, a national
colloquium for discussion of the issues the planning meetings raise, and the
production and wide dissemination of a report for action.
