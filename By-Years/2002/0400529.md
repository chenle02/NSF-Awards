The proposal will support the yearly workshop and conference of Digital
Government Research Program grantees, along with their government partners,
students, and other interested individuals. Based on past experience, there will
be an attendance of about 200 individuals. A white-paper submission and process
will be supported, as well as several events for student demonstrations. In
addition, the proposal will support several outreach activities; these include a
web site (www.digitalgovernment.org) and a printed brochure covering highlights
of the DG program. The workshop will serve several purposes:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To allow grantees and their gov't partners to become aware
of what other grantee/agency teams are doing, &lt;br/&gt;To provide a forum for
government agencies to present their IT-related problems and challenges, and
&lt;br/&gt;To support much-needed dialog between social/political science
grantees and technical grantees. &lt;br/&gt;
