This proposal requests funds to acquire a 4-wheel drive field vehicle for
geologic field work in difficult terrain in Baja California, Arizona and
California. The principal investigator is involved in two NSF projects requiring
extensive field work: "The Evolution of Arc-Related Studies of Mesozoic
Sedimentary and Volcanic Rocks, Baja California" and "Stratigraphy and
Geochronology of Mesozoic Eolianites and Interstratified Metavolcanic Rocks,
California and Southern California". A 4-wheel drive vehicle will allow the
field-intensive projects of the principal investigator and her colleagues at the
University of California-Santa Barbara to be carried out efficiently. Their
projects are contributing to an understanding of the underlying processes and
resulting geographic changes that occurred at convergent plate margins in the
Western U.S. over 60 million years ago.
