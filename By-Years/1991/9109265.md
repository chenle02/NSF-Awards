The principal investigator will study minimal hypersurfaces in Riemannian
manifolds. He will continue to develop and apply techniques from geometric
measure theory and the geometric calculus of variations to existence problems
for minimal surfaces. In addition the principal investigator will continue to
develop numerical methods for constructing minimizers. The research supported by
this award will attempt to describe how minimal surfaces lie in curved space.
Minimal surfaces are surfaces which have minimal area for any prescribed
boundary curve drawn on the surface. These surfaces frequently occur in nature
because many processes develop according to some minimum energy principle. An
important example is the solid- liquid boundary in a solidification process.
Because there are so many important examples of geometric minimization in the
physical sciences, a thorough understanding of the theoretical aspects of the
process can be expected to have a broad impact on science.
