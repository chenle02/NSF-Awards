This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host
laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in
biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to
Filipa Godoy-Vitorino is " A metagenomic study of the Hoatzin crop microbes to
reveal novel carbohydrate-active enzymes." The host institution for this
research is the DOE-Joint Genome Institute under the sponsorship of Dr. Philip
Hugenholtz.

The hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) is a South American folivorous bird, also
known as the stinkbird, unique among other avian species by virtue of the
fermentative function of its enlarged crop. The hoatzin rumen-like crop chamber
allows for the digestion of its herbivorous diet (thus its nickname "flying
cow") and houses an impressive array of novel microbes with potentially novel
fiber degrading enzymes. The crop ecosystem provides the host with energy
through fermentation of the leafy diet, as well as help in the detoxification of
plant defensive toxic compounds. This research project seeks to understand which
microbes and enzymes contribute to breaking down plant cell walls.

The training objectives are to gain skills in metagenomics, to accurately
classify sequence fragments into their corresponding microbial populations, and
to reconstruct metabolic pathways in order to model the ecosystem's dynamics.
The broader impacts include increasing the number of minorities through
innovative outreach activities involving the University of Puerto Rico,
Venezuela and the DOE-Joint Genome Institute, targeting undergraduate and
graduate students. This research offers significant benefits to society as it
aims to identify crop enzymes that could be used in industrial cellulose
degradation for biofuel production. Biofuels are ecologically sustainable and
could become an affordable replacement to fossil fuels, and this project
represents a step along that path.
