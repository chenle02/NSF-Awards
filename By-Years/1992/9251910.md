Plant growth chambers with modern environmental controls will facilitate changes
in the introductory biology curriculum, permitting an experimental motif whereby
all students acquire research experiences and skills. Descriptive, observational
lab exercises in botany are being replaced by experiments that emphasize
physiological processes. Students then become involved with hypothesis
formulation, data collection, statistical analysis, computer graphing, and
report writing. Such a transformation meets several intertwined goals: more
engaging biology laboratory experiences, better retention of science students,
heightened student interest in research careers, and improved research training
for undergraduates. Growth chambers meet an urgent need for reliable
environments in which to place botanical experiments; they also open new
opportunities for experimental manipulations of temperature, humidity, and light
regimes. Courses for introductory students and several courses for advanced
undergraduates (Developmental Biology, Terrestrial Ecology, Plant
Identification) will improve, and new opportunities will open for
independent/team research projects by undergraduates and, during summers, by
secondary students in the Governor's School for the Sciences.
