This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a
novel class of coatings, initially for hard turning cutting tool application,
using a new hybrid coating technology. Specifically, it is proposed to develop
cubic boron nitride-titanium nitride (cBN-TiN) nano and micro particulate
composite coatings using a combination of electrostatic spray coating (ESC) of
cBN powder and chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) of TiN. The project will follow
a concept where initial work indicates that a thick cBN/TiN composite coating
can be deposited in a practical hybrid deposition process using the ESC/CVI
combination, and that cutting tools coated using this method can provide
significant improvement in machining performance.

Commercially, cBN tools are excellent candidates for machining hardened ferrous
alloys and superalloys tools. Development of a cBN coating process can
circumvent limitations of existing tools and thereby provide a significant
improvement in cutting tool selection, productivity and application range where
cBN tools simply do not exist (e.g., chip-breaker inserts, round-shank tools
such as end-mills, and drills).
