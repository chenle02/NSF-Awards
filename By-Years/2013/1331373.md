This project will examine heavy precipitation events in the western United
States known as atmospheric rivers. The predictability and variability of these
events will be characterized in high-resolution global climate model output with
reanalysis and observations used to characterize model biases. The goals are to
(i) characterize the climatology and natural variability of these storms
frequencies and strength in observations, reanalysis, and high-resolution model
simulations using various detection algorithms; (ii) analyze the predictability
of such events using hindcast simulations and identifying atmospheric and
oceanic conditions in which these events develop and are suppressed; and (iii)
combine the knowledge gained above to utilize high-resolution global model
simulations to examine changes in atmospheric rivers in the future and test the
robustness of classifications and predictions made using the present climate.
This project has high broader impacts as it will shed insights into extreme
precipitation events in western US, specifically California
