The EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) is the largest GPS network for
scientific studies in the United States. Its hallmarks are high-quality
instrumentation, an open data policy, and easily accessible positioning products
for crustal deformation studies. Recently it has been shown that many PBO sites
also provide valuable information about land surface conditions surrounding each
GPS antenna. Data from these GPS sites are being used to monitor fluctuations in
three critical hydrologic variables: soil moisture, snow depth/snow water
equivalent, and biomass. Water cycle products derived from GPS sites are unique
because the method is sensitive to the 10,000 m2 area around each PBO antenna.
This fills a critical gap between typical in situ sensors (100 cm2) and
satellite measurements (100 km2). These data are important for climate studies,
water management, and weather forecasting, thus improving, and possibly
mitigating, natural hazards such as floods and droughts while improving
agricultural production. Improvements in these research areas are directly
linked to the U.S. economy and public safety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GPS water
cycle products and error assessments are being generated on a daily basis and
made available to the public. Ancillary meteorological data (temperature,
precipitation) and other remotely sensed environmental datasets are provided for
each PBO site in order to enhance scientific analysis. This research is
interdisciplinary and strengthens connections between the GPS and traditional
water cycle scientific communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All products developed
from this research are available to the public through UNAVCO
(http://pbo.unavco.org). Online data tools allow the public to both access and
visualize the water cycle products. The techniques and standards developed for
this project are being made broadly available, thus expanding water cycle
studies to other GPS networks in the United States and abroad.
