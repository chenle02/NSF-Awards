In the last half century the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, has become an
important model organism for research on mimicry, plant-herbivore interactions,
chemical ecology, physiological ecology, and migration. In addition, the
charismatic insect has proven to be an appealing entry point into the world of
science for both children and adults. Much of the research that has made this a
model organism has been conducted by Lincoln Brower, who will be supported to
write a book targeted to scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, and
science-curious general readers. The book will address the monarch butterflies'
chemical defense against predators, the ecological chemistry of the butterflies'
interactions with their milkweed hostplants, the physiology, ecology and
behavior of the butterflies as they cope with the microclimate in their Mexican
wintering sites, and the butterflies' unique migration and wintering biology
that illustrate timely conservation issues. The intellectual merit of the book
for scientists will be in its presentation of data, critical review of evidence,
and extensive bibliography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important broader impact of
the project will be the archiving of original datasets in a digital data
registry. Explanations of the significance of these data and including
unanswered questions in each chapter will help to spark new research. The book
will enhance non-specialists' and students' understanding of diverse
methodologies that can be used to address ecological questions, and their
appreciation of the value of long-term studies and the collaborative nature of
many discoveries. Copious illustrations will engage the reader and tell the
story, so that the non-expert is prepared to understand data and how experiments
in both the field and laboratory were actually conducted.
