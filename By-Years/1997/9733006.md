IBN 97-33006 WANG. Working memory is an active form of short-term memory. It is
indispensable for any cognitive process where information has to be maintained
with attentive effort for a few seconds, and manipulated "on-line", before it is
erased and new information is loaded. Examples are dialing a telephone number,
planning and executing a sequence of motor movements, reading, and thinking.
Experiments on behaving animals have started to uncover the neuronal basis of
working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Dr. Wang will use theoretical
approaches, in complement with laboratory experiments, to investigate how the
working memory function can be understood in terms of the physiology of single
neurons/synapses, the cortical circuit architecture, and emergent collective
network behavior. In particular, possible neuronal mechanisms will be studied by
computer model simulations for sustained neuronal activity (in seconds) and its
selectivity to memory items, including (a) reverberating activity across the
cortical network, (b) slow cellular and synaptic dynamics, and (c) the role of
recurrent synaptic inhibition. Results from this research will help to
understand the functioning of normal working memory, its neuromodulation, as
well as its malfunctions.
