The goal of this multidisciplinary project is to design and prototype a new
approach in database environments to support collaborative scientific research.
The prototype integrates scientific data visualization and mathematical and
statistical analysis tools with database support in a highly interactive
environment. A new model for scientific data is founded on the notion that a
query of a scientific data base conceptually creates new derived data whose
relationship to the parent database is defined by the query. Each query, in
principle, leads to the discovery of additional structure in the data that is
either explicit in the results of the query, or hypothesized by the scientist(s)
from results of queries. The system uses a process flow graph to represent
queries. The project, carried out by a team of two computer scientists, an
applied mathematician, and scientists from earth science, civil engineering and
atmospheric science, contributes to ongoing research in the fields of
environmental biology and chemistry, oil reservoir analysis, and polar ice core
study. This work will produce a new data model for scientific data and will
design and prototype an integrated data management, analysis and visualization
environment to support interdisciplinary scientific investigation. //
