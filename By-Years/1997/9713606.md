ABSTRACT SOLGARRD EEC-9713606 This award is for a planning meeting to determine
the feasibility and visibility of the University of California-Davis to become a
research site of the University of California-Berkeley Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Microsensors and Actuators. The University of
California-Davis Microphotonics Laboratory's research and resources would be
complementary and synergistic with the I/UCRC at Berkeley. The research agenda
proposed for industrial support and additions to the UC Berkeley I/UCRC
addresses: 1.) High Precision Integrated Optical Scanners, 2.) Fiber-Optic
Switches for Wavelength-Division-Multiplexed Optical Communication Networks and
RF-Photonics, 3.) Corner Cube Reflectors for Low Power Communication, 4.)
Optoelectronic Packaging using Silicon Surface-Micromachined Alignment Mirrors,
5.) Batch-Fabricated, Magnetically Actuated Microstructures, 6.) Femosecond-
Laser-Pulse Shaping, 7.) Evanescently Coupled Microphotonic Devices and Systems,
8.) Studies of Optomechanical Effects in Polymeric Thin Films, 9.) Studies of
Friction and Surface Forces in MEMS.
