This project aims to commercialize high-throughput single cell assay chips for
cancer drug screening and modeling of cancer metastasis. Cancer is one of
leading causes of death in many developed countries, and cancer metastasis
accounts for 90% of the death caused by cancer. Conventional methods for
studying metastasis are limited by low throughput or poor relevance to in-vivo
microenvironment. There is an unmet need to develop in-vitro devices which can
emulate critical steps of the metastatic cascade. In addition to the in-vitro
cancer metastasis modeling, the proposed work aims to provide the solution to
monitor and analyze cancer cell heterogeneity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cancer drug
resistance is one of the greatest challenges in cancer treatments. The
conventional drug development methods used to focus on average drug efficacy and
cannot target the drug resistant tumor cells in the whole tumor, which may lead
to the relapse of tumor. The presented prototype platforms in this application
provide the capability of high-throughput assays at single cell resolution,
which can shift the paradigm of cancer research and cancer treatment. The
proposed platforms also enable high-throughput screening and in-vitro metastasis
emulation, resulting in significant reduction in drug development cost. The
proposed platform technology can facilitate the development of novel therapeutic
ideas with lower assay cost at high throughput. The proposed devices have a high
commercial potential by meeting the need to realize high-throughput low-cost
assays for cancer drug development and screening in research communities as well
as pharmaceutical companies.
