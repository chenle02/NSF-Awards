In this U.S.-Ecuador dissertation enhancement project supported by the Americas
Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering, Bette A.
Loiselle and Kimberly M Holbrook of the University of Missouri, Saint Louis,
will conduct dissertation enhancement research to investigate the contribution
of seed dispersal to tropical forest diversity and structure. This research
addresses hypotheses that toucan seed dispersal behavior influences the
population structure of a neotropical nutmeg, Virola flexuosa. This project
includes work and collaboration with scientists and student biologists from the
Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador (USFQ) and Pontificia Universidad
Catolica del Ecuador (PUCE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on a topic
of considerable importance to long-term conservation and restoration of
biodiversity, particularly in the tropics. The project will provide
international research experience for a female US student and will strengthen
collaborations with Latin American scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
