This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor John Arnold at the University of California,
Berkeley, to carry out fundamental studies in synthetic chemistry aimed at
uncovering new reaction pathways for the important greenhouse gases nitrous
oxide and carbon dioxide. The Arnold group explores the use of nitrous oxide as
an oxygen source for catalytic oxidation reactions, with the green house
friendly dinitrogen as the only by-product. The first stage of their approach is
the development of an understanding of both the nature of nitrous oxide binding
to transition metal centers and the mechanism of N-O bond cleavage. The second
stage involves development of selective oxygen atom transfer reactions based on
the nitrous oxide cleavage product. Oxidation reactions are essential to the
chemicals industry, and the fundamental technologies developed in this program
could lead to new processes to prepare commodity chemicals using inexpensive
feedstocks.

Researchers trained under this program receive extensive education in cutting-
edge synthetic chemistry, learning how to prepare and handle highly sensitive
and reactive compounds. They become highly skilled in modern characterization
techniques and apply the results of computational studies to further their
research. As part of UC Berkeley's strong tradition of outreach, the researchers
interact with students in local schools to engage them in questions relating to
the environment and energy.
