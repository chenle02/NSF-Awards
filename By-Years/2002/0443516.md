With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry and the Department of Food Science and Technology at the University of
California-Davis will acquire a 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
Spectrometer. The new instrument will enable a user base of over 100 graduate
and postdoctoral students to routinely obtain high field spectra with greater
dispersion and sensitivity than is now possible. The instrument will make
possible such experiments as routine collection of proton-detected two-
dimensional NMR data at high field for structural determination of organic
molecules, and direct detection of numerous heteronuclei, including quadrupolar
nuclei, important for studies in inorganic chemistry. The 600 MHz instrument
will provide capabilities to support numerous new faculty appointments that
require access to high field NMR and this instrument will allow rational
partitioning of NMR time on all available instruments for use in research and
teaching of graduates and undergraduates, including well-established minority
outreach programs at UC Davis such as the Minority Undergraduate Research
Program in Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MURPPS) program and ACS Project
SEED. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful
tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.
It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements
of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
