This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project produces potentially
single phase alpha or beta or a mixture of polytypes of silicon carbide fiber
that will withstand high temperature (> 1400 √ùC) use. Silicon carbide fibers
stand out as a primary candidate among commercially available ceramic fibers
that can be used as reinforcements to toughen ceramics for use at high
temperatures. There are underlying sound technical and economic reasons why the
presently available fibers have not made headway commercially. These fibers
degrade both chemically and mechanically during manufacture of the ceramic
matrix composite. The cost of these fibers can range from $500 to $1,000 per kg.
depending upon the quality of the fiber and the quantity ordered. This project
addresses a new silicon carbide fiber manufacture that uses 1) low cost silicon
and carbon containing raw materials, 2) simple furnacing technique, and 3)
complete avoidance of fiber spinning or drawing and sintering methodology or
polymer chemical conversion technology and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
methods. The process offers relatively low risk in scale up to demand driven
silicon carbide fiber manufacture.
