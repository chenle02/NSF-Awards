This project is developing the Basic Technology Concepts Laboratory. The
laboratory is being incorporated into the Fundamentals of Technology and
Technology Applications courses. The laboratory is serving as the cornerstone
for hands-on learning activities in the planned Engineering-Preparatory program.
The laboratory includes equipment and activities related to basic engineering
principles, including rate, resistance, energy, power, momentum, waves, and
vibrations, and activities dealing with advanced topics such as alternate
energy, optoelectronics, lasers, telecommunications, and instrumentation and
control. The laboratory is also being used for summer workshops for secondary
students and in-service teacher training activities. *
