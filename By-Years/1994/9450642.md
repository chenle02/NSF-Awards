9450642 Kovac Our curriculum proposal emphasizes the continuity of chemistry. We
imagine the curriculum as a highly-structured minimal core embellished with
electives. Throughout the curriculum we will emphasize the major themes of
characterization of chemical systems and chemical reactions and dynamics. Within
those themes, important topics such as equilibrium and periodicity will also be
developed. In the lower-division core we intend to teach the material in such a
way that it will not have to be retaught in later courses. Mastery-learning
concepts will aid in this effort. The laboratory will be thoroughly integrated
into the courses with chemicals returned to the center of the curriculum. Modern
educational technology will be utilized wherever possible. We will use the twin
themes of history and ethics to emphasize that chemistry is also a branch of the
liberal arts. Our goal is to produce an innovative curriculum which our
colleagues around the country will be eager to implement.
