This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular and biogeochemical
investigations of microbial communities associated with ocean-ridge basalts."
The proposed research is directed towards identifying which microorganisms are
involved in the initial stages of basalt weathering reactions, their phylogeny
and modes of metabolic activity, and how transient these microbial communities
may be. The research combines sampling of marine, ocean-ridge environments with
laboratory enrichment culturing techniques and molecular biology methods.
