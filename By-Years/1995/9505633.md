9505633 Carriquiry This U.S.-Chile Program award will fund travel and related
expenses for twelve U.S. scientists and two U.S. graduate students, to
participate in a workshop on probability and statistics, to be held in
Valparaiso, Chile, on November 1995. Also, partially funded by this award will
be four Latin American participants from Uruguay and Colombia. Organizers are
Dr. Alicia Carriquiry, Iowa State University, Ames, and Dr. Servet Martinez,
Universidad de Chile. The workshop will bring together active researchers from
Latin America with colleagues from the U.S. and Europe. Topics to be discussed
will range from prequential analysis, stochastic search model selection and
stochastic processes for spatial variability, to infinite particle systems and
quantum probability theory. U.S. speakers are leading researchers in the area of
modeling, estimation and analysis in stochastic processes, and have contributed
extensively to the field. The main objectives of the workshop are to facilitate
the exchange of recent research developments in the field and to promote
international scientific cooperation by identifying common research areas for
the participants. A significant feature of the conference will be the active
participation of young U.S. and Latin American researchers. ***
