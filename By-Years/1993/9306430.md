Grochenig 9306430 This project is concerned mathematical problems arising in
wavelet and sampling theory. Particular emphasis will be placed on the analysis
of multidimensional problems. The thread which ties together the theories comes
from the broader concept of frames developed in the early 1950's, but not
recognized for its importance in new developments in signal processing. One
objective of the work is the construction of orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelet
bases for a general class of dilation matrices in higher dimensions. A
particular step towards this construction is the characterization of all self-
similar tilings which occur naturally in any attempt to find solutions
ofdilation equations. The general construction of nonseparable wavelets will
exploit the links with the theory of self-similar tilings. This type of wavelet
basis is needed in applications to coding, compression and fast transmission
images to obtain more flexibility with respect to the number of wavelets, the
angular frequency distribution and the sampling geometry. The second objective
is the development of algorithms for the reconstruction of band-limited
multivariate functions from irregular samples. Particular emphasis will be given
to the relation between finite-dimensional implementable models of irregular
sampling to the original infinite-dimensional reconstruction problem, and th
analysis of efficiency and speed of iterative reconstructions. The growth of
wavelet analysis has transformed a sizable portion of research in harmonic
analysis into efforts to find efficient and fast procedures for analyzing and
transmitting signals in diverse areas such as tomography, seismology, data
compression and image reconstruction. Many of the concepts have been known in
various forms in the mathematical literature, but recent applications and
discoveries have added impetus to the basic goal of local analysis of signals in
both time and frequency at different scales in a comput ationally efficient
manner. ***
