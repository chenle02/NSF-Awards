This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
biophysical modeling between Xiao-Jing Wang of the University of Pittsburgh and
David Hansel of the Ecole Polytechnique, Paliseau, France. The objective of
their research is to undertake biophysical modeling of 40 Hz oscillations in
neurons and neural systems. They will address: rhythmogenesis; network
mechanisms underlying synchronization and large variability; and the
intermittent nature of 40 Hz oscillations. Rhythmic activity in mammalian brains
at the 30 to 50 Hz oscillation rate has been shown to coincide with increased
focal attention and may have important functional roles in perception and
information processing. The proposed collaboration focuses on these
physiological and cognitive issues by combining unique abilities of the
investigators. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
biophysical modeling. This is complemented by the French investigator's
expertise in the dynamics of large neural networks. Their joint effort will
advance our knowledge of the physiological and biophysical mechanisms underlying
neuronal cooperative rhythmically and its role in the organization of mammalian
brain activity.
