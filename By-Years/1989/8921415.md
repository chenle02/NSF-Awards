This project investigates the evolution of optimizing behavior in a class of
financial asset markets. The sources of evolution are "economic natural
selection" in the marketplace and adaptation by individual investors. Selection
dynamics are a consequence of wealth flows between investors, while adaptation
arises from learning and search by individual investors. Unlike much of the
literature on evolution in markets, this project studies individuals' behavior
in financial asset markets rather than the behavior of firms. In addition to
findings on the evolution of rationality (i.e., markets do not always select the
traders who are most nearly optimizers or who have the most correct
information), the preliminary investigations have discovered a great deal of
regularity in the market process. The investigators exploit this regularity to
characterize the long run behavior of asset prices in financial markets and to
explore the effects of learning, entry and exit, search, and other sources of
economic innovation. This is a very important line of research. The assumption
that individuals behave as if they were rational (near optimizing) or that firms
maximize profits is based on the following natural selection argument. Market
forces punish non-optimizing traders and poorly informed traders by
redistributing to the more nearly optimizing, better informed and better
guessing traders. In the long run, these traders come to dominate the market.
Models of market rationality are widely used in financial economics. Preliminary
work by these investigators suggests that the natural selection process might
not converge on a rational expectations equilibrium, that there are significant
regularities in markets even when the market is not efficient in the long run,
and these regularities can provide a richer and more accurate conceptual
framework for studying the dynamics of financial markets.
