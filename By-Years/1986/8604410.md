This study aims at developing a knowledge-based system that will rationally
synthesize a good manufacturing design and will also ensure satisfactory
operation even when the manufacturing environment changes from the one for which
the process was originally designed. A testing maching and a computer will be
purchased to complete the building of a flexible manufacturing cell. The testing
machine will be empolyed as a metal forming plant, and the computer will be used
to store the knowledge database.
