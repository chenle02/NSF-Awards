Throughout airports and hospitals around the world, x-ray imaging technologies
are used for the safety and concern of mankind. For example, these technologies
are employed to detect dangerous explosive and illegal drugs by homeland
security. The applications are not limited only to medicine and science, but to
general industry, and hence the need for cost-effective x-ray sources that are
reliable and produce optimal yields is ever present. The dense plasma focus
device, which is known as a device that can generate fusion reactions, has
recently been established as a very efficient source of x-rays, thus making the
desire to find and optimize a high performance and high repetition device
tremendous. Presently, such a device has been developed and implemented at the
National Institute of Education in Singapore, and work has been done to optimize
the performance and enhance its reproducibility. This award funds research to
conduct a comprehensive study of dense plasma focus plasmas through the use of
x-ray spectroscopy and imaging. Conducting the proposed research under the
supervision of Dr. Rajdeep Rawat provides the valuable opportunity of studying
radiation and plasma formation from this type of device.

Access to the host?s device will allow for a detailed spectroscopic examination
and imaging measurements on pinch plasmas from a dense plasma focus device,
which has not yet been done. The ultimate goal of completing this research is to
advance knowledge and understanding within the field of pinch plasmas.
Specifically, use of spectroscopy, imaging measurements, and theoretical models
will enhance the understanding of x-ray emission efficiency from such
experiments. Various diagnostic tools such as silicone diodes, x-ray pinhole
cameras, and a spectrometer will be used to enhance knowledge about the
experimental plasma parameters. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration
with the National Science Foundation of Singapore.
