Reduction of mechanical systems with symmetry will be pursued. The problems to
be studied were motivated by recent advances in stability theory and the theory
of classical relativistic fields. The block diagonalization technique to be used
is based on a recent solution to the problem of separation of rotational and
internal modes. The general geometric theory underlying this technique will be
investigated. Recent advances in classical field theory based on reduction ideas
will be exploited to develop corresponding covariant reduction theory and
related topics. This project will extend our understanding of the stability of
relativistic magnetic, electrical, and gravitational fields. These fields, which
may describe motion, are said to be stable if under various sorts of
perturbations the system maintains its basic nature in some way. These have come
under intense mathematical scrutiny for several decades and this project will
extend our knowledge of them.
