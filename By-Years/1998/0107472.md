Prochlorococcus, a marine cyanobacterium, is a dominant phototroph in the
world's oceans which contribute up to 50% of oceanic primary productivity. The
complete genome sequences of two Prochlorococcus isolates have recently been
completed by the Joint Genome Institute of the DOE. This study will develop
complete genome microarrays to study gene expression in these isolates. This
technology will not only help to identify the numerous unidentified genes in
these organisms that have no homologues in sequence databases, but they will
also provide insights into the environmental variables that have driven niche
diversification in this group. Prochlorococcus thrives due to the existence of
multiple ecotypes, each slightly specialized to thrive optimally under a
slightly different set of environmental conditions. Pending the success of this
project, a full-blown study will be conducted applying this array to the
evolution and ecology of this organism. The array will also be made available to
others.
