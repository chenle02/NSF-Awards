*** 9709273 WILLETT This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities Program (CRIF) will assist the Department of Chemistry at Washington
State University acquire a scanning probe microscope (SPM). This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including the study of the kinetics of
growth of self assembled monolayers, the evaluation of forces at protein
surfaces, the study of the enhanced deposition of materials controlled on the
nanoscale by precisely applied stress, studies of molecular electronic
materials, and determination of the orientation of deposited molecular films.
The scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to image atoms directly.
The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves bringing an extremely
sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of the sample surface. The distance is
small enough for electrons to leak or tunnel across the gap and generate a
minute current. As the gap between the tip and the sample increases, the current
decreases. As then probe crosses the sample, moving back and forth across its
surface, it traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. The SPM is
used in the control of material used to fabricate semiconductor circuits. ***
