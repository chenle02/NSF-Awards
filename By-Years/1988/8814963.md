In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program, Viehland will develop a
theory of the way ion velocities are distributed when trace amounts of ions move
through dilute gases under the influence of electric fields. Computer programs
have been developed that will allow both the ion velocity distribution and the
gaseous ion transport coefficients to be calculated from knowledge of the ion-
neutral interaction potentials. Comparison of the calculated quantities with
experimental results gives insight into the accuracy with which the distribution
function can be measured and also into the accuracy of present microscopic
knowledge about the forces between individual ions and atoms.
