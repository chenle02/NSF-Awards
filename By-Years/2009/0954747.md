Intellectual Merit: As the capabilities of bio-implantable devices advance,
there is increasing need for high-speed, low-power in-body communication
systems. By using error control techniques with micro-power analog information
processing circuits, energy can be reduced without affecting system performance.
This approach, called "analog decoding", will be used to develop communication
chips for in-body applications with minimum energy resources. The system will
incorporate several complex nonlinear analog components that have been
demonstrated in previous work. The proposed system-on-chip will be the first
integration of these analog components into a complete micro-power communication
technology. The resulting device will provide continuous throughput greater than
two million bits per second without need for sleep modes, and will consume on
the order of one milli-Watt of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
intended application for this research is cortical stimulators that function as
electronic interfaces to the human brain. In theory, these interfaces can be
used to effectively cure blindness and paralysis by restoring neural
communication with the patient's brain. These devices may eventually be able to
repair damage to the central nervous system by bypassing the damaged sites
through a wireless network of recording and stimulating devices implanted in the
body. The proposed communication circuits will be an important step toward this
goal by providing the necessary throughput without elevating power levels beyond
current implantable micro-devices. Educationally, this project will develop new
instructional materials that integrate electronics education with bio-medial
research applications. Outreach efforts will include demonstrations and
activities designed around the themes of medical and veterinary monitoring
technologies. These activities will be provided at events designed to recruit
students from underrepresented backgrounds.
