The political process has legal, constitutional, and social components which
need to be understood. My research topic is the process by which the White House
through the Executive Office of the President, relates to the main actors in the
legislative process: Congress and interest groups. Specifically, I seek to
explicate the underlying assumptions that these main players share, which enable
the process to work (however badly). Also, I will try to assess these
assumptions and compare them to an older understanding of the policy-making
process that has closer ties to constitutional principles.
