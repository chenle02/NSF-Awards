Proof assistants can express any precise computing task in formal systems of
logic. They specify exactly how hardware and software are required to operate
and use the specifications to guide implementations. Computer scientists using
these tools have achieved over the past two decades the highest levels of
correctness known. Proof assistants draw on advanced mathematics; they have been
used to check the validity of several deep mathematical results and discover new
ones. In this process, leading mathematicians contributed powerful new concepts
into the formal logics. Fields Medalist Vladimir Voevodsky proposed a new
mathematical principle, called Univalence. It has been an open question whether
this principle has computational interpretations. That question was
affirmatively answered recently by the PI and his collaborators. The
intellectual merits of this project consist in formal verification of the
correctness of these interpretations using a proof assistant. The project's
broader significance and importance are to enhance their impact on many critical
applications of computing systems in science, engineering, and industry and to
explore their use in teaching Euclidean geometry to high school students.

This research project on Constructive Univalent Foundations significantly raises
the levels of abstraction that proof assistants can support, and increases the
range of problems they help solve. Preliminary results by the PI and his team
provide strong evidence that Univalent Foundations and the computational type
theory using it will significantly improve the capabilities of proof assistants
and thus the reliability and capabilities of hardware and software on which
modern computing systems depend, from the desktop to the cloud. The project
formally verifies the correctness of the computational interpretations of
Univalence in the proof assistant Nuprl that has been developed by the PI and
his collaborators over the last three decades.
