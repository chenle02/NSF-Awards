This project is concerned with the synthesis and characterization of ferrocene
based surfactants. Ferrocene is a chemical group which consists of an iron atom
in the +2 oxidation state sharing electrons with two five membered rings so that
the rings become aromatic. The ferrocene can be oxidized to a unit positive
charge by the loss of an electron from the iron so that the Fe is in the +3
oxidation state; addition of the electron regenerates the ferrocene as Fe is
reduced back to the +2 state. The uncharged and +1 charged ferrocene therefore
form a reversible (switchable) redox pair. The study will attempt to attach
hydrocarbon moieties to one ring of the ferrocene group. The attachment of the
hydrocarbon group gives the resulting molecule a switchable surfactant
character; in the oxidized, uncharged form it is essentially a nonpolar molecule
while in the oxidized form it is a cationic surfactant with a charged headgroup
and a hydrocarbon tail. This project will explore various synthesis routes for
making different kinds of switchable surfactants, and will characterize the
ability of the surface active form to lower interfacial tension, and to form
micelles. The micelle forming ability of the surfactant is a key feature. When
the surfactant is in the surface active form and has formed micelles, reduction
will deactivate the amphiphillic character thereby causing the micelles to
breakup. This ability to break micelles on demand is important in many
surfactant based separations where micelles solubilize targeted products. In
each of these separations, a final step is to remove the solute from the
micelle; by using switchable surfactants, reduction can affect breakup of the
micelle and release of the solute.
