This proposal from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT)
group seeks funding for the support of software and hardware projects that will
enable a measurement of the branching ratio of the ultra-rare K-meson decay, K0L
to p0+n+nbar. This decay is perhaps the single most incisive test of the minimal
Standard Model explanation of CP violation. A much larger amount of CP violation
than that presently observed is needed to explain why the universe is matter
dominated. It is therefore important to search for exotic sources of CP
violation. The experiment, called KOPIO, will be carried out at the Brookhaven
National Laboratory's Alternating Gradient Synchrotron that provides the most
intense beams of low energy long-lived neutral K-mesons. The VT group plans to
maintain, update and answer physics questions with the GEANT Monte Carlo
simulation code and to design and construct the charged particle and gamma ray
veto detectors that will catch particles from background decays emitted in the
general direction of the beam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the
research program are expected to derive from the important engineering problems
to be surpassed in the project and from the involvement of students at all
levels from high school to graduate school. &lt;br/&gt;
