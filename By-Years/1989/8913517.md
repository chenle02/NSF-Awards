The P.I. will convene a workshop on nearshore processes in which approximately
sixty scientists will participate. Focus will be on wave run-up, surf zone, and
outer esturary problems, but will not include problems on the continental
shelf/slope region. Workshop objectives are to decide long-term goals for
nearshore research and to develop a long-range science plan for the next one or
two decades.
