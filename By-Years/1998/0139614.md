&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to the University of Central Florida for
the support of a three-year, REU Site in Nanomaterials Process and
Characterization (NANOPAC), under the direction of Dr. Sudipta Seal. This ten-
week summer program housed in the Advanced Materials Processing and Analysis
Center (AMPAC), will involve ten students annually in an intensive research
experience on a wide range of topics including applications in sensors, optics,
coatings, thin films, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Each
student will be paired with an engineering faculty member with on-going research
programs in AMPAC faculty mentor and will be actively involved with the mentor's
research group. In addition, the participants will be involved in extensive
complementary educational activities, including a weekly seminar series focusing
on heir research projects, career seminars/field trips, and specialized
workshops on assorted topics. As a capstone to their REU experience, each
student will prepare and give a presentation at a concluding poster session to
UCF faculty and invited industry participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
