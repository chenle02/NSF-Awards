9614460 Cline The major focus of mineral exploration in the United States today
is centered on the search for Carlin-type gold deposits (CTGD). These are large,
low-grade, sediment-hosted sytems located in northern Nevada, which are noted
for the presence of micron-sized "invisible" gold. In spite of their economic
importance, the geological processes that caused the formation of these deposits
remains obscure and geological models continue to be descriptive. The main goal
of this proposal is to provide ways to identify the geological processes that
were essential to the generation of Carlin-type gold mineralization.
Specifically, this study will aim to define if fluids involved in the transport
and precipitation of metals on CTGD's are genetically linked to metamorphic or
magmatic processes. Furthermore, these results will provide new directions for
exploration strategies and could produce genetic models that can be used later
to explore for CTGD in the Great Basin and other parts of the world.
