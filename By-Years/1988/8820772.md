The purpose of this basic engineering research is to produce an instrument that
will provide for fine control of muscle movement in patients who have incurred
irreparable damage to the nervous system, eg., stroke and spinal-cord injury.
Thus through instrument control, the patient will regain use of limbs that had
lost all voluntary movement. All research proposed here will be done on cats.
The proposed system provides for two sets of electrodes. One set of electrodes
will be for sending electrical stimulation to the muscles to produce contraction
and relaxation in a way analogous to the electrical stimulation the nervous
system normally provides the muscles for voluntary control of muscle movement. A
second test set of muscles and thus "sense" the degree of contraction or
relaxation which determines the position of the muscle, then use this
information to control the muscle movement; this, again, is an instrumentation
technique analogous to the way in which the nervous system normally controls
muscle movement. The unique feature of this research is that the electrical
stimulus to control the muscle movement will use a range of frequencies
simultaneously. The higher frequencies can be used to inhibit muscle
contraction; thus it is expected that a very fine muscle response can be
achieved. The result will be a more stable movement with less fatigue than
previously achieved.
