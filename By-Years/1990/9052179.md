A new curriculum will be developed whose goals are: (1) to lead students to
inquire into the world around them through hands-on astronomical experiences and
(2) to present science as a cautious process devised by and for human
exploration and interpretation. Small telescopes will be purchased. Equipment to
connect to a remote new 3.5-m research telescope will be purchased. Personal
computers will be used to allow students to simulate the changes of the sky.
