This project will produce the first sample of the nineteenth century service
sector. It will produce a data set containing economic and demographic data on
middlemen who operated businesses in 89 counties in 10 North Central States
during the 1860-1880 period. Names of proprietors and locations of businesses
will be collected from statewide business directories and linked to the
manuscript censuses of population, agriculture, and manufacturing. Completion of
the project will provide quantitative and consistent evidence on changes in the
marketing sector of the Midwest during the period when the practice of standard
grading and the use forward contracts on grain were spreading. The data promise
to add a new dimension to our understanding of the economic development of the
Midwest and offer long term research opportunities to scholars in economics,
history and other social sciences.
