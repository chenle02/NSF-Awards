The objective of this research is to design and implement a Flexible Computer
Integrated Manufacturing (FCIM) work-cell for the assembly of an Automatic
Braking System. The brake system may use the FCIM concept in automating the
assembly process of one of its subsystems, the Actuator Unit, by incorporating
the design for automated manufacturing concept. The FCIM work-cell will contain
robots, a looped conveyor, vision system, sensors, and controlling computers.
The research includes the justification for the use of an FCIM work-cell, the
study of the changeover time from one model to the other, the reuse of
equipment, material handling and the ability to use multiple vendors.
