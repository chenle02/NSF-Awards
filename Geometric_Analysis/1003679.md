This project involves a number of topics. The first topic is the study rigidity
theorems (i.e. metric uniqueness) of compact manifolds. Here for example is
considered isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces with the same
spectra (e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, or Lengths of closed
geodesics) be isometric. This also includes questions about metric rigidity
induced by conjugacy of geodesic flows, as well as inverse scattering problems.
The second topic involves isoperimetric inequalities. The ideal is to find sharp
isoperimetric inequalities and study the equality case. This at times ties in
with the first topic. It also involves systolic inequalities and other
inequalities between geometric quantities. Another topic concerns infinite
groups G acting cocompactly on nonpositively curved spaces X (in the sense of
Alexandrov). The project is to study the relationship between the geometry of X
and the induced action of G on the ideal boundary of X. This can be considered
an aspect of geometric group theory. The final topic is geometric optics. This
topic involves using differential geometric techniques to design mirrors and
lenses to accomplish prescribe optics functions.

The rigidity theme of the project is a continuing project with many different
aspects. In general these problems concern the question of whether a space can
be determined by a prescribed set of data. One aspect of this concerns questions
of remote sensing. For example: can you determine the density of an object (say
a brain or the earth) from measurements taken "from the outside"? The CAT scan
is a practical example where one determines the mass density (or more accurately
the absorption coefficient) of an object from measurements of the total mass
along straight lines. An alternative set of measurements is the set of times it
takes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary (this is a
special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt with in the proposal). A
related set of measurements is to record the exit times and directions of
geodesics given their entry directions (this is the "geodesic lens" or
"scattering" data). The thrust of the proposed study is to determine under which
circumstances certain sets of data (e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of closed
geodesics, distances between boundary points, lens data) are sufficient to
completely determine the geometry of the spaces in question. In some cases it is
non-uniqueness that is interesting. For example, in cloaking the goal is to make
it the space in question (the object to be cloaked) appear from the outside like
a different space (empty space). One aspect of the optics theme of the proposal
is the design of multiple mirror (or lens) systems. An example to consider with
multiple mirrors is a periscope. By designing appropriately curved mirrors in
the periscope one can make for example a non-distorting wide angle periscope or
a non-distorting magnifying periscope.
