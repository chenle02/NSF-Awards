DMS-0203205&lt;br/&gt;Stephen A. Mitchell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work
is centered on K(1)-local homotopy theory &lt;br/&gt;and its applications to
algebraic K-theory. One goal of the &lt;br/&gt;project is to compute the mod 2
homology of the general linear &lt;br/&gt;group of a number ring. A broader
objective is a systematic &lt;br/&gt;study of K(1)-local homotopy theory from
the perspective of &lt;br/&gt;Iwasawa theory, with a view toward applications to
the algebraic&lt;br/&gt;K-theory spectra of number
rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most striking features of modern
mathematics is &lt;br/&gt;its essential unity. Time and again one finds that
seemingly &lt;br/&gt;unrelated branches of the subject interact in unexpected
ways. &lt;br/&gt;The interaction of of algebraic topology and number theory is
&lt;br/&gt;a noteworthy example of this phenomenon. Number theory began
&lt;br/&gt;as a "discrete" subject, then turned analytic in the 19th
&lt;br/&gt;century and increasingly geometric in the 20th. In the last
&lt;br/&gt;thirty years or so, algebraic topology (the study of
properties&lt;br/&gt;of geometric objects, such as curves and surfaces, that
remain invariant under deformation) has entered more and more into number-
theoretic questions. The proposed work will explore &lt;br/&gt;further the
remarkable connections between these two subjects, &lt;br/&gt;by analyzing the
topology of certain geometric objects that &lt;br/&gt;can be associated to
classical number-theoretic data.&lt;br/&gt;
