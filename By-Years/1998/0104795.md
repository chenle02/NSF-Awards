In 1999 West Nile virus (WNV) reached New York causing massive mortality in
American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). In Tompkins County crows have been
studied since 1990, and blood samples for DNA extraction are available. Since
WNV will most likely reach epidemic proportions in upstate NY in the summer of
2001, massive mortality can be expected among crows. This provides a unique
opportunity to determine which individuals can survive infection with WNV and
identify the genetic component of the resistance. Large numbers of crows will be
captured in the 2000-2001 winter and blood samples will be obtained for DNA
analysis and serology. DNA samples will be analyzed for differences in immune
response genes by, thus providing the basis to study genetic diversity before
and after the onset of the expected WNV epidemic. The hypothesis will be
validated if crows surviving the WNV epidemic differ in allele frequencies of
genes associated with immune responses.

Although it is assumed that pathogens co-evolve with the ability of the host to
mount effective immune responses, very few studies using natural populations
have tested the validity of this hypothesis. In order to understand the risks to
which populations are exposed when a new disease infects them, it is important
to compare populations before and after they are exposed to the new pathogen.
