Plant synthetic biology is rapidly becoming a field of great economic importance
in a broad variety of industries, including medicine, energy, and agriculture.
The pace of this advancing field requires the timely collective expertise of
scientists, chemical and biological engineers, and mathematicians to develop
accurate modeling systems, optimize high value chemical production, and
ultimately manufacture essential feedstocks on an industrial scale in a manner
which is both sustainable and economically viable.

The 6th International Conference on Plant Synthetic Biology, Bioengineering, and
Biotechnology will bring researchers working in academia and industry both
domestically and abroad to discuss newly uncovered scientific knowledge,
integrate these findings into groundbreaking solutions, and provide a forum that
can introduce students to the possibilities of a career in plant synthetic
biology. Organized by the Society of Biological Engineering (SBE), a
technological community within the American Institute of Chemical Engineers
(AIChE), this conference will host a diverse group of attendees, including both
established professionals in the field and students at all stages of their
careers. This award provides support for broadening participation of students
and early career professionals to attend the conference, participate in the
discussions, and network with representatives from industry, academia and
government.

The award is co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of
Integrative Organismal Systems (BIO/IOS), the Systems and Synthetic Biology
program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (BIO/MCB), and the
Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program in the Division of Chemical,
Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (ENG/CBET).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
