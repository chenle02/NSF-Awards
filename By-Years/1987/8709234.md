This proposal seeks partial funding for a new solid-source mass spectrometer to
be operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at Brown University. The
new instrument will replace a 15-year old machine that is not capable of the
high precision isotope measurements needed for modern geochronological and
isotopic tracer studies. Three faculty members in the Department are experienced
in mass spectroscopy, and they and their students will be the major users of the
new mass spectrometer for studies in regional tectonics of the Northern
Appalachians and related ore deposits.
