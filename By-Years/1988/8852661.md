The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer system is used to introduce
undergraduate chemistry and physics students to an important area of modern
spectroscopy. The instrument is used in introductory organic chemistry, advanced
organic chemistry, and quantum physics courses. This instrument is also used in
a newly developed integrated laboratory course in inorganic, analytical, and
physical chemistry. Students in the senior thesis programs in chemistry and
physics utilize this instrument extensively, and thus gain instrumental
experience with modern equipment similar to that they will encounter in industry
or graduate school. This hands-on experience also enhances understanding of the
theoretical concepts introduced in the lecture portion of the courses. The
grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF
award.
