This proposal seeks support for the acquisition of a shared high-performance
computing (HPC) cluster to be used for data- and computation-intensive
applications. The infrastructure supports research in three research areas:
computational biology and bioinformatics; machine learning and data fusion; and
infrastructure resilience and environmental sustainability. In each of these
areas, there are multiple projects that benefit from the infrastructure. This
HPC cluster is the first such public infrastructure in South Jersey. Coupled
with education and research programs focused on real-world problems, the HPC
cluster aids classroom instruction in relevant courses in parallel processing
and advanced computer architecture. HPC computation is incorporated into the
curriculum of many general courses including the courses in Biomedical
engineering, Computer Science, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mathematics,
Biological Sciences, Bioinformatics, and Electrical and Computer Engineering
program. The HPC facilitates expanded educational opportunities at the
undergraduate level in all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)
areas.
