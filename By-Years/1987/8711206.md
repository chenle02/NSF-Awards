The photochemical reaction center is the site in the photosynthetic membrane
where absorbed light energy is converted into chemical energy. While recent
biochemical evidence has supported the structural similarity between photosystem
II and the bacterial reaction center, components in the photosystem I (PSI)
reaction center complex remain more poorly defined. It is only in the past
several years that well-characterized higher plant PSI preparations which retain
the structural and functional aspects of PSI in vivo have been available. The
PSI reaction center complex of oxygen-evolving organisms, which is the focal
point of the current project, is less well characterized although it is known to
be functionally different than the other complexes since it contains a low
potential electron acceptor system. Dr. Malkin will examine the nature of the
polypeptide subunits in the isolated PSI complex and the association of specific
electron transfer carriers with specific subunits. The stoichiometry of the
individual subunits within the complex and changes in the content of these
subunits in response to environmental signal will also be defined.
