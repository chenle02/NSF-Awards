9316509 Whillans This award is for support for a three year program to study the
mass balance and ice stream mechanics in West Antarctica. This study will use
recently collected data to further test and refine models for mechanical control
on the ice streams and will refine mass balance calculations of the ice stream B
drainage system. The first calculations of mass balance for ice stream D and E
will also be made and an explanation will be sought for what appear to be
stranded old shear margins within the ice streams. This work will lead to a
better understanding of the reasons for the existence of the ice streams and the
mechanisms that control their movement. Because changes in the West Antarctic
ice sheet have direct impacts on global sea level it is important to understand
both the past and present controls on the ice streams so as to predict their
future course. ***
