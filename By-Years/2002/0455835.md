The purpose of this proposal is to establish standards and rubrics for assessing
robotics competitions in the middle and high school grades. Robotics
competitions are growing in popularity as a method for infusing science,
engineering, and technology in hands-on activities that engage students in
design and development. However, curricular materials for this field have not
been developed. Through the inclusion of experts and practitioners in robotics
and technology, this project will produce a document entitled "Robotics
Assessment and Instructional Explanation Report" that will be available to
developers and practitioners of this educational tool.
