0128914&lt;br/&gt;Orlando&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Terry Orlando and
students from MIT in a collaboration with Frank Wilhelm of the Department of
Physics at the University of Munich, Germany. The aim of the international
project is to maximize the quantum coherence of superconducting quantum bits for
possible use in a full-scale quantum computer. The US side will conduct
experiments, analyze quantum computing and control issues, and explore new
coupling methods between qubits along with intrinsic decoherence mechanisms in
the superconducting system. The German side will provide indispensible
theoretical models which will give quantitative predictions for application to
the experiments. The combined effort could result in new concepts of quantm
computation, the realization of quantum gates, numerical tools to allow the
explicit construction of control pulses, and new coupling schemes and
decoherence mechanisms. The work plan provides for extensive participation by
graduate students in the international travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;
