This is a request for travel funds for a Workshop titled "Advanced hybrid
systems theory for the control of networked systems" to be held in conjunction
with the 2002 World Congress of the International Federation of Automatic
Control (IFAC) in Barcelona, Spain on July 21, 2002. The requested funds will be
instrumental in enabling participation in the workshop of internationally
recognized US experts in the area of hybrid control systems and control
networks, as well as of young researchers, interested in this increasingly
important area.

This workshop is co-sponsored by the European Commission, IST Programme,
Brussels, Belgium (Dr. Alkis Konstantellos), which will partially cover the
travel expenses of the European participants and also cover the expenses for the
meeting facilities. The Organizers/Moderators of this workshop are Dr. Panos
Antsaklis from the University of Notre Dame, Indiana and Dr. Manfred Morari from
ETH, Zurich, Switzerland. Dr. Antsaklis is organizing the participation of US
researchers and Dr. Morari is organizing the EU participation.
