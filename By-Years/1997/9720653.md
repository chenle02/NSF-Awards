9720653 Pruitt Alabama's strategy to improve its R&D competitiveness is based on
a detailed analysis of Alabama' s economy, industrial enterprises, and research
and technology base. The strategy is to strengthen infrastructure in information
science and technology, materials science, and biological and environmental
science. Specific projects for which NSF support is requested are: (1)
Infrastructure to support Alabama and regional connections to Internet 2, which
will provide Alabama university researchers with high performance Internet
connections to National and regional networks; (2) integrated research
environment for intermeshed optoelectronics, which will develop an integrated
research environment to study systems in which optical and electronic elements
are intermeshed in close physical proximity; (3) Infrastructure in sensor
technologies for public safety which will develop sensitive, miniature, "smart"
detectors for identifying contaminants in food supplies, for detecting the
presence of explosives in cargo and luggage, and for monitoring of roadways for
hazardous conditions; (4) laser and photonics research infrastructure, which
will develop new optical imaging techniques for biomedical applications; (5)
infrastructure support for the Biomedical Implant Center, which will support
recruitment of additional faculty and students and purchase of sophisticated
instrumentation for improving the compatibility of medical implant devices; and
(6) infrastructure enhancement for marine sciences, which will support the
recruitment of experts in sedimentology and ecological modeling to strengthen
research in marine sciences. Each of these proposed activities have carefully
developed management plans and strategies to obtain financial support beyond the
period of EPSCoR funding.
