One of the major concerns confronting the nation is the deterioration of the
physical structures of the country. One of the oldest systems place is that of
buried pipelines which date back to colonial days. They are rupturing in many
places and causing inconvenience and added expense to the community to repair
them for continued service. This project will investigate several related
aspects of buried pipelines to determine their condition and rehabilitation
activities. Specifically, the Workshop will evaluate: loadings, effects of
temperature, materials, installation and repair practices, joining methods, and
general constructing practices. The results of this Workshop will be beneficial
to the researchers, decision makers at local, state and Federal levels, and
professional engineers engaged in the design and construction of pipeline
systems. The researchers are qualified to conduct this Workshop. The project is
recommended for an award. This award is for a period of one year and is a one
time award.
