The proposed research is concerned with questions at the crossroads of geometry
and partial differential equations. In recent years, methods involving partial
differential equations have become increasingly important in geometry: Perhaps
the most spectacular example is the Ricci flow method pioneered by Richard
Hamilton and the solution of the Poincare conjecture by Grigoriy Perelman; other
important advances were made in the understanding of minimal surfaces. These are
surfaces which minimize area and serve as models for soap films. The goal of
this project is to further our understanding of these and similar
equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PI and Gerhard Huisken are
planning to study singularity formation for geometric flows. Besides the Ricci
flow, a particular focus are flows for 2-convex hypersurfaces. The PI is also
planning to work on problems in minimal surface theory. In this direction, he is
planning to study the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on a minimal surface;
another direction is the classification of minimal annuli with free boundary.
Finally, the PI is planning to study the gluing approach to the construction of
solutions to geometric PDEs.
