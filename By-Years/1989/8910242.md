The objective of this symposium is to expose other researchers, agencies,
industry, and advanced graduate students to the use of dynamic centrifuge
modeling in the study of earthquake hazard mitigation. These applications
include the mechanisms causing failure in soil masses during earthquake- induced
ground motions, and the verification of techniques used to analyze the dynamic
behavior of soil and soil-structure interaction under these conditions.
Geotechnical centrifuge model experiments are used to simulate the effects of
the earth's gravity for cases where gravity effects are important; the examples
considered here occur in the deformation of soil masses. Recent centrifuge model
tests have verified or expanded upon the use of geotechnical centrifuge model
tests in earthquake engineering research; namely to study the earthquake
response of dams containing liquefiable soils, the base motion tests in earth
dams, the liquefaction behavior of soil masses, the mechanism of flow slides,
the stability of reinforced earth embankments, soil-pile interaction, and soil-
pile-building interaction. The objective of this workshop is to present these
results quickly to the earthquake engineering community. The lecturers are
researchers actively involved in developing these new techniques.
