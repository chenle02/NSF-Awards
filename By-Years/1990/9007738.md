This equipment grant is to improve the capability for automatic image
processing as applied to research in watershed hydrology to determine water
retention characteristics of basins, and to estimate runoff production. Data
extracted from maps of soil-type distribution, topography, rainfall distribution
and land use, among other information, will be used also to estimate the
potential of floods. The image processing equipment will be used in teaching
students and training researchers, and in implementing algorithmic innovations,
software development and research progress.
