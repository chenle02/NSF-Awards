Many animals migrate during specific periods of the year, moving between
wintering and breeding locations. Specifically this research will test the role
of overwintering habitat quality in the timing of migration initiation, duration
of migration and arrival at the breeding area, as well as ability of Black-and-
white-warblers to compensate for the quality of the overwintering habitat while
stopping at refugia to refuel during migration. This research will link the
timing and distance of migration to subsequent reproductive success during the
breeding period and ability to successfully survive the winter using the
presence of stable isotopes in feathers and amount of plasma metabolites to
quantify an individual's condition. Information about the activity at the
stopover areas will allow assessment of the carry-over of nutrients and
condition between breeding, migration and overwintering and the integration of
all phases of the annual life history cycle. These data will enhance our
understanding of how the different phases of an individual's life cycle
influence each other. In addition, the project will also provide cross-
disciplinary biological training for graduate and undergraduate students from
underrepresented groups.
