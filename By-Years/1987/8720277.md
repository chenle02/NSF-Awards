Under this project a prototype derivation system for scientific programs,
designed to facilitate the production of efficient implementations on parallel
processors will be developed. The system will be based upon a "wide-spectrum"
language that supports all phases of the software development process including
specification, design, prototyping, optimization, testing, debugging and
maintenance. Building on their previous work on the scientific programming
systems - the R programming environment, the R validation system, the Russell
compiler and the PFC system for automatic detection of parallelsism - the
project team will implement a sophisticated programming environment to provide
automatic or semi-automatic support for program transformation and refinement at
all stages of the derivation process. It will be possible to augment the
environment's standard transformation support by producing libraries of design
rules written in the wide-spectrum language itself and mechanisms for validation
of refinement steps will be built in at every level. To take advantage of the
existing base of scientific software, the system will support the integration of
FORTRAN subprograms into programs written in the wide-spectrum language.
Furthermore, it will be possible to translate a low-level dialect of the
language to FORTRAN 77, extended by the inclusion of primitives for the explicit
specification of parallelism. The resulting FORTRAN program, typically
consisting of many small procedures, can be optimized to high efficiency using
interprocedural analysis and optimization techniques developed for the R
project.
