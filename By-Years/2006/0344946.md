In honey bees, female larvae can develop into either queens or workers. For
hundreds of years, biologists and beekeepers have wondered how this happens. The
immediate cause of individuals choosing to become one or the other type of
female is nutrition. It is also known that hormones trigger the developmental
switch to flip towards queen or worker development. The objective of this
research is to understand how nutritional differences are translated into
hormonal signals that cause individuals with essentially the same genes to
develop very differently. Modern molecular methods will be combined with
classical experimental manipulation to determine how young bee larvae respond to
different types of nutrition and how these differences are increased by
resulting hormonal signals. The results will be useful in understanding not only
honey bees, but also other insects that use similar sorts of switches, such as
ants, termites, aphids, and grasshoppers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
