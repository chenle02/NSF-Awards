This is a fundamental engineering research project to characterize the
mechanical and biocompatibility properties of calcium-phosphate which has been
sputtered onto a titanium implant. A better fundamental understanding of this
type of material coating, which may be very similar to biological calcium-
phosphate, could accelerate the development of coatings for dental and
prosthetic implants.
