This Phase I SBIR project studies the use of damping elements for earthquake
resistance of flexible frame buildings. A new type of passive damping mechanism
is studied that is potentially superior to conventional damping mechanisms: a
resonant viscous damper, or RVD. The RVD will be placed in the same locations as
conventional earthquake dampers, but because it will possess an internal
resonance tuned to a building's fundamental resonant frequency. As a result, it
will offer much higher levels of passive damping. The objective of this project
is to develop a practical, reliable, and economical damping device that can be
applied to a broad range of medium- sized buildings. The Phase I goal is to
validate the RVD concept by both analysis and testing of an engineering model.
Current earthquake dampers are designed to provide 20-30% structural damping. If
successful, the RVD will provide over twice this damping in the primary mode of
a building without any large increases in frame stiffness nor any large added
masses. The RVD will also reduce motion due to wind sway. An RVD will offer
designers in any field of structural dynamics (civil, aerospace, mechanical) an
attractive alternative solution to many vibration suppression problems.
