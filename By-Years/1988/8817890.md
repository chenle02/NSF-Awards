Analytical instrumentation method development will be supported. Methods for
determining the molecular weight and density distribution profiles of
heterogeneous low density lipoprotein samples. The optical system of the
analytical ultracentrifuge will be further developed. The instrument is no
longer manufactured, but the need for analytical centrifugation has increased.
New, recombinant proteins must be thoroughly characterized and many types of
proteins, including those with unusual charge distributions and modifications
such as lipoproteins can not even crudely be studied with gel electrophoresis.
