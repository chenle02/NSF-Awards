This grant will support measurements of the nuclear electromagnetic moments of
radioactive nuclei by a Westmont College faculty member and his students.
Westmont is an undergraduate institution and undergraduate student involvement
in the research, which is mostly carried out at national laboratories with large
accelerator facilities, is a major thrust of this program. The students will
also carry out data analysis at Westmont. The measurements will test, and
advance the development of, theoretical models of the structure of nuclei far
from stability. The students will learn laboratory techniques as well as
critical analysis of data. They will be exposed to the front-line research
efforts of national laboratories.
