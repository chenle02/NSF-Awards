9301345 Stanton The research entails questions of geometry and analysis
concerning real hypersufaces in complex euclidean spaces. Techniques involve
heat kernel methods and asymptotic analysis analogous to those employed in
elliptic boundary value problems. Problems concerning the rigidity of these
hypersurfaces will also be considered. Such research has possible significant
applications to branches of mathematical physics, particularly general
relativity theory.
