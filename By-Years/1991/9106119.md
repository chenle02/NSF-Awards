This project will consider semilinear partial differential equations with
critical exponents. Topics to be studied include the Kazdan-Warner problem in
bounded regions with Dirichlet boundary condition, further analysis of the
constant in the Sobolev inequality, and multiplicity of solutions for the
Neumann problem. These problems are motivated by questions arising in areas as
diverse as differential geometry and mathematical biology. Basic questions such
as the existence of surfaces with prescribed curvature or the properties of the
equilibria of biological population models will benefit from the results of this
project.
