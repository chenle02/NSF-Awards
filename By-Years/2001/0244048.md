EEC-0244048 &lt;br/&gt;Cleveland Clinic Foundation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award renews funding for three years for a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation's (CCF) Lerner
Research Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering. Eight students per
year, recruited from throughout the United States, will work a nominally six-
month-long term at the CCF. Students will have a unique opportunity to
participate in state-of-the-art research. The research focus will be
engineering-related, with opportunities in biomedical fields such as
cardiovascular assist and replacement, biomechanics, image processing, cell
separation processes, biomedical imaging, and BioMEMS (Biomedical applications
of Microelectromechanical Systems). The Intellectual Merit of this activity
includes opportunities for students that are U.S. citizens or permanent
residents to engage in cutting-edge research and thus make a unique research
contribution through their REU project. It is anticipated that significant
Broader Impact will result from this activity, in part through the program's
focus on encouraging student participants to consider research-related careers
as a viable career opportunity. This focus helps to impact the national need to
increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents that have the
capacity and interest for career opportunities in research-related fields. In
addition, this program seeks to address the national need to increase the
participation of population groups under-represented in science and engineering
in the United States by actively recruiting students from these under-
represented groups.
