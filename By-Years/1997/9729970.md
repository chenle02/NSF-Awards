This award provides support for a systematic study of the minimum enstrophy
principle and maximum entropy principle as they apply to problems of potential
vorticity mixing in hurricanes and larger-scale tropical circulations. Within
the context of a barotropic, nondivergent model, theoretical predictions will be
extended from the symmetric to the asymmetric case. Of particular interest will
be the determination of the bifurcations between the symmetric and asymmetric
structures predicted by the maximum entropy vortex arguments. The results of
such an asymmetric theory should reveal what kind of steady state asymmetric
features are possible in hurricanes. Outside the context of the non-divergent
model, both direct numerical integrations and theoretical predictions will be
generalized to the shallow water equations (on the plane and on the sphere).
This generalization will allow a distinction between vorticity and potential
vorticity and a distinction between enstrophy and potential enstrophy, and will
allow the energy constraint to include both kinetic and potential energy. The
generalization to the quasi-static primitive equations in isentropic coordinates
should then follow from the shallow water case. Each step in this investigation
will help to improve understanding (and, ultimately, prediction) of the
nonlinear evolution of large-scale atmospheric flows.
