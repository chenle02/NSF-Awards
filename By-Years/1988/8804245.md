Eight undergraduate geology students will spend the summer doing research at
the Department of Geology at the College of William and Mary. Library research,
field work, and laboratory investigation will be combined in each project to
give students a broad range of experience. The emphasis will be on indepencent
work by the students under the guidance and in the direct field of interest of
the research supervisors, and each student will have his or her own research
project to work on. The research accomplishments of each student will be
presented in a formal written report and the students will also be encouraged to
present their findings at a professional meeting. Research projects willbe on
the geology of the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Valley and Ridge provinces of
Virginia. Coastal Plain projects may be on paleoecologic studies, environmental
studies on groundwater contamination and pollution of lakes, and investigation
of karst development. Piedmont projects may be on the petrology of granite of
diabase, and the structure and stratigraphy of the Triassic Richmond Basin.
Valley and Ridge projects may study concretions and limestore beds in Devonian
shales, cyclic sedimentation in Ordovician limestones, and detailed structure of
a thrust fault.
