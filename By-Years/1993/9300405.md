Twelve students will participate in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
program in microelectronic materials and processing at Purdue. The Schools of
Chemical, Electrical, and Materials Engineering, which have been sharing
undergraduate courses as well as research on electronic materials and processing
for several years, participate in this program. Students will be recruited from
regional universities and universities with high minority enrollments for summer
research projects. Undergraduate students from Purdue will be able to perform
summer or academic year research. The focus of the REU site will be the
synthesis, processing, properties, structure, and performance of microelectronic
materials, and the interrelationships among these aspects. Specific projects
include anisotropic etching of microelectronic this films, selective epitaxial
growth and insulator degradation, processing on patterned substrates,
fundamentals of metal contacts to semiconductors, and integration of oxide films
with Si technologies. The goals of the REU are to introduce students - with
emphasis on women and minorities - to independent research on electronic
materials and their processing, to develop and enhance the student's creativity
and originality, to develop outstanding candidates for graduate programs, to
demonstrate the excitement and rewards from successful research, and to prepare
B.S. graduates who will excel in industrial Research and Development
environments.
