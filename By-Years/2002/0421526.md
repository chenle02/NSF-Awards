0421526 Faris The research presented in this proposal involves the fabrication
and subsequent use of a frequency-domain imaging system. This system will be the
only system of its kind and will allow for high-speed, sensitive imaging of in
vivo tumors, and small animals. In addition, this research will also allow for
the imaging of chemical reactions taking place in microdroplets.
