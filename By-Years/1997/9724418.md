This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Pomona College acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: (1) studies of the conformational behavior of the antibiotic
erythromycin and its derivatives, (2) studies of the interactions of ligands and
receptors at the molecular level, and (3) studies the experimental and
theoretical aspects of NMR isotope effects and the synthesis and conformational
analysis of structurally modified natural products. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
