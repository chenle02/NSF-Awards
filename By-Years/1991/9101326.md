This program seeks to use non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation
techniques to develop an molecular level understanding of the transport
properties of Newtonian fluids and mixtures and to the non-Newtonian rheological
properties of polymeric fluids. For Newtonian fluids, particular attention will
be focused on the viscosity, thermal conductivity, and mutual diffusion in
representative liquid mixtures. For non-newtonian fluids, attention will be
directed towards the stress tensor in both steady-state and transient states.
