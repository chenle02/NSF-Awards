9601800 Pedraza A laser deposition and processing system consisting of a high-
energy, high-repetition pulsed excimer laser and a processing/deposition chamber
will be established at the University of Tennessee. Continuing and new research
activities supported by this acquisition include fundamental studies of pulsed
laser processing of ceramics and metal-semiconductor couples; pulsed laser
deposition and bonding of bioceramics to metal alloys; photothermal and
photochemical mechanisms for laser activation and encapsulation; and synthesis
of super-hard materials using energetic laser ablation. The combination of the
laser and processing/deposition chamber will enhance presently aging and
outdated capabilities by permitting depositions to be carried out quickly; by
making possible combinations of film depositions and in-situ laser processing
that are currently inaccessible; and by facilitating investigations at elevated
substrate temperatures. %%% The research instrumentation will be used to support
important materials research in the area of pulsed laser processing of metals
and ceramics; to broaden this research by providing new experimental
capabilities not currently available at the university; and to facilitate inter-
departmental and inter- laboratory research collaborations within the University
of Tennessee and with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. ***
