This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in mathematics
between Lawrence E. Morris at Clark University and Anne-Marie Aubert at the
Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, France. The objective of their research is to
investigate various problems in representation theory of p-adic groups related
to `level zero` representations. Representation theory of p-adic groups is an
important and active field in number theory. The collaboration takes advantage
of the complementary expertise of the U.S. and French investigators in
representation theory.
