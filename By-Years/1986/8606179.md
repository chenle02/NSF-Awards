This project will expand the understanding of proteins in bioprocesses where
there proteins are subjected to environments much different from their native
biological milieu. Careful investigations of the processing properties of an
immobilized enzyme or bound antibody sorbent are to be coordinated with probes
of the molecular configuration of such a protein. These fundamental structural
probes provide a crucial link for understanding the connections among
formulation, use conditions, and functional characteristics of immobilized
proteins. All of this research will be conducted in an environment which employs
mathematical modeling to assist in interpreting and organizing the data.
