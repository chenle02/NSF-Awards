The project focusses on new ways to enhance the teaching of Research Methods in
Psychology. This course develops skills in critical thinking, applied problem
solving, and the ability to collect, analyze, and summarize data. Computers
facilitate this training by reducing the time required for setting up
experiments and testing new hypotheses. A workstation with video projection
capabilities will enable the instructor to present classroom demonstrations as
well as step-by-step training in the use of software that supports more than 50
different experiments. This project is unusually cost- effective because the
university already provides a laptop computer to every student. The software
that students learn about in the classroom is installed on their own computers,
effectively resulting in a private workstation for each student This enables the
students to design experiments that can be conducted in the dormitories, campus
centers, or the field.
