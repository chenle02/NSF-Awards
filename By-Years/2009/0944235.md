This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 research project focuses
on the development of a game-like Web solution that helps parents encourage
tweens, ages 8-12, to use educational content online. Today's tweens spend a lot
of time playing games online. A Project Tomorrow study found that only 3% of
elementary school students say they do not play video games. This statistic is
deeply troubling to many parents. In fact, research indicates that most parents
worry more about the impact media, including video games, have on their children
than they do about drug use or sexual activity. The project outcome is a Web-
based, game-like solution that helps parents encourage and motivate tweens to
become consumers of existing educational Web content. Additionally, the project
aggregates content from trusted partners and provides a novel incentive system
to 'spark' interest in STEM subjects. The research objective is to determine
whether the project's tools and interface offer sufficient motivation to
stimulate increased interest and learning online.

The project will focus on STEM content and will aggregate that content from
previously funded NSF projects. Eventually, the project outcomes can be used to
address other disciplines and societal issues. The project's 'trending
functionality' will also help parents and children find and expand interest in
STEM topics. For example, a parent whose child demonstrates a consistent
interest in dinosaurs may not realize how that interest is related to geology
and archeology. The algorithm enables that connection and will suggest new
challenging activities. Parents will also receive: information about how to
discuss and encourage their children's growing interests in STEM subjects;
alerts about regional events, such as museum visits and whale watches; and
suggestions regarding suitable books and educational products.
