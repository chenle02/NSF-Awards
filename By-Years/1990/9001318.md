This dissertation will compare five ladino communities of rural Guatemala on the
basis of their various agricultural production systems. The objective of the
study is to assess the differential impact each of these production systems has
on the social mobility (i.e., changing standards of living and access to the
means of production over time) of small family farms. The study will use data
already collected by the Institute of Nutrition for Central American and Panama
and data that will be generated by original fieldwork. Data on the seasonality
of production practices, cropping patterns, time allocation of household
members, and fluctuations in household income will be collected by interviews
with husbands and wives at frequent intervals.
