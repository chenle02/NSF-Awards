This project will study singular perturbation problems, fully nonlinear first-
and-second-order pde's and control theory, mechanics (porous-medium equation),
and nonlinear waves. A large class of singular perturbation problems related to
reaction-diffusion equations or systems which model physical, chemical and
biological phenomena, in which fronts develop naturally for large times will be
considered. A class of singular perturbations related to gas kinetics and
radiative transfer equations will be studied from the point of view of a new
methodology introduced by the PI. Fully nonlinear pde's and their relations to
control theory and differential games, questions related to the theory of
porous-medium equations, the stability of waves in fluids, and the singularities
of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation will be encompassed. These studies find
applications in topics such as flame propagation, phase transitions, and
evolution of populations.
