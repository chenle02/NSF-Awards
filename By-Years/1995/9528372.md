AST 9528372 Collaborative Project: Independently Determined Distances to the
Magellanic Clouds. Dr. Thomas Barnes at the University of Texas and Dr. Thomas
Moffett at Purdue University expect to complete the determination of distances
to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds using a technique that is independent
of the standard extragalactic distance methods. Distances are currently obtained
using the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation, the RR Lyrae mean absolute
magnitude, and main-sequence fitting techniques. These standard methods disagree
and lead to uncertain distance scales. Drs. Barnes and Moffett will use the
visual surface brightness technique to determine distances to the Magellanic
Clouds with the intent of improving the distance measures to these two key
galaxies.
