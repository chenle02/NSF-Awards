Building on recent work on mock theta functions and mock modular forms, the PI
proposes an ambitious program to investigate the interplay between mock modular
forms and the theory of L-functions, elliptic curves, and representation theory.
The PI will also aim to generalize the theory of harmonic Maass forms to seek
explicit constructions of Maass cusp forms.&lt;br/&gt;The PI has had success in
the related problem of explicitly computing harmonic forms. New results in these
areas should have implications for the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, the
arithmetic of critical values of L-functions, Donaldson invariants, and integer
partitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research in number theory has the
potential for far reaching real world applications. Number theory plays a
central role in cryptography, internet security, and the infrastructure of
emerging electronic markets. Further theoretical advances in the proposed
research will also have implications in theoretic physics (string theory), and
probability theory (e.g. tumor modelling via special cellular automata).
