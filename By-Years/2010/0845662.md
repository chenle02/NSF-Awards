Over the past few decades, there has been great progress in cryptography towards
provable security. Security properties for many cryptographic techniques are
based, provably, on simple computational assumptions (such as the hardness of
factoring), with strong proofs. Symmetric cryptography algorithms such as
blockciphers and hash functions are typically designed without the benefit of
strong proofs of security. There is good reason for this: for these algorithms
especially, speed is an essential concern, and provable security tends to be
attached to heavy computational methods such as modular exponentiation.
Nonetheless, symmetric cryptographic algorithms do seem to be secure, able to
resist all known attacks. This project seeks to expand on our theoretical
understanding of the structural design principles underlying popular symmetric
algorithms, with a particular focus on how these structures are able to
strengthen simple building blocks into secure
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is driven by four central
principles: (1) Focus on structures -- by considering the structures used in
practice that connect simple components, rather than the lowest-level
constructions themselves, results will apply to a wide range of potential
designs. (2) Minimize assumptions -- the research must be aggressive in modeling
underlying components as weak, so as to understand how they are strengthened by
the structures that use them. (3) Avoid asymptotics -- in practice, a security
parameter must be chosen and fixed, and asymptotic guarantees of security are of
little comfort. Favor precise analysis and avoid inherently asymptotic scenarios
like assuming computational limitations. (4) Focus on positive results -- while
negative results (that is, attacks) inform the development of positive
solutions, this is an area in which negative results are already far more
advanced than positive ones. The research focuses mainly on blockcipher design
and hash function design and connections between them.&lt;br/&gt;
