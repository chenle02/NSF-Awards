This research is focussed on the electrochemical synthesis of metallic
multilayered specimens. Four metallic multilayers, cobalt/copper, chromium/iron,
chromium/cobalt, and iron/copper, have been shown recently to exhibit giant
magneto-resistance effects. The multilayers are produced through sophisticated
electrochemistry processing carefully controlled to produce defined variations
in layer thicknesses and interface sharpness. High resolution transmission
electron microscopy combined with computer imaging is employed to examine the
perfection of the layers, the epitaxy, and defect structure. Radial distribution
analysis details nearest neighbor environments. Magnetic techniques are used to
probe interface properties. %%% This research should enhance understanding of
the processing and nature of metallic multilayers. Such materials have many
potential applications, for example, magnetic heads and magnetic storage
elements.
