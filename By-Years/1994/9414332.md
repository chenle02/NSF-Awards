9414332 Chen This research investigates an approach that will enable advances in
design and control technologies for advanced manufacturing systems. The purpose
of this research is twofold: (1) to design and develop a neural network based
decision support system for use in design and configuration of advanced
manufacturing cells and cell control systems, and (2) to explore an intelligent
shop floor control framework for on-line scheduling and control of Flexible
Manufacturing Systems. This innovative new design and operation methodology will
be illustrated through an implementation exercise, at laboratory settings, in
controlling a cluster of computer workstation which simulates the stochastic
operating characteristics of shop-floor manufacturing machinery/equipment. The
intelligent shop floor control scheme constitutes an integrated environment with
innovative cell control techniques which will not only assure that feasible
control actions be taken but also that the continuously improved control
decisions be implemented as cell operation time goes by.
