The objective of the proposed research is to test theoretical predictions that
diffusion can be reduced significantly by alloy design. This is important
because the major factor in the degradation of high-temperature alloys is rapid
atomic diffusion. Experimental measurements of diffusivities in multicomponent
alloys, using the new "square root diffusivity method", will permit the optimum
compositions to be identified. Ternary alloys to be investigated will be based
on the composition Ni-1OCr-1OA1 with small variations therefrom, while
quaternary compositions will consist of the basic alloy with small additions of
Ta, Mo or Hf.
