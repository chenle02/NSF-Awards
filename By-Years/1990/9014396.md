This research will consist of a rigorous systematic methodology for generating
the initial topology or layout of structural members based on mathematical
models and physical principles. The new method of homogenization provides a new
and exciting approach for addressing rigorously how structural topologies may be
optimized. This fundamental new capability offers a unified scheme for carrying
concept evolution through detail layout design, using rigorous principles
together with appropriate empirical knowledge, so that realistic, manufacturable
shapes can be obtained.
