With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor DeRosa of Penn.
State-Delaware County Campus will characterize seminal compounds in the
2-aminopyrrole class of compounds. This will include both chemical and physical
characterization as well as reaction profiles. From this work, it is anticipated
that the electronic effect of the 2-amino substituent will be clearly
established. Further, tautomeric isomers and roles of hydrogen exchange will be
determined. Pyrrole is a fundamental building block in biological systems and
its chemical reactions are quite significant. This project will elaborate the
effects that substituents have on the chemistry of this important class of
compounds. This research is also designed to have a major impact on
undergraduate students which reflects on the future scientific enterprise.
