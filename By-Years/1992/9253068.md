The proposed research will investigate the policy contexts and organizational
structures within schools that influence mathematics and science teaching, and
in turn, student learning. National goals for science and mathematics education
call for major improvements in the level of student understanding and problem
solving ability. Two strategies for achieving these goals, as envisioned by
many, are local school redesign and national student assessments. The proposed
research will help fill important gaps in the knowledge required to advance
these strategies toward improved math and science teaching in secondary schools.
There are two components of the research. The first, analyzes context effects on
teaching and corrects a bias in prior studies of educational effectiveness in
favor of the school as the sole unit of analysis. The other component seeks to
improve upon the NEL:88 program for assessing desired learning outcomes,
especially in relation to teacher context effects on student understanding. This
component will develop subscales for NELS tests that help distinguish teaching
effects on different kinds of student learning. Together these components, which
build on prior work of the researcher, promise new knowledge and recommended
strategies to support systemic reform of U.S. science and mathematics education.
