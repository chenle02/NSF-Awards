9416306 Kenig This award provides funding for group travel of junior
investigators and graduate students to participate in a research program at the
International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, Scotland. The
research focus is at the interface of harmonic analysis and partial differential
equations. A number of outstanding mathematical scientists will be in residence
during the program working informally with the visitors and conducting seminars
on various topics. These include such areas as harmonic analysis related to
curvature and oscillatory integrals, well-posedness and local smoothing effects
in nonlinear hyperbolic and dispersive partial differential equations. The
program will capitalize on applications of previously developed ideas while
fostering growth in what is the most promising new directions in harmonic
analysis and differential equations. Many leading experts from the U.S. and U.K.
will participate in this activity, which is also receiving financial support
from the SERC (of Great Britain). ***
