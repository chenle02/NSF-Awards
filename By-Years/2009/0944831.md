This SBIR Phase I project will develop a hydropneumatic accumulator for fluid
power systems with specific applications to hybrid vehicles. The unique aspect
of the accumulator design is the leaf spring construction which has the
necessary air channel communications that in turn influences the heat transfer
characteristics. The ability to influence the heat transfer will in turn provide
a way to improve the regenerative aspects of the accumulator. The problem is
significant in single accumulator systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be in the many
application areas of fluid power systems. In the specific application to a
hybrid vehicle, there could be a fuel economy improvement. There will be a
trade-off between vehicle weight and reduced fueling benefits. However, any
efficiency in a fluid power system would translate into improved system
efficiency, resulting in broad commercial impact.&lt;br/&gt;
