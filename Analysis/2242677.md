Turbulence is ubiquitous in nature, playing a fundamental role in a multitude of
physical theories, from atmospheric and oceanic dynamics to the birth of stars.
This project is dedicated to an investigation into hydrodynamic and wave
turbulence, both of which, at the core predict cascades of energy. The principal
aim of this supported research is to better understand these energy cascades.
The project is divided into two projects: a study of non-uniqueness of weak
solutions to equations arising in hydrodynamics, and a rigorous approach to the
derivation of the kinetic wave equation in wave turbulence theory. The focus of
the first project will be to utilize the theoretical tool of convex integration
to build theoretical energy cascades in order to resolve long standing open
problems related to weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. The
overarching goal of the second project will be to rigorously determine the
validity of the kinetic wave equation which is theorized to predict turbulence
phenomena in a host settings such as water waves, plasma physics and climate
science. The project will draw on a diverse set of mathematical tools from
analysis, number theory and statistical physics.
