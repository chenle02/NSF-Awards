HRD 04-54569&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MentorNet will host a workshop for engineering
researchers and higher education faculty/administrators attending the annual
WEPAN meeting (Women in Engineering Programs &amp; Advocates Network) to share
and further disseminate new findings and best practices about mentoring,
particularly mentoring via the Mentor Net electronic/virtual systems. An
additional focus is the targeted inclusion of members of the National
Association for Minority Engineering Program Administrators (NAMEPA) in the
workshop. The project plan includes basic evaluation, including pre- (formative)
and post-workshop evaluations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muller cites data from a
recent MentorNet evaluation and research project that was performed by SJB
Consulting (contracted by MentorNet) that indicates that women of color
participating in MentorNet's one-on-one mentoring program find the experience
particularly helpful - African-Americans at 76 percent and Hispanics/Latinos at
79 percent, compared with Asian-Americans at 69 percent and Anglo-/European
Americans at 72 percent. The study also reported that African-American and
Hispanic/Latino mentors also had preferentially good experiences-with their
development of mentoring skills, commitment, and confidence increasing
significantly. The activity should provide a learning opportunity for WEPAN and
NAMEPA members to acquire some skills and knowledge from MentorNet's extensive
investment and interaction in mentoring. The workshop should impact (increase)
the retention of women and minorities in engineering education, and their
preparation for entry, perseverance, and promotion in the engineering
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;
