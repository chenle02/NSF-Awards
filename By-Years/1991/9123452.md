The goal of this research proposed is to develop parallel sparse system solvers
for symmetric indefinite and non-symmetric linear systems such as those
occurring in computational fluid dynamics, develop parallel techniques for
solving time-dependent problems, and construct a rapid prototyping environment
for developing and experimenting with algorithms in sparse matrix computations
on shared and distributed memory multiprocessors. In particular, the following
will be examined: o parallel solution schemes for solving Stokes-like linear
problems arising in CFD and other augmented Lagrangian problems such as interior
point methods of linear programming, o incomplete Newton methods with Krylov or
row projection iterative solvers for the inner iteration, o solution of time-
dependent problems using high-order parallel methods in time, o defining and
developing sparse matrix primitives analogous to the highly effective BLAS-3's
for dense computations, and o implementing sparse factorization and solution
schemes. The goal is portable efficiency and scalability, by exploiting
parallelism on multiple levels. This in turn will allow the work to be used
across a wide spectrum of existing and future computer architectures, instead of
simply a particular machine.
