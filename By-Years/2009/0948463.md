Inspired by the dramatic recent progress in neutrino physics and the exciting
plans for future experiments to address the open neutrino questions, Fermilab
will be hosting The Neutrino Physics Summer School from July 6-17, 2009. This
school will provide broad coverage of neutrino physics, including the
fundamentals, experimental challenges, theoretical perspectives, and possible
future directions. The goals of the Neutrino Physics Summer School are to
provide formal, structured training and classes for advanced graduate students
and post-docs. At least 80 students are expected to attend. The National Science
Foundation, Fermilab, the Fermilab Research Alliance LLC, Argonne National
Laboratory, and the University of North Carolina are providing support for the
school. The NSF funds in this award will be used to pay registration fees for 15
students to attend the school.
