9554465 Royster The Appalachia Rural Systemic Initiative (ARSI), a consortium of
education and community stakeholders, seeks to accomplish significant and
sustainable improvements in the science and mathematics attainment of students
in the Appalachian region shared by six states. Schools in RSI-eligible counties
in Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia will
be partners in Resource Collaboratives, coalitions of schools, community
organizations, institutions of higher education, and through telecommunications
and internet connectivity, information resources internationally. Improvement in
the instruction offered to K-14 students in participating schools will be
accomplished by: providing on-site and ongoing in-service training leadership
and parental involvement activities linking geographically isolated classrooms
to classrooms, laboratories, and libraries outside the region advances in the
level and quality of science, mathematics and technology courses taken by pre-
service teachers in regional colleges. ARSI is uniquely positioned to capitalize
on the extensive electronic networking plans currently in place in several of
the participating states, as well as the educational reform efforts on- going in
its partner states. ***
