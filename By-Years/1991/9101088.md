Pyrenomycetous ascomycetes have been the subject of numerous studies that have
produced phylogenetic hypotheses that remain untested. The stumbling block has
been a paucity of diagnostic characters above the ordinal level. It is the goal
of this project to infer relationships, i.e., natural groupings, among and
within orders of fungi that traditionally have been grouped as pyrenomycetes.
This phylogeny will be based upon the nucleotide sequences of both nuclear
coding regions (SSU rDNA and vATPase). Congruency between the two data sets will
be strong support for the relationships in question, whereas incongruencies will
question such relationships. The resulting phylogeny will be compared to those
of previous studies that have employed characters from morphology,
ultrastructure and cell biology. By using two independent molecular data sets we
will be able to discern between the gene phylogenies and the species phylogeny.
