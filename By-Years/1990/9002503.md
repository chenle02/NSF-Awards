This award provides partial support for the U.S. Panel on Wind and Seismic
Effects. The Panel was created in 1968. Annual meetings alternate between Japan
and the U.S. The Panel develops technologies that advance engineering design and
construction practices and improve the quality-of-life. The Panel is composed of
16 Federal agencies who participate in nine task committees. The task committees
focus on specific national issues, e.g., earthquake hazards reduction, buried
pipelines, transportation and telecommunication systems, repair and retrofit of
structures. The results of task committee workshops and conferences are shared
at the annual joint meeting and usually published as proceedings.
