The UKanTeach Noyce Phase II Scholarship and Stipend Program is addressing the
critical shortage of mathematics and science teachers in the region by
developing a collaboration involving the University and high needs school
districts. Ten scholarships are being awarded each year, for four years, with 32
different students supported by the UKanTeach Noyce Project. Excellent program
enrichment activities that include mentor-teacher support, Saturday and summer
workshops, and a careful selection process is increasing the likelihood of a
successful Noyce program. The project's goal is a doubling of the number of
talented secondary mathematics and science teachers prepared by the UKanTeach
Program. The broader impact stems from the ability to recruit a formerly
untapped pool of talent: students earning a degree in science and mathematics
and a teaching license in four years. The intellectual merit of the program lies
in the highly qualified and experienced project personnel and in a robust and
supportive induction program for Noyce Scholars. This project is advancing
knowledge and understanding by exploring the success of creative recruitment,
preparation and retention strategies for mathematics and science teachers. The
Scholars are being prepared, through coursework and by early field experience
teaching in high needs schools, to take positions in districts that have high
numbers of economically disadvantaged students.
