9505003 Davis The project of Professors Ruth Charney and Michael Davis involves
problems in topology, geometry, and geometric group theory. The main focus of
the project is the study of piecewise Euclidean polyhedra of nonpositive
curvature (in the sense of Gromov's CAT(0) inequality). Understanding the local
geometry of such spaces is equivalent to understanding when polyhedra with
piecewise spherical metrics are "large" (i.e., satisfy the CAT(1) inequality).
This project attempts to answer a number of questions concerning "large"
piecewise spherical polyhedra, as well as the related question of when a
negatively curved Riemannian manifold supports a piecewise hyperbolic CAT(0)
metric (with B. Okun). Charney's research also includes the study of Artin
groups via geometric techniques; Davis's includes the study of certain singular
fiber bundles with applications to smooth torus actions on manifolds (with R.
Scott). Groups are algebraic structures abstracting the concept of symmetry,
which is pervasive in mathematics and mathematical physics. The field of
geometric group theory has, historically, involved ideas from several areas of
mathematics -- topology, combinatorics, and group theory. The recent
introduction of techniques patterned on differential geometry has led to
exciting new developments in the field as well as new applications to problems
in topology. One of these techniques, a version of "nonpositive curvature" for
topological metric spaces, has played a major role in these developments. The
project of Charney and Davis aims at a better understanding of this notion of
curvature and how it may be applied to problems in topology and group theory.
