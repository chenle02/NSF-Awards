9357526 Montelione Dr. Montelione will use NMR to characterize internal motions
in macromolecular complexes and intermolecular interfaces by measurements of
amide proton exchange rates and heteronuclear relaxation rates. He will measure
saturation-transfer between solvent and surface amide proton sites using pulsed
field gradient heteronuclear NMR experiments. Dr. Montelione will also use new
technology for characterizing short-lived bound water molecules on the surfaces
of proteins and determine how these molecules are displaced by ligand binding or
complex formation. These represent the next generation of techniques needed for
studying molecular recognition. %%% The proposed research involves development
of heteronuclear multidimensional NMR methods, biotechnology, and computer
software for characterizing molecular recognition in macromolecular complexes.
The technology will be applied in studies of protein-protein and protein-nucleic
acid complexes. ***
