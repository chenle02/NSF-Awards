9712230 Kleinrock This project entails a detailed analysis of recently collected
high-resolution bathymetry, sonar imagry, and photographic data from the TAG
(Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse) area near 26 degrees north on the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge. The goal is to understand the faulting and fissuring processes in the
area and to develop scaling relations of fault displacement versus fault length.
