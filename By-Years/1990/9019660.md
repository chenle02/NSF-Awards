It will be determined whether the central North sea was glaciated and the rate
and pattern of retreat of the Scandinavian ice sheet form the northern North Sea
will be determined by dating the first glacial marine sediments deposited upon
submarine tills in a series of in situ quality geotechnical bore holes. High
resolution isotoped and faunal records will be developed from rapidly deposited
postglacial sediments to monitor changes in meridional circulation and
melt.water discharge at the centruy time scale. These studies will allow the
evaluation of the relationship between glacier melting and changes in meridional
circulation with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.
