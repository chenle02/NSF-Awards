9506622 DREGER This research is to extend modern techniques of analysis of large
earthquakes in southern and central California back to historical times when
only analog seismographic recordings were available. While many of these regions
are currently quiet, especially off of the San Andreas fault, several historic
large earthquakes have occurred there and these are important to the estimation
of seismic hazard. The longest-lived seismic stations in California are the
Berkeley BRK and MHC (since 1887), and the Caltech PAS and SBC (since 1927)
stations. In addition, seismograms will be obtained from other regional and
teleseismic sites such as the De Bilt, Netherlands and the Florissant, Missouri
observatories. The technique involves the use of recent earthquakes recorded by
modern networks to compare with the historic data to obtain relative locations,
magnitude scaling, and to calibrate paths to each station. The resulting
calibrated Green's functions will be used to model the historic events for
source depth, scalar seismic moment, fault orientation and potential source
complexity in the larger historic earthquakes. This research is a component of
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
