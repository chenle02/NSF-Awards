Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0243828 Date:
1-03-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Stewart Institution: Hope College
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award supports a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Hope College for the summers of
2003-2006. The site director is Joanne L. Stewart. Ten students and twelve
faculty research mentors will participate in a ten/eleven week program. Half of
the students will be recruited from Hope College and half from other colleges
and universities. The proposed research projects cover a broad range of both
chemistry and biochemistry topics. The program will develop professional skills,
especially oral and written communication skills, through seminars, reports, and
presentation of a poster at an end-of-summer research symposium. Evaluation of
the program will be conducted by the chemistry department as well as by
participation in a larger outside evaluation program involving several
undergraduate institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
