Jennifer Brand, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, will study a new class of diodes
based on two different polytypes of boron-carbide.The heteroisomeric diodes are
fabricated by chemical vapor deposition from two different isomers of closo-
dicarbadodecaborane, C2B10H12: orthocarborane and metacarborane, that differ
only by the carbon placement in the icosahedral cage. Metacarborane tends to
form an n-type semiconductor on decomposition, while orthoborane forms a p-type
semiconductor. This exploratory research seeks to understand the electronic
structure of the diode materials as the device is being produced. The project
will include photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy, theroetical
calculations and optical absorption techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
is supported jointly by the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism
Program (ACT) supports new concepts in basic resarch and workforce development
with the potential to contribute to national security. These novel diodes are
effective solid state neutron detectors and also show promise in photovoltaic or
other direct energy conversion devices. Graduate and undergraduate students will
be engaged in all aspects of the project.
