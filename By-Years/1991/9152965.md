A major enhancement of the Computer-Aided-Design and Test Laboratory has begun
to support a new minor in VLSI Systems Engineering for the Computer Engineering
and Electrical Engineering B.S. degree programs of the Electrical and Computer
Engineering Department. A large-capacity file-server, two digital ASIC
(Application Specific Integrated Circuit) testers, a logic analyzer, eight host-
controlled functional testers, and electrostatic plotter and other minor
peripherals are being added to the existing laboratory. This enhancement allows
introduction of the state-of-the-art computer-aided-design practices into the
curriculum of the VLSI System Engineering minor. This minor is the first such
program in the nation, and emphasizes the systems approach to large-scale
hardware design and development, and the use of computer-aided-design, analysis
and test tools for rapid-prototyping and evaluation of designs.
