The Georgia Research Corporation proposes to create a new distance-learning
medium for computing education especially for in-service high school teachers
based on ideas from instructional design and educational psychology. In-service
high school teachers are particularly time-constrained (and thus need
efficiency) and they are more metacognitively aware than other students (and
thus able to better inform the project design). The new medium will combine
multiple modalities, worked examples, and structure based on cognitive models of
designers' knowledge. The research questions are (1) Will the teachers learn CS
knowledge in this on-line setting? (2) Will the teachers will be more efficient
at programming activities? and (3) Will the teachers will find the materials
useful and satisfying? Because of its focus on teachers, the project can
potentially have broad impact, in particular on the strategies for training the
10,000 teachers envisioned in the CS 10K Project. The project will establish
models and design guidelines that can be used for the creation of other learning
materials, including materials for students, for example, in the proposed new CS
Principles AP course.
