9418889 Kurz Preliminary data from the Galapagos demonstrate the importance of
helium to understanding mantle processes. Although the high 3He/4He ratios alone
are important, the focus of this project is to understand the local variations,
and relate them to processes within the plume. A particularly important aspect
of the proposed work is that cosmic ray produced 3He can be used to determine
ages, thus providing age control. This will be an integrated approach that will
combine field work, major and trace element measurements, and the isotopes of
He, Sr, Nd and Pb, with chronology provided by surface exposure dating. This
work will be carried out in collaboration with Dennis Geist (University of
Idaho) who has a long record of field work in the Galapagos. The goals of the
proposed research are to: 1. Evaluate the temporal evolution of Galapagos
hotspot, and individual volcanic centers using surface exposure dating. By
obtaining the geochemical data in conjunction with chronology to rigorously test
the various models for the overall gradients within the archipelago it should be
possible. 2. Document the helium isotopic variability within the archipelago.
