9414459 Wilbur The effects on tribological performance of high density ion
implantation at low energies of oxygen, carbon, boron and nitrogen into tool
steels will be studied. The research is a cooperative effort which involves the
Colorado State University, the Physical Technical Institute in Minsk, Belarus,
and Hughes Company Research Laboratories. The dose and implantation conditions
which induce maximum resistance to sliding wear in commercial tool steels will
be identified, and the mechanisms of deep diffusion at high implantation rates
will be studied. Tribological test results will be compared with microstructural
and surface analytical results obtained by a number of complementary techniques.
