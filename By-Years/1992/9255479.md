The MAA's Interactive Mathematics Text Project will run 12 six- day workshops on
interactive texts during the summer of 1993. These workshops have as their goal
the improvement of mathematics learning by disseminating information on the use
of interactive texts in collegiate mathematics instruction and by supporting the
development of such texts. The workshops will provide hands-on training on the
use of authoring software (e.g., Mathematica, Mathcad, or Maple), examination of
sample texts, opportunity to create an interactive text on a specific topic, and
follow-up networking activities.
