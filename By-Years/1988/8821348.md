This is a test of the hypothesis that periodic, pulsed-potential electrolysis on
an unmodified platinum electrode, or in conjunction with surface modification by
underpotential-deposited tin or ruthenium, can significantly increase the cycle-
averaged power production by lowering the concentration of the poisonous
byproduct adsorbed on the electrode. For a small fraction of the cycle, the
anode potential is pulsed to a high value at which the surface poison is
oxidatively removed; during the remainder of the cycle, the anode potential is
at a lower, power-producing polarization. Preliminary results suggest that the
average current may be increased by better than two orders of magnitude above
that obtainable by using steady- state (DC) control at the same power potential.
The effects of pulsed-potential electrolysis in acidic methanol solutions on
smooth and carbon-supported platinum, with and without underpotential- deposited
tin or ruthenium, are investigated. Conventional current- voltage-time
electrochemical measurements, are recorded and surface infrared and X-ray
photoelectron spectra are taken. The production rates of formaldehyde and formic
acid and the dissolution rate of platinum under the influence of pulsed-
potential electrolysis are determined. Methanol-air fuel cells are attractive
power sources for many applications, including electric vehicles, remote
installations, transportation systems, and emergency backups. Methanol is
cheaper, more compact, easier to transport, and much safer to use than hydrogen,
which is the principal alternative fuel-cell fuel. Unfortunately, methanol-air
fuel cells using a platinum electrocatalyst are self poisoning, severly limiting
their efficiency. This work addresses this shortcoming.
