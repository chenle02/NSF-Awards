9528057 Luco This project uses the extensive seismic response data recorded
within the Hualien, Taiwan, 1/4-scale model of a nuclear containment structure
to validate a set of mathematical models and computer codes. These mathematical
models and computer codes are used to calculate the seismic response of
important structures when the effects of the interaction between the structure
and the surrounding soil are significant. The Hualien experiment is being
conducted by a consortium of organizations including the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in the U.S. and
institutions from Taiwan, Japan, Korea and France. The first task of the project
is to predict the seismic response of the containment model on the basis of
ground motions recorded on the free-field ground surface away from the
structure. In a second task, the predictions are compared with the observations
to obtain an overall assessment of the current capability to model the seismic
response of structures partially embedded in soils, when soil-structure
interaction effects are important. Finally, identification techniques are used
to infer from the recorded data some of the characteristics of the structure and
the soil. ***
