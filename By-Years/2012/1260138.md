This project provides scholarships to support academically talented students
with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in the
College of Engineering, Forestry and Natural Sciences at Northern Arizona
University after transfer from community and tribal colleges. In addition to
scholarship aid, students are being supported though a residential learning
community specifically for STEM transfer students, as well as a seminar class
promoting academic and career success in STEM. Scholars also have access to an
extensive suite of student-support services, including supplemental instruction,
mentoring and undergraduate research opportunities. Financial aid and other
project activities are providing support toward increasing graduation rates for
transfer students, as well as shortening time to graduation. The intellectual
merit of this project lies in its comprehensive, research-based approach which
merges financial, academic and social support to retain and graduate STEM
transfer students. The broader impacts include strengthening relationships and
transfer advisement between the university and surrounding community and tribal
colleges, as well as providing a useful comparison of the impacts of residential
learning communities on transfer students versus freshmen. The project taps a
diverse and talented pool of students to enhance STEM workforce needs in Arizona
and beyond.
