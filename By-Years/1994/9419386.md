For many practical problems, the information concerning the system under study
is often represented in two forms: one is a set of input-output data pairs, and,
the other is a set of linguistic descriptions about the system, often in the
form of IF-THEN fuzzy rules. Traditional system identification methods and
classification methods, even including the (model-free) neural network
approaches, can only utilize the input-output data pairs. This research will
continue to develop general methods to combine both input-output data pairs and
linguistic IF-THEN rules into signal - processing systems designs. The new
direction that this research is taking is the handling of uncertainty by using
fuzzification in a fuzzy logic signal processor. The nonsingleton FLSs will be
applied to a variety of important signal processing problems including fuzzy
classification. The objectives are to: (1) establish a measure of uncertainty
for the output of a nonsingleton FLS, in accordance with estimation theory
practice; (2) develop a nonsingleton FLS state estimator for nonlinear dynamical
systems; (3) extend fuzzy logic classifiers to include imprecise training
samples and noisy measurements, using nonsingleton FLSs; (4) extend
backpropagation and orthogonal least squares parameter training procedures to
nonsingleton FLSs and classifiers; (5) apply nonsingleton FLSs to the
forecasting of multiple time series and to adaptive filtering problems of noise
cancellation and blind equalization; and, (6) apply nonsingleton fuzzy logic
classifiers to modulation classification.
