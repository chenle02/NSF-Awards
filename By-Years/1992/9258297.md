The objective of the proposed research is to experimentally observe the
inhomogeneous flow processes operative during superplastic deformation and to
study their relationship to the macroscopic constitutive response through finite
element modeling of the microstructure. Emphasis will be placed on
experimentally isolating the operative dislocation and diffusional flow
processes and the detecting the inhomogeneity of deformation within single
grains as well as within larger collections of grains.
