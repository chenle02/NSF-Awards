9455588 Ross The objective of this project is the design and development of an
infrastructure around which formal laboratories in computer science can be
implemented. The central component of the infrastructure is a software system
called DYNALAB, for DYNAmic LABoratory. DYNALAB will run on Macintosh and IBM-
compatible personal computers, as well as X-terminals connected to central
computers. Students using DYNALAB have access--through a user interface oriented
towards complete novices--to a comprehensive, easily modifiable, and extendible
library of programs and experiments, including experiments in program structure
(e.g., iteration, selection, recursion, execution-path determination, parameter
passing mechanisms, functions, procedures, and so forth), black box
determination of algorithms, time complexity, space complexity, program
verification, and others. A sophisticated program animation component allows the
execution of programs both forwards and in reverse, while displaying dynamically
and in interactive fashion the pertinent aspects of program execution, such as
the currently executing statement, values of variables, pointer references, and
statement and memory cell counts (for time and space complexity experiments).
Algorithm animation components also allow abstract graphical representations of
algorithms to be presented on a screen in forward and reverse modes for
algorithm and data structure studies. Finally, concept animations are included
for the study of fundamental computer science concepts, such as compiling,
multitasking, intractability, and so forth. The desirability of formal
laboratories in the computer science curriculum is well documented, but few
institutions ha e incorporated them for lack of laboratory resources. It is
expected that DYNALAB will be widely adopted as a tool around which computer
science laboratories can be designed.
