This research investigates the generation of manufacturing tests for highly
sequential VLSI circuits. The approach is based on combining the best features
of deterministic and simulation based techniques. Deterministic techniques are
mainly used to (1) identify untestable and redundant faults and (2) to correct
the direction of the simulation based search. Simulation based test vector
generation examines a set of test vectors to determine a new test sequence to
detect some faults. This process, while accurate and fast, generates longer than
necessary test vectors. The technique being explored is detecting and correcting
the genetic search, using deterministic ATPG. This process involves an intricate
exploration of the power of a switch-level logic and fault simulator in an
combination with a genetic algorithm and the deterministic ATPG during the test
generation process. The technique is being applied to design problems such as,
circuit partitioning, initial test set finding, and circuit initialization-
structure to determine performance and quality of generated test sets.
