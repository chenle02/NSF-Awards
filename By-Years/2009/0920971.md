This grant is in support of the Fifth International Nanotechnology conference.
&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Electronics and semiconductors have enabled the
computer and communication industries throughout the 20th century. Most of the
building blocks of these industries will reach fundamental limits by the end of
the next decade To avoid this crisis, solution through the use of nanotechnology
holds great promise. From the intellectual merit front, international experts
will come together at INC5 to discuss potential solutions and ways to better
align and coordinate these research efforts. Topics for discussion will range
from nanohealth to nanoelectronics.
