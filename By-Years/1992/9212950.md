Cadmium electroplating in cyanide baths is of significant environmental
concern. In addition, by-products of cadmium coatings release toxic substances
in the environment during their use and disposal. As a consequence, a unique,
environmentally and occupationally safe dry plating concept has been developed.
The dry plating concept utilizes a novel plasma assisted vapor deposition
process and an in situ reclaim technique for cadmium. This dry plating is
economical for coating and waste management.
