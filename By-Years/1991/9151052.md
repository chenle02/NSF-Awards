Students are experiencing important statistical activities of sample selection,
data collection, experimental design, randomization, development of statistical
models, in a newly developed laboratory course taken in conjunction with their
first undergraduate statistics course. In doing so, they are gaining a firm
understanding of the role of applied statistics in scientific investigations and
the type or work that professional statisticians do. The lab guides the student
through simple, but meaningful, experiments which illustrate important concepts
from applied statistics. In each session, the students discuss and perform an
experiment, collect and use computers to analyze the data, and write a report.
