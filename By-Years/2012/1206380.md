TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The reorientation of defects can affect
technologically important macroscopic properties of solids like hysteresis
losses in electric steels. This project will investigate the magnetostriction
caused by the reorientation of the magnetization of coherent nano-precipitates
of lower symmetry than the host. Iron-cobalt alloys will serve as the model
system for the investigation as preliminary microscopic and macroscopic evidence
exists in Fe40Co60, which demonstrates that its large magnetostriction,
lambda100=200ppm, is due to this mechanism. The insight gained will be used to
develop new alloys with enhanced magnetostriction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-
TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes to investigate the
magnetostriction of two phase functional materials, predominantly metallic
alloys. Materials displaying low anisotropy and large magnetostriction will be
emphasized as they are very suitable for technological applications such as
sensors or transducers. Additionally, through this collaborative research,
graduate and undergraduate minorities will be trained in materials synthesis and
state-of-the-art characterization techniques. The proposed research will
increase the competitiveness of minority students in the Science and Engineering
disciplines and expand the pool of talented African-American scientists and
engineers, who will enlarge the high-technology minority workforce. The planned
outreach to Maryland high schools will ensure that the proposed research
connects to the potentially interested segment of the high school population.
