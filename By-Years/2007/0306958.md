AST-0306958 Rand One of the most elusive measurements associated with spiral
density waves is that of the angular frequency with which the pattern rotates.
Since many properties of galaxy evolution may depend on how frequently stars and
gas encounter density waves, determining pattern speeds is of fundamental
importance. The researcher has already shown that the Tremaine-Weinberg method
developed some while ago can now be successfully applied to measuring pattern
speeds in galaxies with a molecular-dominated interstellar medium (ISM), using
observations of carbon monoxide (CO). This project will extend that work to a
much larger sample, using archival data from surveys, and will investigate
whether galaxies with a neutral-hydrogen-dominated ISM can be analyzed using
neutral hydrogen (HI) measurements, also from published surveys. This research
will explore whether it is feasible to combine both CO and HI data to study
galaxies whose ISM is not dominated by either phase.

Where available, morphological and kinematic data for the studied galaxies will
be used to investigate the predictions of density-wave theory concerning
resonances and the effect of extended haloes. For barred spirals, this work will
also test suggested connections between the bar pattern and the spiral pattern.

The research will involve at least one doctoral thesis project, and create a new
research opportunity at an accredited Minority Institution (Hispanic Serving).
The results will be spread widely to the community and beyond, through the
principal investigator's continuing local public outreach work.
