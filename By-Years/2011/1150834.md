With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the
research of Professors Robert Batey and Shelley Copley of the University of
Colorado, Boulder. Profs. Batey and Copley will develop a modular and versatile
method for creating small molecule biosensors that can be utilized to monitor
directed protein evolution. The hypothesis is that one can reverse engineer a
form of RNA-based regulation namely "riboswitches" that are found in the leader
sequences of mRNAs that directly bind small molecules to direct expression of
the message. This proposal aims to exploit these RNAs by two means. First, a
"mix-and-match" methodology will be developed that allows a broad array of small
molecule receptors to be spliced into biologically efficient regulatory switches
that drive in vivo expression of fluorescent protein reporters. Second, in vitro
selection methods will be developed to take advantage of the properties of
riboswitches to access a new generation of RNA-based small molecule receptors.
Finally, these approaches are to be applied to a directed evolution project that
selects for variants of homoserine kinase that improve the efficiency of a novel
biochemical pathway for synthesis of a critical
cofactor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this project will be to
develop new approaches that are widely applicable to synthetic biology. One of
the primary goals of this project is to make these techniques easy to apply to a
broad spectrum of protein evolution applications by researchers with diverse
molecular biology skills. Through this project, graduate and undergraduate
students will be exposed to research and coursework at the Chemistry-Biology
interface as developed collaboratively by Professors Batey and Copley.
