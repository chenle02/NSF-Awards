This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Molecular mechanisms of anti-microtubule herbicide
binding to plant tubulin" is to be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Louis C.
Morejohn at University of Texas, Austin. This represents a significant change in
the field of research for this Fellow whose Ph.D. training was in chemical
synthesis of metal-binding proteins. The focus of the postdoctoral project is
the role of microtubules in corn and soybean. The postdoctoral fellowships in
plant biology are designed to increase the number of outstanding young
investigators in plant biology.
