Homothallism in the unicellular alga, Chlamydomonas monoica is an example of
intracellular decision-making: individual cells derived from a common progenitor
become cells of compatible mating-types (mt+ or mt-). Our goal is to decipher
the genetic mechanisms underlying this simple binary cellular decision-a type of
decision central to developmental biology. Our objectives are three-fold: 1) to
distinguish between regulatory mating-type loci (mt) and loci under mating type
regulation (mtl), 2) to identify genes (swi) controlling the cell's ability to
choose between alternative mating phenotypes, and 3) to determine whether genes
involved in DNA repair/recombination also contribute to homothallism. During the
development of any organism to an adult stage, innumerable decisions are made.
The hope of understanding the mechanisms related to such decision making can
only be realized by studying the simpler binary decision making process in an
organism such as Chlamydomonas.***
