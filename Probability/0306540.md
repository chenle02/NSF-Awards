0306540 Rey-Bellet Luc Rey-Bellet works in three directions: 1. Study of
nonequilibrium stationary states for systems in classical mechanics coupled to
heat reservoirs, - in particular the study of stochastic partial differential
equations arising from a model of semilinear wave equations coupled to one or
several reservoirs described by linear wave equations at positive temperature.
The goal is to prove existence and uniqueness of the stationary state, determine
the rate of convergence and study the transport properties of the system. 2.
Development of probabilistic methods to study the ergodic properties of open
quantum systems coupled to reservoirs of bosons and fermions - in particular
investigating and developing tools to study the ergodic properties of quantum
Markov semigroups and quantum stochastic differential equations and combining
them with spectral methods to prove ergodic properties for open quantum systems.
3. Develop the study of large deviations in quantum statistical mechanics - in
particular prove the large deviation principle for the Gibbs-KMS states of
quantum systems on a lattice (quantum spin systems, fermionic and bosonic
lattice gases). Statistical mechanics is the physical and mathematical theory,
which attempts to link the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. At the
microscopic level, atoms or elementary particles are described by the time
reversible laws of Newtonian or Quantum mechanics, which involve a huge number
of equations. At the macroscopic level, materials are, in their normal state,
described, by a few parameters or equations, such as pressure, temperature,
electrical and thermal conductivity, etc. Some fundamental problems in
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics remain poorly understood, both at the
conceptual and mathematical level: for example the characterization of
nonequilibrium stationary states of open systems and the derivation of
phenomenological transport laws from microscopic mechanical models (for example,
the Ohm's law of electric and Fourier's law of heat conduction). The proposal
addresses some of these questions, which are related for example to material
sciences. Also a new field, loosely speaking ``quantum probability'', has
emerged in the last few years, driven by applications such as quantum
cryptography and quantum computing. The proposal is also devoted to the study of
several mathematical tools in this field.
