The research entails geometric methods of partial differential equations
applied to variational principles. This in particular involves the study of
classes of harmonic maps from the n-sphere to Riemannian manifolds and their
Dirichlet integral. Group actions and scalar curvature equations are also
intended to be studied. This research may have potential applications to
configurations of static liquid crystals.
