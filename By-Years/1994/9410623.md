Professor John Ross is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research involving experimental
and theoretical studies of irreversible processes. Ross will conduct research in
three specific areas including: 1) computational studies of macroscopic chemical
kinetic systems to explore the possibility of pattern recognition by different
types of nonlinear systems; 2) development of a methodology for categorizing
complex reaction mechanisms based on stoichiometric network analysis; and 3)
experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamics and stochastic
formulation of chemical systems far from equilibrium. Ross has recently shown
that mass coupled continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) can emulate
bistable switching devices and could be considered as computer logic elements.
Combinations of such devices could also emulate the basic logic gates such as
AND, OR and NOR gates. This work may serve as a model for biological neurons,
and answer fundamental questions regarding the mechanism of computation and
pattern recognition in living systems including the human brain.
