(RSMAS) at the University of Miami requests renewed funding for shipboard
technician activities associated with the research vessels ISELIN, a 170-foot
vessel, and CALANUS, a 64 foot vessel. Both vessels are owned and operated by
the University. In calendar year 1994, the ISELIN will support a total of 77
days of NSF-funded research, primarily in the north Atlantic. The CALANUS will
support a total of 30 days of NSF-funded research, primarily in the coastal
waters of Florida and the Bahamas. RSMAS technicians will be responsible for
