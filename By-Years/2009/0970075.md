This award funds the theoretical research activities of Professor Glennys Farrar
at New York University.

Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR's) are cosmic rays (i.e., subatomic
particles) with extreme kinetic energies that not only vastly exceed their rest
masses, but also exceed the energies typical of other cosmic rays. These cosmic
rays are significant for a number of reasons. First, the origin of their huge
energies remains a mystery which touches on numerous aspects of astrophysics.
Second, these huge energies vastly exceed those accessible in traditional
accelerator experiments. Finally, the energies associated with such UHECR's
often violate the so-called "GZK bound" which provides a theoretical upper limit
on the energies that cosmic rays may have. Understanding how such UHECR's manage
to violate the GZK bound is an important area of research. In her work,
Professor Farrar aims to develop combinations of astrophysics analysis methods
in order to constrain the sources and possible composition of UHECR's, using
recent data from the AUGER experiment. She also wishes to use these techniques
in order to map out the galactic magnetic field by exploiting massive new data
sets of rotation measures of extragalactic sources in combination with
synchrotron emission data from the WMAP experiment.

This work is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. First, it will
lead to the development of computational infrastructure (including the
development of state-of-the-art techniques for optimizing fits involving many
parameters and hundreds of millions of measured data points, new techniques for
rapid simulation of particle cascades, and new probabilistic methods of event
reconstruction that have implications for pattern recognition problems more
broadly). Second, the PI will continue her work with the New York Schools Cosmic
Particle Telescope (NYSCPT) Project (a partnership with local New York City
schools): this includes further development of the next phase of NYSCPT as well
as delivering public lectures on NYSCPT and mentoring NYSCPT participants.
