Principal Investigator: Eric Sommers [esommers@math.umass.edu]

Abstract:

The principal investigator will study several questions in representation theory
which are related to nilpotent orbits in Lie algebras. More specifically, the
investigator will study a new duality map that he defined (and that has recently
been extended by Achar). He will continue to study the Lusztig bijection. He
will try to complete the determination of which nilpotent orbits in the
exceptional Lie algebras have normal closure and prove results (in all Lie
algebras) about the structure of functions on covers of nilpotent orbits.

Representation theory is a branch of modern algebra that is concerned with
understanding symmetries. A central idea is that complicated algebraic or
geometric structures can be represented by a certain set of matrices (arrays of
numbers), which are easier to understand than the original structure. For
example, the symmetries of the square can be represented (in one possible way)
by a certain set of eight two-by-two matrices. This view of representation
theory has many applications in chemistry and physics. The investigator's work
will contribute to understanding the representation theory of Lie algebras and
Lie groups.
