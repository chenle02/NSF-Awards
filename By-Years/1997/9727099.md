ABSTRACT EEC-9727099 EVASHWICK This is a 2-year, $50,000 Research Opportunities
Award (ROA) to California State University Long Beach (RUI/PUI), to conduct
research in conjunction with the Industry University Cooperative Research Center
(IUCRC) for Health Management. The overall goals are to describe the extent to
which various wellness, outreach and long-term care services are offered by
integrated healthcare delivery systems, and to explicate how these services
function as an integral part of the continuum of care. The study involves two
activities: (1) analyzing secondary data collected on the American Hospital
Association Annual Survey to develop a national profile of continuum services at
the hospital, health system, and network levels, and (2) conducting interviews
with 10-12 selected hospitals and healthcare systems about operational issues
pertaining specifically to service integration. The project will examine the
involvement of 27 wellness, outreach, and long-term care services in integrated
healthcare delivery systems.
