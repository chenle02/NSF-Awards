Two dozen Korean and American geographers and regional scientists plan to meet
in Seoul in November 1992 for a five day conference examining "Geographic
Dimensions of National Social and Economic Policy". Purpose of the conference is
to review and evaluate (1) contemporary methods for measuring and describing
spatial variations in economic growth, social development, and environmental
quality; (2) the effectiveness of prevailing development and settlement theories
in accounting for such spatial variations; and (3) ways the state intervenes to
reduce spatial inequalities, why it intervenes as it does, and the extent that
policies programs achieve intended results. Topics of special interest include
housing provision, educational opportunity, health care, income maintenance,
women's issues, general regional economic development, and environmental
protection. This seminar is jointly supported by NSF and the Korean Science and
Engineering Foundation.
