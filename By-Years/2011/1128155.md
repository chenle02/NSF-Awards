The School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) annually
hosts collaborative research visits of one-semester or one-year duration by
approximately 70 mathematicians. This award annually supports visits for 18
postdoctoral fellows and 6 mid-career mathematicians, who join 45 or more other
mathematicians supported by funds from other sources. In first-rate academic
facilities located in a peaceful setting with a minimum of distractions, the
School provides this diverse community of scholars with an interactive
environment rich in mathematical content and conducive to collaboration. The
presence of nearby Princeton University adds to the breadth of mathematics that
is available to IAS visitors. Each year the IAS conducts a special program
focused on a particularly exciting field of mathematics. The programs for the
next three years will include "Univalent Foundations of Mathematics" (2012),
"Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and Random Matrices" (2013), and "Algebraic Geometry
and Hodge Theory" (2014). Approximately one third of visitors come especially to
participate in such programs. The School is dedicated to furthering the
education of its postdoctoral fellows and strongly encourages the participation
of women and members of other groups under-represented in mathematics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School of Mathematics is devoted to supporting
fundamental research at the highest level and to fostering mathematical talent.
It is led by eight permanent faculty members whose expertise spans a wide
spectrum of mathematics. The School is a center for new collaborations and new
lines of research. Junior mathematicians benefit from mentoring by faculty and
from interactions with senior scholars. Mid-career and senior mathematicians
consolidate their research projects and explore new research directions. A large
fraction of this country's mathematical leaders are former IAS visitors. The
School's emphasis on a unified mathematical perspective and bringing together a
diverse group of mathematicians has led to numerous unanticipated mathematical
developments. Historically, many of the most important developments in
mathematics have originated at the IAS -- this is reflected, for example, by the
numerous Fields Medalists whose work is connected with the IAS. All IAS lectures
are videotaped and are available to the public.
