The Peninsula Nature and Science Center (PNSC) in Newport News, Virginia, has
been serving the informal science education needs of the Virginia Peninsula
region for the past 17 years. As a "living museum" it is a combination of a
natural history museum, zoological and botanical garden, nature center, aquaria
and science center. By means of living plants and animals, the PNSC plans to
develop a series of comprehensive indoor and outdoor exhibitions explaining,
interpreting and providing participatory experiences for visitors about the
Atlantic Coastal Plain area. The Commonwealth of Virginia has allocated a
million dollars toward construction of the proposed facility expansion and the
PNSC has raised an additional $502,560 for facilities and exhibits. The National
Science Foundation grant will provide funds for the indoor exhibits which
include: "A Walk in the Past," covering the geology of the area, a time line
wall with touch specimens, the earth's formation and the Dismal Swamp; "How Life
Survives," covering food gathering, protection, shelter and living space and
propagation along with a microscope station; and the "World of Darkness," where
activities of nocturnal animals can be observed. The PNSC has an extensive
teaching program with the elementary schools in the region. They plan to expand
these activities and, additionally, expect to have a statewide impact since they
will be a prime informal science education resource in the state. They also have
the potential of becoming a model for the 1600 nature and science centers in the
U.S.
