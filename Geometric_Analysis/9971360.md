Abstract

Award: DMS-9971360 Principal Investigator: Xiaochun Rong

We have been studying problems in Riemannian geometry related to collapsed
manifolds with sectional curvature bounded in absolute value and applications to
global Riemannian geometry and others. We have made progress on understanding
the topology of collapsed manifolds with pinched positive sectional curvature,
including the fundamental group is virtually cyclic, the maximally collapsed
manifolds are diffeomorphic to lens spaces up to a finite covering, the
nonvanishing of the second Betti number for simply connected manifolds. We have
made progress on collapsed manifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature,
including the existence of the local splitting structure. We have made progress
on Gauss-Bonnet-Chern type theorems for noncompact manifolds as well as the
topological invariants associated to a sequence of certain collapsing metrics.
We will continue our programs in these areas in the near future. We will also
begin to investigate structures of collapsed manifolds with bounded diameter and
a lower curvature bound. This represents a continuation of work proposed three
years ago for NSF Grant DMS 9626252.

One of the most important developments in Riemannian geometry in the last two
decades is in the understanding for the Riemannian manifolds which appear to be
smaller than their actual dimension. For instance, the surface of a very thin
donut looks like a circle. A major part of my research focus on such manifolds
whose curvature are also between the curvature of two spheres of different
radius. We have found restrictions on the topological structure of these
manifolds. Our progress is amplified by the amazing fact that among all
manifolds whose curvature are between the curvature of two spheres of different
radius, all but finitely many appear to be smaller than their actual dimension.
Therefore, we have made progress on the study with a long history: the manifolds
whose curvature are between the curvature of two spheres of different radius.
