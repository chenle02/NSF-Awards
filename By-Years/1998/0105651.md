The certitude that software execution terminates in principle&lt;br/&gt;is of
little use without a grasp of the resources required,&lt;br/&gt;in particular
computation time and space as functions of input size.&lt;br/&gt;Research over
the last decade has demonstrated the potential of implicit&lt;br/&gt;static
analysis of computational complexity, that is, programming
and&lt;br/&gt;verification paradigms that automatically guarantee program
execution&lt;br/&gt;within feasible resources, without an explicit analysis
of&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic complexity in terms of machine
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project further explores the
conceptual&lt;br/&gt;underpinnings of machine-independent complexity, in
particular&lt;br/&gt;abstraction mechanisms in functional programs and
verification systems.&lt;br/&gt;It studies the implementation of these
principles within major&lt;br/&gt;programming paradigms and styles, notably
declarative and object&lt;br/&gt;oriented programming.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, it
initiates applications of implicit complexity&lt;br/&gt;in Feasible Mathematics,
in the guise of a library&lt;br/&gt;of formal proofs which establish the
feasible computational contents&lt;br/&gt;of mathematical theorems without
referring explicitly to
computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
