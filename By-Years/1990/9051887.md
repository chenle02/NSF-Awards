The Multi-Purpose General Science Laboratory allows majors and non -majors
opportunities to participate in scientific experiments in several disciplines
including: physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science, and general
science. The multi-purpose laboratory enables majors to explore the sciences
more fully and serves as a "hands-on" laboratory for non-majors completing the
general education requirement. The grantee provides funds for this project that
are more than an equal match for the NSF award.
