Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a
series of organic chemistry/spectroscopy experiments for the general chemistry
laboratory that use organic chemistry students as peer mentors. Working in
groups, the general chemistry students work on inquiry experiments that
introduce them to UV-visible, IR, and NMR spectrometry. Using electronic tools
such as e-mail and Web-based discussion boards, organic chemistry peer mentor
groups collaborate on-line with the general chemistry students after the
experiments, which helps the general chemistry students apply their newly
learned knowledge. This portion of the project is adapted from the Physical
Chemistry On-line project (NSF DUE-9950809). Because of the relative simplicity
of C-13 spectra, we introduce NMR with C-13 rather than proton spectra. An
upgrade of our existing Varian EM360 with an Anasazi EFT-GENII FT-NMR conversion
package provides an instrument that allows us to do both proton and C-13
spectra. We also are using this spectrometer in our organic chemistry and
advanced organic chemistry courses, and are adapting experiments from the
Journal of Chemical Education that allow students to work in groups. The
upgraded NMR completes the suite of instruments to which we introduce our
undergraduate students at an early point in their careers. It also allows us to
institute a peer-mentoring program, which we expect will enhance our students'
communication skills and make organic chemistry more attractive to students who
have finished general chemistry. The project serves as a model of how organic
chemistry peer mentors can be used in general chemistry. We also are developing
new experiments that introduce NMR to introductory students.&lt;br/&gt;
