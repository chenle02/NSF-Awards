The research objective of this award is to design effective models and systems
for the electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure industry, with the eventual goal of
facilitating mass adoption of EVs and creating a sustainable green
transportation sector. The successful mass adoption of EVs hinges on the
accessibility of supporting infrastructure for these facilities. This research
will study the EV infrastructure industry from a logistics and economics angle,
and provide effective optimization models and systems that can be applied in
practice to assist complicated decision making, evaluate the effectiveness of
policies, and provide real-time operations control. Robust and dynamic
optimization models, that utilize state-of-the-art methodologies in
distributionally-robust stochastic programming, mixed-integer conic
optimization, decomposition and approximation techniques, and stochastic dynamic
control with online learning will be developed. Beyond applications, this
research will also contribute to the theory of these approaches.

If successful, the outcomes of the project will facilitate the revolution toward
mass adoption of EVs and a sustainable future. Models and tools made possible by
the research can help the industry design more efficient and cost effective EV
infrastructure. The project will contribute to the training of industry
professionals through the UC Berkeley Master of Engineering program in energy
systems. The project will also benefit from close collaboration and partnership
with leading industry sanctioners. Finally, the project will mentor and support
student researchers who will continue research in green transportation during
their future academic careers.
