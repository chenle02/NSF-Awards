Project investigates the nature of seismic gaps and their relationship to long
term seismic potential for a number of plate boundaries. Project collects and
analyzes historical seismograms and phase information from earthquakes in the
Aleutian Arc. Improves location and magnitude estimates, models body and surface
wave data for seismic moment, rupture direction and area, and source time
function. Direct application to the earthquake hazards reduction program.
