9321482 McClearn This is a proposal to use anatomical features of the primitive
eutherian (placental) mammals to generate hypotheses about the phylogenetic
(genealogical) relationships of these animals. These hypotheses will be used as
the framework for a study of the unusual feeding mechanisms of primitive
eutherians. Many of these creatures, which include armadillos, sloths, anteaters
and pangolins, are specialized for feeding on ants, and the various
peculiarities of the tongue and digestive tract may have been developed
independently in some of these mammalian lines. Little is known about the
comparability of the anatomical features among these mammals. %%% This study
will yield much useful information about relationships among early mammals and
their specializations for myrmecophagy (ant-eating). This mammalian group has
received little recent attention in phylogenetic research and this study will
allow resolution of questions about transformations in the musculature of the
tongue, palate and pharynx and the innervation of these structures in early
mammals.
