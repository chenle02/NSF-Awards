In engineered and biological systems, flows often involve complexity because of
the shape of the flow domain which can be unknown, and because the fluid can
consist of or contain macromolecules and nanoparticles which impart unusual
behavior. This research aims at developing novel numerical algorithms for
computing flows with such complexity. Because of their robustness and
reliability, fully-coupled (monolithic/implicit) schemes are commonly used to
simulate flows with free boundaries; however, these schemes may become
impractical, especially in three-dimensional geometries and when the fluid has
complex behavior, e.g., viscoelasticity. On the other hand, partitioned schemes
have simpler implementation and potential lower computational cost, yet have
shown severe stability issues when applied to highly nonlinear free boundary
flows. This research will develop novel partitioned algorithms for free boundary
flows of complex fluids which will combine good stability properties with low
computational costs and ease of implementation.

The novel algorithms developed in the project will be used to study and
understand complex flows arising in biology, medicine, and engineering. Major
applications include blood flow in human arteries, the optimization of coating
processes, and the flow of emulsions which naturally occur in oil extraction.
Multidisciplinary training will be incorporated in the research by joint
advising of two PhD students in Applied Mathematics and Chemical Engineering.
The outcomes of the proposed research will impact cyberinfrastructures through
scientific computing, as well as other areas of complex fluid mechanics where
computing plays a central and essential role.
