This U.S.-Brazil award will support a collaborative research project between
Dr.William Fenical of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of
California and Dra. Rosangela de A. Epifanio of Universidade Federal Fluminense,
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to explore the natural products chemistry and chemical
ecology of selected Brazilian marine invertebrates, principally gorgonian corals
and encrusting ascidians. Their program is composed of interactive studies to
expand knowledge of the sources, types and reactivities of defensive molecules
produced by Brazilian invertebrates, and to explore the natural functions of
these molecules in defensive adaptations. The objective of the project is to
form a collaboration between the two researchers through a series of expeditions
and research seminars within Brazil, as well as research visits by the Brazilian
researchers to Scripps. Some of the visits will emphasize the training of
students in new instrumental methods, i.e. 2D NMR techniques, and biological
methodologies associated with determining the functions of secondary metabolites
in shallow marine habitats.
