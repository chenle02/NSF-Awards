Computational geometry is the branch of theoretical computer science devoted to
the design, analysis, and implementation of geometric algorithms and data
structures. Computational geometry has deep roots in reality: Geometric problems
arise naturally in any computa- tional field that simulates or interacts with
the physical world|computer graphics, robotics, geographic information systems,
computer aided-design, and molecular modeling, to name a few|as well as in more
abstract domains such as combinatorial geometry and algebraic topology. Aside
from their obvious practical significance, geometric algorithms and data
structures enjoy a rich and satisfying mathematical structure, and their
development often requires tools from mathematical disciplines such as
combinatorics, topology, and algebraic geometry, as well as traditional
computational tools. The proposal outlines a challenging career development plan
focusing on research in a broad cross-section of computational geometry,
building on and significantly broadening the PI's successful work in the field
over the last several years. Specific problem areas in which the PI plans to
work include approximation algorithms, kinetic data structures, spatial and
temporal databases, external memory computation, geometric optimization, and
clustering. This classification is at best a rough guide, as many interesting
geometric problems fall into more than one category. Furthermore, the PI plans
to continue combining theory and empirical experimentation in his work, putting
an emphasize on algorithms that perform well in practice.
