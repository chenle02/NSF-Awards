In this RUI proposal funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Cindy Samet of the Dickinson College will pursue a
program of research on very weak hydrogen bonding between substituted cyclic
hydrocarbons and Lewis bases. The interactions under study involve hydrocarbon-
base complexes with C-H --- N (or O) hydrogen bonding. Hydrocarbon systems of
interest are halogenated cyclopropane and cyclopentadiene, while bases are
ammonia, trimethylamine, and dimethyl ether. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy combined with matrix isolation in argon and nitrogen matrices will
be complemented by ab initio calculations.

This project will serve to elucidate conditions necessary for hydrogen bonds to
form. These complexes can serve as a model for hydrogen bonding in more
complicated systems such as organic liquid crystals and large biomolecules.
Eventually these studies may have an impact on our understanding of how protein
folding occurs, how supramolecular assemblies form, and how certain crystals
grow. All of these subjects are important, for example, in designing and
creating new pharmaceuticals or advanced materials.
