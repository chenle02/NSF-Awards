A century ago, there was a movement to put mathematics on a rigorous, unified
foundation. Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in
mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more
complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that
the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete
axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest
themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in
algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop
both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied
to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and
topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central
theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra
of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the
lens of transfinite ordinal numbers, compactness, and large cardinals. This
project includes the training of graduate students.

The first part of the research project involves using set-theoretic tools to
study groups of piecewise linear and piecewise projective homemorphisms. This
includes attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark
Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval,
then either G is elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of
Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this
conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of
subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the
unit interval. This analysis is expected to have other consequences: that the
finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that
any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of
F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the
analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals. This part of the research
project also concerns use of set-theoretic tools such as compactness and the
algebra of elementary embeddings to study the amenability problem for F. The
second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in
pure and applied set theory: methods for studying the vanishing of higher
derived limits in homological algebra; the role that Jensen's diamond principle
plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1.
