Through the acquisition of microcomputers and related software, the research
design and analysis courses offered by the Departments of Psychology, Sociology
and Behavioral Sciences have been improved by providing students "hands on"
experiences and "real life" application of theory. Students' experience in
designing their own programs and experiments have also been enhanced.
