This project purchases laboratory equipment to realize a novel undergraduate
Computer Engineering (CE) major curriculum. Traditional CE curricula are
composed of disparate courses that poorly unify key themes and do not allow
students to develop critical abilities. The Electrical and Computer Engineering
department remedies these ills with a new CE curriculum. The centerpiece of the
curriculum is the design of a richly complex digital system: a network of
computers including, particularly, a computer with hardware and important system
software built entirely by each student. This project spans the courses taken
for the past 3 years of each undergraduate's studies. This curriculum allows a
novel emphasis on fundamental engineering understanding, which cannot be
developed in projects of shorter duration. Students develop an understanding of
how design decisions play out over time, they employ sophisticated design
techniques using standard simulation and synthesis tools, and they make complex
software/hardware tradeoffs. This unified, longitudinal Integrated Computer
Engineering Design (ICED) curriculum has been planned over several years. It has
been broadly accepted by the university. ICED can be evaluated with surveys of
CE students involved in either the original (current) curriculum or the new
(ICED) curriculum, both before and after graduation, measuring ICED's impact and
efficacy.
