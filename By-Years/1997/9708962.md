It funds a major study that will assess issues and derive research topics and
policy recommendations for the nature and use of National Information
Infrastructure technologies, and for the generation, distribution, and
protection of information content that flows within those technologies. The
study will assess the state of the art and emerging trends, examine the
available data, evaluate existing intellectual property law, and map the
changing landscape of interactions among these. The information generated will
provide critically-needed, technologically-informed input into the National
debates on these issues
