The primary objective of the proposed research is to determine how behavioral
changes?specifically changes in preferences for mates?contribute to the
evolution of new species. This study focuses on a pair of two closely related
North American species, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the
cotton mouse (P. gossypinus), which have accumulated few genetic differences
between them yet differ in mating preferences. Using a combination of behavioral
mate choice tests and genetic analysis, this research aims to determine: (1) the
degree to which different mating preferences between P. leucopus and P.
gossypinus prevent gene exchange under controlled laboratory conditions, and (2)
the genetic basis of those behavioral differences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
studying what types of genetic changes produce behaviors that prevent species
from hybridizing, we can learn how behavior evolves as well as quantify its role
in the formation of new species. The results from the proposed research will
improve our overall understanding of life?s diversity, and will be used to
create several family programs and a display case in the Evolution exhibit for
the Harvard Museum of Natural History. &lt;br/&gt;
