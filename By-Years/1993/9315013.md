9315013 Rotenberg The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
Washington Office of the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
has organized important conferences on emerging cryptography and privacy policy
issues. These conferences are critical to the continued effectiveness of the
Internet and all the networks that interconnect to it. CPSR will bring together
all new stakeholders in the networking enterprise including private companies,
public interest organizations, and federal agencies to discuss the impact of
federal policies on the deployment of cryptography and the development of
privacy standards. The CPSR requests partial support for a workshop to plan a
framework for these new privacy standards for achieving electronic privacy. This
conference will bring together many academic and government representatives
including some European experts in cryptography technology.
