This award is to support research that will develop new data on the effect of
changing climate on the climatically sensitive upper forest limit in the Pirin
Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fieldwork will be undertaken to collect samples
from a series of cirque lakes near the upper forest limit in the Pirin
Mountains. Plant macrofossil data and radiocarbon dating will supplement pollen
data already in hand. In addition, stable isotope analysis of carbonate in lake
sediments will be used as an independent method of climate
reconstruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposed
research are that it will lead to a better understanding of the vegetational and
climatic history of an area that is transitional between Western Europe and the
continental interior.
