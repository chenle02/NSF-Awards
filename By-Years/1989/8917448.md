The total heat and fluid output of diffuse hydrothermal ventingat oceanic ridge
crests is unknown on the vent field scale. Likewise, its variability in time has
not been measured. The investigators have formulated a hydrodynamic model of
this flow to guide the measurements. The model is currenty being studied in
their laboratory. This model will be used to guide the design of, and interpret
the results from a sensor array to monitor diffuse hydrothermal flow. The
measurements will be made using proven deep-sea instruments; the Benthic
Acoustic Stress Sensor (BASS); and thermistor moorings. This sensor array will
lead to a techniquefor monitoring the activity of entire diffuse hydrothermal
fields over long-term developments. Coupled with methods for monitoring black
smoker flow that have already been developed,it will eventually be possible to
monitor the total output of heat from a hydrothermal vent field.
