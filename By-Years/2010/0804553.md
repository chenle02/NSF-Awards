The PI proposes to study the deformation K-theory of a discrete group and relate
this to the topological K-theory of its classifying space. This is analogous to
the Atiyah-Segal theorem for compact Lie groups, with deformation K-theory
playing the role of the complex representation ring. The PI believes that these
calculations will shed light on the topology of the stable moduli space of flat
connections for surfaces as well as Casson invariants of three manifolds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representations of groups have been important throughout
much of mathematics as well as in physics and other sciences. The PI proposes to
extend our understanding from finite and compact Lie groups to infinite discrete
groups, using a variant of earlier approaches which relate representations to
topological invariants. These results would add to our knowledge of surfaces as
well as manifolds of dimensions three. &lt;br/&gt;
