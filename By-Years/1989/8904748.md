This award provides one-half of the funds required to purchase equipment items
needed to upgrade the paleomagnetism and rock magnetism laboratory in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of California-Santa Barbara.
The remaining funds required will be provided by the institution. Equipment
items included in the upgrade are a vibrating sample magnetometer, Curie
balance, and alternating field demagnetizer. The upgraded laboratory will
support basic research into the causes of magnetism in rocks, studies of the
reversal of the geomagnetic field, paleomagnetism of the moon and meteorites,
and paleomagnetism related to the tectonic history of California and SE Asia.
