CCR-0306046&lt;br/&gt;Functional Hybrid Modeling&lt;br/&gt;Henrik Nilsson, Paul
Hudak, and John Peterson&lt;br/&gt;Yale University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project integrates functional programming with non-causal hybrid modeling into a
powerful, strongly typed, fully declarative modeling and simulation language,
combining the strengths of each paradigm. The work on Functional Reactive
Programming has demonstrated how causal modeling in a functional setting allows
highly dynamic hybrid systems to be described. However, non-causal modeling is
instrumental in making large-scale modeling manageable, and the associated
symbolic and numerical methods are essential for efficient and numerically sound
simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is a language that provides modeling
capabilities beyond the current state of the art while allowing efficient
simulation, and is semantically rigorous to facilitate modeling, reasoning about
models, and catching certain modeling errors. Central research areas include the
semantics of integrated functional hybrid modeling; reconciling the
implementation techniques of the hybrid simulation world with those of modern
declarative languages and dynamic code generation; and a type system tailored to
physical modeling incorporating recent ideas from type theory to enhance the
safety and robustness of the models.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will
facilitate designing and understanding complex systems in the real world by
providing users with a highly expressive modeling language that is suitable for
programming a broad range of modeling and simulation applications.&lt;br/&gt;
