9411141 Was The objective of this work is to explore the use of ion beam
assisted deposition (IBAD) to control the microstructure and interface
properties of microlaminates. The results should provide a more fundamental
understanding of factors controlling strength and toughness in these systems.
Niobium/alumina is selected as the model, high temperature system to explore
IBAD's effect on grain size, morphology, texture and ensuing strength of the
ductile layer. It may be possible to control the metal-oxide interface strength
by controlling the orientation relationship and the impurity composition at the
interface. Although the depositions are done at high temperature (600 degrees C)
and still higher temperature annealing is conducted to assess microstructural
stability, the focus of the mechanical properties study is the toughness of the
microlaminate at ambient temperature. %%% The scientific approach is based on
the idea that ion beam assisted deposition provides improved control over the
structure of individual lamellae and interfaces in microlaminates, thereby
improving the toughness and strength of these materials for high temperature
applications as structural and coating materials. ***
