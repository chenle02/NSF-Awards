Dr. Li Jia, Department of Chemistry, Lehigh University, is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of
Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a CAREER Award to
advance the design and development of a new class of homogeneous catalytic
reactions as an economically attractive route for the synthesis of poly-beta-
peptides. This new chemistry involves the alternating copolymerizations of
aziridines and carbon monoxide with cobalt complexes as catalysts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is coupled with an educational objective to
foster creative chemistry problem-solving in students to prepare them to deal
with arising problems in the chemical industry. An inquiry-based laboratory
course will be used to teach students the intellectual process of creative
problem solving. Industrial speakers will be invited to give seminars at a mini-
symposium on "Problem-Solving in the Chemical Industry". Close industrial
partnership to enrich students' educational experiences and to facilitate
technological innovation is a hallmark of the program.&lt;br/&gt;
