The family Callitrichidae contains two types of monkeys, marmosets and
tamarins. Of these two, previously only the tamarin has been the subject of a
long term study in the natural habitat. This is a two year field study in the
caatinga scrub forest of northeastern Brazil of the social strategies of the
common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). This study provides an unparalleled
opportunity to study a group of animals that exhibit polyandry, monogamy and
polygyny in a single population. Previous studies of tamarins indicated that the
polyandrous tendencies in this family are the result of the high costs of
rearing the infants in this genus. This study will replicate previous data
collection techniques in tamarins in order to test the validity of this model in
marmosets. This research will contribute to our understanding of the development
and proximate causes of mating systems, and provide a data base on the natural
behavior of the common marmoset, a species frequently utilized in laboratory
research.
