Taam, Ronald AST 97-27875 Dr. Taam will carry out theoretical investigations
into the origin and evolution of close binary systems. His research focuses on
the common envelope phase of binary star evolution, during which the
gravitational interactions between the two components lead to the ejection of a
common envelope and the loss of significant angular momentum. His investigations
will be directed toward determining the parameters for which binary systems at
long orbital periods are transformed into short orbital periods and those for
which the binary systems merge, as applied to systems containing low to
intermediate mass stars (as in cataclysmic variables) as well as massive stars
(as in low mass X-ray binaries). His approach includes treatment of multi-
dimensional hydrodynamical processes and high resolution three dimensional
studies of the common envelope phase using an Eulerian nested grid numeric
technique.
