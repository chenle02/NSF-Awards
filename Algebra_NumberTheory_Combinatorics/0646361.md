A conference with approximately 30 participants from the USA and Europe will be
held on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from
Wednesday April 25 to Saturday April 28, 2007. The conference will feature
current research work in the general area of ordered rings, including work on
spectra, representations and completion operators of ordered rings, with
applications in topology and real algebraic geometry. Presentations will be
interspersed with opportunities for participants discuss important topics and
problems. The conference is intended to support younger researchers and
strengthen collaborative links, especially international ones. With this
conference, LSU joins in a partnership with the University of Florida, Vandebilt
University and the University of Mississippi in hosting an annual conference
series in ordered algebraic structures. The conference web site is at
