9400905 Taylor Work supported by this award will focus on mathematical problems
arising in the theory of partial differential equationsnd their applications.
The plans include research on three overlapping areas: applications of
microlocal analysis to nonlinear partial differential equations, inverse
scattering problems and diffraction of waves by a boundary. The first extends
early results on the action of pseudodifferential operators and includes further
development of Morrey space analysis and applications. Work will also continue
in establishing that smooth solutions to various nonlinear evolution equations
do not break down, provided one has a bound on certain Zygmund space norms. A
program to stabilize in an optimal fashion a class of inverse obstacle problems
will be carried out. Work will be done in passing from estimates for the
linearized problem to the true inverse problem via a combination of techniques
from microlocal analysis and a variant of Moser's method for treating hard
implicit function theorems. The research on diffraction of solutions to linear
wave equations by a boundary represents a long-running collaboration with R.
Melrose. This work also includes investigations into phenomena in nonlinear
geometrical optics in cases involving diffraction. Partial differential
equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role
of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to
provide qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This may
include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In
addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and
estimates on the accuracy of these approximations. ***
