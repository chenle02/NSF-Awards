This award provides funds for a new Research Data Center on the campus of the
University of Nebraska Lincoln, with a branch center at Iowa State University.
Research Data Centers are established by host institutions with cooperation from
the Bureau of the Census. The Center will provide secure access to restricted-
use government microdata for the purpose of statistical research. Research at
this Center will include projects on a wide range of topics, including
economics, rural vs. urban life and resource sustainability, and water and food
security. The research conducted at this RDC will give policymakers new insights
into long term trends in this region of the country. In addition, Center
researchers plan to use their expertise in survey methods to work to develop
methods appropriate for Census data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RDC is supported
by an initial consortium that includes the host institutions and the University
of Nebraska Medical Center, the University of South Dakota, and the University
of Iowa. The Center will add geographic diversity to the current network of 18
existing RDCs.
