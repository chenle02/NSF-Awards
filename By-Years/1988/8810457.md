This project is a continuation of experimental and theoretical studies of
reactions of organic molecules in order to determine the timing of bond
formation in these systems and to develop a general theory of reactivity in
pericyclic reactions based upon transition-state molecular orbitals. The
relationship of ground-state distortions to stereoselectivity will be probed by
calculations and x-ray structure determinations.
