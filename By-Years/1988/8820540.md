It is planned to perform a comprehensive and systematic investigations of
cooperative cascade superfluorescence in 3- level atomic systems. A
synchronously pumped picosecond dye laser working at twice the wave length of
the 6S-6D transition in Cs vapor will coherently excite a 6S-6D superposition
state which will coherently radiate to the ground state. A resonant optical
pumping scheme will allow the polarized two-photon picosecond excitation to
invert a small velocity subgroup, lengthening the effective inhomogeneous
linewidth to the fluorescence lifetime, so that when superradiance occurs it is
delayed from the excitation pulse by a detectable amount. The relative
intensities and positions of superradiant burst will be studied as a function of
excitation pulse intensity, light traversal time, delay time, and absorption.
