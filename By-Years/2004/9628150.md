9628150 Ruiz The duration of hydrothermal activity capable of forming a large
ore deposit and the source of ore-forming elements are central questions in the
study of metallogenesis. S particular isotopic method that can be useful in
addressing these two questions is the Re-Os system because Os, as a siderophile
element, is concentrated in sulfides. thus it is theoretically possible to
directly date sulfides instead of associated silicates by the Re-Os isotopic
system and it is also possible to use the isotopic ratio of Os to trace the
relative importance of crustal and mantle sources in ore deposits. the P.I.s
have already made great progress in using molybdenite to date ore deposits with
Re-Os isotopes and here the P.I.s propose to: (1) Continue their investigations
of the post-crystallization behavior of molybdenite. (2) Determine the
usefulness of other sulfides to date base metal porphyry systems by the isochron
method. (3) Constrain, using Re-Os isotopes, the source of metals in base metal
porphyry deposits, which represent accumulations of chalcophile elements within
the earth's crust. The results of this study will provide new insights into base
metal porphyry metallogenesis and the crust mantle interactions in convergent
margins.
