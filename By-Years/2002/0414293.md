0414293 Love The goal of this planning proposal is to create an integrated,
collaborative framework for coastal margings resreach addressing the four US
costal margins, including Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Gulf of Mexico, and
Laurentian Great Lakes. The envisioned network will support data collection,
data aggregation, analytical tools for visualization and exploratory data
mining, and a computational environment supporting predictive modeling
capabilities.
