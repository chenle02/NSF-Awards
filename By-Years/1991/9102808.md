The Fellow will develop a three-dimensional model that can test hypotheses
related to the distribution of hotspots and the nature of the mid-ocean ridges.
Hotspots distribution is effected by plate motions and may congregate near
regions of divergent flow analogues to mid-ocean ridges. The mid-ocean ridges
are either dynamical features of upwellings that have deep mantle origins, or
passive, local, shallow upwellings, induced by divergences in the plate velocity
field. The Fellow will work at the University of Michigan during his tenure.
