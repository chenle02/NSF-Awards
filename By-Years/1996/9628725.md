HRD-9628724 Cal State LA University Auxiliary "Protein Biochemistry" This
program will establish a protein analysis and purification facility which will b
used to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of action proteins and
enzymes, and the biochemical processes that regulate their cellular
concentrations and/or activities. The biochemical interactions and enzymatic
kinetics of highly purified proteins that have been altered either chemically or
by site-directed mutagenesis will be studied to understand their mechanism of
action. Also, the concentrations of proteins before and after a nutritional or
physiological change will be quantified to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms
that regulate their levels within an organism. The titles of the research
projects are "Regulation of Apolipoprotein A-1 Concentrations in Rabbit High
Density Lipoproteins by Dietary Cholesterol and Jojoba Oil", "Synthesis and
Analysis of Transition Metal Modified Peptides and Proteins", "Mapping the
Allosteric Activator Site of Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase by Site-Directed
Mutagenesis", and "The Role of Enzymatic Oxidative Defenses in Arabidopsis Leaf
Senescence". The program will involve five to ten students from minority groups
underrepresented in the sciences, specifically, African Americans, Hispanics,
and Native Americans, with the objective of preparing them for graduate school
and research careers in biochemistry. Activities will include research training
and presentations at scientific meetings, as well as seminars, and academic and
career counseling. ***
