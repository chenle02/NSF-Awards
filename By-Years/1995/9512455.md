With National Science Foundation support, the Sociology Department at UCLA will
create an integrated, shared computing environment based on the Macintosh
platform which allows for state-of-the-art computing in several research areas.
The laboratory will consist of high-end Macintosh computers configured and
networked for the following purposes: general use microcomputers with numeric
co-processing capabilities; X-windows terminals; multimedia devices capable of
audio and video recording and playback; multimedia devices usable for the
analyses of documents, both textual and pictorial. This system will facilitate
research in textual analyses, conversation and interaction analysis and
statistical computing - all areas in which faculty members specialize.
Historical sociologists rely heavily on texts and search and analyze them based
on particular works and phrases - a very time consuming process. With the new
system, it will be possible to scan such materials into the computer and conduct
quick and efficient searches. This will facilitate current work such as the
study of peasant economics and the relationship between agricultural production
practices and a range of social variables. Interaction analyses focus on the
relationship between individuals and this will be facilitated by two
laboratories with visual and sound equipment. Issues such as the relationship
between doctors and patients can be studied and feedback is directly useful in
physician training. Because, in good part, of lack of appropriate
instrumentation, powerful new techniques developed by statisticians are rarely
used in the social sciences and the equipment provided will make many of these
available not only to senior researchers, but to graduate and undergraduate
students as well.
