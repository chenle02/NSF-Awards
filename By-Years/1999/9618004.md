The PIs will combine numerical and theoretical studies of turbulence generation
and scalar spectra and co-spectra of ion, electron and aerosol constituents
caused by turbulence motions. This should provide a theoretical understanding of
small-scale structure and its connection to radar backscatter intensities and
characteristics in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The PI plans to
address evidence for high Schmidt numbers at VHF and UHF frequencies, different
backscatter intensities and characteristics at different frequencies, and
influences of turbulence on pre-existing gradients of electrons, ions, and
aerosols under polar summer mesopause and more general MLT conditions.
