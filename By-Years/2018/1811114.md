This National Science Foundation funded project is focused on PIs' cutting-edge
research in Quantum Topology, an area of mathematics that involves three-
dimensional shapes that are called three-manifolds and knotted circles within
them. Knots appear naturally in the process of replication of DNA, a fundamental
part of life. They also appear in theoretical and practical models of quantum
computation, using pioneering work of Jones and Freedman, two mathematicians
decorated by the highest honor in Mathematics, namely a Fields Medal. Those
models of quantum computation, if realized, may bring changes to the world
comparable to the invention of electricity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
project in Quantum Topology links quantum field theory to topology in dimensions
three and four, leading to powerful invariants of knots and three-manifolds that
include the Jones polynomial, the 3D-index, state-sums and state-integrals. The
PI and the co-PI have had substantial results on the formulation and proof of
long-standing conjectures in this area, and propose to study key unsolved
problems. The proposal is modern, interdisciplinary and employs methods in
topology, geometry, algebra, number theory, analysis, quantum field theory and
combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
