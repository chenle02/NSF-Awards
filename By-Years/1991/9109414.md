Theoretical research in astrophysics will be concerned with the large scale
structure of the universe and with the nature of the dark matter in the
universe. The astrophysical production of axions, which could be a dominant
component of the dark matter, will be probed. The generation of primordial
density fluctuations (which could eventually lead to the presently-observed
large scale structure) by topological defects such as magnetic monopoles will be
studied. The possibility that some of the observed large scale structure is not
real but a result of the limitations of observing techniques will be explored.
These projects are important to our efforts to understand the large - scale
nature of the universe.
