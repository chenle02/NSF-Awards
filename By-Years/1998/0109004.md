0109004&lt;br/&gt;Fenical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is for
support of a collaborative research between Dr. William Fenical, Marine Research
Division, University of California at San Diego, San Diego, California and Dr.
Diaa Youssef, Department of Pharamcognosy, Suez Canal University, Ismailia,
Egypt&lt;br/&gt;The two plan a series of expeditions and research seminars
within Egypt and research visits of the Egyptian scientist to Scripps
Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. The purpose is to expand
our knowledge of the sources, types and reactivities of the defensive molecules
produced by Red Sea invertebrates, and to explore the natural functions of these
molecules in defensive adaptations. The goal is to explore the natural products
chemistry and chemical ecology of these marine invertebrates, principally
gorgonian and alcyonacean corals, sponges and encrusting ascidians.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This award will allow a team of US scientists to
collaborate with Egyptian scientists in a research project to study an area that
is not well understood. The interaction should be mutually beneficial. The
project will provide Fenical's group access to a new research site, and will
provide them international exposure. This exposure would be particularly
valuable for graduate students. It will benefit Youssef's group by providing
them exposure to one of the leading natural products chemistry groups in the
world, by the advanced training, and by the provided.
