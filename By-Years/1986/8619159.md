Funds are provided for the continuation of the effort on high resolution
transmission electron microscopy study of phase transitions and solid state
reactions in modulated structures. Major emphasis of the study is directed
toward understanding the mechanism of discommensuration process and the kinetics
of the incommensurate-commensurate phase transitions which occur in modulated
structures, in particular those formed by the CDW (charge density wave)
formation in transition metal dichalcogenides such as tantalum selenide and
tantalum sulfide and in long period superlattice in alloys such as silver-
magnesium. Mechanisms of boundary motion in forming modulated structures of
different periods which accompanies the commensuration process will also be
investigated.
