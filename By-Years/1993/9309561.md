ABSTRACT --- CTS-9309561 This proposal deals with the application of analytical
and experimental techniques to Self Propagating High Temperature Synthesis (SHS)
in the presence of external forces. Two types of modes of application of the
force are proposed to be investigated: uniaxial and centrifugal pressing. The
specific goals of this study include the understanding of simultaneous
combustion and densification, phase separation and interfacial interactions.
Analytical relationships are to be developed to describe the simultaneous
effects of combustion and densification. A strategy is envisioned for the design
and scale-up of the process to synthesize and densify simultaneously.
