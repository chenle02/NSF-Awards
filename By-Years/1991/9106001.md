The Snowbird zone is a major structural break crossing North America from the
Rocky Mountains to Hudson Strait, it marks the boundary between the Rae and
Hearne Archean provinces and may represent the suture along which these ancient
provinces (micro- continents?) were attached. This project is part of a
collaborative research program with the Geological Survey of Canada. It will
focus on the metamorphic and structural history of the tantato domain, one of
the best exposed parts of the Snowbird deformation zone, in northeastern
Saskatchewan. Results from the study of mylonites in the domain should help
constrain the relative motions and pressure-temperature conditions during the
deformation that produced the Snowbird zone, and therefore help understand its
significance in the Archean development of North America.
