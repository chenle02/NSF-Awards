This project upgrades and expands two presently offered laboratory courses in
applied physics to three courses emphasizing laboratory techniques, data
analysis and presentation. Five computer data-acquisition workstations allow
students to control experimental processes, to gather data for numerical
analysis, and to prepare their final presentations. Students are introduced to
experiment design, numerical data analysis, statistical interpretation of data,
experimental error, and minimum variance. Each workstation has traditional
display outputs as well as computer-recorded outputs.
