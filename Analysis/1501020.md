Abstract (Christianson, 1501020):

This award provides funding for a sequence of mini-schools during 2015-2017, to
be held at the University of North Carolina. The three mini-schools in 2015 will
be held held during March 4-6, 2015 (tentative), April 8-10, 2015 and summer of
2015 respectively.

Through the mini-schools, intimate interaction and collaboration will be
established between members at all levels of the University of North Carolina
Partial Differential Equations group with members at all levels of other elite
research groups with allied interests. The tentative principal speakers for 2015
are: Gunther Uhlmann, Alexandru Ionescu, and Steve Zelditch. During each mini-
school, the principal speaker will give a series of three or more lectures over
the course of 2-3 days on an important topic in the fields of geometric analysis
and partial differential equations. Funded participants will be chosen by the
organizing committee in collaboration with the principal speaker. Several funded
participants will give satellite talks complementing the principal speaker's
lectures. More information will be provided at https://math.unc.edu/seminars-
and-colloquia/seminar.
