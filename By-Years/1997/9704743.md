The proposed research deals with various aspects of interactions between the
analysis of the Laplace operator on differential forms (including the case of
functions) and its discrete analogs with the geometry and topology of underlying
spaces. In particular, the principal investigator will work on the following
specific topics: L^2 Betti numbers and related spectral invariants; spectral
theory of degenerating hyperbolic manifolds; L^2 torsion of finite volume
hyperbolic manifolds; the principle of not feeling the boundary and nonlocal
boundary conditions; spectrum for metrics of modest regularity; upper bounds for
the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on functions on a compact Riemannian
manifold. The differential and difference operators that are the subject of the
proposed research appear in such diverse areas of mathematics as combinatorics,
communication networks, differential geometry, mathematical physics, numerical
analysis, probability, and topology. Intuitions and ideas coming from one of
these fields can (and do) provide powerful and unexpected insight for problems
in other seemingly unrelated fields. Because of this, the Laplace operators are
a fundamental object of study. One aspect of the proposed project is the
application of ideas from analysis in a continuous setting to a combinatorial
problem which ultimately leads to a topological result.
