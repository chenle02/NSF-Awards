This proposal is a joint submission from Utah State University and the
University of Alabama in Huntsville for the application of a new technique
developed under previous NSF support to determine neutral meridional
thermospheric winds from ground based measurements of the height of the
ionospheric F2 layer. The knowledge of the global wind system in the upper
atmosphere is basic to understanding the transport of heat and minor chemical
constituents from high latitudes to low and from dayside to nightside, and for
predicting the propagation characteristics of the ionosphere for radio waves and
microwave communication with spacecraft. The combination of resources and skills
from the two institutions will lead to a particularly strong study.
