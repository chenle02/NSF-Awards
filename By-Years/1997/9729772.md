Public anatomy, the ceremonial dissection and examination of animals that was
performed annually at most European medical schools, was an important part of
public culture in the early modern period. Such events not only taught the
public what the body looked like, they also entertained, enlightened, bedazzled,
and offered moral education to the general public. In a word, anatomical
demonstration formed a `moral theatre.` This study will examine how such events
used animals to reflect ideas about the human body. More generally, public
anatomy will be used as a strategic research site for studying European culture
in the transition between religious and secular modes of thought. In such
respects the study of public anatomy sheds light on changing modes of thought,
explores the relationship between science and the general public, and reveals
early antecedents to contemporary concerns about animal experimentation. The
study will be based largely on archival research in Britain, France, Italy and
the Netherlands, and will produce scholarly articles and a book.
