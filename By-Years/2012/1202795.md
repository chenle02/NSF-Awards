This action funds a National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship for FY 2012. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in
a host laboratory for the Fellow to focus their studies in plant genomics with
an emphasis on quantitative genetics, modern breeding approaches, and
bioinformatics. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship
to Jason A. Peiffer is "Combinatorial Optimization of Molecular Plant Breeding
Strategies". The host institution for the fellowship is North Carolina State
University and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Trudy F. C. Mackay and Eric A.
Stone.

Phenomics and high-throughput sequencing have drastically increased the
information available to crop geneticists and breeders. From this information,
linkage and association mapping of alleles and genomic prediction of breeding
values have enhanced our knowledge of genetic architecture. New analytical
approaches are needed to efficiently use this architectural knowledge in the
optimization of mapping efforts and to better inform breeding practices. Drawing
techniques from the disciplines of combinatorial optimization, statistical
mechanics, and information geometry, this project will optimize the selection of
mapping and genomic prediction populations for multi-environment trials. These
techniques will incorporate prior genetic knowledge in an adaptive sequential
manner to better explore the fitness landscape of potential genotypes. By
implementing related techniques, scientists will be able to use this
understanding of a population's orientation on the landscape to direct cross-
pollination and selection decisions that better exploit genetic diversity and
allow breeders to more rapidly converge on a desired phenotype for a given crop
application and environment.

Training objectives include computational science, applied mathematics,
evolutionary biology, and genetics. Broader impacts include capacity-building
and advanced training for students from the United States to engage in
interdisciplinary research in plant improvement and associated sciences such as
physiology, quantitative genetics, and computational biology. Programs and
source code facilitating execution of these approaches will be made publicly
available.
