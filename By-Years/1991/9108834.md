This award funds a search for, and study of, quasars at very high redshifts.
Dr. Schmidt, the Principal Investigator, is one of the world leaders in such
studies. He aims in this work to investigate the apparent decrease in the
density of quasars at redshifts greater than three, an effect which he
discovered in previous investigations. This may indicate that we are here
observing the initial period of birth of the quasars, and probably that of
galaxies as well.
