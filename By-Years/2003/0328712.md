The Howard University Pre-College program, called the Energy Expert Systems
Institute (EESI), is a 5-week residential program aimed at attracting high
school students, with special emphasis on underrepresented students, to choose a
career in electrical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extensive hands-on and research training to expose
students to current and relevant topics in electrical engineering such as power
and energy systems, communications, the application of system and network
theory, material sciences, topics from civil engineering and computer science.
Basic computation lectures in electrical engineering fundamentals and problem
solving techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Lectures aimed at developing the oral and written
communication skills of the students.&lt;br/&gt;Exposure to laboratory
programming tools like MATLAB, PSPICE, Electronic Workbench, etc, and
programming software packages like Artificial Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic, etc to
improve the students technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;Tutorials on modern technology
such as nano-technology, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), Distributed
Generation (DG), and Wavelet (WL).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Pre-College program is aimed at 11th and 12th
grade high school students from the Metropolitan area (Washington DC, Virginia,
Maryland) and other parts of the country. The program will expose them to
electrical engineering fundamentals and its application to new emerging
technologies through lectures and various research projects performed during the
program. The activities proposed will enhance the students interest and
appreciation for electrical engineering leading to increased enrollment in
engineering programs and awards of engineering degrees. The program will also
reach out to undergraduates and high school teachers from urban schools to allow
them to gain a broader experience and understanding of technology. The
experiences gained by teachers will impact effective teaching and learning of
modern tools and technology in the high schools.&lt;br/&gt;
