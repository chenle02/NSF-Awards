"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Karl S. Booksh of the
University of Delaware is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop a scanning, single particle
surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy technique to be applied for label-free
imaging of nanoscale heterogeneous materials. A single gold or silver
nanoparticle will be placed on the tip of an optical fiber probe of a near-field
scanning optical microscope. The plasmon field will be shaped and focused by
adjusting the size and morphology of the nanoparticle probe. Refractive index
changes on the probed surface will affect the surface plasmon resonance
frequency of the particle immobilized at the tip of the probe. This will enable
the high-resolution mapping of local dielectric constants of nanoscale
heterogeneous materials without the need for dyes or reporter molecules. Such a
high resolution, non-invasive imaging method is currently not available. The
proposed imaging technique will be useful for characterization of surfaces of
materials such as SAMs, lipid bilayers, and soft polymers, and will lead to
innovations in nanoscience and technology, surface chemistry, and biotechnology.
