Southern College of Technology is adding an Automated Lightwave Component
Analysis System at its campus in Marietta, GA. This new instrumentation system
represents a major addition to the Wilder Communications Center. The Automated
Lightwave Component Analysis System gives the 1100 undergraduate students in the
Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology department access to the latest
in computer-controlled test instrumentation that is equivalent to that used in
the lightwave communications industry. Southern Tech's students use the system
to study, in great detail, the performance of virtually any transmitter or
receiver used in modern fiberoptic voice, data and video communications systems
throughout the world. Their studies include analysis of high-speed and high-
power semiconductor lasers and of very sensitive photodiodes. In addition, the
lightwave analysis instrumentation allows the students to completely
characterize the end-to-end performance of entire fiberoptic systems including
those designed and built as projects by the students themselves.
