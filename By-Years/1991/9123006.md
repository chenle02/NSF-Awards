The heat transfer characteristics of the evaporating extended meniscus will be
measured. The contact line region, which is critically important to many
technologies, will be emphasized. This complicated non-equilibrium system has
only been rudimentarily studied. Therefore, a systematic study of the effects of
the liquid-solid-vapor intermolecular force field, as described by a new
dimensionless parameter, and the size of the system on the stress, the heat
transfer characteristics and the stability will be function of the thickness
profile, will be measured using microcomputer enhanced video microscopy based on
ellipsometry and interferometry. The data will be analyzed using the numerical
solution of a model equation which will then be used to obtain the transport
characteristics. The temperature field will be measured using the interline
absorbed film thickness and small temperature sensors.
