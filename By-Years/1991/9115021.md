The infrastructure award is for the acquisition of equipment to develop a
laboratory for parallel processing. The major acquisition is a 64 processor MIMD
(Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) parallel computer and workstations.
Research will be performed in software engineering, parallel algorithms and data
structures, networks and simulation, computer vision, and database management
systems. The advent of new architecture parallel computers has opened new areas
of research related to the effective use of these computers. The MIMD computers
work by allowing individual processors to operate on independent data streams.
The discovery of algorithms to effectively use this type of architecture is a
major research question crossing several disciplines. The parallel processing
laboratory at the University of Florida is investigating several research topics
ranging from experimental algorithm studies to computer vision applications. In
particular: 1. The software engineering group is developing a parallel
programming language environment to be used in the development of parallel
programs in conjunction with a knowledge based development and maintenance
environment. 2. The parallel algorithms group is concentrating on experimentally
determining bottlenecks with both processor communication and input/output
devices. The experimental results will be compared with theoretical models of
performance. 3. The network and simulation group is using the parrallel computer
as both an experimental testbed for load balancing and other performance
enhancing algorithms and as a computational resource to perform complex
simulations. 4. The computer vision group is developing algorithms to utilize
parallelism. There is a natural match between many vision applications and the
MIMD architecture. 5. The database management group is designing algorithms to
implement an object oriented semantic database model on a MIMD architecture
computer. //
