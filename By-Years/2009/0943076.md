The Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education (DBASSE) of the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) proposes a RAPID project to create a
conceptual framework for conducting a comprehensive evaluation the District of
Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). The need for such an evaluation is mandated by
the Public Education Reform Amendment Act (PERAA) of 2007 and the evaluation
must begin in the fall of 2009. Therefore, the framework must be developed
within the next several months. This framework will guide the structure, data
collection, analysis and timeline for conducting a rigorous and comprehensive
evaluation of DCPS in terms of impacts on students, teachers and administrators,
and the system, with particular attention to issues in STEM
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The framework will examine how the new
accountability system has addressed chronic problems in DCPS; components aimed
at school staff will look at credentials, retention and instructional
practices;the student component will examine a range of outcomes such as
achievement, course-taking, and dropout/attendance. The project will be led by a
panel of national experts to be identified by the NRC.
