Most words have more than one meaning. The standard computational model for word
meaning is through lists of dictionary senses. However, choosing the right
dictionary sense is a highly difficult task for humans as well as machines. This
CAREER project follows the hypothesis, based on current models of human concept
representation, that word meaning is better described through a graded notion of
similarity than through dictionary senses. The hypothesis is tested through a
novel meaning annotation framework and computationally through a vector space
model of word meaning. The model uses vector characterizations of typical
arguments to compute the meaning of an individual occurrence compositionally
from the words in its syntactic context. For evaluation, the project focuses on
the ability to draw appropriate inferences, in both shallow and deep frameworks,
from similarity-based meaning representations. The research effort goes together
with educational work that focuses on supporting undergraduate research,
stressing hands-on data exploration and interdisciplinary
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characterization of word meaning is a central
issue in lexical semantics and in computational linguistics as a whole. This
CAREER project will yield a broadly applicable paradigm that describes word
meaning without recourse to dictionary senses. It aims both to provide a more
cognitively adequate model and to benefit language technology applications, in
particular information retrieval, which already relies heavily on vector space
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
