Attardi 9707587 Career Advancement Awards expand the opportunity for women
researchers to advance their career. Dr. Attardi will use these funds to
increase her knowledge of brain anatomy and to acquire state-of-the-art
neuroanatomical techniques to allow her to examine the differential actions of
progesterone leading to the facilitation or inhibition of the gonadotropin
surge. The progesterone receptor is unusual among members of the steroid/thyroid
family of nuclear receptors since, it exists in two isoforms, PRa and PRb, in
all species except the rabbit. Moreover, it has been suggested that
responsiveness to progesterone within a particular tissue could depend upon
changes in the relative ratios of the two isoforms especially given that the two
isoforms change developmentally and with endocrine manipulations. Since these
studies used only tissue from the peripheral system, it is not clear whether the
two isoforms are involved in the mechanism of progesterone action in neural
tissue as well. Dr. Attardi will now examine both the presence and the
regulation of the two progesterone isoforms in the brain and pituitary. She will
determine the role that these two isoforms play in the modulating the ability of
estrogen and progesterone to regulate gonadotropin secretion. Understanding the
integration of this complex neuroendocrine mechanism is very important since it
underlies the perpetuation of the species.
