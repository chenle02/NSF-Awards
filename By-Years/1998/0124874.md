This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
prototype of an integrated set of software tools for computer aided optimal
design. This tool box will require interfacing with large scale proprietary
codes for the simulation of physical phenomena. The industry problems to which
will be addressed are such that conventional optimization techniques are not
applicable. Intelligent search methods and parallel computing in distributed
networks will be the basic tools to be considered. and the applicability of a
recently developed system for asynchronous parallel pattern search.

The system, that exist today, needs to be extended so that nonlinear constraints
can be introduced and larger dimensional problems can be solved. Initial focus
will be on optimal structural design, piezoelectric transducer design and the
design of optoelectronic devices.
