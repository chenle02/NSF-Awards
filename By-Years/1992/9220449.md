This project will examine household economic strategies and wild resource
exploitation associated with market integration in a peasant community in an
Amazonian ecological reserve. The central question is how the increasing market
integration will affect traditional resource exploitation, household economics,
and intra- community relations. The research represents a unique opportunity to
examine an isolated population wherein a traditional, subsistence resource use
system based on common property is influenced by increased outside demand; and
it is important in understanding human impact on the environment in protected
areas. It will also contribute to our understanding the effects of governmental
control on protected areas which have human residents.
