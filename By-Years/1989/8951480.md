This funding supports the acquisition of a Sequent parallel processing system
that basis for development of a parallel processing laboratory: This laboratory
provides experimentation with a variety of parallel architectures and software
environments. Applications of the system are chosen both for their importance to
industry as well as their educational value in learning how to design, program,
and verify parallel programs. This award is being matched by an equal amount
from the principal investigator's institution.
