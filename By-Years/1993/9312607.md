This interagency transfer of funds is part of an agreement between NIH, NSF and
AID to jointly fund three projects for five years, each with three interwoven
components: drug discovery, biodiversity conservation and economic development.
Each funded project will seek to make biotic surveys in developing areas with
the purpose of simultaneously inventorying biological diversity, screening
suitable elements of that diversity for natural pharmaceutical products and
translating the results of this effort into economic potential for the
inhabitants of the host areas. NIH will administer this cooperative research
program for the three agencies, thus necessitating this interagency transfer.
