9412706 Sundaram The focal point of this research proposal is the understanding
of the use, efficacy and limitations of classical and semi-classical methods in
describing the dynamics of strongly coupled quantum systems. Since the strength
of the interaction precludes the use of quantum perturbation theory in these
systems, non-perturbative intuition is derived from a classical description of
the dynamics, which is most often nonintegrable or chaotic. A number of
important issues of both practical and formal consequence arise from the
quantization of dynamics with a classically chaotic limit. In particular, we
propose to investigate 1) the periodic orbit expansion starting from exact
expressions of the trace of quantum propagators, the contributions of
analytically continued orbits and the possibility of conherence (scarred wave
functions) associated with these so-called 'ghost' orbits,2) the effects of
noise introduced via parametric fluctuations on de stabilizing scarred wave-
functions and 3) scarred wave functions in higher dimensions with specific
application to the problems of stabilization of ground state atoms in super-
intense laser fields and to the noise spectroscopy in the interaction of Rydberg
atoms with microwaves. ***
