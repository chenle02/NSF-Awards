Professor Gillet will be studying a number of problems related to Arakelov
Theory, Motives, and special values of zeta and L-functions. &lt;br/&gt;He plans
to show that there is a specialization map for motives of varieties over
discretely valued fields; this would for example describe the relationship
between the motive of a variety defined over the rational numbers and the
associated, possibly singular, varieties over finite fields. He plans to study
whether one can do arithmetic intersection theory on singular varieties, and
improve our understanding of the height pairing on algebraic cycles which are
homologically trivial. He also intends to study questions relating heights and
similar integrals to special values of Dirichlet series. This includes
understanding the relationship between heights of conics and the eigenvalues of
Heun's equation, which is a classical differential equation arising from
problems in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of these areas of
research is to improve our understanding of Diophantine equations, that is,
understanding the properties of the set of integer solutions of equations with
integer coefficients. Diophantine equations have applications in particular to
problems in cryptography and coding theory.
