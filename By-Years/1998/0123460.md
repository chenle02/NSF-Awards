This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation NSF 01-65 on "Ultra-
High Capacity Optical Communications and Networking." We have recently
introduced a hollow dielectric optical fiber which utilizes a one-dimensional
photonic crystal to guide light. This fiber is predicted to have an unrivaled
degree of confinement of the electromagnetic energy density in the hollow core -
allowing for broad-band and low loss transmission with substantially decreased
non-linear behavior. In this proposal we will focus our efforts on creating
novel in-fiber optical devices based on the unique characteristics of this
hollow waveguide. We will theoretically examine the effects of inducing large
periodic modulations along the axial direction of the fiber. These are expected
to open large photonic band gaps in the direction of propagation. In particular
we will study the possibility of creating high Q cavities within the fiber.
Application to high speed all-optical switching and other novel devices will be
illustrated. The ability to form all-optical devices in a fiber has many
technical advantages, reduction of coupling losses to transmission line - not
being the least. It also opens new opportunities to low cost fabrication of
optical devices based on fiber production processes. Our efforts will be
directed towards the formulation of a general theoretical approach, the design,
development and the experimental realization of in-fiber optical devices based
on the axially modulated hollow dielectric omnidirectional waveguide.
