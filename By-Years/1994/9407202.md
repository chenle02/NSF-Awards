9407202 Losos This project consists of a long-term experiment on Bahaman islets
to test for competitive interactions between two similar species of Anolis
lizards. The investigators are introducing each species of lizard alone, or in
combination, onto replicate islets naturally lacking these lizards. The
investigators are also collecting data that will reveal whether morphological
character displacement has occurred during the course of the experiment. The
project also measures the direct and indirect effects of the lizards, singly and
in combination, on lower trophic levels. Character displacement has been a very
important concept in population biology and ecology, yet has never been
demonstrated experimentally. This experiment is important because it will
measure for the first time the ecological processes that operate during
character displacement. The results of this study can be applied to conservation
biology, especially in the design and management of natural reserves and the
management of endangered species.
