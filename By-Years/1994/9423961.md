9423961 Lawall The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Julia L. Lawall to work with Professor
Charles Consel of the University of Rennes/Irisa in France on the development of
an incremental specialization system. The French side of this collaboration is
already collaborating with a group in the U.S. on using incremental
specialization in the development of portable micro-kernel operating system.
Micro-kernel is a system built out of modules on top of a very small kernel.
Incremental specialization would allow an operating system built in this manner
to perform efficiently, by specializing the interactions between the modules to
the demands placed on the operating system. The U.S. group is focusing on the
operating systems aspects of the project, while the French group (which will now
include Dr. Lawall) is focusing on the development of the incremental
specialization systems. ***
