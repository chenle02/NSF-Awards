9458102 Lockery There is growing evidence that human behavior is strongly
influenced by genes. Because many behavioral genes are believed to exert their
influence through the nervous system, it is essential to understand how genes
affect the structure and function of individual neurons. A promising approach to
this problem is to study how genes control the behavior of simple animals. In
many ways, the tiny (1 mm long) roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is ideal for
this investigation: the connectivity among its 302 nerve cells is known
completely; the neural circuits for its behaviors have been identified; over 150
genes affecting behavior have been found; and cloning a gene to determine its
function is easier than in almost any other animal. The main objectives of my
research, therefore, are: (1) to make electrophysiological recordings from
identified neurons in C. elegans to determine how behavior is produced in normal
animals, and (2) to determine how genes affect the structure and function of the
nervous system in C. elegans by recording from identified neurons in behavioral
mutants. This research will deepen our understanding of the causes of behavior
in this increasingly important system and, because C. elegans have homologs in
mammals, it will very likely expand our knowledge of the genetic basis of
behavior in more complex organisms, including humans.
