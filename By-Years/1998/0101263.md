With this Renewal proposal, Professor Richard Saykallly seeks support for his
research on laser spectroscopy of ions and water clusters. The proposed research
will refine and extend the water dimer potential, by characterizing and modeling
out of plane librational vibrations expected to be seen near 500 cm-1. The
refined dimer potential will then be used to calculate three-body interactions
in the water trimer. These potentials will then be used for advanced bulk water
simulations, in collaboration with David Chandler's group at Berkeley.
Additional aspects, such as experimental examination of (H2O)8, hydrated proton
clusters, EXAFS of liquid water, and nucleotide base hydrates will be examined
experimentally.

Improved models for liquid water and aqueous solvation will have impact in the
modeling of protein structures and other biological molecules. A greater
understanding of liquid water remains an important unsolved problem in molecular
physics and condensed matter chemistry.
