One of the roles theoretical computer science is to develop an algorithmic
theory for various application domains. This research is motivated by some
practical problems in computer vision and molecular biology. The main motivating
problem in computer vision is that of searching aerial or satellite photographs.
In this investigation, the problem is abstracted to several "pure" subproblems -
local errors, scaling, and rotations - and efficient solutions are sought. The
research then attempts to synthesize the subproblem solutions and obtain a
general algorithm. The tools for the solution involve techniques that give rise
to more general algorithmic and data structure problems. This research also
addresses problems stemming from molecular biology. Recently, several
researchers presented efficient dynamic programming methods for determining the
RNA secondary structure. New information shows that the secondary structure is
more involved than originally thought. The researchers are investigating whether
the problem is now NP- hard. The answer to that question will determine if
efficient algorithms or efficient approximations to its solution will be sought.
