This award provides participants support to the conference "Symmetry and
Geometry on the Southern Great Plains" which will take place at the University
of Oklahoma, April 26-28, 2019. The goal of the conference is to advances in
Riemannian geometry in the presence of symmetry. Symmetry has long been used in
Riemannian geometry as a tool for building natural classes of examples and for
testing/forming conjectures. The meeting will bring together a broad cross-
section of experts and young mathematicians to help promote new exchanges of
ideas and techniques. The organizers the organizers will promote the conference
to women and under-represented groups so as to increase their participation in
the meeting. The meeting will feature a diverse array of speakers with speakers
ranging from graduate students to postdocs to established
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers plan for this meeting to be the
first one in the series of yearly conferences held alternately at the University
of Oklahoma and Wichita State University during the Spring semester. "Symmetry
and Geometry on the Southern Great Plains" conferences will revolve around the
interaction between symmetry and geometry, with key areas represented coming
from: Homogeneous and low-cohomogeneity Spaces, Lie Groups, Metric geometry,
Einstein metrics, Ricci solitons, Alexandrov geometry, and manifolds of positive
and non-negative curvature. There will be a mix of research and expository
talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
