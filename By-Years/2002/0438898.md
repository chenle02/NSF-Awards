Abstract &lt;br/&gt;0438898&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;University of
Virginia Main Campus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Architectural decisions define search
spaces within which designs evolve. Architectural commitments decisively
influence economic and technical success, yet we lack a validated account of key
relationships between architectures and such outcomes. Baldwin and Clark have
proposed an account of the nature of architecture in terms of design rules, and
of its economic value in terms of real options. Sullivan has developed options-
based accounts of the value of flexibility in design and tested the ability of
Baldwin and Clark's models to explain information hiding and aspect-oriented
design. A major open question remains: Can this approach not only describe but
support development of complex, software-intensive systems? This research will
perform one experiment to test the hypothesis that it can. If successful, the
work will demonstrate support for the modeling of complex architectures in terms
of design decisions, design rules,&lt;br/&gt;dependence relations on design
decisions, and modularity in the dependence structure; and account for key
sources of value in the system design, judged by the ways it evolved and was
exploited to create value for users. A theoretical issue to be addressed is the
possibility of defensible estimates of the sigma parameter of the real options
valuation model. &lt;br/&gt;
