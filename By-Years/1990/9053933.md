Hudson Valley Community College will collaborate in this model project with two
N.Y. State organizations: Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped;
Office of Vocational &amp; Educational Services; and with Troy Resource Center
for Independent Living, Capital District Center for Independence, and the IBM
Corporation. The goal of this model project is to develop a career access ladder
in science, engineering and technologies for individuals with disabilities.
Several innovations characterize the project, including an alternative, short
term approach to academic programming, a supportive academic environment, a pre-
employment training program, and computer networking of academic resources. The
program has support form the college, IBM, and state and local agencies. It will
build upon successful intervention projects, with an incremental approach to
specific needs, i.e. a motivational phase, followed by several training levels
or steps. The training program will feature a curriculum designed by the
Business Advisory Council, with job readiness skills component to ensure
effective transition from training to the work environment. The identification
of needs and deliverables uniquely characterizes project.
