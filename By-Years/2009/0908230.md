This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Erika Gibb will investigate how
volatile molecules such as water, carbon monoxide, and simple organic molecules
evolved through the collapse of a dark cloud into a protoplanetary disk and
eventual incorporation into protoplanets or comets. This proposal will support a
high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopic study of numerous disks and
envelopes surrounding very young stars to discern the chemical composition of
these objects. A major goal of the program will be to explore how the formation
environment and viewing geometry affect the measured composition of gas and dust
in star forming regions. The results will be used to test models of chemical
evolution of clouds and disks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to
have a broad impact on studies of origins of life and the evolution of young
stars, and will contribute to a better understanding of interstellar and disk
chemistry and will significantly impact chemical modeling of disks. Dr. Gibb and
her team will integrate their research into secondary school education by
educating teachers in the metropolitan St. Louis area. They will develop a
summer workshop, in collaboration with the College of Education at her
institution, to train teachers in the St. Louis area in the effective classroom
use of astronomy-based activities. The activities will enhance conceptual
understanding of science and teach the fundamental importance of scientific
inquiry. The workshop will address key components of the Missouri Science Grade
Level Expectations for secondary students through an interdisciplinary approach
to science. A similar workshop, focusing on comet science, will be developed by
Dr. Gibb and a collaborator for the Washington, DC metropolitan area.
