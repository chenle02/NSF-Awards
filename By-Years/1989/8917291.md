This project is a collaborative multidisciplinary tectonic investigation of the
Mojave Desert region of southern California that will be conducted by workers at
the University of Utah (EAR89-16838, The University of Kansas (EAR89-16802) and
the University of North Carolina (EAR89-17291). The study will assess the
continuity of a late Jurassic fold-thrust belt found in the Cronese Hills that
may continue to the southwest and will determine how much Cretaceous and younger
overprint there may be on this tectonic belt. The magnitude and spatial
distribution of Tertiary extension in the Central Mojave will be studied. The
work will focus on field mapping, geochronology and metamorphic petrology of
pre-Tertiary rocks in the western Mojave and mapping, geochronology and basin
analysis of mid-Tertiary syntectonic deposits in the central Mojave. Results
will contribute to regional tectonic syntheses of southwestern North America and
to characterization of processses governing the tectonic evolution of
continental-margin orogens and the large- scale superimposed extension of the
crust.
