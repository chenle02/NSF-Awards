The Exhibit Research Collaborative is a consortium of eight science centers
whose purpose is to develop and produce eight exhibits that will circulate among
the participating institutions and that potentially will travel to other science
centers. Apart from the exhibit aspect the project also has as a related purpose
the training of the staffs of the participating institutions. The present
project represents a second phase of the collaborative effort.
