AST-0434413&lt;br/&gt;Szapudi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop
new techniques to characterize spatial clustering in large astronomical
datasets. The principal goal is a new edge-corrected, banded bispectrum
estimator based on a unique combination of ideas: i) carefully analyze and fully
exploit the underlying symmetries, ii) correct for symmetry breaking by the
window and noise in pixel space, iii) use edge corrected, nearly optimal
estimators with heuristic weighting, iv) use fast, hierarchical computing
algorithms v) use regularized, hierarchical (multi-resolution) transform
techniques to recover the optimal statistics from pixel space estimators. This
unusually broad synergy of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and
astronomy will result in a quantum leap in speed and ability to map the full
configuration space of spatial clustering. The resultant techniques are
practical and applicable to other statistics and to many different large data
sets. Results will feed back into a new advanced statistics class, and will be
broadly disseminated.
