DMI-9634828 Munoz Most of the fiber manufactured today is used for building and
aircraft thermal insulation, ceiling tile, high-efficiency air filtration media,
and commercial roofing systems. One of the most exciting applications for
fibrous materials are their current and potential uses in composites. One
advantage of short versus continuous fiber for reinforcing composite materials
includes the rapid, low-cost composite manufacturability through compression,
injection molding or extrusion. The success of short or discontinuous fibers for
implementation in the manufacturing of advanced composites depends on the
control of fiber length and bulk fiber orientation. In addition, small diameter
(10m) fibers also result in improved thermal insulation characteristics.
Therefore, manufacturers of refractory, glass and polymer fibers are
particularly keen on controlling the fiber diameter in the industrial
fiberization processes. In addition, improved control of fiber diameter may lead
to significant energy savings in industrial furnaces. This research project
investigate the air turbulence interaction during the fiberization processes.
Experiments are designed to provide fundamental information regarding the air
turbulence and fiber interaction. Objectives of the experiments include
developing a relationship between the characteristics of the turbulence, fiber
stiffness, fiber deformation, and fiber tensile force, while controlling the
turbulence characteristics. This research project has strong collaboration
between the Colorado State of Mines and Schuller International. More
importantly, the work will likely have direct implications to other industries
by providing an improved understanding of less expensive manufacturing
alternatives to the older, more conventional continuous fiber manufacturing
processes.
