The objective of this research is to develop a new clocking system for future-
generation high-speed systems-on-chip such as high-performance multi-core
microprocessors, in order to overcome the fundamental challenges in timing,
noise and power consumption facing conventional clocking. In the proposed
clocking scheme, a global clock is distributed across the chip, and then
regenerated locally by injection-locked oscillators. The approach is based on a
nonlinear circuit technique, injection locking, and a full suite of supporting
technologies in systems, devices, and physics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project will advance the
understanding of timing uncertainties in integrated systems, investigate
potential challenges in injection-locked clocking, and develop multi-level
(device, circuit, and system) techniques to address both. The proposed clocking
scheme can deliver significant power savings and noise reduction compared to
conventional clocking, and seamlessly replace the latter without disruption to
the design flow and manufacturing infrastructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The research results have the potential to critically impact computing,
communications, radars, and other high-speed electronics applications. This
project will enable a series of integrated educational activities through
curriculum development, research results dissemination, and industry outreach.
Special emphasis will be placed on under-represented minority student education
and outreach to high school or younger students.&lt;br/&gt;
