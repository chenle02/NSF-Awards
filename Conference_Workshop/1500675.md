This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in
the international conference "Completeness Problems, Carleson Measures, and
Spaces of Analytic Functions" that will be held July 6-10, 2015, at the Mittag-
Leffler Institute in Djursholm, Sweden. This conference brings together a host
of international authorities to explore topics that lie at the interface of
harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and operator theory. The topics of the
conference are of wide interest in several areas of mathematics and also have
impact outside of mathematics. In particular, the completeness problems are
related to solution of Sturm-Liouville and Schroedinger differential equations,
of importance in mathematical physics, and model spaces have important
applications in control theory, of interest in engineering.

The conference will focus on recent progress in function theory, model spaces,
completeness problems, and Carleson measures; in particular, on two recent
stunning developments in the area: Poltoratski's research into the completeness
of eigenfunction solutions to certain differential equations and Lacey's work on
Carleson measures. Bringing together seasoned researchers and promising young
mathematicians to address research challenges in this area is likely to lead to
important new questions, inspire further research and new collaborations, and
lead to new breakthroughs. The conference program provides ample opportunity for
graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
