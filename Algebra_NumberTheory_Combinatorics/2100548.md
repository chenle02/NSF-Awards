The area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the branch of
mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic varieties, defined by
polynomial equations. Algebraic geometry has significant applications in coding,
industrial control, computation, and theoretical physics, where physicists
consider algebraic varieties as a piece of the fine structure of our universe.
One focus in this project is Moduli theory, which studies a remarkable
phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type
is often manifested as an algebraic variety in its own right, called a moduli
space. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of
"organisms" as itself being an "organism" is not just a metaphor but a rigorous
and quite useful fact. The other focus in this project is birational geometry,
focusing here on resolution of singularities. Resolution of singularities is a
fundamental procedure where "bad" points of an algebraic variety are removed and
replaced by "good" points. This project includes research opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students.

In more detail, the PI will continue studying problems in birational geometry,
focusing on resolution of singularities, semistable reduction, and the geometry
of stack theoretic birational modifications. The PI and collaborators will build
on recently completed work to functorially resolve singularities of proper
families of varieties; to study the geometry of weighted blowings up and more
general stack-theoretic procedures; and to study subtle phenomena in positive
characteristics. In addition, the PI will continue to study moduli spaces. The
main foci are Moduli and arithmetic of subvarieties of families of abelian
varieties, aiming to extend recent non-degeneracy and uniformity results of
rational points on curves to symmetric squares of curves and related
constructions.
