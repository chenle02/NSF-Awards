9405008 Wolf This research is concerned with applying the techniques and
knowledge of information theory and communications theory to achieve ultra high
density information storage. An important component of this research is an
experimental program by which it is planned to characterize the effects of the
storage channel on the information bearing signals. The results of these
measurements are utilized to create accurate mathematical models of the storage
channel. Examination of these models then suggests new modulation, detection,
and coding systems. The performance of these new systems is predicted by
simulation and by theoretical analysis based on the models. Finally, hardware
implementations of the most promising of these systems may be constructed and
tested on real storage systems. ***
