9624837 Alleyne This CAREER award will investigate the research issues
associated with control of fluid power actuator systems to take advantage of
their favorable load to power ratios, while improving their linear-like
behavior. The educational plan has two goals: developing a fluid power
laboratory that integrates the research and learning experiences for
undergraduate and graduate students, and a plan to increase underrepresented
minorities in engineering. The project will develop a standard set of advanced
control algorithms for generic fluid power systems, they will be implemented
using open architecture approaches on hydraulic machine tool drives. The target
manufacturing applications are high performance drilling and new parallel-link
manipulator drives. The fluid power laboratory development is strongly supported
by industry, and will enhance the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's
control and manufacturing offerings. In addition, the laboratory plays an
important role in the plan to attract and provide opportunities for
underrepresented minorities, both through existing organizations like the local
Boys and Girls Club and establishing an association for African-American
graduate students in science and engineering. The impact of this innovative
project will be technical developments that can be used to design faster, safer
and higher performance manufacturing machines and systems. The educational plan
will produce engineers experienced in the advances and limitations of high
performance fluid drive systems, and provide a more diverse and technically
competitive workforce.
