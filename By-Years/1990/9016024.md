This proposal represents a continuation of research on the fractional quantum
Hall effect (FQHE), which started as a NSF Industry-University Cooperation
Research Activity and involved a collaboration with Dr. H. L. Stormer of
AT&amp;T Bell Labs. The proposed research represents a continuation of the FQHE
effort and will be concentrated in three areas, namely 1) the nature of the
ground state, 2) low energy excitations, and 3) the transition to a Wigner
solid. This research team has made many of the significant discoveries in recent
years in this subfield and in the last 3-year period observed the even
denominator state, the small filling factor termination of the FQHE series, the
scaling behavior of the QHE, and obtained important new information on the
quasi-particle gaps.
