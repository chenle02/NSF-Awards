The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce the
amount of landfilled or environmentally polluting plastic waste and to
investigate the commercial potential of activities that divert plastic waste
from landfill. Plastic waste is a massive problem for modern society because
single-use plastic products touch all aspects of life, and reducing their use,
recycling, or finding alternative materials cannot fully address the problem. In
addition, plastics that leach into the environment damage ecosystems.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of technology that selectively
and efficiently transforms plastics into chemical products for use in high value
applications. This approach employs catalysis and chemical conversions to break
the long carbon chains of polymer macromolecules. This program will seek to
understand how the parameters and reaction conditions that affect the chemical
transformation also affect the commercial opportunities and limitation of such
conversions, as well as other factors that must be considered for innovation of
the technology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
