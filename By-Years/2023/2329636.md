This grant supports travel of a diverse group of approximately 25 dissertation-
stage students at U.S. institutions to participate in an international doctoral
consortium with distinguished research faculty. The Communication, and Digital
Technology, and Organization (CTO) doctoral consortium at the 2023 Academy of
Management (AOM) convention in Boston, Massachusetts, will consist of one and a
half days of talks and interactions among students and researchers. The CTO
doctoral consortium provides students with feedback on their work from other
students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own dissertation
research proposals. Additionally, because of the diversity of the business sub-
disciplines and communities involved in the AOM conference, the consortium will
allow students to establish research connections beyond their own disciplines.
Consequently, participation will allow students to develop a better
understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their
participation in future interdisciplinary research.

The intellectual merit of this travel grant is that it provides a forum for
doctoral students to exchange insights and receive feedback and guidance in
order to strengthen the quality of their dissertation research, and its broader
impact lies in facilitating the establishment of new research collaborations and
professional networks, as well as developing a greater awareness of ongoing
cutting-edge research in the fields of organizational communication, information
systems, and management research into the impact and role of digital
technologies in organizations and society.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
