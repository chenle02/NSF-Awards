IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2022, sponsored by the
IEEE Communication Society, is to be held in Seoul, South Korea, on May 16 â€“ 20,
2022. IEEE ICC is a premier international conference of the IEEE Communications
Society and a major event in wireless communications and networking that brings
researchers and practitioners of every aspect of digital/wireless communications
and networks together to present up-to-date results and achievements in the
field. It is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field.
Participation in events like this is an extremely important part of the graduate
school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior
researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field. Participants
have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions,
and interact with hundreds of other leading-edge researchers in the field.
Considering the pandemic situation, the conference will be held in a hybrid of
both in-person and virtual formats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal provides
travel support for approximately twenty graduate students in the United States
to attend this premiere conference. The travel awards will target first-time
attendees and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences
is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have
limited travel funds. The research community and the Engineering workforce
benefit from the improvement of students in the pipeline, and the introduction
of new researcher perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
