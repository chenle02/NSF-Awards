Title: Tropical Atmospheric Boundary Layers Physical and dynamical processes the
regulate the air-sea exchange of sensible heat flux, water vapor and momentum
will be analyzed using new data sets from the TOGA (Tropical Ocean Global
Atmosphere) Program. The proposed research is intended to contribute to a better
understanding of the coupled ocean- atmosphere system and to provide an
observational basis for improving representations of the marine atmospheric
boundary layer in dynamical prediction models of the atmosphere-ocean system.
The project has two specific objectives: o determine quantitatively the effect
of spatial variations due to mesoscale and synoptic scale disturbances on the
large- scale averaged air-sea flux fields of sensible heat, water vapor and
momentum over the equatorial Pacific Ocean o improve bulk aerodynamic formulas
for spatially averaged fluxes including weak wind conditions through analysis of
aircraft data from TOGA COARE (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment) and
moored buoy data from the TOGA-TAO (Tropical Ocean Atmosphere) array. This
research is important because it seeks to quantify the physical exchange between
the warm waters of the western Pacific Ocean and the overlying atmosphere in a
highly climate sensitive region of the world.
