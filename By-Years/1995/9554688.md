The purpose is to provide a workshop to transfer knowledge regarding the
economics of engineering design to all engineering faculty who teach design-
intensive courses. This knowledge was gained, in part, from a three-year, multi-
disciplinary, multi- institutional National Science Foundation research grant
entitled, "Integration of Economic Principles with Design in the Engineering
Science Component of the Undergraduate Curriculum" (DUE-9155917). Multimedia
based software and extensive course notebooks will be distributed to each
workshop participant. This faculty workshop will be presented two times and will
be complemented by a one-day workshop in which the participants will report on
their success in implementing workshop materials in courses taught at their home
institutions.
