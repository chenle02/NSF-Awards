This project is part of the NSF/USGS initiative within the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 17 October 1989. The influence of local soft soil conditions on
earthquake motions is often very dominant. Preliminary information suggests that
this is particularly true for the Loma Prieta earthquake. The ability to
confidently predict these effects is an important component in the effective
design of structures, in determining the accuracy of seismic code provisions,
and in estimating damage due to an earthquake. The goals of the project are (1)
to determine the ability to predict the acceleration levels and response
spectrum shapes of soft non-linear clay profiles using equivalent linear
methods, and (2) to assess the adequacy of existing design codes for soft clay
sites, using the damage potential index approach, based on the recorded and
computed response. The specific objectives of this program are: (1) To acquire
the available strong ground motion records on soft clay sites so as to determine
a representative spectrum shape; (2) Compare this spectrum with spectrum shapes
proposed by Seed and Sun (1989), the Structural Engineers Association of
California (1988) and Borcherdt (1976); (3) Analyze three soft clay sites for
which spectrum shapes have been predicted, using recorded rock motions as input
values; (4) Compare ground motions computed using the computer program SHAKE
with recorded values, in order to assess the accuracy of this program; (5)
Analyze three additional clay sites for which the earthquake damage was heavy or
where recorded motions are available, in order to provide additional
verification; and (6) Calculate the damage potential index using the measured
and computed response motions.
