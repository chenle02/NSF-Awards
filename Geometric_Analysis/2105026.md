Geometric flows are evolution equations that describe motions of surfaces, or
higher dimensional analogues, with speeds determined by their curvatures. A flow
of principal concern for this project is the Mean Curvature Flow, characterized
by the property that it evolves a surface so that its area decreases as rapidly
as possible. Geometric flows have extensive applications to various physical
problems. For instance, mean curvature flow occurs in the description of the
evolution of interfaces arising in several multiphase physical models. Moreover,
it is used in material science to model cell, grain and bubble growth. Geometric
flows have also proven to have extremely useful geometric applications,
specifically classification theorems and geometric inequalities. This project
will focus on ancient solutions to mean curvature flow, these being solutions
that have existed for all times in the past. A large and important class of
these solutions has hitherto resisted attempts at elucidation, but a new method
of constructing, studying and classifying them will be brought to bear. The
project also includes training of graduate students as well as the organization
of workshops and summer schools to help create opportunities for students to be
exposed to new developments in geometric analysis.

Ancient solutions have an important role in the study of singularities; these
constitute an obstruction to the existence for all times of the flow, and it is
therefore of major interest to understand their geometry and behavior. As is
typically the case in mathematics, focus has to be narrowed to some extent in
order to obtain satisfying answers. Therefore this project will focus on ancient
solutions to mean curvature flows that are confined to slab regions. This
project will construct, in all dimensions, a large family of new examples, both
symmetric and asymmetric; the project will also construct many eternal examples
which are not of the standard kind that evolve by translation. Additionally, the
project proposes a novel way of classifying such solutions. Finally, the project
plans to apply results to the non-collapsed setting to obtain properties of
entire solutions. Looking further ahead, there is strong evidence that these
methods apply to a much wider class of geometric flows. The project includes
plans to run seminars, train and mentor students and organize workshops on the
subject of flows. The PI also aims to broaden participation of under-represented
groups through various activities.
