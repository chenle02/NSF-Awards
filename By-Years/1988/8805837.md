Glen Hall will carry out research into problems in the theory of dynamical
systems motivated by celestial mechanics. Hall will focus his attention on two
problems in particular. The first is the study of exact symplectic twist
diffeomorphisms of four dimensions. The goal is to give examples of pathological
behavior, give regularity theorems of invariant sets and obtain a better
understanding of the topology of periodic orbits. The second problem is the
study of central configurations, particularly extreme cases of a few large
masses and many small equal masses. The goal is to find techniques for these
extreme cases which will allow extensions of these results to the n-body problem
and will include analytic and numerical work.
