This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a novel, low cost laboratory instrument for genetic analysis and single
molecule studies. The technology is suitable for the detection and
identification of DNA and RNA through fluorescent hybridization probes without
the need for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification, or for proteins and
small molecules through fluorescence immunoassays. The general scheme is based
on single molecule detection (SMD) and utilizes the two-color cross-correlation
spectroscopy (TC-FCCS) technique with coincident detection analysis scheme to
simultaneously probe ten focal regions of a microfluidic assay. High efficiency
single photon detectivity Geiger mode microavalanche photodiode (uAPD) arrays
will function as detection elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
application of this project will be on biological and medical research, and on
the drug development process. Examples of potential applications range from the
study of conformational dynamics and interactions of macromolecules to
biochemical kinetics of single molecules.&lt;br/&gt;
