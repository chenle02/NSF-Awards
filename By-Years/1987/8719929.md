Two reacting solid-state systems are investigated using dynamicx-ray diffraction
(DXRD) and other techniques. The systems to be studied are (1) the reaction of
calcium oxide and silica to form calcium silicates, and (2) the synthesis of
mullite from colloidal boehmite and silica. The objectives of the study are (1)
to obtain quantitative verification of DXRD-acquired data in a system of known
kinetic behavior (calcium silicate), (2) to apply DXRD to a multiply reacting
system (mullite), (3) to determine the effects of particle size and water vapor
on the roles of diffusion and kinetics in solid-solid reactions, and (4) to
determine the reaction sequence and rate-limiting steps in the production of
sol-gel-derived mullite. This project includes the first application of DXRD to
a system with unknown kinetics. This new technique, developed by the
investigator, has the potential to provide more detailed information on solid-
solid reacting systems than has been possible up to now.
