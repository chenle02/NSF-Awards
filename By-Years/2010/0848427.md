Professor Thomas Keyes of Boston University is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop and exploit the idea
that, with a careful treatment of polarization, straightforward classical
methods can replace difficult quantum calculations in describing the properties
of water, the binding of ligands to proteins, protein folding, protein
association, and the related spectroscopy. The calculations are facilitated by
application of the powerful "statistical temperature molecular dynamics"
computer simulation algorithm developed in the Keyes group.

Water bound to biological molecules influences physiological activity, and water
in extra-terrestrial environments is essential for life. Understanding ligand-
protein and protein-protein interactions is a key to efficient drug design. Thus
the impact of the project ranges from astronomy to the biotech industry. Close
collaborations with spectroscopists ensure that the new methods have maximum
utilization for extracting molecular information from experimental measurements.
