This RIA award will investigate, both experimentally and analytically, the
anisotropy, and anisotropic yielding. That occurs in amorphous polymers due to
molecular alignment (or orientation, or texture) that is produced during
deformation. Based on that study, an accurate constitutive relation will be
developed that closely describes the experimentally observed anisotropic
yielding. Such a relationship will be useful in subsequent studies of
manufacturing processes in which such materials undergo large inelastic
deformations.
