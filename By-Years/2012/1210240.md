This action funds Paul Stumpner of University California, Davis to conduct a
research project, entitled "Determining Proxies for Environmental Variability
stored in an Alpine Lake Sediment Core," during the summer of 2012 at GNS
Science in Wellington, New Zealand. The host scientists are Dr. Richard Levy and
Dr. Marcus Vandergoes.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is a contribution to
paleoclimatology and better undertanding of sediment transport, by determining
environmental proxies for sediment records stored in an alpine lake. Varve
counting technique for resolving sub-annual variability is dependent on
determining relationships between the hydrologic forcing mechanism and the
sediment deposit. This research helps determine those relationships.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
