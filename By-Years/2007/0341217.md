The CMET II project is connecting learning of mathematics of prospective
elementary teachers in mathematics content courses with how children understand
and learn mathematics. The goals are to 1) enhance understanding of mathematics
by pre-service teachers, 2) improve their teaching of mathematics, 3) improve
their understanding of how children learn and understand mathematics, 4) help
them connect the mathematics they are learning with the mathematical concepts
they will be teaching, and 5) facilitate their understanding of connections
between the mathematics they teach to the mathematics and technological skills
children learn in middle and high school. To achieve these goals, supplementary
materials and guides for instructors are being developed for mathematical
content courses for elementary teachers. Formative and summative evaluations are
being conducted at multiple and diverse test
sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;CMET II advances
knowledge on the integration of research on learning of mathematics by children
with learning of teachers, thus providing a mechanism for enhancing and studying
the interweaving of content and pedagogy (Ball &amp; Bass, 2000). This original
approach is based on the NSF proof-of-concept grant, CCLI-EMD DUE 0126882, which
successfully produced pilot materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to significantly impact the
preparation of future elementary teachers by providing them with in-depth
knowledge of how the subject matter they are learning relates to their future
teaching. National dissemination activities include: journal articles,
conference presentations, and commercial publication.&lt;br/&gt;
