The Center for Science, Mathematics and Technology Education will develop
integrated materials for seventh grade students centered around the topics of
biotechnology, manufacturing and forecasting. Each unit will include objectives,
experiential learning, appropriate use of multimedia, and appropriate technology
and evaluation instruments. Attention will be given to preparing materials that
motivate all students, especially those from groups underrepresented in
technological careers, to learn the foundational mathematics, science and
technology concepts by involving them in enriched learning experiences relevant
to their daily lives. The materials will be developed together with teachers,
piloted revised, tested, published and disseminated through a marketing plan
supported by a publisher. To maximize the potential for long-range impact,
systemic problems that impede the implementation of integrated materials will be
identified and alternate solutions will be proposed. Implementation materials
will be developed so that systemic changes can be made and the materials taught
with minimal teacher development. Student performance data will be gathered to
determine the increase in achievement in mathematics, science and technology.
