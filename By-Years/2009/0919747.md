For proper neuronal function to occur, the neuron must have the correct number
of input centers, or dendrites, which look like branches on a tree. However,
very little is currently known about how the pattern of these branches is
determined. The goal of this project is to identify how both global and local
changes in dendrite branching occurs. The Principal Investigator and her
students will make use of molecular biology, biochemistry, and neuronal cell
culture to study signaling by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a major
regulator of dendrite branching. First, they will assess how administration of
BDNF to neurons changes the shape of the dendrites overall and at distinct
regions from the cell body. Second, neurons will be exposed to BDNF-coated latex
beads to mimic local stimulation, and changes in the dendrite branching by this
treatment will be compared to those that occur with global BDNF treatment.
Third, they will use drugs and molecular techniques to identify the proteins
that are responsible for the effects of BDNF. These studies are important
because they will provide information on how dendrite branching is regulated
during development to yield a functional brain. The impact of this research is
far-reaching. Conducting the experiments will not only advance our understanding
of how dendrite morphology is regulated but will also be part of a program to
train high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in cutting-edge
techniques in neuroscience. The project involves setting up an exchange program
for undergraduate and Masters students at the University of Liberia so that they
can perform summer research in the Firestein laboratory. A major goal is to
establish an international program to bring neuroscience to the University of
Liberia community through seminars, workshops, and exchange programs. This
program will help educate people in a country facing global
conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
