Alan Walker and Meave Leakey, two very well known and widely respected
paleoanthropologists, will excavate a most promising early hominid site at Lake
Turkana, Kenya, in this project. This site has already yielded a few scattered
hominid remains from superficial surface collections, and the time period
represented in this site currently represents a gap in our knowledge of human
evolution. The earliest known hominid fossils date back to 3.6 million years.
and these deposits date to 4 million years, getting close to the hypothesized
time of splitting of the ape and human lineage's.
