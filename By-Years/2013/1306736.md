All astrophysical and cosmological data now point convincingly to a large
component of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in the Universe, but a dark matter particle
has yet to be directly detected. A well-motivated possible candidate is a light
axion. Should axions constitute the dark matter of our Milky Way halo, they may
be detected through their conversion into a narrow microwave signal by an
apparatus consisting of a microwave cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic
field. Using this concept the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) has performed
a search for such axions within the mass range of a few micro-eV. Recently a
smaller microwave cavity experiment was constructed called ADMX-HF (High
Frequency), specifically to explore higher ranges of axion masses. ADMX-HF also
serves as a test-bed for innovations in microwave cavity and amplifier
technologies that could be migrated to the larger ADMX platform. ADMX-HF and
ADMX operate as "one experiment, two sites", sharing expertise, technology, and
data. This award will expand the collaboration to accelerate the construction of
ADMX-HF as well as dramatically expand its initial capability.

Broader Impacts: ADMX has proven to be a technology driver as components such as
the SQUID amplifiers developed for ADMX are already being used for other
purposes. Innovations to be developed by ADMX-HF have similarly broad potential.
Both PI and Co-PI are committed educators with long experience in involving
undergraduate students in their research and engaging the public. The research
funded through this award will inform additional education and outreach
initiatives with which they are involved.
