The problem addressed by this project is the lack of student access to modern,
dependable equipment that is primarily dedicated to undergraduate teaching of
laboratory courses in Animal Nutrition and Animal Reproduction and Development.
Objectives are to develop laboratory curricula that give students training in
the application of biological principles to solve problems in animal agriculture
through an understanding of the scientific method and to provide significant
individual access to items of equipment that enable students to test hypotheses
and gain technical experience with modern experimental procedures. The plan
includes the expansion of the laboratory classes in the two disciplines to
include a substantial class experiment on the nutritional physiology of growing
lambs (Animal Nutrition) and an array of individual or small-group projects on
gamete and embryo physiology (Animal Reproduction and Development). Both
experiences include significant student participation in developing hypotheses
and setting specific objectives; reports are written in scientific format. The
target audience is predominantly sophomore and junior undergraduates majoring in
Animal Science. The significance and impact of this project for undergraduate
education are related to the number of students whose exposure to experimental
animal science may be substantially increased. All of the 470 students, plus a
moderate number of nonmajors, take at least one of the courses described.
Evaluation of the success of these innovations is conducted by student and
faculty peer review, and results may be communicated to scientific peers at
annual meetings of the American Society of Animal Science and the Society for
the Study of Reproduction, each of which has sessions devoted to undergraduate
instruction.
