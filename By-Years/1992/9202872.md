The proposed research consists of three concurrent thrusts: (1) the
electrodeposition of new ceramic superlattices, such as those of PbSnO, PbBiO,
TlSnO, and PbAgO; (2) a study of the optical properties of nanomodulated
materials, which has bearings on the effects of quantum confinement and the
tunable IR reflectivity; and (3) a scanning probe microscopy study of epitaxial
growth of the nanomodulated superlattices. The STM/AFM will also be used to
study the feasibility of depositing single crystal superlattices. %%%% This
project pursues the new and interesting results of electrodeposition of ceramic
superlattices to more oxide systems. It will also investigate their optical
properties. It will also study the epitaxial growth of these superlattice with
the use of scanning probe microscopy . The feasibility of depositing single
crystal superlattices will be explored as well. Based on the encouraging
preliminary results, these superlattices have shown lattice perfection qualities
comparable to those of MBE products. This method could have the possibility of
becoming a very important industrial process. This study will provide important
and fundamental scientific and technical information about the electrodeposition
process.
