Dr. Kenneth B. Eisenthal of the Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, is
supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Division of
Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work on the utilization of the
Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) technique to probe interfacial dynamics in such
processes as molecular transport through bilayers as a function of composition,
molecular orientation in bilayers, solvation dynamics and charge transfer across
a bilayer membrane.

These studies will have a high impact and provide new insights into transport of
molecules across membranes that will have a great impact to the medical
community (for example, in drug delivery issues), to the biochemical and biology
communities, and to the physical chemistry community with regard to ultrafast
femtosecond phenomena. Students and post-doctoral associates will be trained in
a unique area that encompasses chemistry, biology, and biochemistry.
