Chemistry (12) In order to support growing student interest in environmental
analysis and to improve environmental chemistry education and undergraduate
research, we are modifying several courses to include analytical tools important
in environmental assessment. We have identified Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Ion Chromatography (IC) as the targeted methods. These
instruments enable implementation of experiments in Environmental Chemistry,
Soil Science, and Lab Methods II courses involving sampling, identification, and
quantification of specific pollutants. We also are introducing a laboratory
experience to study photochemical smog through use of a NO-NO2-NOX analyzer.
Similar experiments in NO complexes and ozone chemistry are adapted from the
University of Alaska and Universitat Bayreuth in Germany. Many chemistry
students performing required undergraduate research projects are involved in
projects doing long-term monitoring of local ecosystems with students from
multiple disciplines. Enhancing separation capabilities to include GC/MS and IC
is expanding environmental research opportunities for students and faculty.
Availability of a NO-NO2-NOX detector is allowing students to be involved in
smog research, collaborating with the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection.
