9409870 Chajes, Michael J. This is a Research Initiation Award. This research
involves utilizing the unique properties of composite materials, in combination
with engineered wood and concrete, to develop a new, economical, high-strength
structural member for use in bridges and buildings. The research will involve
the development, testing, and evaluation of concrete-wood-FRP composite beams.
the important issues to be addressed are: (1) bond strength between the FRP
plates and engineered wood, (2) composite action between and concrete flange and
wood web, (3) stiffness, ultimate strength, and ductility of the composite
beams, and (4) behavior of the composite beams under sustained loads. The
investigation will lead to the development of versatile, high- strength,
composite beams and to basic research findings relevant to the use of advanced
composite materials for structural engineering applications. ***
