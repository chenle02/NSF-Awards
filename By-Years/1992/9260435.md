The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop patentable materials and
methodology that would greatly facilitate the difficult, slow and frequently
expensive process of obtaining high quality protein crystals suitable for
protein x-ray crystallography. The approach to be used involves attaching
protein molecules, in a site-specific manner, to a synthetic core containing
four sites of attachment arranged tetrahedrally. The complex, which now
possesses structural symmetry, will be more prone to crystallization than the
individual, inherently unsymmetrical protein molecules. The method also has the
added advantage of providing for a general appproach to isomorphous replacement,
a frequently necessary but sometimes difficult step in protein crystallography.
%%% Three dimensional protein structures, obtained mostly through x-ray
diffraction studies, are extremely valuable in computer-aided design studies,
especially in the fields of protein engineering, pesticide design and drug
design and development. An ancillary benefit of this study includes a possible
deepening of our understanding of life processes in general at the molecular
level.
