This research is expected to lead to a deeper understanding of relation of
conventional nuclear physics to nonperturbative QCD through studies of skyrmion
scattering in 3+1 dimensions. The dynamics of the model contains a unified
description of nucleons and nuclear interactions, including meson production,
baryon excitation and annihilation and the possibility of a phase transition to
quark matter at high energy. This research project involves undergraduates at
Westmont College and provides them with experience in frontier research in
nuclear physics.
