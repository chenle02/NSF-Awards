In this project, the PI intends to use motivic homotopy theory to create new
tools for the study of problems in algebraic geometry. The PI plans to transfer
classical obstruction theory to the motivic setting, with the specific goal of
understanding the obstructions to finding sections to algebraic fiber bundles
over an algebraically closed field. The PI plans to study algebraic cobordism,
an algebraic versions of the topological theory of complex cobordism, and to
further examine its connection with Donaldson-Thomas theory. Additionally, the
PI plans a further study of the Deligne-Goncharov motivic fundamental group.
Finally, the PI plans a further study of the motivic Postnikov tower, with the
goal of gaining a better understanding of this tower for a variety of
interesting generalized cohomology theories on algebraic varieties, as well as
for the motives of smooth projective varieties.

Homotopy theory is a branch of topology, which deals with fundamental
properties of curves, surfaces and shapes of higher dimension. Algebraic
geometry, on the other hand, tries to understand the properties of solutions of
equations, even when one cannot actually solve the equation explicitly. Creating
analogies between the seemingly unrelated fields of algebra and topology has
often been a fruitful approach to solving difficult problems in both fields.
Morel and Voevodsky have transferred an entire branch of topology, called stable
homotopy theory, to the algebraic setting, making ideas from stable homotopy
theory applicable to problems in algebra and number theory. The PI plans to take
a number of specific constructions from homotopy theory, adapt them to this new
setting, and use these constructions to solve problems in algebraic geometry.
