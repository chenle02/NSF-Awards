9353488 Akins City College of City University of New York proposes to continue
its Center for Analysis of Structures and Interfaces (CASI). The Center has two
fundamental goals: (1) to conduct exemplary research and (2) to substantially
enhance the involvement of minorities in science and engineering in this Nation.
The center has three research component subprojects including: (1) the use of
light and its properties to study structure and dynamical processes of
aggregated molecules absorbed onto surfaces of different types of materials, (2)
the use of spectroscopies to investigate structures and properties of mass-
selected cluster beams syntheses of clusters, and (3) the use of ultrafast laser
techniques for characterization and assessment of nonlinear properties of films
and semiconductors for electronic and/or photonic device applications. CASI was
established in 1988 with funding from the National Science Foundation under the
Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) Program. The CASI project meets
the goals of the MRCE Program especially (1) to increase the minority presence
in science and engineering by making substantial resources available to upgrade
the research capabilities of strong and productive minority institutions, (2) to
allow the institutions to continue use of research as a tool to increase the
effectiveness of related science and engineering activities for minority groups
in its region, and (3) to provide opportunities for minority faculty and
students at City College and nearby institutions to engage in meritorious
research that leads to publications in refereed journals. ***
