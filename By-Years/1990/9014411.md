This project investigates and evaluates rationales for the use of pesticide
technology in the United States. On the one hand, pesticides are regarded as
valuable tools in food production and in the protection of public heath, yet on
the other hand, pesticide use has given rise to serious concerns relating to
both public health and the condition of the environment. In light of these
concerns, people are calling for a reassessment of the risks and benefits of
pesticide use. Surveys indicate the possibility of a significant shift in public
values, with demands for cheap and cosmetically appealing food conflicting with
demands for no pesticides. To evaluate the merits of these apparent conflicts,
it is necessary to obtain factual information from a wide range of sources and
to reassess the value judgments forming the basis for policy decisions. This
study will attempt to obtain and integrate information on fourteen diverse
topics, ranging from the extent and economic benefits of pesticide use to the
environmental and social costs of pesticides. Knowledgeable scientists and
scholars will collect, assess, evaluate and summarize the latest scientific
information about pesticide use. They will consider how conflicting moral
objectives can or should be reconciled; what role public and private groups and
organizations should play in determining pesticide policy; and what guidance
should inform government agencies and regulations about pesticide use. Findings
will be disseminated at a meeting in Washington, DC, and via a summary of the
findings and a volume of the collected papers. This research has an important
and timely focus; its results will be useful and accessible to a wide audience.
The qualifications and track record of the principal investigators are
excellent. The participants are highly qualified and well balanced. The proposal
and addendum provide adequate information about the activities plan, and about
the value issues that will be investigated. The proposal is recommended for
support, with high priority.
