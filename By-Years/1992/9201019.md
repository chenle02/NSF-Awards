This project concerns mathematical research on problems arising in the area of
several complex variables. It involves the function-theoretic and geometric
properties of bounded pseudoconvex domains in n-dimensional complex space and
their automorphism groups. The first goal of the research is to identify domains
with noncompact automorphism groups by the local geometry of their boundaries.
Particular interest is placed on boundaries which are not entirely smooth. The
second component of the work is the extension of studies on the asymptotic
behavior of the intrinsic invariant metrics defined on the bounded pseudoconvex
domains. The research relates the boundary behavior of the automorphisms and the
compactness of the automorphism groups. Finally, work will be done identifying
the bounded symmetric domains by their boundary geometry among domains with
noncompact automorphism groups. The projects are connected by the theme that the
size of the automorphism groups and the boundary geometry of bounded domains are
tied together. The study of several complex variables arose at the beginning of
the century initially to examine those properties of classical function theory
which generalize to several variables. It turned out that most properties do not
generalize and research turned instead toward some of the more intriguing
geometric and analytic questions which arise only when the domains are of
dimension two or greater. This project continues that tradition.
