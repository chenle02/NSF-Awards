The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is a new and
innovative method for the automated manufacture of living blood vessels. This
research will yield new scientific as well as engineering knowledge into the
automation processes to manufacture a new class of living products. Such
fundamental knowledge will help usher in the next era of high-value bio-
manufacturing and is needed to sustain the competitive advantage of our
manufacturing economy. As a product, manufactured living bloods vessels have
significant commercial potential in at least two areas. Manufactured blood
vessels will be a less expensive alternative that replaces the use of animals in
the testing of medical devices. Manufactured blood vessels will be used to treat
and repair cardiovascular disease.

The proposed project will design, build and test a new fully automatic system
for the manufacture of small living blood vessels to be used for reducing the
use of animals in the testing of medical devices and to be ultimately used to
treat patients with heart disease. To develop this automated manufacturing
system, the project will add human cells to a specially designed mold to form
living building parts in the shape of round donuts. A robot will be programmed
to retrieve these donut-shaped living building parts one-by-one and drop them
into a specially designed funnel where the stack of donuts will form a long tube
or living blood vessel. The built blood vessels will be housed in a bioreactor
tank that controls the temperature and recirculates the broth needed to provide
the nutrients that nourish and mature the living blood vessels until they are
ready for use. This novel automated process will manufacture living blood
vessels for research testing and for clinical application.
