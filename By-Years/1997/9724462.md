9724462 Swets, Daniel L. Augustana College Major Research Instrumentation:
Acquisition of Laboratory Equipment for Parallel Algorithm Research Image
Processing A Major Research Instrumentation award has been made to Augustana
College to support the acquisition of a cluster of high-powered Pentium machines
to develop a parallel processing laboratory for use in academic instruction and
research. The parallel processing equipment will allow Augustana faculty and
students to study parallel implementation of computer vision and image
processing algorithms for the production of real-time, cost-effective image
processing systems. Augustana College has existing ties to the US Geological
Survey EROS Data Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota which makes available data
from remote sensing sources including satellite, airplane, and ground
radiometers. Three senior personnel and eight undergraduates will be developing
parallel algorithms for the processing and analysis of satellite images that
include parallel cloud-cover data detection and extraction, parallel statistical
data smoothing, and parallel land cover analysis.
