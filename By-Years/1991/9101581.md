The investigators will develop algorithms for stowing cargo on movement-and-
storage devices such as airplanes, trucks, ships, shelves, and pallets so that
the load is safely balanced and stable. Such problems have this general form:
Given a structure and a set of forces and moments, where should those forces and
moments be applied to the structure? This complements the traditional design
questions of mechanical engineering: Given a set of worst-case forces and
moments, design a structure to bear them. The investigators have coined the term
"combinatorial mechanics" to describe the issues to be studied. The problems
involve mechanics because of the concern for the center-of-gravity, deformation,
natural frequency, and so on. The problems are combinatorial because the forces
generally arise from the weight of items to be stored, and so the resultant
forces on the structure depend on how the items are arranged. The approach to
this research represents an innovative departure from traditional load planning
approaches. The development of a field of combinatorial mechanics could open the
door to novel interpretations of logistics problems of this nature.
