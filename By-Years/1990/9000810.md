This award provides support for a 10-week summer research experience for nine
undergraduates from Carleton College and other regional colleges and
universities. Pre-participation reading requirements will provide students with
an adequate foundation for meaningful scientific investigation. During the
summer, students will work in a one-to-one relationship with a research
supervisor in the laboratory. Weekly seminars will provides student with the
opportunity to discuss research plans and results as well as to delve into
primary scientific articles. To further focus and unify the student
participants, a theme of developmental regulation has been selected. Six of the
nine projects relate directly to this theme and mid-summer seminars will be used
to discuss current literature in this area. Projects will include investigations
of: the mechanisms of action and the chemical characteristics of a possibly-
steroid pheomone produced by Oedogonium, functional structure of Hensen's node
in the chick embryo, regulation of floral development in tobacco, effect of B
chromosomes in maize on developmental processes, structure and function of the
glucocorticoid receptor in rat liver, development of synaptic connections in
Xenopus, variation of sex expression in composites, role of song communication
in coordination of parental care in cardinals, and effect of gregarine parasites
on population biology of capitellid polychaetes. Opportunities to complete
research and writing during winter break will be available.
