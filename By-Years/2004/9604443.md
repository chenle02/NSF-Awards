9604443 DasSarma This research tests the hypothesis that specific regions of the
genome of Halobacterium halobium adopt supercoil density-dependent Z-DNA
conformations that function as regulatory switches for the control of gene
expression. Halobacterium halobium is an extremely halophilic Archaea in which
the left-handed Z-DNA conformation is favored by a highly negative DNA
supercoiling density, a high G+C content including alternating CG sequences, and
a high cytoplasmic salt concentration (5M). A combination of mutagenic and
biochemical analysis will determine if expression of the bop gene encoding the
H. halobium purple membrane protein is controlled by B-to-Z DNA conformation-
dependent switch at a potential Z-DNA sequence located 23 base pairs upstream
from the bop gene transcription start site. Preliminary evidence indicates that
bop gene transcription is induced under conditions of highly negative DNA
supercoiling, and reduced when supercoiling is relieved by inhibition of DNA
gyrase. Therefore, the DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin will be used to determine
the role of DNA supercoiling in mediating DNA conformational changes and bop
transcription, including the development of an in vitro transcription system for
studying the effects of DNA supercoiling on transcription. %%% This research
will evaluate the role of DNA conformation and conditions that affect DNA
conformation in the regulation of gene expression in Halobacterium halobium, a
Archaea bacteria that exists under conditions of extremely high salt
concentration. ***
