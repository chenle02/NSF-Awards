This grant in theoretical physics supports the research of Professors J. Sucher
and R.N. Mohapatra at the University of Maryland. The work of Sucher will
address atomic physics problems including two-photon exchange forces, the
relativistic two-body problem, and highly excited states of the helium atom. The
research of Mohapatra is concerned with extensions of the standard electro-weak
model that will investigate quark condensates and neutrino masses and magnetic
moments.
