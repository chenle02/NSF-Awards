Fifteen young scholars will examine career options in the natural sciences
(wildlife ecology, fisheries/aquaculture, or museum science) in a residential
setting at Texas A &amp; M University. Project activities include 14 days of
instruction, problem solving, exposure to the research environment and
contemporary methods, career exploration, and consideration of the philosophy
and ethics within the natural sciences. Young scholars will enhance their career
planning through identification of options, discussions with career
professionals, and on-site visits to selected research and educational
facilities. A planned 2-3 year follow-up of participants will determine the
degree to which project goals were achieved.
