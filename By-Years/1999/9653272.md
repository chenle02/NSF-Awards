Many of today's chemistry students, particularly in community colleges, are
nontraditional. They are older, economically disadvantaged, they work many hours
off campus, and often come from under represented minorities. Unfortunately,
they are also under prepared to succeed in college. The application of computer
technologies can help us shape new strategies that promote learning, achievement
and retention of these students and thus increase our educational productivity.
The goal of this project is to improve the learning of chemical concepts through
the increased use of computer visualization. A team, consisting mainly of
undergraduate students from our college, will produce chemical visualization
software in a highly modularized form and will disseminate it at very low cost
through both the Internet and CD-ROMs. We will test the viability of this
approach as a learning experience for students. These software products will
also benefit students nationwide by supplementing traditional instruction with
the power of visualization. They will help chemistry and biology teachers make
the transition to instruction at a higher level of technology and could be
useful in constructing course materials for distance education.
