9504760 Franks The proposed research pertains to various aspects of dynamical
systems: the dynamics of surfaces maps, stability theory for various flows,
applications to celestial mechanics and Hamiltonian systems are among the topics
to be pursued. Dynamics of surfaces flows - stability issues as well as area
conservation issues - is directly relevant to understanding many natural
phenomena and predicting their long time behavior. For example, the proposed
research may lead to a better understanding of large scale fluid flow problems
arising in ocean dynamics involving shallow water waves.
