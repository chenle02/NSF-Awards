This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. Features of the Casimir
force will be explored for nanometer separations. In particular, evidence will
be sought for the demonstration of repulsive and lateral Casimir forces. Such
forces have never been experimentally demonstrated and could play an important
role in the fabrication and control of electromechanical devices as MEMS
approaches NEMS.
