Network structures arise in modeling a wide variety of systems in sciences and
engineering. One of the most important classes of network models is random
graphs. The goal of this project is to study two challenging problems in network
analysis: one is on sampling random graphs with a given degree sequence, and the
other is on detecting structures in networks. For the first problem, a new
sequential sampling method is proposed which samples the networks from an
approximate uniform distribution. These samples can be used to estimate the
distribution of any test statistic and count the number of networks with given
vertex degrees. For the second problem, new Monte Carlo algorithms are proposed
to detect network structures, including highly connected subgraphs and network
motifs.

The investigator develops innovative Monte Carlo techniques for simulating
random graphs and detecting network structures. These methods can be used to
analyze social interaction patterns, identify network motifs, extract densely
connected molecular modules, and much more. Identifying network structures are
scientifically important because they may correspond to a group of proteins that
interact with each other at the same time or a functional unit that plays a key
role in biological regulation networks. The research provides an ideal
opportunity for involvement of students with a broad range of background and
interests. The algorithms developed from this research will be incorporated into
relevant courses.
