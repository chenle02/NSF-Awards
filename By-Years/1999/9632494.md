This award in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of
Chemistry provides partial support to enable the participation of four invited
younger speakers, and fifteen non- invited younger participants for the first
Gordon Research Conference on Chemical Sensors and Interfacial Design. This
conference emphasizes the fundamental understanding of the interfacial chemistry
critical to the design and use of chemical sensors. The subject matter of this
conference is central to the research focus of the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program. Participation of the young researchers supported by this
award helps to continue the vibrant growth of this important area of interfacial
chemistry. This award enables the participation of four young invited speakers
as well as fifteen young participants in the Gordon Research Conference on
Chemical Sensors and Interfacial Design. This rapidly growing field of basic and
applied science is impacting environmental and biotechnological problems.
