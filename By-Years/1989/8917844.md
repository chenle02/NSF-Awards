The University of Texas at El Paso will establish a Research Careers for
Minority Scholars program to seek and nurture minority students and guide them
into careers in research in science or engineering. RCMS scholars will be
selected from current University undergraduate students (initially) and from
senior-level high school students in the region. Each student will join an
ongoing research program of his or her own choosing. Faculty members in five
science and engineering departments will serve as mentors to RCMS scholars.
Students will also participate in reserach seminars and various outreach
activities and receive monthly stipends, travel support, tuition, and fees. RCMS
scholars will be expected to disseminate their research results through
publications and presentations at scientific meetings, and to use a topic
related to their ongoing research program as the basis for an undergraduate
honors thesis or master's thesis.
