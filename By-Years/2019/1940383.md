The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will bring a new family of "structural color"
coatings to the commercial marketplace as an alternative to toxic pigments and
dyes, as well as a new paradigm for controlling the flow of light. This project
aims to improve the energy efficiency of buildings through a coating that can be
applied to residential roofing materials during installation or at the original
equipment manufacturer level. The technology is a bottoms-up approach to the
formation of reflective materials offering significant advantages over state-of-
practice cool-roofing alternatives by retrofitting without changing the facade's
appearance. The resulting product will rapidly increase adoption of cool-roof
technologies due to improved performance without aesthetic loss, a key homeowner
concern, leading to substantial energy savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses key risks and
technical challenges associated with commercializing brush block copolymer based
photonic crystals. This forms an ideal advanced materials platform for large-
area dielectric mirrors due to the low costs of the raw materials and the
simplicity of "bottoms-up" fabrication by macromolecular self-assembly. To
realize commercial applications, the chemistries for these reflective organic
materials need to be optimized for exterior coating applications to resist
degradation from natural weathering conditions such as ultraviolet radiation,
rain, thermal cycling; furthermore, the formulation must be optimized for
standard application. This proposed activity will develop new synthetic routes,
stabilization strategies, and the first manufacturing processes to demonstrate
these unique advanced materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
