This Dissertation Enhancement Award will send the PI's graduate student, Andrew
Logan, from the Colorado School of Mines to Norway for up to a year to work with
Peter Jennsen and his group at the Agricultural University of Norway. The
research investigates the role of microbes in the removal of bacteria and virus
from wastewater. Dr. Jenssen is an accomplished soil hydrologist, and his group
has access to site-of-the-art equipment, some of which is unavailable at the
School of Mines. The international collaboration will give the student the
opportunity to make international connections that will continue throughout his
career, and which benefit the U.S. scientific community by making the
considerable Norwegian expertise available to it.
