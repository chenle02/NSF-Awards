This planning grant to Virginia Commonwealth University reform undergraduate
education in the mechanical engineering department. In order to meet this
challenge, the VCU Mechanical Engineering Department will develop a novel
experiential engineering library that will: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) Provide an
easily accessible and readily available environment for hands-on engineering
learning experiences beyond the traditional Mechanical Engineering curriculum.
&lt;br/&gt;2) Foster critical thinking by encouraging students to apply
fundamental mechanical engineering principles to emerging interdisciplinary
fields including MEMS, bio-engineering, and nano-technology. &lt;br/&gt;3)
Encourage collaborative team-based learning among peers as well as mentoring by
more senior undergraduates, graduate students and faculty. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The experiential library is envisioned to be analogous to a
traditional library. It will contain a large number of experiments and computer
simulations either "on reserve" or available to be "checked out" by the
students. At the instructor's discretion, hands-on problems will be assigned as
a complement to or in lieu of paper and pencil homework. The equipment can also
be used independently by students seeking to improve their understanding through
manipulation and visualization. Additional activities will provide enrichment
opportunities for both undergraduate and visiting secondary school students. The
flexibility and integration of the experiments in the library make it superior
to laboratories used in traditional engineering courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
