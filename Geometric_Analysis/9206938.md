The principal investigator will continue his study of problems in complex
differential geometry. In particular he will study the interplay between
topology and the complex structures on a manifold. These problems will include a
study of the vector bundles over a manifold. In addition, Professor Yau will
study some problems in spectral geometry and numerical approaches to the
geometry of the Laplace operator. This award will support research in the
general area of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry
is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic
concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall
geometric and topological properties of a space by piecing together local
information. Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences
include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the
large scale structure of the universe.
