Solitons are localized, moving, nonlinear pulses of energy that are known to
propagate without change in shape or amplitude in many lossless, nonlinear,
uniform systems. In nonuniform systems, however, the soliton properties usually
change as it travels through the nonuniformity. The proposed research is an
analytical and numerical study of the characteristics of solitons in nonuniform
systems. The purpose of the investigation is to explore how the nonuniformity of
a nonlinear medium can be tailored to achieve certain desired modifications of
the soliton such as reshaping, amplification, compression, or reflection. It is
proposed to consider three different systems in which the nonuniformity is
controllable: Solitons on nonuniform nonlinear transmission lines; solitons on
axially-nonuniform optical fibers; and solitons in a nonuniform plasma bounded
by a grid-plate structure. The results of the proposed investigation are
expected to have a more general applicability, however, because the basic
equations governing solitons in the three systems are identical in form to those
in several other systems of current interest such as surface and internal water
waves, acoustic waves in a crystal lattice, and magnetohydrodynamic waves in
plasmas.
