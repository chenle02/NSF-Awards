In September 1996, under the auspices of the Commission on Social and Behavioral
Sciences, NAS, and the National Science Foundation, a two-day workshop was held
in Washington, DC, to bring together researchers and scholars to discuss on-
going and key research on current efforts to enhance quality in US
organizations. Several researchers reported on work-in-progress, and the
assembled scholars considered ways in which quality research could both better
inform and be improved by closer linkages to the organizations research
community. This workshop was stimulating and useful to the research of the
participants and observers. This project is for a follow-on workshop to
reassemble many of the participants from the first workshop, as well as some
additional scholars. The overall aim of this workshop will be to improve the
papers initiated at the first workshop with an eye toward creating an edited
volume, as well as to continue to strengthen the conceptual links between TQO
topics and core topics from disciplines such as organization theory, sociology,
and psychology.
