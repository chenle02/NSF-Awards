The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program
provides support for projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that
can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of
students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Kentucky State University seeks to
broaden minority student involvement in STEM fields by implementing evidence-
based teaching, learning, research, recruitment, retention, and professional
development strategies. The overall goal is to significantly increase the
retention and graduation rate of underrepresented minority students choosing
career paths in STEM graduate programs and the
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the goal with activities
to: develop a Summer Apprentice Program to prepare incoming students in
mathematics; develop focused recruitment activities with high schools; provide a
research experience for selected STEM sophomores; revise and develop critical
STEM gatekeeper courses; integrate active learning activities in courses and
provide a support system for students; and develop a faculty pedagogy
development program. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and what
is learned through this project can serve as a model for other
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
