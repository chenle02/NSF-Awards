The mathematics department at Grinnell College will develop a Mathematics and
Computing Lab in which students use software packages that strengthen
mathematical intuition and insight by representing mathematical ideas and
objects (such as functions, matrices, differential equations, infinite series,
computer programs, and algorithms) in a variety of forms that permit them to be
manipulated and experimented with. The objective is to promote the kind of
direct acquaintance with and understanding of these mathematical objects that
professional applied mathematicians and computer scientists have traditionally
acquired through long experience or unusual insight, and have more recently
begun to develop more quickly through software tools. Specifically, the software
will include packages for graphical display and manipulation of functions and
algorithms, numerical approximation, and symbolic algebra. The computer system
used will consist of a Sun 3/160S file server, a large disk and tape system, and
eight Sun 3/50M workstations. The workstations in the lab will be connected to a
departmental local area network, which will give faculty and students equal
access to all resources and enable them to exchange information from the lab,
faculty offices, and classrooms.
