The aim of this project is to improve the quality of instruction in digital
control systems, robot interfacing and control, and robot vision in the
Electrical Engineering Department of Lawrence Institute of Technology. The
project will use eight workstations, the major equipment for which will be: 1) a
computer to act as the system host for all equipment during student experiments,
2) a robot arm and controller, 3) a high speed analog/digital-digital/analog
converter used for digital control and robot interfacing experiments, and 4) a
video imaging system to direct the robot arm and gripper for part orientation.
This laboratory is especially significant because it will prepare students for
electrical engineering applications of robotics and digital control systems.
Automation using robotics is an important aspect of future industrial
development, and it is important to teach the subject in an engineering college.
