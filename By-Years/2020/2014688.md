The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce cost and increase accuracy of solutions for
the healthcare industry, including point-of-care diagnostics, therapeutics, and
drug development, by enabling new lab-on-chip technologies. These technologies
rely on microfluidic devices, small plastic parts that automatically and
efficiently conduct scientific experiments with tiny volumes of liquid samples.
Point-of-care devices can have a particularly profound impact on underserved
communities by allowing access to testing otherwise unavailable due to cost and
resource issues. The proposed system will decrease the time and expense required
to develop technologies addressing these challenges. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
SBIR Phase I project addresses the speed of lab-on-chip development through
three main technical innovations: 1) A library of microfluidic features for
design of microfluidic parts; 2) A rapid tooling system rapidly producing
microfluidic molds; and 3) The macro-to-micro interface where lab-on-chip
devices connect to the outside world. The proposed project will create an
automated system to quickly and reliably connectorize microfluidic devices,
increasing reliability and ease of use. The performance goal is a complete lab-
on-chip prototyping system providing fully functional devices in less than a
week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
