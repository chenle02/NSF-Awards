This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will investigate methods for
evaluating and comparing heuristically derived solutions to multi-objective
combinatorial optimization problems. Almost all such problems are NP-Hard, so
characterizing the Pareto-optimal efficient set is computationally intractable.
The research will draw on heuristic and approximate solution methods for these
models, and structure a approach to comparing them based on distance to the
(possibly) unknown Pareto set. Drawing on promising preliminary results for
small models, the research will seek to develop and extend the methods to higher
dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-objective optimization problems model
important tradeoffs that decision makers face in many settings. For example, in
strategic facilities location problems, decision makers must trade off
minimizing cost and maximizing service. Most of these problems are also
combinatorial, in that discrete decisions such as build or don't build require
choice of one option or another without the opportunity to compromise the
difference. Such models are so common in engineering practice that advances in
methods for treating them have great potential significance to the broad field
of operations research.
