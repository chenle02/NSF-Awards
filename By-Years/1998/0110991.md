Simple and complex animals, including humans, are always faced with the need to
decide wisely upon actions using incomplete information. How the nervous system
is organized to do this has been a major puzzle. However, we know that animals
make most decisions using their own affective state as information, and that in
their computations they integrate their own internal state with sensation and
experience to arrive at decisions. The result represents a cost-benefit analysis
of a behavioral decision in terms of probable benefit, resource loss and
possible self-damage. This proposal describes plans to study the neural basis of
cost-benefit analysis in decision-making in foraging behavior using a model
predator species with simple body form, behavior and nervous system. Three goals
are outlined: 1) to find how satiation and prey-avoidance learning influence
decision-making mechanisms in the nervous system for attack or avoidance; 2) to
determine the role of serotonin, a critical biasing factor, in the mechanisms of
decision-making; and 3) to summarize and test the results in a computational
model of the neural networks. The expected results are significant to the
development of autonomous robots capable of making least-probable-error
decisions in a noisy environment, and to the evolution of artificial
intelligence for which motivation-based processes may provide the critical
regulation of goal related activity, just as in real intelligence systems. The
results also relate directly to health issues of weight-control in anorexia and
obesity, in that they approach the organization of processes regulating
nutritional homeostasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
