A structural dynamics analyzer is obtained for research at the Oklahoma State
University. It is used for four current research projects: modal analysis of
small mechanisms, modal analysis of a rotor bearing system under seismic
loading, vibration of heat exchanger tubes on multiple supports/vibration in
tube bundles and flow-induced vibrations, and web handling dynamics including
acoustic emission signature and vibration noise control.
