Many computational problems can be solved by searching through a well-defined
but huge space of candidates provided good heuristics are available to guide the
search. Thus automated discovery of search heuristics would have both practical
and scientific importance. In this approach, the generation of heuristics is
modelled as the application of successive transformations to an initial problem
specification. This research addresses a number of issues raised by the long-
term goal of scaling up to more realistic application domains. To refine the
model, studies of perturbation experiments aimed at understanding when and why
it works will be carried out. To enrich the space of generated heuristics,
extensions and integration of transformations so as to rederive known scheduling
and routing heuristics and the discovery of new ones will be undertaken. To
explore this space more efficiently, novel methods for evaluating potential
heuristics will be employed. Expected outcomes of this work include engineering
advances in automated methods for discovering heuristics, as well as scientific
advances in understanding their underlying principles.
