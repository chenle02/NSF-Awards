The purpose of the proposed project is to enhance undergraduate instruction in
research methods in psychology. The project will facilitate the demonstration of
a wide range of psychological phenomena, as well as the design, execution, and
analysis of original research by undergraduates. Its impact will be on five
upper-division advanced laboratory courses (Learning, Cognitive Psychology,
Sensation and Perception, Physiological Psychology, and Animal Behavior), an
introductory lab course, and a course in research methods.The core of the
project is a bank of 13 microcomputers to serve as student stations for data
collection and analysis. One of the computers is to be used for program
development, to assist students in designing original research. The software
selected will allow students to gain first-hand experience with general
principles of research design, and also with the specific techniques associated
with particular areas within experimental psychology. This will greatly increase
the breadth of research experiences to which students can be exposed, and
increase the variety and sophistication of student-initiated research projects
(required of all majors) by facilitating instruction in all aspects of the
research enterprise.
