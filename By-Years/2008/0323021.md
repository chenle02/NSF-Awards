In this project, the PI will investigate several different aspects of
the&lt;br/&gt;theory of linear partial differential equations associated to
manifolds&lt;br/&gt;with singular Riemannian metrics. These include the
propagation and&lt;br/&gt;diffraction of singularities for the wave equation on
manifolds with conic&lt;br/&gt;and edge singularities, and the structure of the
fundamental solution for&lt;br/&gt;the time-dependent Schrodinger equation on
manifolds with scattering&lt;br/&gt;metrics. Tools such as the Fourier-Bros-
Iagolnitzer transform will be&lt;br/&gt;studied and refined as
needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linear partial differential equations (PDEs) that
describe wave propagation&lt;br/&gt;(such as the classical wave equation and the
Schrodinger equation) are of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental importance in physics and
geometry. The propagation of waves&lt;br/&gt;on curved spaces often involves the
geometry of the underlying space in a&lt;br/&gt;subtle manner. When the space is
`singular,' either in the sense of being&lt;br/&gt;infinite in extent or of
having degenerate properties in a finite region,&lt;br/&gt;the relationship
between geometry and the properties of solutions to PDEs&lt;br/&gt;is especially
fascinating and poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt;
