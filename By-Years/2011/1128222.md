The objective of this program is to engineer nanostructures to control the
thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. Specific
objectives are: engineer the electro-thermal response of the detectors to
improve the speed of these devices; and, model the microscopic mechanism of
photodetection to shed light on the physical origin of the detector jitter and
minimize it. To achieve the first objective, an improved electro-thermal model
of the superconducting nanowire will be developed. Nanostructures will be
designed to directly control the thermal behaviour of the nanowires at the
nanoscale, which will in turn allow validating the predictions the theoretical
model. Achieving the second objective will require the development of a detailed
model of the excitation and expansion of the hot-spot. The intellectual merit of
this program is to advance the speed and timing precision of superconducting
nanowire single-photon detectors by first clarifying their fundamental physics
of operation, and then engineering a new device architecture based on this
understanding. The broader impacts of this program are: (1) the introduction of
a new generation of diverse undergraduate and graduate students to the fields of
superconductivity, thermal processes in condensed matter, and nano- and quantum-
optics; (2) the integration of the scientific results as case studies into the
curriculum of two courses (one for graduate students and advanced
undergraduates, and another targeted at post-graduate professionals), which
focus on the practical role of nanofabrication in advanced research; and (3) the
development of technological applications in industrial and scientific areas
ranging from communications to astrophysical observations.
