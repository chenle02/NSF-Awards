The NSF IUCRC Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations (CDMI) is
hosting a public workshop in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) entitled "Orthopedic Sensing, Measuring, and Advanced Reporting Technology
(SMART) Devices". The goal of the workshop is to: 1) to gain better
understanding of current state and future possibilities of Orthopedic SMART
device technology; and 2) begin to identify/establish appropriate regulatory
framework to promote use of the technology and protect public health. Public
input and feedback gained through this workshop may aid in the efficient
development of innovative, safe and effective, orthopaedic SMART devices, for
better patient care.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
