Seismic methods of various kinds are among the most basic tools of marine
geophysics; they are the means by which we obtain "CAT scans" of the earth on a
variety of scales, using instruments towed from ships and/or deployed on the
seafloor. Converting raw data to images of the Earth requires quite a lot of
computer processing. SIOSEIS is an easy-to-use, basic data processing package
provided at no charge that has served the community for three decades. It has
become an indispensible tool for a host of applications. A great advantage of
SIOSEIS is that its flexibility makes it adaptable to the often unique research
applications and specifications. Reconfigured for use on the latest seismic
platforms, SIOSEIS will continue to be an important tool for data manipulation,
quality control and initial processing of marine seismic data.
