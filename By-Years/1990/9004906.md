There are two areas which will be addressed in this research. In the first,
problems will be considered which are related to a conjecture by Lech concerning
the behavior of the Hilbert function under faithfully flat morphisms of local
noetherian rings. In the second, the principal investigator will study stability
properties of the divisor class group CL(R) where R is a local normal excellent
henselian ring. This research is concerned with the geometric properties of
commutative rings which arise in algebraic geometry. One of the problems to be
considered is a conjecture by Lech which has been unsolved for twenty-five
years.
