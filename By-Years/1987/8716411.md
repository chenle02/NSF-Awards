The study of glacially reworked sediments and microfossils is essential toward
reconstructing the geologic and glacial history of Antarctica. Evidence from
reworked Pliocene marine diatoms and fossil wood in the Sirius Group of glacial-
sediments, throughout the Transantarctic Mountains, indicate a massive early
Pliocene destruction of the late Pliocene antarctic ice sheet, marine flooding
of interior basins and polar warmth through the Pliocene. The chief objectives
of this project are to substantiate the suggested Pliocene deglaciation and to
improve the resolution of Pliocene diatom biostratigraphy in antarctic interior
basins, which will help date the reworked assemblages. The improved Pliocene
diatom chronology will aid in determining the timing and magnitude of late
Neogene ice-volume change and marine transgression; events which have
implications for climatic, geologic, oceanographic and evolutionary
biogeographic studies within and beyond Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
