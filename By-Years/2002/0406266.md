In this U.S.-Brazil symposium supported by the Engineering Design Program in the
Division of Design, Manufacturing, and Industrial Innovation, the Thermal
Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Division of Chemical and
Transport Systems, and the Americas Program of the Office of International
Science and Engineering, G. S. Dulikravich of Florida International University
and Helcio R. B. Orlande of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
will organize an international forum on inverse problems, design and
optimization (IPDO) to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in March 2004. This
gathering will bring together three communities of researchers from different
world regions, providing a common forum for presenting different applications,
problems, and solution concepts. The symposium involves lectures, two tutorials,
and a roundtable discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium ties together
important areas in several disciplines, and the cross fertilization from the
community interaction is expected to be fruitful. Significant international
participation will enhance the opportunities for future networking and
cooperative projects with U.S. participants. The symposium will put forward a
consensus list of recommendations concerning the most promising future
directions in research involving the three areas explored by the IPDO.
Proceedings will be published in an international journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
