This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
New York University studying political leadership in a Mexico City lower class
neighborhood. The project will focus on the change of leadership style from the
old-fashioned `cacique` or strong-man style who provides generalized support to
followers, to a more contemporary narrowly-focused issues-oriented leader of
collective action. Using in-depth interviews of leaders and actors in collective
popular movements , participant-observation of social movements, oral histories
of local movements, and a survey of two neighborhoods the student will test the
hypothesis that the loss of political control by the official PRI party is
associated with a changeover in local political leadership style from strong-man
to popular leader. This research is important because is will advance our
understanding of how local issues are resolved in the capital city of our close
neighboring country. Mexico is undergoing rapid political change, and this
project will shed light on how that change is being lived out on the streets of
working class neighborhoods. The information will be of interest to social
scientists as well as policy makers who need to understand why the Mexican
government institutes specific policies.
