This research concerns infrastructure for supporting multiuser- interfaces. Two
important criteria for evaluating such an infrastructure are the flexibility of
the supported paradigms for (a) application-user interaction and (b) user-user
sharing. Currently, an infrastructure offers either great interaction
flexibility but limited sharing flexibility, or great sharing flexibility but
limited interaction flexibility. The maximum interaction flexibility is offered
by shared window systems, which allow multiple users to share a single logical
window. However, these systems offer no sharing flexibility. The hypothesis of
this research is that it is possible to significantly increase the sharing
flexibility of these systems without reducing their interaction flexibility.
This research identifies new software abstractions and architectures for
establishing this hypothesis and uses an experimental method wherein the new
concepts are implemented and used in validation experiments. If successful, it
will lead to a new kind of infrastructure that automatically meets the sharing
needs of a large class of multiuser user-interfaces that must today be
implemented manually at great programming costs.
