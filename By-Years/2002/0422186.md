This SBIR Phase II project concerns the development of proton exchange membrane
(PEM) fuel cells with improved power density (kW/L) and specific power (kW/kg),
reduced cost, and simplified assembly. A new type of electrically conductive
polymer sheet has been developed that can be used as both, gas diffusion layer
and bipolar plate in PEM fuel cells. The material is light, inexpensive, highly
conductive, chemically inert, easy to process, and corrosion resistant. The use
of this conductive polymer in PEM fuel cells will reduce cell weight, volume,
and cost, while simplifying cell assembly. During the Phase II project, the
conductive polymer materials will be optimized as bipolar plates and gas
diffusion layers, and they will be integrated into PEM fuel cell
stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new material has significant commercial
potential because of its multifunctionality, lightweight, effectiveness, and low
cost. The potential customers are developers currently working with PEM fuel
cells operating on hydrogen, methanol, and reformed hydrocarbon fuels. This
includes all of the automotive manufacturers and the manufacturers of stationary
fuel cell power systems. &lt;br/&gt;
