The investigator studies various effective methods in the theory of elliptic,
hyperelliptic, and cubic curves and their function fields. Classical problems in
these areas are computing class numbers, regulators, and discrete logarithms, as
well as determining cardinalities of Jacobians. The first part concerns
arithmetical invariants of hyperelliptic and cubic curves. In particular, the
investigator and his colleagues hope to advance counting points methods for
these curves over large prime fields. Effective methods make use of modular
equations, the distribution of the zeroes of the zeta function, the Hasse-Witt
matrix, approximation of Euler products, optimized algorithms, and others. The
second part concerns with the Weil descent methodology for elliptic curves or
other Galois descent methods. The Weil descent methodology is a means to reduce
the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) over composite finite
fields to the discrete logarithm problem in an abelian variety over a proper
subfield. This leads to an effective method of reducing any instance of the
ECDLP over a finite field to an instance of the discrete logarithm problem in
the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve over a subfield. Since subexponential-time
algorithms for the latter problem are known, this shows how important the method
is for cracking certain elliptic curve cryptographic schemes. Similar ideas are
applicable for curves of genus bigger than one.

The proposed research belongs to the interface between number theory and
algebraic geometry. On the theoretical side, it advances the theory of algebraic
function fields and curves. At the same time, on the practical side, it advances
the connection between the theory of algebraic curves and a highly relevant
application to cryptography. In recent years, elliptic and hyperelliptic curves
have become objects of intense investigation because of their significance to
public-key cryptography. Hereby, tools from algebraic geometry, number theory,
and the theory of algorithms are central in the cryptanalysis of elliptic and
hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems. Methods of this proposal can be applied to
guarantee the security of these curve cryptosystems or reveal weaknesses of
certain curves. The proposed research also advances the number theoretic
computations and applies a variety of strong recent results to the algorithmic
aspects of number theory.
