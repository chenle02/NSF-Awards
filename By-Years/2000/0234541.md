With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts
Amherst will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer and refurbish a 200 MHz
spectrometer. The new spectrometer will be a part of the High-Field NMR Facility
at the university - a facility open to research of the Five Colleges Consortium
(UMass, Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Amherst and Hampshire Colleges) and surrounding
industries. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on the
tacticity of, and branching in polyolefins; branching in dendritic and
hyperbranched macromolecules; mechanistic investigations of copper-based
catalysts for cross-coupling reactions; structures of conjugated polymers;
thermodynamics of the unfolding/recognition process; and structural dynamics of
amphiphilic polymers. These instruments will also play a vital role in training
undergraduates and local area high school students.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in the development of novel polymers.
