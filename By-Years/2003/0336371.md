This work will study how water is stored and distributed in the lower mantle.
Experiments will be performed to understand the solubility of hydrogen in
aluminous perovskites, the effect of pressure on the hydroxyl bands, and the
effect of water on phase transformations at the 660-km seismic velocity
discontinuity. These data are critically important for understanding
substitution mechanisms for the incorporation of trivalent ions and hydrogen in
the perovskite structure, and the defect chemistry in the lower mantle that
controls the mantle processes. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is an integral
part of the PI's continuous efforts to understand the chemistry and mineralogy
of the lower mantle through experimentation and thermodynamic modeling. The
project will provide opportunities for graduate students (as pre-doctoral
fellows) to gain research experience. The large single crystals of silicate
perovskites synthesized in this project will be available for other researchers
in the community. Results from the proposed study will be disseminated primarily
through publications in scientific journals, and by participation at scientific
conferences. The expected results will have broad impact in many different
fields including petrology, mineral physics, geochemistry, seismology and
geodynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
