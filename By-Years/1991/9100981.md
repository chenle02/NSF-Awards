This project examines the role of middle class actors in promot- ing or
retarding social change. PIs will interview about 100 black teachers in South
Africa on their attitudes toward student protests and apartheid, and will
analyze their responses by several indicators of social position of the teachers
(such as age, income, and gender). Results will enable contrasting predications
from theories which see middle class actors as essentially conservative to other
predications which predict heavy middle class involvement in social change
movements.
