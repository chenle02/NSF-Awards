This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. The research examines the social organization of homeless people who
camp on publicly-owned lands. It tests prior theories about the homeless,
comparing older theories about social disaffiliation with newer ones on the
culture of resistance. The study builds on the co-investigator's four years of
previous research and observations on this population by using ethnographic
methods of data collection. New data will come from 120 days of observations and
60 intensive interviews. %%% This research will contribute to sociological
understanding of the lives of homeless rural residents. It adds to a tradition
that looks for insights into how social organizations are formed and operate by
examining those who live unconventional lifestyles. Findings may also be of help
to policy-makers, concerned with programs for reducing homelessness. In addition
to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
