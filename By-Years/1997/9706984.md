9706984 Nash A cooperative, international investigation of the lichens (both
micro-and macrolichens) of the greater Sonoran Desert region (Arizona, southern
California, Baja California, Sonora and Northern Sinaloa) was funded by DEB
92-01111. The project has made progress toward writing a modern lichen flora for
use by systematists and other professional botanists as well as decision-makers.
Because the Sonoran Desert includes a significant number of Clean Air Act Class
I areas, and because lichens are excellent indicators of air pollution, it is
anticipated that the flora will have considerable utility to land managers in
both the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Services (both U.S. and Mexican).
Liason has been established with institutions within Mexico and collaboration
and with over 60 prominent lichen systematists worldwide. Publications from this
project so far document the discovery of 50 species new to science, and the
first records of distribution in the Sonoran Desert for over 200 more. By the
completion of the project, the flora will treat over 1700 species in 328 genera.
