This project will contribute to the development of new forms of mobile human-
computer interaction that can be called "microinteractions." These are short
interactions that, in some cases, are performed almost without conscious
thought, comparable to checking the time on a wristwatch by a mere glance. Such
microinteractions are already major uses of mobile computing and communication
technologies: being reminded of an appointment, displaying the caller ID of an
incoming call, noting a phone number or URL, making an appointment, or receiving
a short e-mail. Yet few devices support microinteractions well, leading to a
lack of use of the functionality, and there exist few design guidelines for
microinteraction interfaces. This research will increase the fundamental
knowledge and the design principles required to achieve substantial advances in
this emerging field.

The research will investigate barriers to microinteractions, create design
guidelines for microinteraction interfaces, create a MAGIC (Mobile Action and
Gesture Interface Control) toolkit that enables gesture-based microinteraction
techniques, and produce and study prototypes that instantiate the research
results. The project will concentrate on the wristwatch as a socially
acceptable, fast-to-access interaction platform. Previous work suggests that
access time - the time to retrieve a device and navigate through its interface -
is a major contributor to "balking," or deciding not to use an interface. The
research will quantify the effects of access time on balking, create design
guidelines on appropriate access times for typical microinteraction tasks, and
give concrete suggestions for minimizing balking by quantifying access times for
the wristwatch as compared to other typical device mounting locations such as
the pocket or belt. Specifically, four types of microinteractions will be
examined: glances, computer-initiated events, user-initiated events, and a new
style of interaction, "dual purpose speech," where key phrases in the user's
conversation simultaneously trigger actions on the mobile device.

The project will create wristwatch-based gesture, touchscreen, and speech system
prototypes that support each of the microinteraction types. This work will
encourage new directions in mobile interface research. The extensive involvement
of students in the project will allow them to develop a wide range of hardware
and software prototyping skills.
