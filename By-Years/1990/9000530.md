Dr. Carpenter and two graduate students will further develop and study her
biologically motivated ART3 model of adaptive pattern recognition. The funded
work will focus on computational analysis of these self-organizing
architectures, development of network architectures for new parallel computer
designs, and construction of hierarchies of neural-network modules (including
her earlier ART and ART2 "adaptive resonance theory" networks).
