9413360 Scheffler This project involves the dissertation research of an
anthropology student from Yale University in Mali, West Africa. The project is
to document the importance of political speakers, known as "griots", in Mali
politics. Using ethnographic techniques such as participant observation,
intensive interviewing, analysis of media, public documents and archives, the
student will analyze the changes in recent history of how griots, as clients of
powerful "patrons" and as independent commentators, shape and express public
opinion. This research is important because it advances our expertise of
political behavior in this important area of the world at the same time that it
provides a case study of the role of the media in a very different political
system than ours. Such comparisons will advance our understanding of general
political processes of attitude formation. ***
