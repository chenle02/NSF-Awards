This project mounts a joint theoretical, experimental, and numerical approach
to inverse problems in scattering and nondest- ructive evaluation. It will not
only use actual measurements in theoretically derived inversion algorithms but
the interaction of experimentlists and theoreticians will provide the impetus
for the development of the next generation of algorithms incorpo- rating more
realistic data sets as well as stimulating the design of new experiments.
