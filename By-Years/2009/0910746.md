This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Dean Wilcox at Dartmouth College to carry out
fundamental studies of metal ions binding to proteins. The research provides new
insight about the uptake, transport and delivery of essential metals, as well as
the sequestering and export of toxic metals, by living organisms. Using
calorimeters to measure the heat that is released or absorbed when metal ions
bind to proteins, the investigators quantify the relative metal and protein
contributions to the energy-related factors that determine the stability of
metal-protein complexes. In many cases two or more metals bind to the same
protein with an unusually high stability that may be fundamental to the storage
of essential metals or to the sequestering of toxic metals. Not only is this
research leading to fundamental chemical insight about metal-protein
interactions but it is providing important training for students who will be the
next generation of bioinorganic chemists and biochemists. In addition, this
research will develop and disseminate the protocols for calorimetry measurements
with metals, which are needed to accurately quantify the thermodynamics of
chemical reactions involving metal ions. Results from this research on the
chemistry that living organisms use to manage essential metals (e.g., copper,
zinc, iron) and deal with toxic metals (e.g., cadmium, mercury, arsenic) will
provide valuable information for assessing the environmental impact of metals
from natural and man-made sources.
