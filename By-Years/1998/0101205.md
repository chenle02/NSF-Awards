This proposal concerns several related problems in quantum information theory,
all arising from the study of noisy quantum channels. The first problem is to
prove additivity of minimal entropy and multiplicativity of the maximal trace
norms for a unital qubit channel. This result would imply additivity of the
Holevo capacity for such channels, thereby settling one particular case of a
longstanding conjecture. The second problem is to investigate a conjectured
equality between the Shannon capacity of a noisy quantum channel and a new
quantity which was introduced in earlier work of the P.I.. The third problem
involves a study of one special class of non-product measurements for product
channels, with the goal of providing an interesting laboratory for testing ideas
about entangled measurements.

Advances in nanotechnology have provided the opportunity for scientists to
study and manipulate the quantum properties of microscopic systems, including
single-atom systems and single-photon states. Recent theoretical discoveries
indicate that such systems may have extraordinary properties. One example is the
quantum computer, which is a theoretical device capable of outperforming any
standard computer. Another example is a protocol for unconditionally secure
encryption, which would be achieved by encoding messages as quantum states.
Mathematics played a key role in the development of both of these ideas. The
current proposal concerns a similar mathematical investigation of quantum
devices which would be used to transmit and store information. A fundamental
problem is to determine the information capacity of such a system, and thereby
find the quantum analog of Shannon's famous expression for the capacity of a
noisy channel. The P.I. describes a strategy for determining this capacity in an
important special case, namely a memoryless channel where "qubits" are used to
encode the information. The method of solution would involve some new
mathematical ideas which may have applications to other areas of quantum
information theory.
