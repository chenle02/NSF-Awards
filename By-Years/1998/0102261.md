Mathematical Sciences: Analysis of Some Nonlinear Problems in Electromagnetic
Fields

Abstract DMS-0102261 Hong-Ming Yin



This project investigates several nonlinear problems arising from the theory of
electromagnetic fields and heat conduction. The first problem area concerns
investigation of induction heating processes. The mathematical model consists of
nonlinear Maxwell's equations coupled with a nonlinear heat equation. The
objective is to analyze whether or not thermal runaway (blowup) happens and how
to prevent it if it does occur during a heating process. More complicated free
boundary problems, modeling phase change during the heating process, are also
under study. The second problem area concerns investigation of a p-Laplacian
type of evolution system that models the classical Bean's critical-state model
in the superconductivity theory. The effort focuses on understanding how the
phase change takes place between normal and superconducting states.

This project investigates mathematical models of heat flow in situations that
involve electromagnetic fields. These models are important for many industrial
applications. The results of this work will lead to a better understanding the
complicated dynamics of electromagnetic fields and will provide explanations for
certain experimental phenomena. In addition, this investigation will produce
mathematical results of general interest for the study of Maxwell's equations
and nonlinear heat conduction.
