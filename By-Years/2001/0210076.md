This program will graduate 30 graduate students specializing in
Information&lt;br/&gt;Assurance (IA) over a period of four years. The program
will be accomplished through the close&lt;br/&gt;collaboration of the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) and North&lt;br/&gt;Carolina
A&amp;T State University. UNC Charlotte will offer an NSA-recognized IA
curriculum over&lt;br/&gt;the North Carolina Education and Research Network
(NCREN), a real-time two-way video&lt;br/&gt;system designed for distance
education in North Carolina. The IA curriculum emphasizes
critical&lt;br/&gt;thinking, development of teamwork and effective communication
skills. Student research and&lt;br/&gt;presentation are integral parts of every
course. Students are strongly encouraged to participate in&lt;br/&gt;on-going
research projects. The program is distinguished through its close partnership
with&lt;br/&gt;industry, program diversity, distinguished faculties, state-of-
the-art laboratory facilities, and&lt;br/&gt;expanding IA career opportunities
to under represented groups in our society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student is
required to complete a qualified industry-sponsored internship. Each
internship&lt;br/&gt;project must originate from a company or organization
focusing on a real-world IA problem;&lt;br/&gt;require creative design and/or
research that are appropriate for a Master's level student; and
has&lt;br/&gt;clearly defined deliverables, which typically would include
documents and/or prototype software.
