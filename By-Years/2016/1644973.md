The 16th ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM
SIGCOMM, in cooperation with USENIX, is to be held in Santa Monica, CA, November
14-16, 2016. This proposal requests funding to assist approximately 10-12
graduate students from US institutions who attend this conference. IMC is the
primary venue for presenting new research results on collecting and analyzing
measurements of the Internet. Attending conferences such as IMC is of paramount
importance for graduate students pursuing research in the field. Authors have
the opportunity to present their work and all attendees have a chance to
interact with many others performing leading-edge research in the field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal will serve to widen the
audience attending the Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), raising the level
of interaction and the potential for new collaboration, new investigations, and
higher quality research. Given the rising cost of travel, the grant will enable
students (who otherwise do not have sufficient funds) to attend the conference.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This proposal, by enabling students to
attend who might not otherwise be able, will increase the dissemination of the
conference's research results to a larger and more diverse audience. It also
integrates research and education of graduate students by allowing students to
observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the
field. By giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students, we
hope to widen the participation among these underrepresented groups.
Furthermore, by advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities,
participants from a more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend
and benefit from the conference.
