This study uses fungus-growing ant species to address host specialization by a
virulent pathogen of the ants' fungus gardens. Molecular analyses of host-
parasite phylogenetic relationships will be combined with analyses of population
differences to determine if parasites specialize on particular host fungal
species. Subsequent experiments will be initiated to determine the consequences
of host specialization, and analyses of the chemical mechanisms underlying
resistance will explain how specialization is maintained. The project will show
how mechanisms of resistance and infectivity shape parasite-host specialization
and the dynamics of these interacting populations. The research includes
collaboration with scientists at domestic and foreign institutions and
deposition of collections at museums in Latin America. Undergraduate students
will be trained in molecular and experimental techniques.
