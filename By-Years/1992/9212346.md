Liu Wave pipelining techniques have a good potential to improve the performance
of a digital system design. The success of achieving CMOS wave pipelining
requires a design methodology which tightly couples the knowledge of technology,
process, circuit, logic, and system architecture design as well as CAD tools for
design and testing. While preliminary results have clearly demonstrated the
feasibility of wave pipelining in CMOS, more work is needed toward the efficient
design of wave pipelined systems. This project is to develop and demonstrate
design techniques and VLSI structures for wave pipelining based on CMOS
technology, primarily because of its wide availability and relatively low cost.
Useful application areas for wave pipelining in high speed systems include high
speed sampling circuitry, digital phase locked loops, MUX and DEMUX, error
correction circuits, data and clock recovery for fiber optics.
