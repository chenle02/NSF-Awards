9705005 Calini This project concerns the connection between completely
integrable partial differential equations and the topological properties of
knotted closed curves which arise from models of vortex filament evolution. The
principal investigator plans to show that questions regarding knot types,
mechanisms for knotting and unknotting, stability of knot formations and
classification of knots by means of standard representatives can be effectively
addressed in this context. The two main tools that will be used are the periodic
theory of relevant integrable equations (among which are the Continuous
Heisenberg Model, the focusing Nonlinear Schroedinger and the sine- Gordon
equations) with periodic boundary conditions, and the theory of Backlund
transformations. The PI will use constructive methods for multiphase solutions
to generate large classes of knot representatives and will study a precise
relation between their knot type and the associated Floquet spectrum both
theoretically and computationally. Backlund transformations will be used to
investigate possible mechanisms for topological changes, to construct self-
intersecting curves that represent transitions between different knot types and
to produce examples of knots that are realized by curves with special properties
(such as curves of constant torsion). Complex structures in the form of knotted
and linked loops are present in many phenomena of the physical world: tornadoes,
plasma loops and magnetic arches in stellar atmospheres display complicated
vortex formations; mitochondrial DNA is a coiled, often knotted, molecule;
bacteria strands are found to form tangled loops; links and knots are observed
in certain stable mixtures of chemical media. This project concerns the
connection between evolution equations whose structure is well-understood and
the properties of knotted loops which arise in the study of vortex filament
dynamics and DNA modeling. The principal goal of this inve stigation is the
development of the mathematical tools necessary to effectively address questions
regarding the mechanisms for knotting and unknotting, the stability of knot
formations and the classification of knots and links. Such issues are gaining
great importance in a number of applied fields: for example, an understanding of
the complex vortex structures in the solar crown can provide information on how
the sun's magnetic activity affects the earth's climate, while topological
changes such as loop creation, knotting and unknotting appear to be at the heart
of the replication mechanism of the DNA molecule, a fundamental question in
cancer research.
