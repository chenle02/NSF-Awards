Advances in computing technology from the past few decades have opened the
possibility of a cyberinfrastructure for linguistics that will advance the field
by allowing linguists to analyze and test hypotheses against much larger data
sets, collaborate with more people across greater distances, and as a result
find solutions to questions not previously answerable. However, in order to
realize the promise of a well-engineered cyberinfrastructure, the field needs to
solve three problems: (1) establishing a culture of publishing and sharing data
and annotations, and of expecting hypotheses to be tested against available data
sets; (2) identifying existing standards and software that can contribute to a
general cyberinfrastructure and plan how to build from them; and (3) developing
a funding model which will sustain not only research contributions by linguists
and computational linguists, but also software development (including user
interface work) by software engineers.

These problems can not be solved by isolated research projects, but rather
require wide-spread communication, participation and buy-in from the field. The
goal of this workshop, Cyberling 2009: Towards a Cyberinfrastructure for
Linguistics, is to bring together linguists representing a wide range of
subfields (as well as outside specialists) who are interested in the potential
of cyberinfrastructure for linguistics and who have experience in working with
related projects to create a roadmap for solving the problems noted. The
workshop is being collocated with the Linguistic Society of America's 2009
Linguistic Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, and includes
open panel discussions to engage the general audience of the Linguistic
Institute and thereby promote wider interest in cyberinfrastructure development
within the field.
