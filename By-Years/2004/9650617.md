This college has over 1,200 students in the engineering technologies and about
200 in engineering science. This department is upgrading the modern optics
component of the appropriate courses by introducing current instrumentation for
the study of lasers. Through laboratory experiments, students gain an
understanding of the principles and measurement techniques involved in the study
and use of lasers. The pedagogical format is that of a traditional laboratory,
with careful prototyping leading to writeups that ensure maximum learning by the
students. The laboratory centers around the principles of lasers and signal
transmission. The use of Ti:Sapphire and Diode lasers affords the students the
unique opportunity to study these principles while working with state-of-the-art
technology. Laboratory exercises on the modulation and demodulation of signals
for fiber-optic communication, and on the acousto-optic and electro-optic
modulation, are combined with existing laboratories to complete the set of
photonics laboratories applicable to both engineering and technology students.
The particular laboratories developed under this program should provide a model
for other laboratories on the principles of lasers and their application.
