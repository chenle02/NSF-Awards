The escalating threat of cybercrime has underscored the urgent need for skilled
professionals proficient in collecting and presenting evidence for legal
proceedings and business decision-making. However, the vast volume of digital
data stored across devices, networks, and social media platforms makes it
challenging to locate and analyze specific pieces of evidence. The task of
connecting evidence and identifying patterns presents a daunting challenge for
human investigators. The novelty of this project lies in harnessing the
extraordinary capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create tailored
educational materials for digital forensics professionals and students. These
materials are designed to equip investigators with the knowledge and skills
necessary to navigate the intricate landscape of cybercrimes and enhance their
effectiveness in combating such offenses. The project's broader significance is
to better prepare investigators to leverage LLM-assisted techniques for digital
forensics, ensuring they can adapt to the evolving nature of cyber threats
effectively. The project will fine-tune an LLM to construct Digital Forensic
Investigation Graphs (DFIGs) based on criminal cases from a widely recognized
repository. These DFIGs serve as visually informative representations of the
investigation process, evidence entities, and their interconnections using STIX,
a standardized language for exchanging structured threat intelligence data. To
ensure accuracy, the entities and relationships within the graphs will undergo
scrutiny through graph neural network (GNN) models, identifying and rectifying
potential errors. Supported by comprehensive instructional materials, including
lecture notes, case studies, and hands-on lab exercises, students will be guided
through the process of acquiring the necessary expertise to construct and
analyze DFIGs for diverse digital forensic cases. This will promote digital
forensics education at the University of Baltimore, a Minority-Serving
Institution, and Florida A&M University, an HBCU, among others. Additionally, a
faculty development workshop will disseminate the instructional materials to the
broader national community, fostering a stronger and more inclusive network of
cybercrime fighters.
