Understanding of the structure of the four-dimensional universe in which we live
is a key topic of investigation in modern mathematics and physics. Gauge theory
is a crucial tool for the study of the mathematical structures that provide the
context for standard models of the physical world. The research supported by
this project will develop new mathematical tools and theories that will help
test such models and advance our understanding of four-dimensional spaces. A key
mathematical idea is the interaction between three-dimensional theories known as
Floer theories and the study of invariants of four-dimensional spaces. In
addition the project provides research training opportunities for graduate
students.

This project will develop and extend invariants including abelian gauge
theoretic models, cobordism invariants arising from the critical values of Morse
like functions such as Daemi's Gamma invariant, equivariant extensions such as
equivariant singular instanton knot homology, and new parameterized invariants
that combine Konno adjunction-style complexes with homotopy invariants of
families. It will also translate structures uncovered in some gauge theory
packages to other packages, for example translating L-space notions from
Heegaard Floer theory to analogues in the instanton case, or equivariant
structures from the Seiberg-Witten Floer theory to the Heegaard Floer theory.
Topological applications will include new insights into knot concordance,
homology cobordism, diffeomorphism groups of 4-manifolds, and SU(2)
representations of 3-manifold groups.
