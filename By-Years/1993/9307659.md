This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Bernasconi at the University of California, Santa Cruz to study asynchronous
transition states of proton transfer and nucleophilic addition and substitution
reactions using the principle of nonperfect synchronization. The specific
targets are: (a) to separate the polarizability and resonance effects in sulfur
and phosphorus substituted anions, (b) to study proton transfer from carbon to
carbon by experiment and theory, and (c) to study the influence of metallic
substitution on proton transfer barriers as well as the more general area of
nucleophilic additions to the C=M double bonds of Fischer carbene complexes. %%%
In this project Professor Bernasconi will employ his empirical theory, the
principle of nonperfect synchronization, to study asynchronous proton transfer
reactions and additions to Fischer carbene complexes. The application of his
physical organic methodology to the ubiquitous chemistry of metal carbenes will
fill an important void.
