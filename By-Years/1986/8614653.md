The Committee on Earthquake Engineering was established by the National Research
Council in September, 1983. The Committee was organized to meet the need for a
national focus and continuing assessments of the national earthquake engineering
program. In its fourth year of operation, the committee will continue to oversee
five projects: (1) strong-motion instrumentation, (2) advisory panel on National
Earthquake Engineering Experimental Facility study, (3) earthquake engineering
on concrete dams, (4) seismic policy adoption and implementation, and (5)
earthquake loss estimation.
