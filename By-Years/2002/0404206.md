&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic resonance is a fundamental effect inherent to any
dynamical system with three basic aspects: (a) a nonlinear, multistable
behavior, (b) a weak coherent input modulation, and (c) a noise source either
inherent to the system or being added to the system. In the current setup, a
nanomechanical beam plays the role of the dynamical system, which can be driven
nonlinearly to be in a bistable state with a large activation barrier. If the
beam is driven from above (below) the resonance frequency in the frequency
domain, it goes to the high (low) state. Once the beam is in one of the high or
low states, it requires an enormous energy to jump over the potential barrier to
go the other state. The addition of even a small amount of noise can give it a
finite switching probability for crossing the barrier. For a moderate level of
noise, the switching will acquire a degree of coherence with the underlying
signal. If the noise is too large, it swamps the signal. In the intermediate
range, there is a maximum in the switching probability, corresponding to a
resonant behavior in the dynamics of the beam.or, stochastic resonance.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In physical sciences alone, the proposed
research could achieve an unimaginable breadth of impact with the potential
discovery of novel engineering solutions in the area of MEMS and NEMS. The
exploratory research activity phased over one year will enable the training of a
graduate student in developing skills for cutting-edge engineering solutions. In
particular, the program will allow a comprehensive training on high-frequency
circuit modeling and analysis with the available software package, hardware
design for signal stimulation and transduction in the RF range for an effective
detection method, and characterization of equivalent circuit parameters. The
graduate students are trained on fabrication of Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems
(NEMS) from a number of materials, including silicon. The undergraduate student
will be involved in the simulation and modeling of the nanomechanical structures
for the proposed exploratory research in order for an early exposure to the
field of nanoscale engineering. &lt;br/&gt;
