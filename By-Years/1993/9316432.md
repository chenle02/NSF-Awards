9316432 Blake This renewal project will continue research on molecular orbital
calculations in the H-C-O-Al-Si-Na system in a variety of chemical and
hybridization states. Work on fitting the initial collection of results to an
interatomic potential known as the Universal Force Field for use in silicate and
oxide systems will be refined. The research will emphasize completion of very
high level molecular orbital calculations on small Si-containing oxide clusters
of varying coordination state and limited expansion of a suite of simulations on
the molecular interactions of volatiles (primarily water and carbon dioxide) in
melts. It will utilize computing facilities of the PI and the suite of platforms
available in the Materials Simulation Center at California Institute of
Technology.
