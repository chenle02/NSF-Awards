9409013 Lee This project is to develop and implement a plan within the framework
of the US-China Earthquake Protocol program, to exchange researchers between the
two countries. It has been recognized that exchange of research personnel is an
effective way to upgrade the level of the joint research program. Both sides
agree that the exchange, which has been postponed for some time, be initiated
during 1994. The proposed exchange shall include both the short-term (less than
half a year) and long-term (about one year) visits by researchers to each side.
Each side shall plan to send one to four researchers to the opposite side's
universities or other research institutions involved to take part in the joint
research work. The National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research has a
wealth of past experiences in areas of international cooperation. NCEER will
provide assistance to the National Science Foundation Earthquake Hazard
Mitigation Program to organize and coordinate international researchers for the
purpose of international cooperation, knowledge transfer and to coordinate the
visits of US and PRC investigators. The Center's administrative operations would
serve as an efficient and convenient base of operations to undertake such
logistical planning. *** e hejjjjjjjjjjjjj
