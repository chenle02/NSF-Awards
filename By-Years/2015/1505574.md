Non-Technical&lt;br/&gt;Modern electronic devices (e.g. computer hard drives)
use "spin" to store information. Other optoelectronic devices (e.g. lasers) use
light to transmit information. This project investigates new materials that
could integrate these two functions in a single system. We will explore the
properties of coupled pairs of semiconductor quantum dots that behave like
molecules with unique and tunable properties. The results will provide the
scientific foundation for building faster and more powerful computing,
information transmission and information storage devices. The project will train
graduate students in the conduct of research. It will also help to inspire and
educate younger students by bringing hands-on scientific experiments into K-12
classrooms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;Coupled pairs of
semiconductor quantum dots are called quantum dot molecules because coherent
tunneling between the individual quantum dots leads to the formation of
molecular states with unique and tunable properties. This project will develop
the scientific foundation for predictive design of tailored properties for
individual charges confined within quantum dot molecules. To accomplish this
objective, the research team is investigating specific changes in the structure,
composition and electric field environment of the quantum dot molecule that they
hypothesize will lead to new optoelectronic and spin properties. The team will
grow designed quantum dot molecules using molecular beam epitaxy and fabricate
device structures that allow application of two-dimensional electric field
profiles that break the molecular symmetry. The resulting optoelectronic and
spin properties will be characterized with optical spectroscopy at low
temperatures and in high magnetic fields. The team will develop the
computational tools necessary to accurately predict the properties of new
quantum dot complexes that incorporate nontraditional materials such as GaBiAs
and rare-earth nanoinclusions. Close interaction between theory and experiment
will allow refinement and validation of the computational models, setting the
stage for predictive engineering of solid state nanostructures with tailored
properties.
