Steady growth in per-capita municipal solid waste during the past two decades
has spurred a dramatic increase in the number of curbside recycling programs
nationwide. As a result, local planners have at their fingertips a wealth of
information on the costs of operating a variety of curbside recycling programs.
They do not, however, have comparable information on the willingness of
households to pay for and participate in curbside recycling. This type of
"benefit-side" information is crucial in estimating the extent to which
household monthly fees in a given community might be increased in order to cover
the costs of operating its curbside recycling program, as well as the effect
that changes in the fee have on household participation rates. It is
particularly useful information for communities that are seriously considering
the implementation of a voluntary curbside recycling program, where a household
pays for the service only if it has signed up for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using
state-of-the-art contingent valuation methods, we will survey a large number of
households across a wide variety of communities (e.g., those currently with and
without curbside recycling) and curbside recycling programs (e.g., voluntary vs.
mandatory programs). Our primary goal is to estimate the value of curbside
recycling to a typical household. Using advanced econometric techniques, we will
also estimate the effects that various household- and community-specific
characteristics have on this value. This will be the largest and most accurate
study of household recycling behavior to date. By incorporating the most recent
advances in contingent valuation methods, our study will help advance the
understanding of how best to elicit household information on environmental goods
such as recycling. Most importantly, our results will provide local planners
with valuable information regarding the benefits of recycling necessary to
undertake cost-benefit analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
