9322041 Strichartz This award provides a research environment for a group of
eight undergraduate researchers in the mathematical sciences working at Cornell
University. The project will engage the students in an eight week program of
experimentation, exploration and computation leading them to consider serious
mathematical problems drawn from several areas. These include harmonic analysis
related to wavelets and fractals, stability of periodic circle packings,
interactive particle system models of ecosystem dynamics and superconvergence
points in spline-Galerkin methods. On problems related to nonlinear phenomena,
as students will be offered a number of open-ended problems and encouraged to
attack them numerically and analytically. To assist the investigations, students
will be given instruction in the using computer facilities. Additional students
supported by REU supplements on research grants will provide additional
opportunities for healthy interaction among the students. Students will present
the results of their work orally as well asin written form. Recruiting efforts
will focus on attracting applications from students in underrepresented groups,
especially through personal contacts. ***
