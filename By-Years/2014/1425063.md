In the hospital sector, prices are generally negotiated by hospitals and
insurers rather than set by one side or determined by means of an auction. One
of the ways that firms may achieve a better bargaining position is through a
horizontal merger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops theoretical and
empirical models of competition for bilateral oligopolies such as the one
described above. The proposal then shows how to use these models to better
understand the nature of competition in the health care sector, as well as to
examine the impact of counterfactual mergers and policy remedies in this sector.
The approach is also useful to evaluate the impact of mergers and competition in
other industries where prices are determined by negotiation between
differentiated sellers and a small numbers of gatekeeper buyers. In addition,
the proposal further develops the theoretical underpinnings for bilateral
oligopoly bargaining models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed project has two
significant intellectual merits. First, it contributes to the empirical
literature on bargaining models, by developing new methods to analyze
competition in sectors with small numbers of firms on both sides of the market
and using the methods to evaluate the impact of mergers and other counterfactual
policies. The research extends the standard applied modeling framework for
mergers to settings where prices are determined through bilateral negotiation.
The methods are applied to the health care industry, demonstrating their
applicability and use in an important empirical setting.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, the proposed project contributes to the
theoretical literature on bargaining between multiple agents by evaluating
conditions under which simple solutions can be generated as the unique
equilibrium of a simultaneous alternating offers game. Thus, this project
provides guidance on when the use of these solutions is
appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many important sectors of the economy,
prices are determined by negotiation between different parties rather than by
being set unilaterally by one side of the market. Understanding the impact of
competition and mergers in these sectors is important from a policy perspective.
This proposal develops empirical and theoretical methodology to examine these
industries. The hospital industry has been the subject of more antitrust trials
than any other sector over the past 25 years, and the proposal specializes in
models for this sector. Thus, this proposal has the ability to influence
antitrust policy and more broadly, our understanding of the nature of
competition in industries with negotiated prices.
