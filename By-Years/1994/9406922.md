9406922 Javidi Matched filter functions and optimum processors derived under the
spatially overlapping input signal and scene noise assumption may not perform
well in the presence of spatially disjoint input signal and scene noise, and
could lead to very poor system performance. The purpose of this work is to
design new optimum processors for spatially disjoint signal and scene noise. The
principal investigator will consider a general model of a target in non-
overlapping input scene noise where the target may include distortions such as
unknown illumination, scale, rotation, etc. Overlapping noise on the target due
to detector noise or other statistical fluctuations will be included in this
model. It is intended to conduct theoretical, numerical, and experimental
investigation of the optical pattern recognition systems which are designed in
the presence of scene noise that is spatially disjoint with the target. ***
