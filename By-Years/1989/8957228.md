Professor Blake with support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is
developing innovative laser spectroscopic techniques for the investigation of
chemical processes within extreme cosmochemical and man-made environments such
as molecular clouds, planetary atmospheres, plasma deposition chambers, and
heterogeneous catalysis vessels. Both laboratory and remote sensing programs are
planned. This research is supported by a Presidential Young Investigator Award
(PYI). A particular area of emphasis is the study of the spectral response and
chemical reactivity of atomic and molecular clusters that are intermediate in
size between small molecules and macroscopic samples. Clusters and cluster
chemistry in cooled jet expansions or ion traps are being examined using various
techniques, including sub-Doppler laser sideband spectroscopy in the far-
infrared, optically pumped infrared fluorescence, time-resolved pump/probe
experiments, and resonance ionization mass spectrometry. Cosmochemical searches
will be made at various observatories for spectral features identified in the
laboratory.
