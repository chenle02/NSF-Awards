The project looks at several seemingly unrelated problems from a
&lt;br/&gt;unified perspective. It deals with questions of expansion of Cayley
&lt;br/&gt;graphs of finite groups, eigenvalues of Riemannian manifolds and
&lt;br/&gt;pro-p groups. Somewhat unexpectedly, methods and results from one
&lt;br/&gt;field shed a new light on the other areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
work is promising to be very interdisciplinary and should &lt;br/&gt;have, if
successful, a serious impact on several mathematical fields, &lt;br/&gt;pure and
applied. On the pure side, it is expected to have a &lt;br/&gt;completely new
approach toward the Thurston conjecture on three-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional
manifolds. On the applied side, it will bring a better &lt;br/&gt;understanding
of expanding graphs, graphs which serve as basic &lt;br/&gt;building blocks for
various communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;
