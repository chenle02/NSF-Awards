The PI will explore the electronic device potential of heterostructures using
germanium-silicon alloys. The investigations to be performed will permit
evaluation of the potential of germanium- silicon heterostructures, in
particular for application to heterojunction bipolar transistors. Basic studies
of film growth using advanced gas phase epitaxy, including determination of
critical thickness for commensurate growth will be used. Doping effects and the
processes of oxidation and diffusion which are not yet well understood will also
be examined. Abrupt multilayered structures will be grown and a variety of
analytic techniques will be brought to bear for film characterization. In
particular, will be performed the growth and evaluation of heterojunction
bipolar transistor structures which may be of great importance as high speed
switching devices. Research performed in this project will also permit the
investigating of the future advanced heterojunction concepts which involve the
use of sheets of dopant atoms. These studies will advance the understanding of
heterojunctions in general and will lead to improved understanding of important
devices.
