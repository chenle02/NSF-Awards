The Principal Investigators propose to carry out research on the effects of the
ratio of alpha to beta glucose on the specific growth rates of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and E. coli, as well as the effect of this ratio on the kinetics of
byproducts from these organisms, such as ethanol and acetic acid. Continuous and
fed-batch fermentations will be carried out, and optimization studies will seek
to produce high cellular growth rates and yields with minimal byproduct
formation.
