9725528 Schlager This project will establish an online teacher professional
development (TPD) research testbed to a) investigate the resources,
capabilities, and technological support that TPD efforts will need to supply
useful online activities based on next generation virtual environment platforms;
b0 develop, implement, and evaluate innovative TPD models that integrate face-
to-face and asynchronous interaction with collaborative synchronous online
activities; and technological factors that contribute to (or obstruct) the
effectiveness, sustainability, and scalability of new concepts for online TPD.
This study will investigate four categories of issues-implementation process,
TPD benefits and outcomes, community building, and technology use and
satisfaction-using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The
investigators will build on a pilot project that developed a virtual community,
TAPPED IN, for online TPD. ***
