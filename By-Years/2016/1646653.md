The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
data security by preventing eavesdropping on a communication channel. This
project takes into consideration the location of potential eavesdroppers and
fading channel signals to prevent unauthorized access to communication. The
project will enhance information security by providing a technology that uses
less computation power, while insuring longer battery life, to secure
communication. The project provides an alternative choice for securing
communication by not relying on traditional encryption, which sometimes has been
vulnerable to attacks. The potential application of this I-Corps project
includes, but is not limited to: financial sector, military, government research
institutions, healthcare, and other security-sensitive applications.

This I-Corps project utilizes a combination of signaling and coding techniques
to provide security against eavesdroppers by not relying on a secret pair of
keys that traditional cryptography schemes are known for. This technology uses a
combination of channel codes and physical location of eavesdroppers to prevent
the eavesdroppers from gaining access to the communication wave. The research
for this project enhanced security by using a lower probability of message
detection and error correction technique at the physical layer of the internet
model. The technology adds bits to messages and ensures that the messages cannot
be decoded by eavesdroppers. More specifically, the technology exploits
degrading signals, noise, interference, and localization techniques to provide
secure communication. The proposed technology uses less computation power than
traditional approaches and is thus a great fit for biological sensors. This
scheme achieves information confidentiality, integrity and authentication.
