This award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in a seminar on the
"Present and Future of Experimental Particle Physics by Hybrid Emulsion -
Electronic Detectors," organized jointly by Dr. Neville Reay of Ohio State
University and Professor Kiyoshi Nui of Nagoya University, Japan. United States
and Japanese participants will meet in Nagoya, Japan during November 1988. Over
60 physicists in our two countries have been collaborating for the past 10 years
on studying the decays of elementary particles containing heavy quarks as one of
their primary constituents. The objectives of the seminar are (1) to summarize
the important results, both in particle physics and in experimental techniques,
which have been obtained in the collaborative projects, (2) to disseminate
information on newly established methods, and (3) to establish directions for
future research. Despite the fact that U.S. and Japanese investigators have been
collaborating on a large-scale, particle physics research project for more than
a decade, the leaders from the various associated institutions have never all
met simultaneously. This seminar will enable a comprehensive evaluation of
accomplishments and help to ensure commonality of future interests among all
Japanese and U. S. participants.
