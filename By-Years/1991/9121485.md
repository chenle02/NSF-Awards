This is a proposal to study how characteristics of communities influence the
occurrence and timing of several dimensions of the transition to adulthood, for
example the decision to get married, and to have the first child. The study will
focus in particular on the relationship between out-of- wedlock childbearing and
the relative availability of marriage partners in a community, and on the degree
to which community characteristics can account for racial and ethnic differences
in the transition to adulthood. Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth (NLSY) will be linked with data for counties and metropolitan areas from
the Census and other sources. Event history models will be estimated to
determine the impact of the community level variables on the transition to
adulthood. This study will provide a valuable contribution to a large literature
on the transition to adulthood in American society. Its unique contribution will
be to shed light on how the communities in which young people live may affect
the choices and decisions they make early in life in particular with respect to
decisions about childbearing, marriage, and sexual activity.
