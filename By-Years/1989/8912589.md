The goal of the proposed study is to detail the form and function of vocal
communication and antipredator behavior in two species of lemur. These two
primate species are ideal for this comparative study because they differ in
size, sociality, ecology and reproductive biology. Their vocal repertoires will
be quantified, the importance of visual and auditory cues used to discriminate
harmful from harmless animal stimuli will be determined, and alternative
hypotheses of antipredator call function will be tested through predator model
presentations and call playback trials. The project will be conducted in a large
natural habitat enclosure using models of naturally-occurring avian and
mammalian predators as stimuli. %%% Predation pressure is recognized as having
had a profound impact on primate social organization, yet vocal and non-vocal
antipredator tactics of primates have received little research attention. This
project addresses a central issue in the study of nonhuman primate vocal
communication, and does so in a way that is likely to make an important
contribution to current theories concerning the evolution of human language.
