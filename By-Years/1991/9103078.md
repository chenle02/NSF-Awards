The Fellow ill engage in high-pressure phase equilibrium experiments of
selected primary mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) analog compositions. Such work is
needed to understand the chemical differentiation of the earth's mantle and to
predict the chemical composition of magmas that are supplied to the base of the
ocean crust. The Fellow sill undertake this work at Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory of Columbia University.
