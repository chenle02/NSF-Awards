The analysis of the light emitted atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere
leads to a knowledge of the chemical and physical reactions taking place there
as energy in the form of solar ultraviolet radiation is absorbed during the day,
and in the form of high speed streams of electrons and positively charged atoms
is absorbed at high latitudes at night. To relate the optical observations to
specific chemical reactions and to infer upper atmosphere temperature and
composition and energy inputs, it is necessary to perform controlled laboratory
experiments to determine the parameters that need to be used in numerical models
of the processes. This award is for laboratory work to provide such parameters
for reaction involving nitrogen and oxygen atoms and molecules, and in
particular for the shapes of "spectral lines", i.e., the detailed distribution
of the number of photons emitted versus their precise wavelength, to help sort
out reactions involving the breakup of molecules from reactions involving the
direct collision of electrons with atoms.
