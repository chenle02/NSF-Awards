9610176 Lewis This is an award to support research on the potential of using
phytoremediation for removal of radon from soil surrounding buildings as a step
toward reducing the pollution of indoor air from this radioactive gas. The
objectives of this project are to determine the amount of radon that can be
removed from soil by vegetation and to develop a soil-plant-atmosphere radon
transport mathematical model that may provide additional insights into the mass
and diffusional transport of water-soluble gases by plant vascular systems from
soil to air. This laboratory study involves experimental simulation of the soil-
plant-concrete basement system typical of constructed buildings by physical
models placed inside plant growth chambers with controlled temperature, light
and relative humidity. Quantitative determination of radon relating to
controlled variables will provide the basis for development of the simulation
model. Results of this project are expected to provide insights into the
potential for reduction of radon levels in residences. An expected product is a
determination as to whether a field-scale investigation is warranted, a step
that would be needed to translate knowledge to be gained into procedures for
engineering and architectural design of new buildings and addressing radon
pollution of existing structures. ***
