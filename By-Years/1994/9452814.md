secure rights for one additional PBS broadcast plus three additional years of
off-air recording for educational purposes. In 1990, NSF awarded $367,430 to the
South Carolina Educational Network toward production and dissemination of a
television series entitled, "Spaceship Earth." The series takes a
satellite's-eye view of the Earth, providing a unified look at the rich variety
and interdependency of life and land on our planet. Topics considered in the
programs include: an overview of a new global geography, population, earth's
crust, world markets, weather, seas and oceans, rivers, forests, food, and "the
watchkeepers," Earth's inhabitants who are responsible for its well-being. That
series was completed and broadcast over a three year period. During that time it
attract large general audiences and was widely used in schools. There is
continued interest is use of the series, however, broadcast and off-air taping
rights have expired. South Carolina Educational Television also will develop and
disseminate promotional material to alert audiences and teachers of the
continued availability of the project.
