9626589 Jacobson The Palona, Orocopia and Rand Schists are Late Cretaceous-early
Tertiary subduction zone rocks in southern California and southwestern most
Arizona. These rocks were emplaced beneath the mesozoic arc of western North
America along the vicent-chocolate mountain thrust, according to one model,
originating during low-angle, east-dipping subduction. Thus the model implies
top to the west sense of movement. However, many studies have documented top to
the east movement on many exposures of the fault, which due to subduction, would
reverse subduction polarity and create several geometric problems for Loramide
tectonics. Recent work has indicated that many of these "wrong way" kinetic
indicators may be due to later, normal faulting reactivation of the thrust
surface. This project will focus on this possible reactivation and will attempt
to date the movement. Successful results will help finally resolve one of the
main controversies of the Cretaceous tectonic geometry of the southwest margin
of North America, and illuminate the younger extensional event.
