The Stony Brook Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Physics and Astronomy
brings 13 undergraduate students to the Stony Brook campus each summer for
participation in an eight-week program of forefront research in the laboratories
of Stony Brook physics and astronomy faculty members. The immediate aim of the
program is to provide training in, encourage interest in, and appreciation of,
scientific research in physics and to facilitate career planning by the actual
doing of research in a collegial setting, by site visits to research
laboratories at Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory, by weekly
seminars on current problems in physics and finally by presentations of student
research results in a formal symposium and a written report at the conclusion of
the program. Outstanding projects are submitted for presentation at national
student research symposia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program offers research
opportunities in the areas of astronomy, atmospheric physics, high-energy
particle physics, instructional laboratory instrumentation, lasers and optics,
nuclear physics and solid-state/condensed matter physics. Most projects are
experimental but a few are theoretical. Recruiting efforts concentrate on
sophomore and junior level physics majors of high academic standing, many from
colleges in which research opportunities are limited. The broader aims of the
program include increasing the national pool of qualified scientific
researchers, and fostering understanding of research methods to those who go on
to other fields of endeavor such as, for example, science/ engineering
administration, patent law, or secondary school teaching. Particular efforts are
made to attract women and students from under-represented
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
