9632746 WISHNER Episodic, advective features may play a major role in the input
and loss of zooplankton and larval fish populations on Georges Bank. However,
the importance of these mesoscale events has not been quantified directly and
may be strongly time-and feature- dependent. The impact is likely to vary with
the type of feature and its location, season, and magnitude, all of which will
affect the species, abundance, and developmental stages of zooplanton and fish
larvae in the feature itself and on the Bank. As part of the U.S. GLOBEC
Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase 2 program, this project will determine
the association of particular zooplankton species with selected episodic
features of opportunity (such as Scotian shelf streamers, slope or shelf water
parcels, or warm-core rings) and ascertain how the vertical migrations of
zooplankton interact with the flow fields to affect the flux of zooplankton in
these features. ***
