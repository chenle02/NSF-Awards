Consistent with the increasing instrumental emphasis in chemistry, Mississippi
College is introducing a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) into its
chemistry curriculum. Use and application of this instrument affects all
students in organic and analytical chemistry, and instrumental analysis, and
strengthen our undergraduate research program. The GC-MS uses a benchtop system,
computer accessed and controlled, and allows identification of complex mixtures,
data storage, and comparisons searching within a large library of data. Student
experience with GC-MS compliments present powerful analytical methods thus
better preparing them for graduate and professional schools or industry.
Specific course improvements include increasing the instrumental emphasis in
qualitative organic analysis of natural materials, products of chemical
reactions, environmental contaminants and drugs. Theory of mass spectrometry is
supported by experiments and in advanced classes the importance of integrating
separation science and mass spectroscopy with computer assistance is
experienced. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
