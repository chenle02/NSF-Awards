9520679 The blue oak is a keystone species in a water limiting environment, and
over much of its range in California, this tree is not regenerating. This
research is aimed at understanding the role that water relations play in
determining the success of this tree. The research will compare vulnerability to
drought-induced cavitation in oaks of different ages. It will determine the
amount of genetic variation that exists in this trait, by comparing responses of
seedlings produced by different parent trees. Finally, it will ascertain the
importance of phenotypic plasticity in modifying response to different levels of
moisture stress. The research will increase understanding of the mechanisms and
variability of response to drought induced cavitation in woody plants.
Understanding of the phenotypic expression of water-use traits, and knowledge of
variation on temporal and spatial scales should be of considerable value in
developing management plans for the conservation of an ecologically important
species.
