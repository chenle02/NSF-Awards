Probabilistic and decision-theoretic planning, which operates under conditions
of uncertainty, has important applications in science and engineering, but such
stochastic methods have been under-utilized because these planners do not scale
to large, complicated problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast, the past
decade has seen tremendous scale-up in deterministic planning techniques, which
do not directly address the same challenges of uncertainty head on. This project
provides a systematic framework for exploiting this progress in deterministic
planning technology - be it classical, temporal or partial satisfaction planning
problems - in stochastic planning as well, by novel adaptation of theory and/or
methods of determinization, hindsight optimization, and machine learning.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is helping to bridge the traditional divide
between deterministic and stochastic planning communities, and it is bringing
stochastic planning technology to real-world applications.
