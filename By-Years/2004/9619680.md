Undergraduate Computer Science Research Program : Research Experiences for
Undergraduates This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project
supports 9 students per year in programs carried out during the summers, for
three years. Students are recruited from smaller, primarily undergraduate
schools throughout the South with emphasis on recruitment of women and minority
students. Research projects within the department from which the students have
an opportunity to select include software testing, database systems, parallel
algorithms, human-computer interfaces, distributed systems, artificial
intelligence, programming languages, and performance analysis. Students are
required to create a formal, written report documenting their summer activities
and, at the completion of the program, to present a short talk to the students
and faculty of their home institution.
