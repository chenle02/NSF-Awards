This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the merit
and feasibility of the World Wide Student Laboratory (WWSL). WWSL is a scalable
Internet-based education infrastructure that enables students, under the
guidance of their educators, to have 24x7 remote access enabling them to carry
out, advanced educational experiments in modern laboratories at leading
universities and research centers worldwide, regardless of the students'
location. This approach will improve the quality of the laboratory experience
and substantially reduce the cost of the educational laboratory, which is the
most difficult and expensive segment of science and engineering education to
provide. Using WWSL, educational institutions will be able to afford better
facilities for the education they provide, access to the best lab facilities in
other institutions, and substantially broaden the number of lab study subjects
in their curriculum. Individual instructors can customized the content and
methods of lab for their students. WWSL will make available all materials
necessary for fulfillment of the lab work The economic and societal benefits of
the WWSL approach are based on the potential a dramatic increase in the
efficiency of existing lab facilities in universities. WWSL can serve
traditional universities, colleges and high schools, as well as distance
education institutions.
