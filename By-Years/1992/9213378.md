Soil erosion models have become an essential tool for soil conservation
planning and design and for a variety of other land management and assessment
tasks. Modern soil erosion models are process based, and virtually all of them
contain a formula for predicting sediment transport capacity, as transport
capacity controls both rate of erosion and rate of deposition. Although all
hillslopes have irregular surfaces, no existing formula is capable of accurately
predicting the transport capacity of overland flow on such surfaces. There is an
urgent need for development of such a formula. This project will develop
sediment transport formulas for stone covered and grass covered surfaces as a
first step toward development of a more general formula for all irregular
surfaces. The research will be based on two sets of flume experiments in the
laboratory. Cylinders will be used to simulate stones and nails will simulate
grass. Experiments will be performed in a six meter long flume using a variety
of water discharges, gradients, grain sizes, and cylinder and nail
concentrations. The analysis will establish empirical relations between
transport capacity and appropriate hydraulic variables that reflect the energy
dissipated near the bed and available to transport sediment. The ability of
process-based soil erosion models to provide accurate predictions of soil
erosion is dependent on the accuracy of the transport capacity equation they
employ. This research should produce formulas for stone and grass covered
surfaces which can be incorporated immediately into existing soil erosion
models. Use of these formulas should lead to more accurate estimates of sediment
transport capacity and thus better predictions of soil erosion rates on
irregular surfaces.
