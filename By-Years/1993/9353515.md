9353515 Anderson Volcanology for Earth Science Teachers is series of three-week
workshops for 25 teachers to be held during the summers of 1994 and 1995 at the
Hilo Campus. The focus of these workshops will be the study of active volcanoes.
The objective will be to improve middle/secondary earth science instruction by
preparing participants to effectively teach their students about volcanoes,
related geological processes and principles, such as plate tectonics and
earthquakes. Science knowledge development, hands on activities, interactions
with scientists, field experiences, teaching strategies, and the development of
teaching materials will make up the core of the program. A "resource book" will
be compiled and validated for each participant. The participants will be
expected to improve earth science curricula and classroom instruction upon
returning to their schools.
