This study investigates whether employment in either informal or formal work
sectors affects the extent to which people have favorable attitudes toward
government or choose to participate in political activity in Mexico and Costa
Rica. The informal sector includes economic activity based on small-scale, labor
intensive work and lies outside the protection of state regulation. The study
uses mass surveys in Mexico and Costa Rica. These data provide systematic
comparisons of informal and formal sector workers. With the size and growth of
the informal sector in Latin America the findings address important questions of
political attachment to democratic ideals.
