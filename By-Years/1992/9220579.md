Green lacewings are beneficial predatory insects that eat aphids, scales, and
other serious pests of crop plants. They are often raised artificially for mass
release in agricultural areas where they can serve as important agents of
biological control. Henry et. al. have found that several distinct North
American species of green lacewings exist which can be told apart only by their
unique courtship songs. Similar-looking lacewings are found in Europe, but these
have songs that differ greatly from North American ones and vary from region to
region. In the past, all of these European and North American lacewings have
been thought of interchangeably as a single species, Chrysoperla carnea, and
have been freely exported and imported across the Atlantic for biological
control purposes. However, since different species can show strong prey
preferences and other individualistic behaviors, it is feasible that some mass
reared and released green lacewings might be relatively ineffective against
certain targeted pest species. Efforts at biological control should be enhanced
by recognizing the hidden biodiversity within this lacewing species complex and
beginning to use the most appropriate "song species" in each continent, area or
habitat. %%% This project will investigate the hidden species diversity in
European green lacewings using song analysis, just as has been done for the
North American ones. Thus, the investigators will determine how many true
species exist in this economically important insect group and which are
appropriate for use in biological pest control programs in different areas of
the world. Perhaps, even more importantly, this project will serve as a model of
the importance of song or other behavioral traits in investigating biodiversity
in insects and other groups of organisms.
