The NSFNET today is a complex enterprise enabling millions of researchers,
educators, and students to communicate with one another, access a wealth of
information on-line, and use the resources accessible through the network. While
a great deal of useful information is available on the network, finding what one
needs may be complex. An efficient network should have adequate information
resources and "road maps" to permit the user to navigate quickly and easily to
the information which he or she needs. This project will (i) categorize and
index the various information resources available into a Directory of
Directories so that users can more quickly and easily locate the information
they need, (ii) develop "white pages" and "yellow pages" directory services,
(iii) develop a core Directory of Directories facility to coordinate the
directory and database resources of the NSFNET,(iv) develop a complementary set
of Directory and Database Services to extend, supplement, and promote the
evolution of available resources on the NSFNET. The Directory of Directories and
Directory and Database services will initially be implemented using current
Internet tools such as "WAIS" and "Netfind" to permit rapid use of the services.
They will be transitioned to a fully distributed state-of-the-art system based
on the Directory standard (X.500) and, thereafter, will incorporate newly
developed research technologies which will improve performance in searching
large directories and explore innovative information gathering techniques to
keep the directories accessible, manageable, and current. The project is one of
three collaborative activities comprising the Network Information Services
Management Project.
