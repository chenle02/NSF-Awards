9312851 Maragakis This research is a study to perform full-scale tests of double
angle railway bridge connections and evaluate their fatigue strength by
monitoring the development and propagation of cracks. A fatigue reliability
model will be developed based on the fracture mechanics approach. A detailed
finite element model of the connections will also be developed. New connections
as well as connections from older railway bridges will be tested. These
connections will be supplied by the American Association of Railroads (AAR)
which has expressed a strong interest in the project and will be cooperating in
the investigation. ***
