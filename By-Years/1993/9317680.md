9317680 Babcock This research program explores the ways in which grain boundary
segregated elements affect the atomic structure of grain boundaries in metals
and oxides. Characterization techniques include high resolution, phase-contrast
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, high resolution Z-contrast
scanning TEM imaging, high spatial resolution x-ray and electron energy loss
spectroscopy, and high speed position-sensitive atom probe microscopy to
determine: (a) the atomic-scale distribution of the segregated solute both
parallel and perpendicular to the grain boundary, and (b) the influence of the
segregated solute on the atomic packing units of the host grain boundary. These
studies are conducted on bicrystalline samples of controlled grain boundary
crystallography, controlled doping, and simple, but representative, geometry.
Lead- doped nickel oxide and gold-doped iron have been chosen for the initial
experiments. These two alloy systems are model materials whose behavior
represent that of a broad range of compounds and alloys. The experimental
results will be compared with contemporary models for grain boundary structure.
The thrust of these analyses is to determine whether or not a fundamental
structural mechanism exists by which segregated atoms influence grain boundary
properties. %%% Such knowledge is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms by
which grain boundary segregated solutes control a broad range of grain boundary
and, therefore, bulk properties in engineering materials. ***
