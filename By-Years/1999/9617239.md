The University of La Verne requests support from NSF to connect a branch campus
and an off campus center to the Internet. The Woodland Hills Campus is located
about 53 miles from the home campus with about 325 full time students, the
Orange County Center is about 40 miles from the main campus and has about 415
full time students. These distributed sites need the Internet connection to be
able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the
world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of these
institutions as well as the community in general. The award provides partial
support of the project for two years.
