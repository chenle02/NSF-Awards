This award, made to one of the pioneers and leaders in the field of large-scale
structure studies, will fund the investigation of peculiar motions in the
Perseus-Pisces supercluster of galaxies. The detailed motions of the galaxies
observed, will, in turn, permit the determination of the mass distribution in
this very massive and relatively near-by supercluster. This should help to
understand how such very large and highly structured collections of galaxies are
formed.
