A backscatter communication enables development and implementation of battery-
less sensors, miniaturized (MEMS) robots, or even nano devices. However, the
current stat-of-the-art technology limits communication scenario to a direct
transmission between active and passive devices, for example in radio frequency
identification (RFID) system between a reader and a passive tag. In contrast,
the goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-hop network that utilizes
backscatter signal as communication for passive, battery-less devices. The
objectives of this work include mathematical representation of such passive
multi-hop networks and development of novel cross-layer communication protocols
and control schemes with learning methodology for beam-forming. The expected
contributions include an improved theoretical understanding of the multi-hop
network of battery-less devices and a novel cross-layer optimization framework
of network protocols that are feasible and practically viable. The end result of
this effort would lead into a truly pervasive, backscatter-based networking
paradigm. The proposal?s outcomes include extending the range and improved
capabilities of RFID systems to support larger and more complex sensing
applications while lowering cost and minimizing environmental impacts
(batteries-less operation). Moreover, a set of outreach activities include
engagement of women and students from under-represented minorities through
Missouri S&T Student Diversity Programs' office and Project Lead the Way (K-12
outreach). In long term, the outcomes will support various applications of MEMS
and nano devices through facilitating a communication and control of such
devices, with a potential to transform the healthcare, manufacturing into
something that now is considered a science fiction.
