The University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) will host 14 undergraduate
students during summer in an interdisciplinary program of biosphere-atmosphere
science focused on global change. Participants will conduct hands-on research
based at a well-equipped field station in northern Michigan, with an emphasis on
either biological or atmospheric science. This 9-week summer program will begin
during the second week of June and will continue through mid-August. Students
will 1) participate in workshops and activities designed to provide the
philosophical bases and technical tools needed to conduct scientific research;
2) work with an experienced mentor as part of an on-going research project; and
3) design, conduct, analyze, and report on an independent research project.
Overall, participants will gain experience in all phases of research, from
hypothesis formulation, through data gathering, to analysis, interpretation and
communication of research findings. They will be immersed in, and interact with,
a diverse community consisting of 30 or more PhD researchers and faculty and
&gt;100 other undergraduate and graduate students from across the US and other
countries. UMBS REU students will be selected based on academic achievement,
career goals and an interest in obtaining research experience in environmental
sciences. Students from minority groups that are underrepresented in sciences
are particularly encouraged to apply. Accepted students will receive a stipend,
free room and board, a budget for research supplies, and funds for travel to and
from the site. Further details and updates are available at
