Neutral non-glyceride lipids - waxes in the broadest sense - are major
components of many marine animals from a single celled organisns, through higher
invertebrates, to fishes and the mammalian toothed whales. It is estimated that
the annual production of wax esters in just one group of organisms, the calanoid
copepods, may approach three hundred million metric tons. These same organisms
are the principal food of such commercially important fish as herrings,
sardines, anchovies, and young salmon, as well as most of the major seabird
species. Hence wax eters indirectly are of considerable importance to man, from
both nutritional and economic standpoints. We have little knowledge on how wax
eters are assimilated. The work proposed will elucidate the biomedical and
physiological mechanisms responsible for this unique capacity to assimilate an
otherwise refractory food source. The studies described here include both in
vivo and in vitro (enzymatic) experimental approaches with both wild sea birds
and domestic birds (ducks, chickens, turkeys, etc.).
