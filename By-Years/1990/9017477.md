In this project, the investigator proposes to: 1. Develop a protocol for
computational mechanics methodology which enhances solution accuracy with
reasonable resource demand, that will be appropriate for the computation of
thermo, solid and fluid dynamical systems. 2. Integrate the protocols into one
smooth solution algorithm. 3. Apply this new protocol in the solution of the
flow between rotating coaxial cylinders; and 4. Investigate the potential
generalization of the method to specific combinations of coupled thermo, solid
and fluid dynamical problems. Solving models that combine these three areas:
thermo, solid and fluid dynamics is a very critical problem in engineering
technology. Reasonably good computational protocols are available to handle the
above systems independently, but hardly any efficient technique has yet been
developed to integrate the simultaneous solution of the three problem types.
