This grant provides funding support for the AmeriMech Symposium on Mechanical
Behavior of 2D Materials (Graphene and Beyond) to be held in Austin, Texas from
April 4-6, 2016. This AmeriMech Symposium will bring together experimental and
theoretical researchers interested in the mechanical behavior of 2D materials in
order to develop a comprehensive view of the state of the art, and develop a
roadmap for future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-dimensional materials play
an increasingly critical role in advanced technologies. The mechanics of
deformation and failure of these materials have been recognized by the mechanics
of materials and structures community as an extremely challenging problem, both
to predict computationally and to measure experimentally. This symposium will
bring together leading researchers in the field of low dimensional materials.
The longer presentation times, coupled with a substantial discussion period at
the end of each day will foster meaningful exchanges between participants and
lay the groundwork for the development of a roadmap for future research and
collaborations.
