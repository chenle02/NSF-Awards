The objectives of this research are to explore magnetic phase transitions in
novel pure, dilute and mixed magnetic insulators. The study of spin glass
behavior in insulating materials are conducted. Also, several mixed magnetic
systems are studied in which spin glass phases might occur. In other mixed
magnetic systems tetracritical or other multicritical points in the magnetic
phase diagram are investigated. As an example of a rare magnetic model class, a
dilute magnetic system is studied as well. Variable temperature, variable field
magnetization and susceptibility measurements are conducted on single crystal
and polycrystalline samples. These studies are important because they provide
information on areas such as zero-field splittings, ferromagnetic interactions,
and spin class character.
