Modern turbo-machinery plays a major role in today's technology. Applications
are numerous in the aircraft, compressor, and pump industries. The trend is
toward more compact machines with lighter weight shafts and high speeds.
Vibration analysis becomes indispensible as weight grows less. The transfer
matrix method is very popular for these vibration analyses. The method assumes
that beam theory can be used to determine rotor span stiffness and that the beam
elements have constant cross-section. However, modern rotor elements violate
these assumptions, having shell configurations of varying cross-section. This
project incorporates these configuration effects into the transfer matrix
approach. This is a fundamental advance in the vibration analysis tool and will
be welcome in the rotor dynamics industries.
