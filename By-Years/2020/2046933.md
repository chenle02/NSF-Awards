With the support of the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Dr. Tran Nguyen of the University of California at Davis is
studying newly discovered pathways by which sulfur radicals can be formed in the
environment and the potential importance of these reactions for influencing the
composition of the atmosphere and understanding human-induced climate impacts.
Dr. Nguyen and her research group will study how the reactions of sulfur
radicals with organic compounds may change under different conditions relevant
to cloud/fog droplets and the liquid water of aerosol particles. Complementing
the research efforts, Dr. Nguyen will also produce accessible scientific
education materials on environmental chemistry topics that will be disseminated
via broad digital platforms to pre-college students, teachers, homeschooling
parents, and the general public. Finally, Dr. Nguyen and colleagues at UC Davis
will integrate open-access atmospheric chemistry data into undergraduate
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sulfate radical is known to be a reactive
oxidant in the aqueous phase that can form surface-active compounds such as
organosulfates, which could also affect atmospheric composition and aerosol-
cloud interactions. This research will investigate the photochemical production
of sulfate radicals in aqueous particles and bulk liquid water, and
characterizes its dependence on pH, particle liquid water content, solution
ionic strength, interfacial surface area, and other factors. In addition, the
reactivity of sulfate radicals with a number of environmentally-important
compounds will be quantified, alongside product identification to glean
mechanistic information for these reactions. This project will provide
interdisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students in physical
chemistry, quantitative analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry,
atmospheric chamber techniques, and computational
modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
