Grzegorz Szamel of Colorado State University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to explore the fundamental statistical
mechanical descriptions of the glass transition. First, a novel computer
simulation technique will be implemented to test the general theory of the glass
transition proposed by Parisi and collaborators, which assumes that the glass
transition is associated with the vanishing of one component of the supercooled
liquid's entropy, the so-called configurational entropy. Second, theoretical
understanding of the glass transition will be advanced by elucidating the
connection between mode-coupling theory and the Parisi approach. In addition, a
new extended mode-coupling theory will be developed that is applicable to
systems with stochastic (Brownian) dynamics such as colloidal suspensions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many useful polymer materials are flexible at room
temperature. Cooling these plastics below their glass transition temperature
causes them to become brittle like glassy, amorphous materials with structures
similar to that of a liquid but with some profoundly different properties. Among
the most interesting unsolved problems in physical chemistry are a theory for
the glass transition and the nature of the glassy state. The outcomes of this
research project are expected to lead to new insights into glass behavior, which
could have broad technological implications in advanced materials processing.
