Popp (OCE-9711197) ABSTRACT Popp OCE-9711197 Current research activities by the
PI and his colleagues at the University of Hawaii require the measurement of
precise isotopic ratios of C and N in marine samples. The proposed purchase of
an automated C-N isotopic analysis system would greatly enhance the throughput
and sensitivity for making these measurements over what is currently available.
The PI and his colleagues are experts in the use of such instrumentation and
have a proven track record of research accomplishments in this area. Thus the
proposed l improvements would lead to a strengthening of current research
activities and lead to enhancements in current graduate and post-doctoral
education programs and facilitate new research projects not possible without
modernization of the current facility at the University of Hawaii. In addition
to the $40K of NSF support, $55K in total funds have been approved by the
University using an existing ONR building fund to support this equipment
purchase, thus significantly increasing total funds to this project.
