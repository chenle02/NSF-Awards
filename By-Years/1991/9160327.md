Fusion Systems has fabricated ultraviolet reflectors using aluminum-based
dielectric multilayers. The resulting optical characteristics of the multilayer
assembly display phenomena characteristic of anomalous, metallic-like optical
properties, while retaining the basic dielectric character of the materials. The
descriptive term "transparent aluminum" has been applied to this phenomena. The
phenomena was discovered during studies for development of high reflectance
(greater than 95%), broadband ultraviolet reflectors for use in the deep UV and
mid UV portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. This project investigates the
optical and electronic properties of this phenomena for potential application in
the deep UV and vacuum UV (VUV), as well as other regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Suitable analytical techniques attempt to further define the anomalous
phenomena in both theoretical and experimental terms. A study of the possibility
that "transparent aluminum" analogues may exist for alternate, proprietary
materials is also part of the project.
