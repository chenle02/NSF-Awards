This award is to purchase manipulation and sensor and control processing
equipment for projects in intelligent distributed control of materials handling,
object manipulation using tactile sensing, coordinated motion and grasp
planning, and finding surface boundaries in images. The award will allow the
University of California, Berkeley to expand its RobotWorld system, update its
LYMPH multiprocessor, and acquire a frame grabber and color camera to support
fast image acquisition and processing. University of California, Berkeley will
be purchasing manipulation and sensor and control processing equipment to
support research in robotics and computer vision. The equipment will include an
expansion of its RobotWorld system, an update to its LYMPH multiprocessor, and a
frame grabber and color camera.
