The proposal builds on early work in developing and deploying an on-line
credential service, MyProxy. MyProxy was created in 2000 to solve the problem of
credential delegation and was specifically targeted to support web portal
requirements. Grid entities, must be able to dynamically manage and select the
most appropriate security credentials in order to support or complete the
application or work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has a three-phased
approach to create the persistent credential management support needed for
production middleware. In the first phase, MyProxy will be redesigned to become
more robust. In the second phase, additional functional will be created, tested
and deployed to support multiple authentication mechanisms. In the third phase,
the middleware will be expanded to include Web Services and Open Grid Services
Architecture. Overall, the project expands Grid computing will contribute to the
national and international Grid infrastructure by making Grid computing more
secure and easier to use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
