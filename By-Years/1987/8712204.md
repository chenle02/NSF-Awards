Professor Wood is supported by the Physical Chemistry Program to study the
properties of aqueous solutions at temperatures up to 450 degrees C. These
measurements require the development of special instruments that can make
thermodynamic measurements at such extreme tempertures. Data will be obtained on
the densities, heat capacities, heats of dilution, and electrical conductivities
for a variety of aqueous solutions near the critical point of water. Since some
very abrupt changes in these properties occur, it is expected that these
measurements will help develop theories for understanding these unusual effects.
This experimental research program is providing important thermochemical data to
many fields, beyond chemistry. In particular the data to be obtained by
Professor Wood is expected to be of appreciable importance to geologists, steam-
power and chemical engineers. Such data are helpful to the understanding of
mineral geochemistry, corrosion of electric plant boilers, and the chemistry
involved in the production of geothermal power. Also, these measurements are
essential if one is to learn about the effects of solutes at low concentration
and will be useful to test modern theory.
