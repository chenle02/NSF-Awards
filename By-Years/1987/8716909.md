This is a one year conclusion of a large three year interdisciplinary field
study of the Chesapeake Bay and adjoining coastal area. During the initial
funding period, four scientific cruises collected a wealth of data on the
nutrient recycling and microbiology of this coupled estuarine - coastal system.
This work offers the most detailed picture yet of the role of marine bacteria
and phytoplankton in the assimilative capacity of a coastal region impacted by
large population centers. This funding will allow the collaborative scientists
to add additional results to their existing base, and produce scientific
publications integrating this novel collection of measurements in the coastal
environment.
