9319837 Frances This is a request for an Individual International Travel Grant
to visit several German Universities in February of 1994. The goals of the trip
are the following: (i) to discuss mutual exchanges of students between Purdue
School of Chemical Engineering and German Universities; and (ii) to discuss
research interactions between the universities. The ultimate target is to
involve U.S. undergraduate students for coursework or research, graduate
students for coursework or research, and post-doctoral students. U.S. students
are expected to benefit from the high level of chemistry and chemical
engineering education and research in German universities and from their strong
industry-university interactions. Moreover, students will acquire a better
international perspective and be better prepared for tackling globalization of
U.S. industry. A report will be provided to NSF. ***
