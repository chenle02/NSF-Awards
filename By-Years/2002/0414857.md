The purpose of this project is to develop effective techniques for visualizing
and interactively exploring large relational data. The project has three
integrated technical components: (1) data visualization, which focuses on
extending 3D grand tour and volume rendering techniques to render high
dimensional data cubes; (2) database support, which focuses on establishing a
solid foundation of data access and data aggregation to support interactive
exploration of data cubes; (3) data projection, which focuses on developing
robust and reliable techniques to project a manifold of data into low space such
that the intrinsic structure of the data are preserved. The methodology of this
project is to project data to low space and to visually explore the data by
using 3D rendering techniques on the multi-resolution high dimensional data
cubes. The data cubes are obtained by applying innovative data access techniques
to large relational data. The education component includes the development of a
new course, the development of a set of interactive online demos, and the
creation of a collection of real-world data exploration projects. Expected
results include techniques, algorithms and tools that are usable by researchers
and end-users. This project has applications in data mining, pattern
classification and information retrieval. &lt;br/&gt;
