9971137 Harrington This project deals with the structure of recursively
enumerable sets under inclusion, with emphasis on invariant sets and
automorphisms, and on definable sets with their corresponding finite back-and-
forth games. There is a natural interplay between the non-existence of certain
types of automorphisms and the existence of certain types of invariant sets.
This project will attempt to address some of the combinatorial difficulties
inherent in extending the current techniques for automorphisms to finite back-
and-forth arguments. This might help convert the invariant/automorphism
technology into a definable/non-definable technology, thus producing possibly
interesting definable sets. A recursively enumerable set is a set whose members
gain entry because a corresponding computation comes to a halt; thus the
recursively enumerable sets are examples of a phenomenon described over time (at
any given time one knows only the finite set of members whose computation has
already halted) but whose actual nature is timeless (a potential member is
either in or out---the computation either eventually halts or it never halts).
So the recursively enumerable sets provide an arena for studying the interplay
between the appearances in time of some thing and the timeless nature of that
same thing. The method used here is to presume, despite appearances, that two
things are actually `the same' in the sense that they can be identified via a
symmetry (automorphism). This either turns out to be the case, or the failure of
the attempt to produce the desired symmetry may (and often does) result in a
timeless describable property separating the two things and explaining why they
are truly different. This project also plans to use the above as an exemplar
towards understanding the pre-Socratic philosophers. ***
