9309926 Mantell The award is for the evaluation of current NDE techniques for
monitoring bonding in realtime during the in situ consolidation of fiber
reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites. The most promising one of these
methods will be selected for more detailed experimental evaluation. Bond quality
in composite specimens will be measured by the selected NDE method and by
mechanical testing, and the effectiveness and limitations of the selected
technique will be evaluated. It is expected that this research will lead to
effective closed loop process control and will ultimately result in reduced
manufacturing times, improve final part quality, and lower part costs for
thermoplastic composite parts. The technique developed here is expected to
become a key tool in the evaluation of thermoset composites as well.
