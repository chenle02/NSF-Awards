The focus of this research is the creation of new surface forms and the
determination of geometric and physical properties of surface. The full sweep
from constructive mathematics through algorithmic implementation in conjunction
with interactive computer graphics display of surfaces will be utilized. Both
three-dimensional and multi-dimensional surfaces will be considered. The
research activity performed by Barnhill and others will involve the study of
"surface" problems, where a "surface" is defined to be a function of two or more
variables. The study of graphics and visualization is of considerable importance
to a variety of users in the science and engineering community. Encouragement of
such activity is increasingly important as the computational technology becomes
more powerful and available.
