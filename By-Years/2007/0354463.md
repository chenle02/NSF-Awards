This is a U.S.-Bulgarian cooperative research project that will investigate the
possibilities of obtaining and modifying, in a controlled and reproducible way,
thin dielectric films containing various metal nanoclusters with a homogeneous
narrow cluster size distribution using magnetron co-sputtering. The principal
investigators are Dr. Mariana Sendova from the New College of Florida and Dr.
Marushka Sendova-Vassileva from the Central Laboratory for Solar Energy in
Bulgaria.

The objective of this research is to grow metal nano-clusters in various
dielectric matrices using existing sputtering and a pulsed laser. Such
nanocomposites have interesting optical and electro-optical properties which
will have potential in different types of optical devices. This research will
contribute new experimental data to the rapidly developing area of nanomaterials
and nanotechnology as it combines the advantages of magnetron co-sputtering
together with those of laser-assisted modification of thin films.

This project in mathematics research fulfills the program objectives of bringing
together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine
complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
