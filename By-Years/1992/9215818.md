Energy generation and transport in sub-micrometer electronic devices do not obey
continuum laws such Ohm's law and Fourier's law. It is proposed to study such
processes both theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical model considers
the electrons, optical phonons and acoustic phonons to be three thermodynamic
systems which exchange energy between themselves. The constitutive relations for
heat and particle fluxes are obtained from the Boltzmann transport equation.
With appropriate conservation laws the model will predict the temperatures of
electrons, optical phonons and acoustic phonons, as well as density of charge
carriers and electrical conductivity. The experimental effort will focus on
developing a new technique of nanometer-scale temperature measurement, making
use of the atomic force microscope. The measured temperatures will be compared
with theoretical predictions.
