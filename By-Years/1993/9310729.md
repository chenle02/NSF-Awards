The purpose of this "high-risk, high-payoff" research is to develop, and make
known to the research community, a new approach to modeling aging, degradation
and fracture of polymers. This will be accomplished by performing some
preliminary research using novel tools of geometry and analysis that are
evolving from the relatively new mathematical fields of fractals and fraction
calculus. The PI will attempt to formulate a new, encompassing field theory,
"fractal continuum mechanics," that can be used to bridge size scales in the
study of the mechanics," that can be used to bridge size scales in the study of
the mechanics of materials. This formulation will allow for the introduction of
morphological features at scales finer than the usual macroscale at which
ordinary machine and structural analysis and design takes place. It is necessary
to take such "micro" features into account in order to more thoroughly
understand (and, thereby, more precisely model) aging, degradation and fracture
of materials.
