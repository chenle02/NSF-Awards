The aim of this project is to understand the chemical basis of the venom that
very small marine snails use to paralyze much larger and faster prey. Like
scorpions and snakes, marine cone snails produce poison that is fast-acting and
lethal. This project entitled "Killer Snail: An Interactive Marine Biodiversity
Learning Tool" will educate young children on the diversity of venomous sea
organisms and the important role they play in marine ecosystems. "Killer Snail"
is a two-part product: an eBook dramatic story told from a snail's point of
view, and a mobile video game allowing players to experience and explore the
life of marine snails. The project targets students grades 2 to 5 and will
showcase the rich biodiversity of marine organisms. The story and game will also
demonstrate concepts and values of sharing, altruism, diversity, planning and
other life skills. Predator-prey interaction of marine snails and bioluminescent
worms will illustrate an ecosystem not unlike childhood, a time when
interactions with others, some of whom are dangerous, can be barriers to
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are relatively few eBooks or mobile
games about marine organisms. The market is, thus, ready for marine biology
learning tools that are informative, fun, and visually stimulating. Engaging
stories can boost learning. Similar to Aesop's fables or Grimm's fairy tales,
"Killer Snail: The eBook" will be allegorical, conveying important life lessons,
such as dealing with predators and avoiding danger. "Killer Snail: The Game"
will highlight planning a scientific expedition, from choosing a location, to
how much air one needs in one's dive tank. Both story and game will be
immersive, allowing readers and players to learn about different snail species
(cultural diversity), snail hunting strategies (tool usage), and cost benefit
scenarios (planning). "Killer Snail" will be a vicarious adventure, built on
interactivity, based on compelling visual imagery and age/development-
appropriate concepts?all designed to peak the interest of students. The project
should find a large audience by appealing to the interests of students,
educators, parents, and scientists in the media formats they most enjoy.
