This grant to the University of Notre Dame provides funds for replacement of
the tandem Van de Graaff accelerator voltage grading resistors. The new
resistors will provide more linear voltage grading in the accelerator so that
the acceleration tubes are subjected to more uniform electrostatic stress.
