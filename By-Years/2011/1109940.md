This project will continue an ongoing program of astrometric (positional)
observations of Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). Astrometric follow-up of new
observations is essential in order to determine orbits and recover the objects
at future observing opportunities; over 60% of NEAs newly discovered in 2008 and
2009 were subsequently lost due to the lack of adequate follow-up. The Principal
Investigator and students supported by this project will perform astrometric
measurements using the University of Hawaii 2.24-meter telescope and other
telescopes on Mauna Kea. The telescopes and specialized techniques used enable
this team to observe fainter objects, with greater positional accuracy, and with
better access to the south celestial hemisphere than other groups. They will
adapt the newest and most accurate astrometric reference catalog, the PPMXL
catalog, for use in NEA astrometry and provide this customized catalog to the
community. Improvements will be made to their data processing pipeline to speed
the process and enable more positional measurements per object. Finally, the
group will plan and carry out measurements of physical characteristics,
including shapes, albedos and colors, of selected objects that are possible
candidates for human exploration. Accurate NEA astrometry is most critical for
the tracking of potentially hazardous asteroids that could collide with Earth;
the project thus has broad impacts on impacts. This has implications for Earth-
science questions, such as how Earth acquired its water, as well on strategies
for mitigating the impact hazard. The project will educate graduate students in
observational techniques and in Solar System dynamics; these students, in turn,
will have the opportunity to mentor high school students in using the Falukes
educational telescope on Haleakala for asteroid research.
