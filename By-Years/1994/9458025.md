9458025 Wooley A new approach towards the synthesis of uniquely functionalized
macromolecular architectures will be undertaken. Micellization effects will be
employed to organize amphiphilic block copolymers, containing crosslinkable
sites in one of the blocks, into a desired conformational arrangement, which may
be permanently fixed through intramicellar crosslinking of the block copolymer
micelles. %%% ***
