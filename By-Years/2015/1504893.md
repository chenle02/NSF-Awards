Knowing the benefit of active learning is a major issue for faculty teaching
undergraduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM). The importance of increasing student knowledge, retention, and
graduation in STEM has become a national concern in regards to maintaining
global competitiveness in the STEM workforce. By examining the use of monolog
and dialog based videos for instruction in STEM, this mixed-methods
(quantitative and qualitative data collection) research study investigates
student achievement in relation to students' interest/enjoyment and
effort/importance and provides a more complex understanding of active learning.
Such inquiries that move beyond laboratory settings and extend to real classroom
contexts are particularly warranted. The results from this project could have
compelling implications for developing digital materials to facilitate STEM
learning. Moreover, as faculty seek new ways to deliver content to students,
this study informs the ways in which that content can be
delivered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are (1) to test these
novel instructional video formats that merge out-of-classroom assignments with
active learning in an authentic college science classroom and (2) to seek an
explanation for the influence of monolog and dialog conditions on learning and
how these formats mediate student achievement. The research consists of a cross-
over design that varies video type (dialog vs monolog video) and counterbalances
the presentation conditions of course topics. Analysis of the data consists of
first conducting dependent samples t-tests to determine if data from similar
viewing conditions (monolog or dialog) can be combined from different points in
time. A series of analysis of covariance steps will then be conducted to look
for a main effect of the monolog or dialog videos on student achievement
measures. Multiple regression analyses will be conducted to determine the
relations between video viewing time, survey variables, and student learning.
