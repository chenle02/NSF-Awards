9224783 Hardwick This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
award. This project is designing and building a prototype archive and version
control system that facilitates concurrent engineering by allowing engineers to
coordinate concurrent changes to a design. The system permits engineers to merge
concurrent changes, find conflicts between concurrent changes, ask questions
about the contents of changes and designs, and resolve conflicts between design
versions produced by concurrent changes. The system models the contents of a
design using the EXPRESS language of the STEP standard for the exchange of
engineering product data. The EXPRESS schemas are managed by the archive and
version control system in addition to the design versions themselves so that the
various tools of the system have access to both the data and its schemas. The
system will significantly advance the data management infrastructure for
concurrent engineering and manufacturing by supporting collaborations between
engineers as they concurrently work on the design of products. ***
