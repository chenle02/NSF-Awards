This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in a week-long
conference on function spaces at Southern Illinois University on May 17 to May
22, 2010. This is the 6th conference in a series focused on the areas of
function algebras, spaces and algebras of analytic functions, Lp-spaces,
geometry of Banach spaces and related topics. Much of the funding will be
directed to young mathematicians (i.e., postdocs, graduate students, junior
faculty) who do not have their own support.

The goal of the conference is to foster awareness and enable interaction on
current activity in the broad area of function spaces. This is a conference on
an active area of research in analysis. The conference will also provide an
opportunity for junior researchers to learn and interact with established
researchers.
