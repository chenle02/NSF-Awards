Sperm-female coevolution: mechanisms, models and theoretical
implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work has demonstrated that the shapes
of sperm and of the female&lt;br/&gt;reproductive tract evolve in concert. This
pattern is attributable to a&lt;br/&gt;process known as female "sperm choice,"
with female reproductive&lt;br/&gt;tract characteristics producing a bias in
patterns of paternity when&lt;br/&gt;females mate with multiple males, such as
biasing fertilization in favor of&lt;br/&gt;longer sperm. Research proposed here
will investigate (1) physiological&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of female sperm choice,
(2) possible benefits to&lt;br/&gt;females of having the ability to
"discriminate" among sperm variants, (3)&lt;br/&gt;costs and benefits to males
of variation in traits that contribute to&lt;br/&gt;fertilization success, and
(4) implications of producing few,&lt;br/&gt;large sperm for sex difference
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disparity between the sexes in the size of their
sex cells is believed to&lt;br/&gt;be the cornerstone of all sex differences
(e.g., body size, aggressiveness,&lt;br/&gt;ornamentation). However, contrary to
popular belief, males of all species&lt;br/&gt;do not produce many tiny sperm.
In fact, sperm cells are the most diverse&lt;br/&gt;cell type: in nearly all
animal groups, they evolve in size, shape, and&lt;br/&gt;structure so rapidly
that even closely related species can usually be&lt;br/&gt;discriminated by
their sperm. Because having the correct species-specific&lt;br/&gt;sperm
structure is pivotal for successful reproduction, sperm divergence&lt;br/&gt;may
function as an "engine of speciation." Understanding the causes
of&lt;br/&gt;sperm evolution is thus important to our understanding of the
biological&lt;br/&gt;basis of sex differences and of the process of
speciation.&lt;br/&gt;
