The study will investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of phase transitions in
mantle materials at high pressures and temperatures using using a special high
pressure apparatus designed to apply a controlled shear stress to the sample
while at high pressure and temperature. The sample will be examined by optical
microscope, in situ x-ray diffraction at high pressures and temperatures using
synchrotron radiation, and post mortem electron microscope and microprobe
analyses. Experimental information on the dynamic behavior of mantle materials
at pressures and temperatures that exist within the transition zone of the
mantle will be very valuable for understanding the origin and nature of deep
focus earthquakes.
