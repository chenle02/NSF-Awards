9733588 Tian This research project combines software reliability engineering and
software measurement to develop an integrated approach to early measurement and
improvement of software reliability. Key research activities include: 1)
Integrating research findings in software reliability engineering and software
measurement to assess and improve software quality over extended development
phases and application domains. 2) Developing analysis techniques and tools to
effectively analyze diverse measurement data. 3) Practical implementation of
this integrated approach and adaptation of it to a wide variety of software
development environments in collaboration with several industrial partners. (4)
Developing or enhancing several graduate and undergraduate level courses in
software engineering and computer science. The key benefits of this research
project include: (1) a systematic technique to measure software quality early in
development and to identify early problems for effective quality improvement,
(2) construction of support tools that can help the implementation and
deployment of these techniques in industry, and (3) educational opportunities
for students to work on leading edge research projects that solve practical
problems. ***
