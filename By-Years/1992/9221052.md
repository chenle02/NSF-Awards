This research is being conducted by Dr. David M. Hillis, a molecular biologist
from the University of Texas. Dr. Hillis is well known for his studies relating
to DNA sequence analysis. The current research is a natural extension of Dr.
Hillis' past work and represents a major innovation, linking the utilization of
parallel computers with a need for the development of more efficient software
for analyzing the increasing amount of nucleotide sequence data. Software for
DNA sequence analysis is being modified and developed for massively parallel
computers in an effort to increase computation speed and enhance the assessment
of available computer algorithms. Supercomputer manufacturers are currently
emphasizing massively parallel architecture, and even smaller highly parallel
computers are under production and/or developed. The development of software for
biological analysis will contribute to both the scientific community and the
newly emerging parallel computer industry.
