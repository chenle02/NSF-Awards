The nature of the shallow oceanic crust produced at seafloor spreading centers
is poorly constrained by available geophysical data. Recent studies suggest that
the shallowest layers of the crust are characterized by extremely low seismic
velocities, but that the velocity increases rapidly with depth. Understanding
the processes that control these variations are important in determining the
porosity of the crust, alteration of crustal rock, and the local and regional
significance of crustal drilling data. The present award will support Dr.
Fryer's participation in a near bottom refraction study of a segment of the East
Pacific Rise in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The project will allow a
detailed study of the shallow crust by using both a receiver and acoustic source
deployed at the seafloor. This technique will provide a higher resolution study
than is available from normal surface ship observations. Dr. Purdy of Woods Hole
has responsibility for obtaining the field data. Dr. Fryer will be involved in
analysis of the data from the experiment which will be compared to drilling
results planned along this same section of ridge. The principal investigators on
this project have distinguished records in both experimental and theoretical
analysis of crustal data.
