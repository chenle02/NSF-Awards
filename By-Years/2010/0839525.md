This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project deals with improving the
long-term durability of fuel cells. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel
cells offer a potential environmentally friendly source of power but performance
improvements are required before costs justify more widespread adoption of this
technology. This project focuses on the improvement of long-term performance of
platinum or other noble metal based catalysts for fuel cells. Loss of active
platinum surface area during the course of operation is one of the major reasons
for performance degradation. To counteract this loss of active metal area our
approach provides a unique method to stabilize the catalyst via modification of
the carbon support. New technology from ceramics, the electronics industry and
catalysis are combined to develop new support materials which are much more
resistant to degradation. Lessons learned in improving the resistance to
catalyst deactivation are applicable to catalysts in this study and to any
future fuel cell catalyst that uses carbon as a support.

The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project is to improve the
degradation resistance of PEM fuel cells. Fuel cells offer an opportunity to
provide a clean source of energy, a world-wide concern. Performance improvements
are required before the costs of fuel cells make them economically viable. The
catalyst electrode is by far the major cost in a fuel cell stack, so improving
its productivity is crucial. This project provides a method of preventing, or
slowing, the loss of platinum surface area during fuel operation thus improving
its long-term performance. This project complements the work reported by others
in developing catalyst systems with higher initial activity. Both approaches are
critical in providing economical fuel cells. In terms of overall costs,
increasing the catalyst lifetime by two to four fold is equivalent to cutting
the platinum costs by at least a factor of two to four. The technology developed
in this project is not only applicable to any fuel cell system but to other
industrial processes that use carbon catalysts. Carbon supported catalysts are
used as commercially important oxidation catalysts. Development of materials
more resistant to oxidation and sintering could provide additional benefits to
these processes as well.
