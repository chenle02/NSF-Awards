This award provides funds to establish an interdisciplinary site REU program in
Neuroscience at the University of Illinois Neural and Behavioral Biology (NBB)
Program, a Ph.D. granting interdisciplinary program begun in 1970. The common
focus is neuroscience, the interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the
function of nerve cells and systems from the molecular and cellular levels to
that of behavior. Faculty in the program that demonstrate an extensive history
of involvement of undergraduate in laboratory research have been selected as co-
Principal Investigators. Collectively, faculty in NBB have sent about 75
undergraduates who worked with them into scientific careers, including faculty
positions at Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Stanford, and Pennsylvania. Even greater
numbers have gone on to careers in Medicine and other professional Doctorate-
level fields. Neuroscience subfields in which research experience will be
offered included behavioral neuroscience, neural development and plasticity,
molecular, cellular and genetic neuroscience, neurophysiology, neuroanatomy,
computational neuroscience, and cognitive neuroscience.
