*** 9760645 Chow This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project
utilizes bandgap-engineered photon detection for high performance ambient
temperature thermal imaging for a variety of industrial applications such as
nondestructive testing, quality control, and process optimization. Although
thermal detectors such as micro-bolometers have seen rapid progress in
performance and cost reduction, they are limited by low detectivity, sluggish
response time, and spectral non-specifivity. Fast IR imaging is difficult to
achieve. Indium arsenic antimonide (InAs1-xSbx), grown by molecular beam
epitaxy, , will be used as the basic photodiode material. The design suppresses
Auger noise to achieve much higher detectivity. In similar material systems high
detectivity has been found that is greater than commercial thermal detectors by
an order of magnitude. Phase I will emphasize material fabrication and
feasibility demonstration of uncooled operation. Phase II would optimize the
device structure and fabricate two-dimensional imaging arrays. Uncooled IR
imaging arrays are expected to have commercial applications in nondestructive
testing, medical diagnostics, industrial process control, navigation, and
pollution monitoring. Reduced fabrication and operating costs may expand
commercial markets significantly. ***
