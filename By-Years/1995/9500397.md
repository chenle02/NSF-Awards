The focus of this research is the use of silacyclobutane based reagents and
chiral Lewis bases. The common theme is the pursuit of hexacoordinate silicon
species as organizational nodes for bringing together combinations of
nucleophile, electrophile and chiral catalyst for asymmetric transformations.
Enoxysilacyclobutanes will be used to promote aldol, Michael, Henry and Abramov
reactions and silacyclobutanes will be used in a broad range of organosilicon
transformations. Another part of the research focuses on ligand-accelerated
catalysis by the use of trichlorosilyl-based reagents. With this accomplishment
based renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of
Dr. Scott E. Denmark of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Illinois. Professor Denmark will focus his work on developing new methodology
for catalytic, asymmetric transformations. The research will involve
organosilicon compounds and chiral Lewis bases that possess hexacoordinate
silicon species as the key component.
