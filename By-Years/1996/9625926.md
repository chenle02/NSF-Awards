9625926 Mann This project deals with passively minimizing sound radiation from
composite structures via the use of embedded material variations and integrated
stiffners. An innovative methodology is developed to investigate the sensitivity
of the radiated sound power to material and spatial variations so that designs
may be optimized to possess minimal sensitivity to fabrication variability. The
spatial variations are envisioned as thickness build-ups, which may additionally
serve as structural stiffners. For these build- ups, analytical capabilities are
developed to determine the effective stiffness and damping properties for input
into a numerical model. The numerical model allows for variations in material
properties over individual elements, thus reducing computational mesh size.
Structural beams, designed to reduce sound radiation, are fabricated and tested
to verify modeling methodology. The research effort provides a foundation for
designing composite structures which exhibit high stiffness-to-weight and
strength-to-weight ratios as well as low sound radiation.***
