The 10th International Conference on the Cell and Molecular Biology of
Chlamydomonas will be held in Vancouver, B.C., Canada on June 11-16, 2002. The
biennial Chlamydomonas meetings bring together a highly interactive and
collaborative community of approximately 200 researchers from Europe, Asia,
Australia and North America. The international nature of this relatively small
group of scientists has proven invaluable in the development of Chlamydomonas as
the model organism of choice for many fundamental biological problems, including
flagellar and basal body function and assembly, organelle biosynthesis and its
nuclear/organelle control, gametic differentiation and life-cycle progression,
photosynthesis and phototaxis. This award provides travel funds to enable
invited speakers, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to attend the
meeting in Vancouver.
