The research objective of this award is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
the ion beam interactions with the bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) and the impacts
of ion implantation on the surface bioactivity of BMGs. The research will (i)
identify the key processes and variables for ion implantation towards bioactive
BMGs, (ii) investigate the effects of ion implantation on both surface and
electrochemical properties of BMGs, and (iii) study the biological activity of
ion implanted BMGs, with a special focus relevant to the orthopedic applications
of BMGs. These efforts will not only further our understanding of BMG-ion beam
interactions, but also propel the advancement of BMGs as biomedical materials to
address some of the unmet challenges in the orthopedic field, such as the bone
tissue integration of implants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results
of this research will provide an opportunity to create new functional and
bioactive materials that are capable of forming direct biological bonding with
cells through surface interactions. The results will be disseminated to enhance
the scientific and technological understanding of BMGs, and to broaden BMG
applications into biocompatible materials, which could potentially impact human
health. The research will provide a unique opportunity for the PIs to educate
and train graduate and undergraduate students in multidisciplinary areas of
research, science, and engineering. Planned outreach activities include summer
research program for teachers and pre-collegiate students to gain first-hand
laboratory experience, and showcase of research endeavors at the interface of
materials and biology in regional schools and local science museum.
