9314430 Beck This U.S.-Chile award will support a research collaboration between
Dr. Susan L. Beck of the University of Arizona and Dr. Sergio E. Barrientos of
the University of Chile. The researchers will analyze historic earthquake
seismograms from events between 1920 and 1963 along the Chilean subduction zone.
They will use modern waveform methods to determine earthquake source parameters
and will evaluate seismic cycles of the underthrusting and normal fault
earthquakes along the coast of Chile. The study will include detailed analyses
of earlier historic earthquakes. The Chilean subduction zone segment of the
Nazca South American plate boundary has failed repeatedly in large earthquakes.
To better assess future earthquake hazards along this plate boundary, more
information about previous earthquakes is needed. Since this type of tectonics
has parallels in areas of the U.S. and its territories, the proposed study may
lead to increased understanding of U.S. earthquakes hazard. ***
