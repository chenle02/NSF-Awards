Infections with some plant-pathogenic viruses not only make the host plants more
attractive for aphids, but also increase the rate of aphid growth and
reproduction. This may represent active manipulation of plant metabolism by
viruses, which rely on insects for their transmission from one plant to another.
However, although numerous studies have demonstrated altered aphid growth on
virus-infected plants, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that
underlie this phenomenon. Research using Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis),
Myzus persicae (peach-potato aphid), and Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) as a model
system will be used to study the molecular biology of plant-aphid-virus
interactions. Preliminary results show that Arabidopsis defense responses, which
are normally turned on when aphids initiate feeding, are reduced in TuMV-
infected plants. Further research will be directed at measuring virus-induced
changes in plant metabolisms, identifying plant defense pathways that are
manipulated by TuMV, and determining which of the eleven TuMV genes are required
for shutting down anti-aphid defenses in Arabidopsis and other plant
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TuMV, which is commonly transmitted by green peach
aphids, is a serious pathogen of vegetable crops. Virus control in agricultural
systems is complicated by the propensity of peach-potato aphids to develop
insecticide resistance, as well as TuMV reservoirs in Arabidopsis and other weed
species. Research on the interactions of Arabidopsis, peach-potato aphids, and
TuMV interactions, will identify previously unknown aspects of plant metabolism
that contribute to aphid attraction and reproduction. Such information can be
used to improve the insect and virus resistance of crop plants through classical
breeding and transgenic approaches. The proposed project also will contribute to
training a new generation of students in plant molecular biology, biochemistry,
and genetics. These students will be well-prepared for future careers in the
plant biotechnology industry, academia, or government service.
