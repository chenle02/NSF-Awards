This proposal is concerned with the restoration of service in a power system
that has lost some or all of its load. In a blackout or brownout situation, the
system may separate into separate islands and it is necessary to first restore
the load within the islands and then restore the interconnections among the
islands. The restoration is proposed to be done with a hierarchical multi-layer
approach consisting of a direct control layer, an optimizing layer, and an
adaptive layer. The focus here is on the last two layers with the problem
formulated as a multi-stage multi-objective sequential decision problem. The
problem of power system restoration after a blackout is an important one but has
been very difficult to formulate in a rigorous mathematical way. A new
formulation is to be developed in this approach. Any success at better
restoration techniques will lead to shorter periods of power outages.
