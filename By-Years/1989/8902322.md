This conference will bring together key high level decision makers from
organizations that sponsor and conduct manufacturing research to enable them to
identify redundancies in effort, as well as unattended needs. The critical
parameters that define manufacturing research will be presented by
representatives from academia, industry, and government. These issues will be
further discussed and debated by eminent panelists. This conference will build
on previous initiatives, and will become a first step in several new
programmatic thrusts to enhance the U.S. manufacturing research infrastructure.
