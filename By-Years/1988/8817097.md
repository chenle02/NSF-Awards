Phase transformations in mantle minerals at high pressures and temperatures
play a major role in the static and dynamic processes of the Earth's interior,
especially in the transition zone from the upper to the lower mantle at depths
between 350 and 700 km. This action provides funds for support of research
focused on two projects to study the properties and processes associated with
these polymorphic phase transformations (1) Pressure dependence of the elastic
properties of high-pressure phases; and (2) kinetics and mechanisms of phase
transformations. These experiments will be the large-volume, high-pressure
facilities of the Stony Brook High Pressure Laboratory.
