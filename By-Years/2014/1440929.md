The goal of this project is to investigate the reliability, robustness, and
computationally efficiency of digital audio forensic methods under various
adversarial conditions, e.g., lossy compression attack. We aim to identify and
develop mathematical tools for modeling and characterizing of microphone
nonlinearities (fingerprints), statistical methods for acoustic environment
estimation, and system identification based framework for linking an acquisition
device to the audio recording. More specifically, the project uses statistical
modeling and extraction of microphone fingerprints by developing computationally
efficient algorithms for nonlinear system identification and acoustic
environment modeling and extraction using nonlinear filtering, and use them for
linking a given recording to the acquisition device and to the acoustic
environment. The algorithms developed through this project holds the potential
for immediate effect in the area of digital audio forensic analysis,
particularly in forensic analysis in compressed domain.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed techniques will be evaluated for robustness,
reliability, and computational complexity using datasets collected during this
exploratory investigation and datasets available in the public domain. The
expected outcomes also include datasets for performance evaluation of audio
forensic methods and audio forensics tools robust to targeted attacks. The
findings of this research, resulting audio forensic tools, and datasets will be
made available to the research community via project webpage.
