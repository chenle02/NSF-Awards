#1351936&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Guohua Cao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses
contemporary challenges in atherosclerotic plaque imaging of small animals using
state-of-the-art hardware components and modern reconstruction techniques,
pushes a new frontier of biomedical imaging, and promotes new preclinical
applications in mouse models. By synergistically integrating three separately
developed components CNT source, Medipix detector, and interior tomography into
a novel interior 5D micro-CT system, the resulted whole system is much more than
the sum of the components. The system will provide significantly higher spatial
and contrast resolution, finer temporal resolution, and lower radiation dose
than the state-of-the-art micro-CT. It will transform the method for studying
cardiovascular diseases in mice and rats, make a significant impact on
atherosclerosis research through facilitating basic mechanistic studies in mice
and advancing our knowledge on pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and has
potential in clinical assessment of vulnerable plaques.
