This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist at Northern
Illinois University, studying agricultural change in Indonesia. The investigator
will study the changes in agricultural practices and rituals in an indigenous
society in eastern Indonesia. The hypothesis to be tested is that the villagers,
who combine cash-cropping with modern technologies with traditional swidden
cultivation, will differentiate in their agricultural rituals as well. The
project will see whether the traditional rituals will be restricted to the
traditional agricultural regimes, or whether they will be modified to adapt to
the contemporary varieties. This research is important because it advances our
understanding of agricultural change in this important area of the world. By
detailed study of how farmers retain or modify traditional rituals to give
meaning to their changed agricultural practices, the project will provide
valuable information for planners to use to encourage new adoptions of more
high-yielding food sources.
