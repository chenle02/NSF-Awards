Much research in recent years has centered on the modeling and analysis of
mechanisms where flexibility of components is an issue. Such systems are
referred to as elastodynamic mechanisms. Previous efforts have been based on
either the finite element approach or on the transfer matrix approach. This
project combines the two into a hybrid approach in an attempt to develop more
accurate and efficient methods for elastodynamic mechanism analysis. The
research is a step in the direction to better understanding of
mechanismflexibility effects. It may contribute to understanding higher order
acceleration effects and rigid body dynamics and elastic deformation coupling;
better analysis accuracy is also likely to result.
