The research involves the study of hydrogen atoms in the MOCVD growth process
and is highly innovative. Because of its strong relation to materials, only
"bridging" support can be recommended until the PI submits a proposal that
addresses issues of common interest to the Lightwave Technology Program and DMR.
The work has already attracted the interest of ATT Bell Labs and could have
important impact on layer growth. //
