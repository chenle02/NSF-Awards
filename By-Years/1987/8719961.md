This project provides partial funding for an automated, multi-collector,
solid.source thermal ionization mass spectrometer to be installed at the
University of California at Santa Cruz. The mass spectrometer will be used
primarily by researchers in the Earth Sciences Board at the University and will
form part of a multi-user isotope geochemistry laboratory toward which the
University has contributed rooms for the equipment, 50% cost- sharing on the
cost of the equipment itself, and hired a full.time technician to aid in the
operation and maintenance of the laboratory equipment. Research topics that will
be investigated on the new instrument include: isotopic constraints on the
evolution of the Earth's mantle and Pre.Cambrian crust, marine biogeochemistry
of lead, and a study of rare-earth element distributions in minerals.
