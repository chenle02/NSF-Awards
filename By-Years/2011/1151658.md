With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the
research of Professors Michael W. Crowder and David L. Tierney of Miami
University. Professors Crowder and Tierney will probe molecular motions in
enzymes during catalysis using rapid freeze quench double electron-electron
resonance (RFQ-DEER) spectroscopy. Enzymes are not static biomolecules; rather,
the catalytic activities of most enzymes require highly coordinated motions of
loops, helices, and other structural features of the enzymes for the biochemical
reactions to proceed. While there are a number of techniques already available
to probe enzyme motions, many of these techniques require large quantities of
enzyme and large assumptions to interpret the data. The technique to be
optimized in this work is amenable to conditions of low enzyme concentration.
The methodology developed in these proposed studies will address important
issues that affect how applicable the technique will be to other systems, such
as (1) determining the range of reaction times that can be reliably interrogated
with this technique, (2) exploring varying spin labels to ascertain which work
best for this technique, (3) optimizing the RFQ process for the collection of
samples for Q-band DEER, and (4) developing methods to handle multi-subunit
proteins. The Broader Impacts of this project include training of undergraduate
and graduate students in enzymology, modern EPR spectroscopy, and molecular
biology. If successful, the proposed methodology could find broader scientific
impact in the evaluation of enzyme motions during catalysis across a significant
range of enzyme systems. The investigtors will continue their involvement in
community outreach, such as hosting an annual Science Week for elementary school
children and making presentations on antibiotic resistance to local non-science
audiences.
