9400907 Miller Computational aspects of proofs systems may be generally divided
into two kinds. In what may be broadly called functional programming,
computation is seen as term reduction corresponding to proof reduction (i.e., to
the process of cut elimination). On the other hand, in what may be broadly
called logic programming, computation is expressed by goal directed, cut free
proof search in certain formal theories. This characterization of the logic
programming paradigm is based on Miller's and Scedrov's earlier joint work. The
proposed research is aimed at understanding the proof systems arising from
linear logic, their computational and descriptive powers, and their semantics by
means of interactive protocols. Game-theoretic notions, such as interactive
protocols, should contribute to the understanding of "fine structure" of both
semantics and computational expressiveness of linear logic. In the logic
programming setting, such proof systems provide primitives for handling contexts
and communications among resources. A proposed specification language based on
this style of proof system can be used to declaratively and naturally specify
such aspects of computation as side-effects, communications, and continuations.
