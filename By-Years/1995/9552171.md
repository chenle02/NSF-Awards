This project leads to a series of laboratory modules that, as a whole, compose a
laboratory for physics majors, but individually are appropriate for courses in
chemistry and astronomy. Each module is being built upon an experiment that
determines a fundamental constant or important physical constant. The
experiments are clearly distinct from the traditional chemistry or astronomy
experiments both in the nature of the information sought and, in many cases, by
the techniques and processes used. They do, however, serve as an integral part
of these courses. In each case, the goal is to emphasize the role that physics
plays in the discipline it supports while simultaneously identifying it as a
distinct discipline. The educational goals of the experiment are to (1) have
students appreciate the relevance of the supporting physics experiment since it
is carried out within the related nonphysics course; (2) maximize the number of
students that are exposed to landmark physics experiments; and (3) increase the
student's appreciation of the distinctive nature of physics as a discipline. The
experiments are designed to (1) be carried out with only computer-aided
instruction; (2) use computer interfaces to allow for high- precision work and
to support calculations; and (3) measure fundamental constants that have a
direct impact on the associated course.
