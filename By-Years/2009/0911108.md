The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
supports the research program of Prof. Linda McGown of Rensselaer Polytechnique
Institute. Prof. McGown and her students will study the processes that govern
affinity protein capture at aptamer-modified surfaces using affinity MALDI mass
spectrometry in combination with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy
and imaging, and will apply the knowledge gained to enable the design of
improved aptamers. The proposed study has the potential to greatly impact the
field of aptamer design and facilitate the use of aptamers as recognition
components in a wide range of chemical and biological applications. The project
will provide excellent training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate
students in a highly interdisciplinary area at the chemical biology interface.
Prof. McGown and her students will also participate in the Science Technology
Entry Program (STEP) at RPI, which aims to attract and retain high school
students from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups in science
and engineering fields.
