The goal of the program is to develop research activities in the design of
neural network structures in the implementation of distributed processing of
stochastic data, dictated by statistical techniques. The processing is to be
directed at the basic operations common to communications, information, and
decision oriented system: detection or hypothesis testing and parameter
estimation. Probability of error, generalized Chernoff bounds and related
parameters will be used as performance criteria. Establishment of a group of
researchers in this area is a secondary goal.
