Detecting a change in the type of relationship modelled in regression form is
accompanied by the need for inference about the point at which the change
occurs. This research will examine statistical tests and their properties and
will construct confidence regions for change points, concentrating on two-phase
multiple regression. Approximate distributions for test statistics will be
generated, power functions will be estimated, robustness will be considered
theoretically and numerically, and an alternative estimator will be defined
using a neural network algorithm.
