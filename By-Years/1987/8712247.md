Isotopic compositions of lead will be measured in different sized particles
collected on stages of cascade impactor samples of air which have already been
collected in the South Pacific and North Pacific westerlies as part of the
SEAREX Program. These data will be combined with SEAREX data for lead, salt and
dust concentrations measured in rain, air, and sea water samples associate with
the impactor samples to provide a reliable explanatory model for enrichment of
lead in sea salts and will furnish trustworthy estimates of magnitures of
recycled eolian lead fluxes entering the oceans.
