Valencia Community College requests support from NSF for connection to ICI.
This grant will be used to help six campuses get access to the Internet. The six
sites are East Branch Campus, Osceola Branch Campus, West (Main) Campus,
Downtown Center, McCoy Center, and West Park Campus. ICI, a midlevel network in
Florida, will provide operations management and information services and it will
give the college access to the Internet, a collection of interoperable networks
connecting most research and education organizations in the United States. The
Valencia Community College campuses need the Internet connections to be able to
access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of the Valencia Community
College system as well as the community in general.
