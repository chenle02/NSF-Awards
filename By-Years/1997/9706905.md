Abstract 9706905 Richter Richter and Sundberg will investigate the structure of
the invariant subspace lattices of bounded analytic functions acting as
multiplication operators on Banach or Hilbert spaces of analytic functions. The
knowledge about the invariant subspaces of the unilateral shift (i.e.
multiplication by z on the Hardy space of the unit disc) has been used via
dilation and model theory to enhance our knowledge about contraction operators
on Hilbert spaces. The spaces that will be considered include the Dirichlet and
Bergman spaces of the unit disc. The operator theoretic questions that arise are
naturally related to questions from classical analysis, such as questions about
zero sets and sets of uniqueness. The study of linear operators acting on
Hilbert spaces can be viewed as an extension of linear algebra to an infinite
dimensional setting. It has historical origins and applications in such fields
as partial differential equations, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics. The
work of Richter and Sundberg is concerned with certain natural models for such
operators. It is expected that a study of these models will yield insight into
general structural properties of Hilbert space operators.
