Recently, organizational ecologists have studied the forces of competition and
legitimation by analyzing organization's founding and failure rates. At the same
time, economists have studied how forces of competition shape organizational
size distributions. The proposed research will integrate these two perspectives
by determining whether size gives organizations competitive advantages that
decrease their chances of failure and increase their changes of growth. The
study will also address whether changes in founding and failure rates cause
changes in the level of resources available for organizational growth. Finally,
the proposed research investigates how historical events have shaped processes
of competition and legitimation. Data on banks in Manhattan will be used.
