Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD's) have found widespread use in synthesis, formal
verification and testing of digital circuits. This success in the EDA research
area has spawned research efforts on a number of fronts, including theoretical
studies of algorithms and complexity, applications to such areas as artificial
intelligence and logic programming, and extensions beyond Boolean functions to
represent matrices, Markov systems, and multi-variate polynomials. This workshop
(February 13-17, 1995) is the first ever held specifically on this important
technology.
