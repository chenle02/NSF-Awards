A member of the group of S-type lectins, variously known as CBP35, Mac-2,
Laminin-Binding Protein, L-34, RL-29, etc., has been shown to reside in the
nucleus of mammalian cells. This protein was shown some years ago to be
associated with a ribonucleoprotein complex which was identified as hnRNP. Pilot
experiments will be performed to address the possibility that the lectin is
involved in splicing of nuclear pre mRNA. The idea that a galactoside-binding
lectin is involved in the splicing of pre mRNA is a highly speculative one, for
which presently available evidence is thin. If the proposed preliminary
experiments provide further support for the hypothesis, the results would
substantially alter current thinking in the areas of intracellular lectins and
RNA processing.
