Luo&lt;br/&gt; The imvestigator studies conditions under which
certain&lt;br/&gt;convex cones can be represented or approximated by linear
images&lt;br/&gt;of the positive semidefinite matrix cone. These conditions
are&lt;br/&gt;the essential tools for the exact finite reformulation
of&lt;br/&gt;semi-infinite constraints arising from robust optimization.
The&lt;br/&gt;project focusses on cones of nonnegative mappings
and&lt;br/&gt;applications to robust optimization, analysis of interior
point&lt;br/&gt;methods for adaptive filtering and robust beamforming,
and&lt;br/&gt;efficient optimization methods for the design and analysis
of&lt;br/&gt;multi-user communication systems and for decoding and
detection&lt;br/&gt;in multi-input-multi-output wireless communication channels.
The&lt;br/&gt;theoretical issues are all strongly motivated by the need
to&lt;br/&gt;develop efficient optimization algorithms for problems in
signal&lt;br/&gt;processing and digital communication systems.&lt;br/&gt; The
project aims at developing new computational techniques&lt;br/&gt;to solve
problems in the information and communication technology&lt;br/&gt;area. The
latter area has, over the last thirty years, been&lt;br/&gt;relying mostly on
traditional numerical optimization methods,&lt;br/&gt;which can run into
difficulty when the problem size becomes large&lt;br/&gt;or when data rate is
high. In this project, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies ways to use state-of-
the-art optimization techniques and&lt;br/&gt;computational tools to resolve
some well-known computational&lt;br/&gt;bottlenecks from the information and
communication technology&lt;br/&gt;area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
