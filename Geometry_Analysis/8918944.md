The two investigators will study Kleinian groups on 3- manifolds and their
related cohomology. Maskit's cohomological classification of geometrically
finite Kleinian groups will be further studied. Sullivan and Marden's theory of
stable Kleinian groups will be analyzed using Gardiner and Kra's cohomological
conditions. The investigators will also institute a year honors course for two
students to prepare them for graduate study of Kleinian groups. Motions of
three-dimensional hypersurfaces which permute a finite number of subdomains will
be investigated. Geometers and topologists have shown intense interest in these
"Kleinian groups" since Thurston classified such hypersurfaces using hyperbolic
geometry. In addition, the two investigators will institute a one year honors
course for two students. The goal of this course will be to prepare these
students for graduate study in mathematics. Kleinian groups will be used as a
rich source of examples for their study.
