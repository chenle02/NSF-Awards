9618969 Giese This four year project proposes to provide a total of 72 secondary
social studies teachers from Colorado in two cadres, selected in teams, with
trainilg to enable them to integrate Internet resources and appropriate
instructional strategies into inquiry-oriented, student-centered social science
activities. In addition the teachers would receive training in leadership skills
to enhance their roles as leaders in their home school building and districts.
This would be accomplished by selecting teams of from two to four teachers from
the same school or district to attend a two week workshop followed by four-two
day academic year sessions, a second one week workshop devoted to leadership in
the second year with some additional follow-up during the second academic year.
The project has projected a total of 56.5% of the award as cost sharing.
