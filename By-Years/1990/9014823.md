This project examines a number of problems associated with interior point
methods for linear programming. It begins with the observation that under
certain conditions the affine scalding algorithm converges at a superlinear rate
when applied to the feasibility problem. Then every linear programming problem
is approximated by a feasibility problem. The main technical difficulties have
to do with degeneracies in linear programming problems. With assumptions about
problems being nondegenerate results about superlinear convergence are proved,
but superlinear convergence has been observed even in degenerate cases. So what
is actually required for superlinear convergence is not clear. Trying to
accelerate affine scaling algorithms leads naturally to questions about centers
of polytopes. The existence of a large set of "centers" inside every polytope,
except these equivalent to simplicies is shown. The affine scaling algorithm
converges fast when started at one of these general centers. To discover means
of computing centers efficiently is a goal of this research. After finding ways
of accelerating convergence, the questions of how to perform each step
efficiently is addressed. The least square problems will be solved by a
preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm.
