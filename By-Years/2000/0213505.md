James McCusker of Michigan State University is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on the chemistry
of excited states of transition metal complexes, particularly on ultra fast
reactions of Cr(III) species that contain paramagnetic ligands. Interest in this
research is centered on characterizing and explaining effects that arise from
coupling between two or more unpaired electrons in the photochemically important
excited states of transition metal complexes. Ultrafast process will be studied
by spectroscopic techniques, accompanied by extensive
computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the energies involved in coupling
between several unpaired electrons in transition-metal complexes are often small
on an absolute scale, such effects often determine the chemical and
photophysical properties of such compounds. There has been relatively little
prior study of the influence of electronic and magnetic coupling on
photochemical and photophysical properties of transition metal complexes. The
research proposed under this proposal has the potential greatly to expand
scientific understanding of profound effects that electron-electron coupling
exerts on phochemical reactivity of transition metal species. There are many
potential applications of such understanding in important technological areas,
such as the design and fabrication of electronic devices using novel molecular
based magneto-optical materials.&lt;br/&gt;
