Optimization problems that arise in computational and other related areas are
investigated in this project. Special emphasis is placed on bi-criteria
optimization problems and geometric problems. In a communication network, the
two important criteria that are of great practical implications are the
communication delay and total cost. In path planning routing, the two important
criteria are the total length and the number of bends. Optimization problems
concerning two criteria either simultaneously or in lexicographical order are
studied. Among those to be studied are weighted farthest neighbor Voronoi
diagram construction for a set of point sites, a new class of geometric
problems, called the capacitated path problem, in which the obstacles have
capacities and the cost of a path avoiding these obstacles is a function of the
length of the path and the capacities of the obstacles visited by the path, and
routing problems with multiple source-destination pairs such that these paths do
not cross and yet their total length is to be minimized. The goals of this
research are to apply geometric techniques to tackle these new classes of
optimization problems, and to identify problems that can (or cannot) benefit
from the geometric properties.
