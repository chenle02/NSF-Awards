This starter grant award to the University of California at Los Angeles supports
the research of Professor Michael W. Deem. The work aims to develop powerful,
biased Monte Carlo methods to explore the conformations of peptide molecules.
The approach leads to an efficient, Boltzmann-weighted sampling of torsional
degrees of freedom in these biological molecules. The method allows an
examination of the conformations accessible to constrained peptides at body
temperature and can address peptide transport in physiological environments. The
approach can be used to computationally design inhibitors to protein active
sites, a topic of interest to the pharmaceutical industry. This research will
advance the fundamental understanding of the role that peptides play in
regulatory processes within the body and the types of therapeutic agents that
may interact with proteins.
