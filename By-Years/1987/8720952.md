Horizontal extension in the Hinterland of a thin-skinned thrust belt has been
proposed as a natural consequence of crustal shortening and thickening and
resulting topographic uplift. Most examples are known from modern orogens and
ancient belts have yielded little evidence. This study will explore a suggestion
of extension in the enigmatic, younger-over-older, top-to-the-west faults in
southern Idaho that appear to be contemporaneous with Late-Cretaceous Laramide
compression. The fault motion and timing will be addressed by 39Ar/40Ar dating
and by reconstructing the thermal regime by illite crystallinity and conodont
CAI. Results are expected to define the timing and kinematics of extensional
tectonics in this region, and will bear on the relations among crustal
shortening, thickening, topographic uplift, erosion and extension in the
hinterland of thrust belts.
