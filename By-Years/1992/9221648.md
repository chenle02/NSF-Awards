The determination of large scale structure in the universe is a major problem
in astrophysics today. During the last two years, the Principal Investigator has
begun to produce results from a redshift survey which aims to map the universe
beyond 1 billion light years distance. The project consists of measuring 25,000
selected galaxies, and positions and magnitudes of 20,000 galaxies have been
obtained. Approximately 10,000 spectra have been obtained, and they have
measured distances to 5,000 galaxies. This project will be continued through
this grant. The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in this
research area.
