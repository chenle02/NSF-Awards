DMS-9422061 Givant Mills College, in collaboration with Carleton and St. Olaf
Colleges and The George Washington University plans to develop and operate a
consortium of three programs to increase the number of women who pursue and
obtain advanced degrees in the mathematical sciences, and who become active
members and leaders of the mathematical community. Growing out of the efforts of
the Mills Summer Mathematics Institute (1991-94), the consortium is a unified
effort to bring undergraduate women into mathematics at the highest levels. It
is the first major effort of its type. It will directly involve 48 women
students. Carleton and St. Olaf Colleges jointly propose a four-week summer
program for 18 students at the freshman-sophomore level, with the focus on
conjecture and proof, as well as on the use of mathematical software for problem
solving. The other two components of the consortium are aimed mainly at students
at the end of their junior year. The George Washington University proposes a
four-week summer program in which 10 outstanding undergraduate women will be
immersed in intensive short courses which will lead them to interesting open
problems. Mills College will continue to develop and operate its Summer
Mathematics Institute, a six-week program for 20 excelling women math majors.
Students will take 2 or four seminars; each seminar will be led by a woman who
is an active research mathematician. Interactive, discovery learning and work on
difficult problems will lead to mathematical understanding. All three programs
will provide advice and information about graduate school and careers in
mathematics. Among the most valuable aspects of the consortium is the emphasis
placed by each program on involving active women mathematicians as instructors,
TAs, and mentors. The consortium will create a network of women mathematicians:
faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, who will support and inspire
each other to high achievement.
