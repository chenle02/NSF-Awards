Abstract Santiago CTS-9523435 The PI proposes to carry out a preliminary
experimental study of an opposed-flow diffusion flame (OFDF) between a downward
directed jet of a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen and a pool of liquid methanol.
Stable combustion products will be sampled and analyzed using quartz microprobes
followed by gas chromatographic analysis. Temperature profiles will be measured
by means of thermocouples. Non-intrusive techniques will be considered for
future use. This is a Minority Research Planning Grant Proposal.
