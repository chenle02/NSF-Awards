The proposed research involves the derivation of constraints upon the structure,
composition, and thermal regime of the Earth's interior by simultaneous
consideration of thermodynamic, thermoelastic, mineralogical, and seismological
data. In particular: constraint of lower crustal compositions, compositional
differences between upper and lower mantle, anomalous compositional and thermal
characteristics at the core-mantle boundary.
