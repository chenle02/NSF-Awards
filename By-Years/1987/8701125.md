Burghelea will study some aspects and implications of cyclic homology in
algebra, topology and geometry. In algebra, he plans to study the cyclic
homology of algebraic varieties and crossed product algebras associated to
actions of groups on algebraic varieties; he will also study the Chern character
for group rings. In topology he will study the homology type of B Diff(M) in the
stability range, and at the prime 2. In geometry he will study the relationship
between the Selberg trace formula, cyclic homology and closed geodesics.
Exploring the uses of cyclic homology will render a powerful technique more
versatile. Ultimately applications to theoretical physics and other consumers of
higher mathematics should profit. **8 8701643 Bergman Three important properties
of universal algebras will be studied: the amalgamation property, deductiveness,
and congruence modular varieties. The research on the amalgamation property
centers on two problems. 1. Determination if the amalgamation property plus
residual smallness implies the congruence extension property. 2.
Characterization of the amalgamation bases of the variety. The plans for
deductiveness are less specific. The general issue is to attempt to classify
those varieties that are deductive. A third avenue to be pursued is the
representation problem for the commutator in congruence modular varieties. All
of these topics concern the foundations of algebra and are likely to be applied
outside of algebra only to the extent that they condition a mode of thought
about algebraic questions.
