9552985 Bamberger In this project, key components of a distance learning
computer laboratory will be prototyped. In particular, the following systems
will be developed: an interpersonal communication tool which combines elements
from email, video-conferencing, listserv/listproc, usenet news, WAIS, gopher,
and WWW; network based, interactive, media-rich, digital collections or
curricular material; and authoring agents for the seamless integration of the
interpersonal communication systems and interactive digital collections. The
prototype sytems will be developed and field tested during the grant period.
Deliverables will include the prototype systems, raw data for assessment of the
impact of the tools on educational delivery, and a preliminary assessment study.
In order to fully demonstrate the need for and benefits of distance learning
computer laboratories, the prototype system will be developed in the context of
a course on digital image processing. ***
