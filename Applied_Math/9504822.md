9504822 Lasiecka/Triggiani This research project is centered around issues of
optimality, regularity, stability or feedback stabilization, for classes of
linear and nonlinear partial differential equations which arise in modern
technological applications. The three main areas of the study, bound together by
a common theme, are: interacting structures and related smart materials ,
modeled by systems of coupled partial differential equations, typically of
different types, with possible couplings of state variables at the boundary;
analysis and control theory of linear and nonlinear models of certain elastic
shells, such as a spherical caps, but also shells having other geometries; and
analysis and control theory of elastic models which exhibit high internal
damping and which are acted on by certain boundary controls. At the core of the
study are problems of quadratic optimization, leading to a Riccati theory
describing the synthesis of the optimal solution; regularity of solutions of
partial differential equations in the interior and at the boundary; and feedback
stabilization of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. This study
is motivated by problems arising in structural optimization, stabilization and
control. At the core of these issues lies the notion of optimization, in
accordance with some pre-selected quantitative criterion, of the evolution of
some physical system. Such systems often can, and are, modeled as systems of
linear or nonlinear partial differential equations involving control variables
which are to be selected according to the particular optimization criteria
involved. In this project, such an approach is applied to the study of complex
interactions such as arise, for example, in thermal/elastic or fluid/structure
couplings. The goal is to develop appropriate mathematical models based on
partial differential equations and to design optimal control strategies based on
a careful analysis of the mathematical models. ***
