0129059&lt;br/&gt;Theodorakis&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Chrostopher
Theodorakis and students from Texas Tech University in a collaboration with
Rupert Simon of the National Research Center for Environment and Health in
Neuherberg, Germany. The aim of the international project is to study the effect
of thyroid-disrupting substance on molecular markers. The ecological relevance
of these responses will be assessed in laboratory exposure experiments with
zebrafish and African clawed frogs as fish and amphibian model species. The
German group can provide samples of zebrafish exposed to selected pollutants,
analyze them for thyroid hormones and iodinated compounds in tissue and serum
samples, and determine exposure concentrations of organic contaminants in water
and biological samples. The group at Texas Tech will expose zebrafish and
African clawed frogs to perchlorate and analyze thyroid histology, analyze
differential gene expression, and perform analysis of perchlorate in water and
tissues. Results of the collaboration will develop new protocols for endocrine
disrupting potential assessments of industrial and environmental chemicals. The
work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
international travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;
