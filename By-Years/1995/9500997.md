PI: Weinstein DMS-9500997 Weinstein will study the role of nonlinear ground
states in the dynamics of nonlinear dispersive evolution equations. Specific
problems to be considered include the infinite time behavior of nonlinear
dispersive Hamiltonian systems, the spectral stability and instability of
nonlinear bound states, nonlinear waves in optical fibers and the dynamics of
coupled fiber arrays, and vector Zakharov and vector nonlinear Schroding
equations. Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling
of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to
create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative
information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about
uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods
for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these
approximations.
