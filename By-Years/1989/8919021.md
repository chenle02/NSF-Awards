Under the direction of Dr. David Freidel, Mr. Juan Albarracin- Jordan will
conduct archaeological research in the Tiwanaku Valley to collect data for his
doctoral thesis. For more than a millennium (ca. AD 100-1200), the northern
Bolivian site of Tiwanaku was the paramount city of the Lake Titicaca basin
which was, in turn, one of the great demographic centers of native Andean
civilization. However, despite Tiwanaku's important position in the prehistory
of the Andes - it is one of the early centers of state formation - little is
known about its economic history and how it rose to prominence, governed an
empire, and then declined. Mr. Albarracin-Jordan's research will help fill that
gap. One issue of particular concern is how the land, much of which is unfarmed
today, was able to support such a large population. What are the crops and the
farming strategies which these ancient Andeans employed? Mr. Albarracin-Jordan
will focus on this issue. Rather than excavate in the city center, he will study
what likely is the richest agricultural area, conduct a systematic survey, make
collections of surface materials, and map and excavate selected sites. These
data should provide important information on population distribution and
landscape use. This research is important for several reasons. It will shed
light on a little understood aspect of South American prehistory. The Tiwanaku
empire rose quickly and extended its influence rapidly over a wide area. This
history is little understood. Secondly, it will increase our understanding of
the more general question of how complex societies such as our own arise and are
maintained. Finally, it will contribute to the training of an extremely
promising young scientist.
