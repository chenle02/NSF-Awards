In this study we propose to grow extended chain polymer crystals on individual
SWNTs (not on bundles of SWNTs) using shear flow field in an appropriate
solvent. The polymer coated SWNTs are termed as ?seed crystals?. Flexible
polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, PET, nylon 6, and nylon 66 will be
used in this study. These seed crystals will be harvested from solutions and
characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy, wide-angle
X-ray diffraction, and by differential scanning calorimeter. The seed crystals
will be blended in the respective polymer in melt or in solution. Fibers will
also be spun by melt or solution spinning. The idea is to use seed crystals to
promote extended chain morphology in those polymers, where only semi-crystalline
morphology with chain folds exists. Structure, morphology, and properties of the
processed fibers will be studied.

Growth and study of the "seed crystals" will contribute to the fundamental
understanding of interaction between polymer and the carbon nanotube. Use of
such crystals in polymer processing would provide range of polymer morphologies
that would broaden the structure-property relationship understanding. There is a
significant performance and price gap between the commodity textile fibers such
as PET, nylon, and polypropylene on one hand, and high performance polymeric
fibers such as Kevlar® and Zylon® on the other. This study has the potential to
close the performance gap between these two classes of fibers. Polymer-CNT seed
crystals developed in this study may also find applications in injection molding
and extrusion for influencing polymer orientation and crystallization in these
processes. In addition polymer coated carbon nanotube seeds can find application
in electronics where carbon nanotube act as conductor of heat and electricity
and polymer as the insulating layer.
