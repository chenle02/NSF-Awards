The vocal communication system of birds has long served as a model system for
the study of vocal communication in general. One reason is that the behavior of
birds is especially easy to study. Another reason is that avian vocal
communication has so many similarities to human communication, for example, in
development and in neural control. Progress in studying the function of avian
vocal signals has recently been aided greatly by the use of a bioassay for
measuring preferences of female birds for male vocalizations. In this bioassay,
captive females are first treated with a hormone, estradiol, and then exposed to
playback of recorded vocalizations. Females respond to appropriate vocalizations
with a courtship display, which is used as the response measure. Dr. Searcy will
investigate the hormonal basis of the bioassay by treating females with
different doses of estradiol, measuring levels of the hormone in their blood,
and relating dose and blood level to their degree of responsiveness to vocal
stimuli. These experiments should both advance our understanding of the hormonal
control of reproductive behavior in female birds and lead to methodological
improvements in the bioassay for female vocal preferences. In a second series of
experiments, Dr. Searcy will test the effect of loudness of vocalizations on
female preferences. Based on other investigators' experiments with frogs,
theories have been proposed to explain why some preferences can be reversed by
changing loudness while others are insensitive to such changes. Dr. Searcy will
test whether or not these theories can be extended to birds, as a step towards
unifying the field of bioacoustics. In a third set of experiments, Dr. Searcy
will test the ability of female birds to sort vocalizations produced by
different males, using a technique similar to experiments on people's
discrimination of unfamiliar voices. These experiments will provide another step
towards producing theories of vocal communication that are general across all
animals, rather than specific to just one group.
