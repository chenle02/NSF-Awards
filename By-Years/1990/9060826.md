Gigasample analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are needed in many fields, from
advanced information processing systems to scientific instrumentation used in
high energy Physics experiments. As higher speed ADCs become available, signal
capture functions which were only possible in the analog domain, now become
possible to achieve in the digital domain, where sophisticated (and far more
accurate) signal processing functions may be applied. Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)
technology promises a tenfold increase in conversion rate in addition to
providing overall improvement in issues such as power dissipation, radiation
resistance, operability at higher temperature, etc., as compared to silicon
technology. However, GaAs ADC development has been plagued with problems for
which no near term solution is foreseen. The thrust of this research is in the
development of a technology driven architecture that draws upon the strengths of
both GaAs and Si technologies. In particular, the research makes use of the
significant difference between the signal bandwith ("rise time) and realizable
current gain (or current drive) between the technologies to realize low- power
high resolution ADCs. The work involves feasibility research, modeling and
prototype building.
