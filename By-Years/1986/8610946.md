The 1985 Mexican earthquake left a large number of damaged reinforced concrete
buildings which appear to be suitable for repair and strengthening. This project
will conduct a coordinated research effort with engineers in Mexico City that
will be involved in reconstruction activities. The reconstruction process will
provide an opportunity for the U.S earthquake engineering community to observe
first-hand, a large-scale effort to determine the condition of buildings
suffering various degrees of damage, assess the existing strength and design
schemes to provide strength required by current codes, and review the
construction procedures utilized as they pertain to U.S. practice. The research
will use the results of experimental work at the University of Texas.
Involvement by projects will be established to ensure that the work undertaken
is pertinent to U.S. structures.
