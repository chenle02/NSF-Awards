This research focuses on the linkage between discrimination and trust. This
linkage is especially important when considering the important role that trust
plays in the success of initial encounters between strangers. In many social
settings trust and reciprocity can improve the well-being of both parties. Quite
often brief, face-to-face interactions are the primary basis by which
individuals initiate and build social networks in economic and political arenas.
If particular ethnic groups are not trusted in these brief interactions (through
discrimination), then individuals from those ethnic groups lose the opportunity
to prove themselves trustworthy. Consequently those individuals lose access to
many financial opportunities that stem from repeated interactions that are
fueled by trusting relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory experiments
are used by which strangers make decisions with one another. The decisions
involve financial stakes in which one person can trust another, and in return, a
counterpart can choose to be trustworthy. The experiments manipulate three major
variables: the ethnicity of the partners; the framework in which the decision is
cast; and the institutional guarantees underlying the trust game. The
experimental are novel in that they are conducted via the internet, in real
time, between multiple laboratories. The experiments suggest policy
interventions that can encourage initial trusting behavior through minimizing
discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
