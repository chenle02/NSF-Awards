9311727 Kornfield This research involves a detailed phylogenetic and
biogeographic study of endemic killifishes of Lake Titicaca in South America.
The experimental approach will entail extensive collecting in the lake followed
by a detailed genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence variation within
and among species. These genetic data will be used to both construct a phylogeny
for the these endemic fishes and examine population and historical processes
related to this unusual diversification in this South American lake. %%% This
investigation will provide a detailed assessment of the various processes (both
biotic and abiotic) responsible for the diversity of endemic (unique)
killifishes seen in Lake Titicaca. Investigations of the genetic uniqueness of
isolated populations of killifish will facilitate the formulation of
conservation policies optimized for preservation of the biotic diversity of this
rare and unusual fish fauna. This is important as the entire Andean Altiplano
ecosystem is becoming threatened by increased human activities. ***
