This proposal requests assistance from the National Science Foundation to
establish a multiuser Hybridoma Research Laboratory at The University of Texas
at San Antonio (UTSA). The laboratory will: (1) enhance and strengthen the
research capabilities of life science faculty by providing expensive, state-of-
the-art equipment, not presently available, to facilitate the application of
monoclonal antibody (MAb) technology to ongoing and planned research programs;
(2) enhance and strengthen research experiences for minority undergraduate and
graduate students by facilitating the acquisition of intellectual and physical
skills to become competitive in an area of biology which is rapidly achieving
status as required background by the scientific community; and (3) foster
research interactions between UTSA and other regional academic institutions with
large minority enrollments in the biological sciences. Furthermore, the enhanced
research experiences are expected to contribute to increased entry of minority
students into careers in the biosciences. Initially nine investigators and their
students propose to utilize the Hybridoma Research Laboratory to facilitate the
application of MAb technology to ongoing research programs in physiology,
molecular cell biology, genetics, biochemistry and neurobiology. These research
programs will impact 14 undergraduate and 7 graduate minority students per
year.//
