Measurements of the auroral ionosphere using a digital research-ionosonde co-
located with EISCAT near Tromso Norway provide the content and orientation of
the proposed work. Data acquisition and analysis were accomplished (1983-1989)
by the investigator during a stipendium with the Max-Planck Institut fur
Aeronomie, followed by a research consultancy at the British Antarctic Survey.
The seven papers now to be written will join four already published, or
accepted, which have resulted from prior work. Two papers present a new method
for deriving ionospheric vector velocities from high resolution Doppler and
echolocation analyses and undertaking their comparison with EISCAT bulk ion-
velocity measurements. Three papers are concerned with new achievements in the
development of data acquisition principles for digital ionosondes. They show
progress toward a better understanding of the interplay of the processes of
radio reflection, refraction, diffraction and dispersion in controlling the
information content of ionosonde echoes. One paper demonstrates two new methods
for the spatial representation of ionospheric soundings. Two papers are
concerned with natural (Joule) and artificial (radio) heating of the auroral
ionosphere.
