This award will provide partial travel support for graduate students and a
prominent Russian researcher, Prof. E. A. Shcherbakov of the General Physics
Institute, Moscow, who will give an invited lecture, to attend the Second
Topical Meeting on Compact Blue- Green Lasers, in New Orleans, Louisiana,
February 2-4, 1993. This meeting is cosponsored by the OSA and IEEE/LEOS
societies. Developments in compact blue-green diode lasers and related nonlinear
optical sources will affect a broad range of important technological
applications ranging from reprographics to optical-disk data storage and
biomedical diagnostics. This meeting is intended to bring together researchers
in source development with those in the user community to foster a dialogue in
this rapidly expanding field. The research focus of this meeting is central to
QEWB program research interests. The graduate students supported on these funds
will be asked to provide feedback as to their experience in the form of a two-
page letter report that will be forwarded to NSF.
