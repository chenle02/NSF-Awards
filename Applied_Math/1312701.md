We propose to study two phase flow in karstic geometry utilizing a hierarchical
family of physically motivated diffuse interface (phase field) models. These
models embody several challenges: moving interface between two types of fluids
which leads to strong nonlinearity of the resulting models, and different
physics in different parts of the physical domain which leads to the coupling of
subsystems of different types. Although these two difficult issues have been
studied before in separate contexts, the physical need of two phase fluid flow
in karstic geometry requires us to investigate the two issues in a coupled
fashion. This is a challenge that has not been addressed so far. The PI and
collaborators plan to investigate the models from several different angles.
Firstly, we will investigate the mathematical well-posedeness of models.
Secondly, we will study the sharp interface limit. Thirdly, we will design and
implement accurate and efficient numerical methods for the models so that the
results can be compared to experimental results. These are highly non-trivial
tasks due to the highly nonlinear nature of the coupled systems, and the
disparity of physical and mathematical mechanism in the porous media and in the
conduit. The sharp interface limit is a highly nonlinear singular perturbation
problem which is known to be a challenge. We will combine tools from partial
differential equations, functional analysis, asymptotic analysis, numerical
analysis and computation, and laboratory experiments to investigate these
problems.

Geometric configurations that contain both conduit (or vug) and porous media is
termed karstic geometry. It is known that the study of multiphase flow in
karstic geometry is of great importance in many applications such as groundwater
study, fuel cell technology, petroleum engineering and carbon-dioxide
sequestration. The successful completion of the investigation on the validity of
the models proposed here will help us better understand several important two
fluid phenomena in karstic geometry. We also believe that the methodologies to
be developed may be expanded to investigate more complex models that involve
phase transition, and large density ratio. The better understanding of these
important problems could lead to better engineering processes and better science
based environmental policies.
