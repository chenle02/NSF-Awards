9402434 Hickey This three year award is for continuation and expansion of
studies related to the effects of gravity waves on the minor species' densities
and associated nightglow emissions of the mesopause/lower thermosphere (MLT)
region. For a given mean state and set of gravity wave parameters, the
characteristics of the emission fluctuations will depend on the chemical
pathways involved in the emission process. By careful modeling, the
characteristics of the oxygen emission fluctuations using several different
chemical pathways that have been proposed to explain the emissions will be
investigated. Preliminary analyses have shown that obvious differences exist in
the emission fluctuations for the different possible chemical pathways involved.
By expanding these analyses, it will be possible to search for signatures in the
emission fluctuations that are peculiar to each of the different chemical
pathways. The theoretical development will be followed by extensive diagnostic
analysis of both ground-based and space-based emission data, searching for the
prognostic signatures, and deducing the chemical pathways involved. ***
