9405380 Boley This project will develop and experiment with a variety of core
numerical algorithms for large sparse or structured linear algebra problems.
Part of the research is the development of effective algorithms for the analysis
and design of very large control models such as those related to large flexible
space structures. To accomplish this, a major focus of this research will be the
design of effective and efficient linear algebra algorithms. Examples of
problems to be addressed are large Lyapunov equations, large order matrix
pencils, large eigenvalue and singular values solvers. Parallel algorithms will
be explored and exploited. Approximate solutions obtained via Krylov space
methods, or other methods, will be analyzed. A standard sparse matrix library
(SPARSKIT) will be used as the foundation for the software development. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms, the quality of controller designs
obtained from the approximate solutions will be explored. ***
