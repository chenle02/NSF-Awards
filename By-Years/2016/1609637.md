One of the National Academy of Engineering's 21st Century Grand Challenges is
"Advancing Personalized Learning" and this project helps to contribute to this
knowledge base. Active learning in the classroom has been proven to be an
effective approach to improve student learning and engagement, as well as
readiness for the STEM workforce. An example of active learning, which will be
part of this project, is the flipped classroom model where the sequence of
content delivery and practice of problem solving is flipped. Students are
initially introduced to the lecture content prior to and outside of class, and
participate in collaborative activities under the facilitation of an instructor
during the classroom. To add to the flipped classroom model and to further
enhance student learning, this project introduces a freely-available adaptive
platform to personalize the pre-class activities for every learner. It is
expected that this personalized pre-class experience will further enrich student
collaboration and learning in the classroom. This project involves both
development of the platform and assessment of student learning to investigate
the efficacy of the method. This body of work will advance our understanding on
the impact of the combined flipped and adaptive approaches on cognitive and
affective learning gains of students from diverse
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many engineering problems result in
mathematical models that do not have exact solutions or otherwise would take a
long time to solve. To solve such problems, many engineering students and also
mathematics students, take a course called Numerical Methods in order to learn
computational techniques to solve complex mathematical models. The context of
this project is a Numerical Methods course that will be redesigned as an active
learning classroom incorporating adaptive (personalized) learning. More
specifically, this project will compare the effectiveness of three instructional
approaches (a flipped class with adaptive learning, a flipped class without
adaptive learning, and a blended class without adaptive learning) on students'
conceptual gains, procedural knowledge gains, higher-order problem solving, and
affective learning. Both qualitative and quantitative metrics will be used
during this investigation. Project deliverables include instructional materials
and best practices for teaching Numerical Methods in a flipped setting on an
adaptive platform. Dissemination avenues include the freely-available Knewton
adaptive platform, an open education resource portal, and social media.
