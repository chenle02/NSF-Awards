The PI will attempt to quantify the rate and magnitude of climate and sea level
changes during the last interglacial using patter of architecture and community
succession in reef sequences of four Caribbean islands in existing University of
Maryland collections. The study will establish a regional pattern to rule out
local tectonic and oceanographic variabilities. The samples will be analyzed by
ICP-SMS to see if improved resolution is sufficient to screen Th dating and
paleotemperatures based on Sr/Ca and U/Ca ratios in order to detect alteration
in coral records. Results of the ICP-SMS analyses will be compared to previous
thermal ionization mass spectroscopy results.
