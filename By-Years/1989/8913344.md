Research will develop efficient procedures for estimating critical quantities
in counting and enumeration problems with applications to manufacturing problems
that arise as components of decision making models in management, production and
distribution systems. The researchers plan relies on a sampling procedure that
derives its advantage by using a Markov chain structure to generate successive
samples of the combinatorial objects needed in considerably less computing time
than it takes to generate them as independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) random combinatorial objects. In particular, this generating efficiency
appears to increase as the size of the problem increases. Although the
generating method also appears to inflate the variance of the overall estimate,
preliminary analysis indicates that this inflation is more than offset by the
increasingly more efficient generating time, resulting in a highly efficient
method of estimating the critical quantities of interest. This method will be
develop in the context of counting and enumeration problems especially as
encountered in network reliability and feasible flow setups as they apply to
manufacturing problems. Research will also be conducted into finding optimal
Markovian dependence structures that maximize efficiency, into incorporating a
priori bounds into this methodology and into the extension of this technique to
other areas such as simulated annealing.
