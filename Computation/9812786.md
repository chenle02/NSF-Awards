Crowley 9812786 The investigator and his colleagues organize a workshop on
uncertainty in modeling and simulation. Its aim is to sketch out broad
scientific questions and promising avenues of research related to uncertainty
issues, to document the potential impact of the issues, and to produce a report
outlining key research issues. The report will be distributed in print and via
the web. Uncertainty issues arise throughout science and engineering. The
problems these fields tackle involve nonlinear phenomena and complex systems
that are not well understood; observations are not error-free and are irregular
in space and time (weather and climate data typify these characteristics); and
many natural and engineering processes are inherently stochastic or chaotic. The
mathematical and statistical models of such systems share the same features of
complexity, nonlinearity, and stochasticity. Scientists, mathematicians, and
engineers analyze and compute with these models to understand and predict the
underlying systems. Therefore the recognition and the management of uncertainty
are important issues in both analysis and computation as well. Hence the meeting
involves engineers, mathematicians, and scientists. The interplay between these
disciplines is essential to form the required perspective of opportunities and
challenges that arise from dealing with uncertainty. Identifying key research
issues is an important step in guiding research; the results affect every area
of science and engineering.
