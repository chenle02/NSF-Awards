Jack Simons of the University of Utah is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies on the structures
and dynamics of molecular anions. Analytic models for describing vibrationally
induced electron ejection will be developed. Other applications include the
interactions of low-energy electrons with DNA bases, electron binding to
zwitterions, dipole-bound anions, and the electronic stability of dianions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research advances the understanding of the nature of
the chemical bond and of electronic dynamics through the study of unusual
chemical species, including the prediction of new species whose existence may
depend on new bonding paradigms. Also, laboratory findings will be interpreted
in order to add to the knowledge base of molecular anions. The project on DNA
damage may provide insight into genetic mutations and how to avoid them.
