A model engineering curriculum is being developed to prepare engineering
students for innovative, contextually-sensitive design, effective communication,
and improved participation in society's decision-making processes. The
curriculum develops coherence and integration of liberal arts and engineering
through the use of an engineering "design sequence" and a liberal arts "area of
coherence," both of which stretch from the Freshman to the Senior years. The
courses in each sequence integrate topics and perspectives from the other area
and develop critical thinking and communication skills through the use of open-
ended group projects with significant writing assignments and interactions with
industry professionals. Capstone courses, "Capstone Design" and "Technology in
Society," integrate concepts from previous courses and the other area. The
grantee institution is contributing significant funds to this award.
