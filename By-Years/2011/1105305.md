The goal of this proposal is to further explore and understand different
geometric structures on surfaces and natural induced dynamical systems on the
corresponding moduli spaces. We intend to study the dynamics of natural
geometric flows on the cotangent bundle of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces
of a given genus. Most of the results and questions in this area are based on
analogies between these flows and unipotent flows on homogeneous spaces. We also
plan to investigate the asymptotic behavior of intersection pairings of
tautological line bundles on the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces of genus g as
g goes to infinity. This could shed some light on geometric properties of random
hyperbolic surfaces of large genus in different models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
main problems motivating our proposed project are centered around the geometry
of Riemann surfaces and their deformations. Moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces
appear naturally in various contexts, for example in algebraic geometry and
string theory. This research proposal is interdisciplinary and has connections
to different branches of mathematics, especially dynamical systems, low
dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry and geometric
group theory.
