The processes involved in the determination of a cell's developmental fate
remain important problems in developmental biology. During the development of an
organism, both maternally-derived products and zygotic compounds must interact
within the developing embryonic cell for proper specification of the cell's
developmental potential. Using the nematode C. elegans, zygotic lethal mutants
affecting only embryogenesis will be isolated to assess the role of the zygotic
genome in early development. Maternal effect lethal mutants that appear to be
defective in specifying the gut lineage will be identified to analyze maternal
components required to specify a particular lineage. The expression of a subset
of strict maternal effect lethal genes, par genes, will be examined to gain some
understanding of the mechanisms involved in cytoplasmic partitioning. Products
for the par genes are required for proper localization of cytoplasmic factors
during the early divisions of the C. elegans embryo. Additional alleles at the
par loci will be isolated. Par genes will be cloned by "transposon tagging"
following transposition mutagenesis. The par genes will be sequenced and the
sequences used to prepare antibodies to par proteins. Antibody probes should
allow a biochemical analysis of par gene products and thus, provide information
about the mechanisms involved in asymmetrically partitioning cytoplasmic
components essential for proper development. One of the central problems in
developmental biology is understanding how the division of a cell creates two
unlike daughters with different developmental fates. It has been proposed that
such asymmetric divisions result from unequal positioning or partitioning of
cytoplasmic components. Dr. Shaw proposes an investigation of this question
using appropriate mutants of C. elegans.
