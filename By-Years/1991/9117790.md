Our recent studies of the magnetic properties of soil chronosequences has shown
that rock magnetic studies are a powerful tool for studying soils and
identifying soil inhomogeneities. Magnetic susceptibility, frequency dependent
susceptibility, loss of susceptibility upon treatment with the buffered strong
reductant citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite, anhysteretic remanent magnetization,
and other rock magnetic properties indicate that pedogenic processes convert
non- or weakly-magnetic minerals to strongly magnetic minerals and that the
particle size of these magnetic minerals are smaller than the size of the
inherited suite of magnetic minerals. The time variation of indices of rock
magnetic properties are nearly linear for pedons within three California
chronosequences, indicating that rock magnetic properties may be useful in
studies of soil chronosequences, indicating that rock magnetic properties may be
useful in studies of soil chronosequences. The goal of the research that we
propose to undertake is to further the understanding of the processes and
relationships discovered in the initial work. In particular, we will further
explore the interdependence of rock magnetic properties and particle size,
mineralogy, profile location, and soil forming process. In addition, we will
test the relationship between the presumed ages of pedons and rock magnetic
indices by sampling and measuring rock magnetic properties on a wider range of
soils.
