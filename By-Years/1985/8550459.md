This project will develop video, computer, and print materials that will enhance
the teaching of geometry in secondary schools. The central medium will be
broadcast-quality videotapes, which will consist of computer generated animation
accompanied by narration and some text. Workbooks will allow the video materials
to be used either for classroom instruction or for independent study. Related
computer programs, together with high quality documentation, will also be
developed, allowing students to explore geometric concepts interactively. A
useful byproduct of the project will be a "geometer's sketch pad", a program
that will enable geometers working with inexpensive microcomputers to sketch
geometric figures in two and three dimensions and to apply geometric
transformations that will permit visualization from different perspectives. This
program will be used by the project staff for prototyping animation sequences.
It will also be of interest to other mathematicians and will be appropriate as
an instructional tool for use with gifted students.
