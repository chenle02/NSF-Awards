Professor Todd Martinez of the University of Illinois is supported by a CAREER
grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop
theoretical tools that address nonadiabatic effects on gas- and condensed-phase
chemical reaction dynamics. Photochemical cis/trans isomerizations and ring
opening/closing processes will be investigated using calculations of potential
energy surfaces, their couplings, and multiple electronic state nuclear
dynamics. Improved continuum models for predicting electronic structure in
solution and quasi-ligand approaches for reducing the number of electrons
explicitly considered will be employed. Novel educational ideas include
incorporating organic photochemistry examples and modern computational chemistry
software into undergraduate and graduate physical chemistry courses.
Photochemical processes are important in vision and biosynthesis of vitamin D as
well as synthetic organic photochemistry. A detailed understanding of the
electronic structure and dynamics of these reactions will increase our ability
to design new photochemical synthetic routes or control known photochemical
reactions. Incorporating these research topics into college chemistry courses
allows students to see the relationship between concepts and real-world
applications.
