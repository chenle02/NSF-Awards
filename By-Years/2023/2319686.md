This research project aims to investigate the development and synchronization of
Dictyostelium discoideum, a social soil amoeba, to gain valuable insights into
how multicellular organisms organize themselves. This study addresses the
broader scientific importance of understanding synchrony at different levels,
such as cells, tissues, and whole organisms, and its relevance to biological
science. Dictyostelium discoideum is an ideal model organism due to its
simplicity and suitability for genetic and molecular analyses. The project seeks
to unravel the intricate mechanisms by which cells coordinate their development,
tissues form and assemble, and organisms progress through distinct developmental
stages. By employing advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and
standard RNA sequencing, the scientists will quantify synchrony and gene
expression patterns. By comparing wild-type development with mutant strains
lacking specific signaling mechanisms, they will analyze the consequences of
genetic and temporal perturbations in synchrony. Additionally, the research will
generate a comprehensive transcriptome atlas, identifying new cell types and
subtypes. The generated data sets will be publicly accessible, allowing for
further exploration of synchrony and development. Furthermore, STEM teachers
will be trained in data mining and scientific research, enhancing their skills
and inspiring their students. This project contributes to scientific literacy
and expands our understanding of the intricate biological processes underlying
multicellular organism development.

This research project focuses on studying the synchronization and development of
Dictyostelium discoideum at various levels: cells, tissues, and organisms. The
primary objective is to investigate the mechanisms and significance of synchrony
by examining a series of developmental checkpoints. These checkpoints involve
extracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling, cell-cell contact mediated by
allorecognition proteins, and the production of Spore Differentiation Factor
(SDF) peptides. To achieve these goals, the researchers will employ advanced
techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and standard RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq). These methods will allow for the quantification of
synchrony and gene expression patterns during different developmental stages.
The analysis will involve comparing the synchrony in wild-type development with
that of mutant strains lacking extracellular cAMP signaling. Additionally, a
genetic suppressor strain will be examined, which restores development without
restoring synchrony, enabling a deeper understanding of the consequences of
perturbations in synchrony. The project also aims to create a comprehensive
single-cell transcriptome atlas for Dictyostelium discoideum. This atlas will
enable the identification of novel cell types and subtypes. To validate the
findings, selected differentially expressed genes will be further investigated
by generating Green Fluorescent Protein fusions and following spatiotemporal
gene expression, and genetic ablation experiments will be conducted to explore
the functions of newly identified cell types. Overall, this research project
contributes to our understanding of developmental synchrony in Dictyostelium
discoideum and its underlying molecular mechanisms. The use of advanced
molecular tools and analysis techniques will provide valuable insights into the
coordinated organization of multicellular organisms.
