The project concerns the topology and geometry of manifolds, stratified spaces,
infinite trees, and ultrametric spaces. The main tools are controlled topology,
surgery theory, noncommutative geometry, and C*-algebras of groupoids. The main
focus is on the geometry of infinite trees and other non-compact manifold
stratified spaces at infinity. Specific problems that will be addressed include
the Baum-Connes conjecture for local similarity groupoids arising from the end
spaces of trees, periodic structure in the neighborhood of the singular set of a
manifold stratified space, the classification of stratified h-cobordisms, and
controlled topology over nonpositively curved manifolds. This last problem is
related to Novikov-like conjectures.

Topology seeks to classify, characterize, and explore those abstract spaces
known as manifolds. Manifolds are locally like ordinary euclidean spaces (the
line, the plane, three-dimensional space, etc.); however, they are allowed to
have global twisting, curving and holes (e.g., circles, spheres, tori).
Manifolds arise in many models of physical and biological phenomena. Manifolds
with singularities, or stratified spaces, are even more ubiquitous as they
appear as solution spaces of algebraic and differential equations, and as limits
and compactifications of manifolds. Mathematical trees are the one-dimensional
case of stratified spaces and are used to model branching processes. There are
many asymmetric infinite trees that nevertheless have many similar infinite
subtrees. One of the goals of this project is to study these non-global
symmetries of infinite trees using a fairly new branch of mathematics called
noncommutative geometry. More generally, the symmetry and periodic structure of
stratified spaces at infinity will be investigated.
