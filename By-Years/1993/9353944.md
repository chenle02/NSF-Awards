9353944 Wyman "Technology Strategies: Tutorials and Projects" involves 120
participants in one of four two-week workshops offered at The Ohio State
University in Summer 1994 and 1995. The workshops include tutorials in
mathematical topics, calculator use, and software packages, but they emphasize
extensive participant projects that incorporate new technologies and teaching
methodologies culminating in presentations during the workshops and at followup
meetings. These workshops build on the highly successful Technology Strategies
Workshops offered at Ohio State with N.S.F. support in 1992 and 1993. Faculty
from two- year and community colleges, four year colleges, and universities are
actively recruited. Also, alumni from the previous workshops are invited to
attend the Tutorials and Projects workshops. The Participants take home new
insights on the national curricular reforms that have developed in the past five
years, as well as renewed excitement and enhanced technical skills. As a result
of the workshop, they will be able to communicate this excitement to their
students. Proceedings volumes will be widely distributed and participants are
invited to submit papers for a refereed publication for national dissemination.
