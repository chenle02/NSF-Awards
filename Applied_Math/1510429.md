The objective of this project is to obtain a rigorous mathematical theory of
imaging with waves in complex (cluttered) environments. The topic lies at the
interface where mathematics meets physics, probability, numerical simulations,
and signal processing. The research is driven by challenges in application areas
such as ground penetrating radar, satellite imaging and tracking through
atmospheric turbulence, nondestructive ultrasonic testing of materials such as
aging concrete, imaging in shallow water, and underground exploration. Complex
media are ubiquitous in such applications and pose a serious impediment to the
imaging process, which is largely ignored by the present imaging technology.
Moreover, computer modeling of wave propagation in complex media is faced with
formidable computational challenges. Mathematical analysis is needed to unravel
the complicated scattering effects of such media so that the present imaging
technology can be advanced. This project seeks to analyze long-range propagation
of sound and electromagnetic waves in complex media that may also vary in time,
develop novel adaptive imaging methodologies that mitigate the medium scattering
effects, and propose new measurement setups that can improve the imaging
process.

Complex environments are naturally modeled with random processes, and the wave
equation has random coefficients and boundaries. The propagation of uncertainty
from these random processes to the uncertainty of the waves measured in imaging
applications is a highly non-trivial problem. One goal of the project is to
develop a better understanding of this problem for the acoustic wave equation
and Maxwell's system of equations. The mathematics is a combination of
asymptotic stochastic analysis and invariant imbedding for studying transmission
and reflection operators. The project considers mixing random processes that are
static or may vary in time. The time variations are studied in various setups,
with both rapid and slow time changes with respect to the duration of pulses
emitted by sensors that probe the complex environment. Another goal of the
project is to develop a novel robust and adaptive imaging methodology in complex
environments. The methods should be able to detect the loss of coherence of the
measured waves due to scattering in the environment and to enhance the signal to
noise ratio by filtering the components of the fields that are useless in
imaging. The analysis of the imaging methods seeks a resolution theory that
quantifies the focusing of images and their statistical stability.
