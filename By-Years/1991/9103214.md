In this project the principal investigator will continue his work on orthogonal
polynomials and integrals associated to Coxeter groups and root systems by means
of a parametrized commutative algebra of differential-difference operators. In
particular, he will look at the intertwining operator which relates these
algebras for different parameter values. This operator is conjectured to be a
new type of fractional integral operator supported by a subset of the group
algebra. There is a relationship to Poisson kernels that could lead to explicit
integral forms. The principal investigator is analyzing orthogonal polynomials
that are associated to Coxeter groups and their root systems, in order to study
questions involving differential- difference operators, kernels of integral
operators, and special functions associated with the Laplace operator.
Orthogonal polynomials arise in an essential way in a number of different areas,
such as numerical analysis, approximation theory and differential equations. In
this project the principal investigator will use the algebraic structure
associated with these polynomials to extend our knowledge of the symmetry
properties of the polynomials.
