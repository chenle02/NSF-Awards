There are fundamental problems to speeding up CPUs beyond what is
&lt;br/&gt;possible today. Because individual transistors are not getting any
&lt;br/&gt;faster, manufacturers like Intel and AMD are no longer able to get
&lt;br/&gt;massive performance improvements just by increasing clock speeds
&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., going from 2GHz to 10GHz). To overcome this, future CPUs will
&lt;br/&gt;contain hundreds to thousands of smaller computational cores on a
&lt;br/&gt;single chip which will all run at the speed similar to current
&lt;br/&gt;processors (e.g., 2GHz). This means that each single core will only
be &lt;br/&gt;as powerful as current CPUs, but that the total aggregate power of
all &lt;br/&gt;the cores will be significantly more than what is possible today.
An &lt;br/&gt;important problem with the advent of these new CPUs is that the
&lt;br/&gt;database systems that are used in all aspects of our society are
&lt;br/&gt;ill-suited for this change. Such database systems are used to store
&lt;br/&gt;and access data for a variety of applications, including on-line
&lt;br/&gt;business (e.g., Google, Facebook), scientific instruments (e.g.,
&lt;br/&gt;astronomical telescopes), and medicine (e.g., MRI scanners). The
&lt;br/&gt;reason that they are not ready to handle these new "many-core CPUs"
is &lt;br/&gt;because most of them use ideas that were designed in the 1970s and
&lt;br/&gt;1980s when processors only had a single core. Thus, the purpose of
&lt;br/&gt;this project is to develop both software and hardware technologies
&lt;br/&gt;that will allow database systems to utilize the full computational
&lt;br/&gt;power of future CPU architectures. The results of this project will
&lt;br/&gt;enable organizations to deploy future applications on fewer machines
&lt;br/&gt;that use less energy than what is currently used
today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer architectures are moving towards an era
dominated by &lt;br/&gt;many-core machines with hundreds of cores on a single
chip. This &lt;br/&gt;unprecedented level of on-chip parallelism introduces a
new dimension &lt;br/&gt;to scalability that current database management systems
(DBMSs) were &lt;br/&gt;not designed for. In particular, it becomes exceedingly
difficult for &lt;br/&gt;the DBMS to perform concurrency control, logging, and
indexing &lt;br/&gt;efficiently. With hundreds of threads running in parallel,
the &lt;br/&gt;complexity of coordinating competing reads and writes to data
&lt;br/&gt;diminishes the benefits of increased core counts. Thus, in this
&lt;br/&gt;project the PIs propose to develop a software-hardware co-design
approach &lt;br/&gt;for DBMSs in the many-core era. On the software side, rather
than &lt;br/&gt;attempting to remove scalability bottlenecks of existing DBMS
&lt;br/&gt;architectures through incremental improvements, the PIs seek a
bottom-up &lt;br/&gt;approach where the architecture is designed to target many-
core &lt;br/&gt;systems from inception. On the hardware side, instead of simply
adding &lt;br/&gt;more cores to a single chip, the PIs will design new hardware
components &lt;br/&gt;that can unburden the software system from computationally
critical &lt;br/&gt;tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see
