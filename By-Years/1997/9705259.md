w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9705259 Krim This experimental research project
focuses on the atomic scale understanding of frictional phenomena, including
those at liquid- solid interfaces. A set of experiments involving quartz crystal
microbalance (QCM) studies of friction in controlled environmental conditions
and well-defined contact geometries will be performed. Some of these seek to
explore the fundamental mechanisms of energy transfer at a sliding interface,
while others will investigate model lubrication systems which are of relevance
to actual engineering applications. One system to be studied consists of
selected rare gas and alkane layers sliding on clean (111) metal surfaces. Model
lubrication systems under study include atomically-uniform C60 surfaces in
contact with a liquid; and hexanes and synthetic lubricants in contact with
atomically uniform metal surfaces. In the latter systems properties of interest
include the viscosity and slippage of molecularly thin lubricant layers forming
immediately adjacent to the surface, topics which are related to the performance
of a lubricant in the transition region between elastohydrodynamic and boundary
lubrication. %%% This experimental research project is devoted to improving the
scientific understanding of friction forces and related heating effects. An
understanding of these effects on the basic atomic scale is sought, making use
of advanced experimental techniques, including the quartz crystal microbalance
(QCM) which can detect single atomic monolayers. The work focuses on mechanisms
of energy transfer during sliding friction; and the viscous and elastic
properties of liquid lubricants close to a solid surface. Improvements in
understanding here can be of great importance, because the range of technology
involving mechanical motions is broad and has great economic importan ce. The
work is interdisciplinary in its nature and the graduate students in this
program will receive an excellent education preparing them for employment in
industry, government or education. ***
