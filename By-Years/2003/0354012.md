This chemistry award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
site at the University of Connecticut for the summers of 2004-2006. The program
director is Amy R. Howell assisted by co-PI, Robert K. Bohn. Ten students,
including two students from Central Connecticut State University will
participate in a ten-week program. Students primarily from regional (New
England, NY, NJ, PA) non-PhD granting institutions, minority serving
institutions and women-only colleges will be targeted for participation.
Chemistry faculty from the University of Connecticut and Central Connecticut
State University will serve as mentors. Research projects are broadly chemical
in focus (for ex. organic, bioorganic, physical, chemical physics, inorganic,
bioinorganic, biological, analytical, instrumentation, polymer). The program
will be supplemented by seminars on chemical databases, careers, ethics,
communicating results and ethics. The program culminates in student oral
presentations and a poster symposium.
