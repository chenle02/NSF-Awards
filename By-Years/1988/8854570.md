The object of this project is to provide self-study resources for students who
perceive that their preparation for design courses is inadequate in some
respects. The same resources can give information in depth to more advanced
engineering students. A computer-based system that will allow students to design
components, to choose methods of assembly, and to select data is to be
developed. Such a system gives information presently not available in any one
textbook, and could provide remedial and advanced guidance for freshmen and more
advanced students. It is capable of continual updating and enhancement.
