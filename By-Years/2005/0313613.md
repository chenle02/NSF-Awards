This Travel Grant will provide partial support for 6 to 8 US scientists to
attend the 27th NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Intrinsic Localized Modes and
Discrete Breathers in Nonlinear Lattices, Erice, Sicily, July 21-27, 2003. The
workshop deals with properties of condensed matter that occur in materials that
have a regular lattice structure but that are spatially discrete. In such
systems, nonlinear models must replace the linear models of the last century.
The nonlinearity introduces fundamentally new phenomena, such as "intrinsic
localized modes" and "discrete breathers". This Advanced Research Workshop is
intended to bring together in a workshop forum both junior and senior workers to
discuss the common research topic of intrinsic localization of vibrational,
atomic and spin energy, electric charge, electromagnetic energy and magnetic
flux in nonlinear, spatially discrete systems from the theoretical, numerical,
and experimental perspectives. The Travel Grant will enable six to eight
scientists from the US to travel, attend the workshop and interact with other
scientists in this field, which spans a wide area of physical and biological
sciences.
