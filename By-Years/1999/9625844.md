This project focuses on algorithms that work with limited information. This
research investigates on-line algorithms in the context of various resource
allocation problems in operating systems. This project is taking a twofold
approach to each problem. The first approach is to perform a theoretical study
using competitive analysis. The competitive measure is used to evaluate on-line
algorithms by measuring their performance in relation to the optimal off-line
algorithm which has available to it complete information about the problem
instance at hand. This effort plans to perform empirical tests to evaluate the
performance of various on-line algorithms in a realistic setting. The first two
problems addressed in this project are related to memory management. The first
of these addresses ways in which information about the access pattern of a
program available at compile time can be used to guide page replacement and
prefetching policies. The investigator will develop methods which can take a
program and automatically generate appropriate memory management instructions to
be inserted in the code. The second problem addresses allocating memory
resources among users in a multiprocessing environment. This work addresses this
problem for general multiprocessing environments as well as methods specifically
designed for database systems. The third problem examines preemptive load
balancing strategies over local area networks under a probabilistic model for
process duration. The last problem is an investigation of disk scheduling
strategies. This work is motivated by the fact that the availability of larger
cheap memory has made it possible to have long queues of disk updates which
means that more sophisticated scheduling policies can have a greater impact on
disk utilization. ***
