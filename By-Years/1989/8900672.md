A REU Site is established to provide the undergraduate engineering student a
research experience in biophysical systems. The objectives of the program are to
1) develop in the student the ability to identify and creatively solve research
problems in biophysical systems, 2) provide research examples through seminars,
literature reviews and active interaction in research projects with faculty and
industrial personnel, and 3) enhance the written and oral communication ability
of participating students through presentation of research procedures and
findings. Educational programs including seminars, course work and stimulating
research projects have been planned to instill an interest and enthusiasm for
future research activities. Research projects include: biological signal
processing using vocalization, non-destructive contact measurements, thermal
properties of porous media, electronic image processing, spatial and spectral
information in water quality control, and stochastic process, risk analysis and
optimization.
