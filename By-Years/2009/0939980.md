These funds help support a series of workshops entitled the "Charles Keeling
Memorial Climate-Related Science and Policy Workshops" whose aim is to explore
the scientific underpinnings of natural and anthropogenic climate change as well
as potential strategies for adaptation and mitigation. Support of the workshops
continues a series of successful briefing for policy makers on Capitol Hill
organized by the American Meteorological Society (AMS) over the last few years.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid those who are interested in the content of the
workshops but cannot attend the briefings on Capitol Hill, the AMS will video
tape the workshops and make them publicly available on the AMS website. Such
workshops are timely because the science and policymaking communities are poised
to interact as never before as policymakers, worldwide, plan for action on
climate change. &lt;br/&gt;
