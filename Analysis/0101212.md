Abstract Lanzani

This project concerns several questions about integral representations for
holomorphic functions of one and several complex variables, related (singular)
integral boundary operators, and elliptic boundary value problems. The main
underlying theme consists of estimates of Cauchy singular integral operators
with focus on the case of domains with rough boundaries.

The crux of this project is the basic observation that it is often possible to
determine the values a certain function, say, f, takes inside, say, a ball, by
only measuring the values f takes on the surface of the ball, via the
computation of a (surface) integral involving the datum f and an auxiliary
function K ( the "kernel"). It may help to think of the value f at a point P as
the temperature at this point: by (easily) measuring temperature on the surface
of a ball (think of the ball as been made of a solid material, such as metal),
one can then find out the value of the temperature inside the ball without
having to reach the inside, simply by plotting the surface temperature data in
an integral formula, and then computing the integral. Because of the microscopic
nature of matter, it is much more natural to make these measurements and
calculations on a "rough" body, say a cube (which has corners and edges), than a
"smooth" ball. In the mathematical model, this new situation translates into
additional constraints on the kernel K which make it much harder to effectively
use K in the computation of the integrals. In this project we study certain
("complex")analogues of these mathematical models in the context of "rough"
domains.
