The Greater Kansas Area Security Workshop (KanSec) provides a regular forum for
researchers and students across Kansas and the neighboring states to present
research and educational activities in the field of cybersecurity, and to
promote interactions and collaborations. With three NSA/DHS National Centers of
Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) and IA Research
(CAE/R) in the State of Kansas, substantial cybersecurity research and
educational activities are taking place. KanSec was formed to encourage
collaboration despite the geographical remoteness of the area. The first two
KanSec workshops, in Spring and Fall 2012 respectively, included over 50
participants each, with about 10 student presentations at each event. The next
workshop is scheduled to be hosted at the University of Kansas in the Spring of
2013, and has received inquiries about participation from universities in
neighboring states including Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Arkansas. To improve the
quality of the workshop and to give students better experiences, KanSec will
invite renowned researchers as keynote speakers for future KanSec
workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports student travel to the KanSec
workshops in spring and fall 2013.
