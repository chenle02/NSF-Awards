Program Director's Recommendation Center for Integrative Materials Joining
Science for Energy Applications (CIMJSEA) Proposal #1330273, 1330986

This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Integrative Materials Joining
Science for Energy Applications (CIMJSEA) located at the Ohio State University,
and Lehigh University. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized
by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to
submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research.

The research described in this proposal will provide fundamental insights into
the causes of reduced creep life in welds of modern superalloys that have severe
crystallographic gradients (equiaxed and columnar), compositional gradients
(microns to nm), and precipitate (0 to 80%) gradients. The ultimate goal is to
develop the testing methodology that will feed the creation of digital "apps"
that predict the creep response of welded structures. The ability to predict
localized deformation in welds will accelerate the deployment of high
temperature materials. Successful deployment will lead to higher energy
efficiency of utilities and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

The results of this research will provide an important step to improve the
understanding of the relatively poor joint properties. This will pave the way
for developing solutions so that new materials can be used to their fullest
capacity in future generation power plants. The research conducted along the way
will also provide an opportunity to train engineers who will be prepared to
address these complex problems in materials for energy applications. Potential
benefits to member organizations include deployment of digital apps for welds,
capable of predicting the local properties as a function of crystallographic,
compositional and microstructural gradients.
