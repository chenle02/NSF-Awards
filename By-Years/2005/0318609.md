With National Science Foundation support, the Empirical Methods in Cognitive
Linguistics Workshop brings together a large group of linguists and
psychologists from around the world (plus three-dozen selected graduate
students). Thw workshop, organized by Dr. Michael Spivey, demonstrates state-of-
art empirical methods in Cognitive Linguistics. The research progrm of Cognitive
Linguistics breaks from tradition with it's claim that language is NOT an
encapsulated function of the mind. Language intertwines with perception, action,
and cognition, all of which hsape language acquistion and ordinary discourse.

The workshop consists of 10 faculty-led sessions that include instruction in
statistical analyses of natural langage corpora and hands-on training in
laboratory protocols (e.g. verbal protocol, reaction-time tasks, eye-tracking,
neuroimaging). The purpose is to cross-pollinate the disciplines of Linguistics
and Psychology. The explicit goal of the workshop is to instill shared knowledge
research strategies allows for shared intuitions in how to conduct impirical
studies of language. To that end, one session focuses exclusively on the
logistics and infrasturcture of international collaborations.

INTELLECTUAL MERITS of the workshop include an unprecedented sharing of
experimental methods and solutions and a focus on training of graduate students.
In additon to the plenary speaker, Dr. Leonard Talmy, a long list of highly
respected cognitive linguists and experimental psychologists will be attending
as session-leaders and as particpants.

BROADER IMPACTS of the workshop include structured opportunities to form new
international and interdisciplinary collaborations between linguists and
psychologists and a unique opportunity for training of graduate students.
