Chemical mediation of linkages among species at different trophic levels is an
important characteristic of ecosystems. This proposal examines a sedimentary
community dominated at middle trophic levels by organisms which produce toxins
that influence higher and lower trophic levels. The exudation of the toxin
monobromophenol by the polychaete worm Notomastus lobatus into the sediment is
hypothesized to influence the activity and composition of the microbial
community, recruitment of infauna, and predation/disturbance by sediment feeding
predators. Experiments are proposed which examine the dose response of
functional groups and the total community of bacteria to monobromophenol,
allelochemical inhibition of larval settlement and adult activity of infauna,
and the relationship of predator activity to the presence of monobromophenol in
the sediment.
