This award supports cooperative research in computational mechanics between
Luis Caffarelli and Antony Jameson of the Institute for Advanced Study and
Sergio Idelsohn and Nestor Aguilera of the Association for Mechanical
Computation in Argentina. The research will be in the field of computational
aerodynamics with the objective of developing accurate and efficient methods of
predicting aerodynamic flows around aircraft or their principal components. This
work will continue productive ongoing research on free boundary problems which
arise in several contexts including flame propagation. Caffarelli and Aguilera
will concentrate on the free boundary problems and their singular perturbations,
in particular the uniform behavior of level surfaces and the stability of
numerical methods of calculation. Jameson and Idelsohn on the other hand will
center their work on flows with small viscosity and their limits using numerical
techniques, symmetrization of operators, local variational principles and finite
element methods.
