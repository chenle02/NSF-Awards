This award to the Human Relations Area Files, a not-for-profit research
institute in New Haven, CT. which specializes in cross- cultural research, will
fund a major conference to assess the past, present and future of cross-cultural
and comparative research. Twenty-five leading scholars in this research
tradition will gather to assess what has been accomplished, to evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of varying research traditions, to develop agendas for
furthering the comparative study of culture, and to resolve disagreements among
comparative researchers by involving researchers with different viewpoints in
collaborative papers. The conference will produce a summary of the proceedings
in a major journal, and a book-length manuscript consisting of the conference
papers. This research is important because the explanation of the similarities
and differences in human society and culture is critical to our understanding of
ourselves as human beings. This conference should produce an evaluation of the
state-of-the-art in this research tradition, with prescriptions for future
directions for research. The Human Relations Area Files is the leading
repository of cross-cultural research materials, and is the appropriate
organization to host and organize the conference.
