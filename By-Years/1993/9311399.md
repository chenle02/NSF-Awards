The Chemistry Division's Office of Special Projects makes this award to Purdue
University to support a second Workshop for underrepresented minority
undergraduate chemistry majors. The Workshop will be held on July 9-11,1993. The
previous first-of-its-kind Workshop was extremely successful at elicting the
opportunities available to individuals who pursue advanced study in chemistry.
The objective continues to be to bring minority students from throughout the USA
together with high-achieving minority mentors from industry, academia and
government in order to introduce the students to the opportunities created by
obtaining a Ph.D degree in Chemistry. The Workshop will also include
opportunities for the student participants to visit advanced research
laboratories and to meet graduate students. %%% This Workshop will provide
underrepresented minority students with the opportunity to meet peer mentors who
have shared the same obstacles in their lives and education. These contacts are
intended to continue throughout their academic careers and hopefully, well into
their professional lives.
