When a mixture is fed to a packed bed of sorbent, the components in the mixture
can be partitioned into separate and adjacent bands in the bed under certain
"favorable" conditions. The most important favorable condition is the concave-
type isotherm (i.e., Langmuirian). Fortunately, the adsorption of almost all
biocompounds on immobilized enzyme sorbents are Langmurian. A "displacer" is
needed after the injection of feed. The displacer must adsorb more strongly than
all components in the feed mixture and must be easily desorbed later. Upon the
injection of the displacer, the components are eluted sequentially from the bed.
This technique, called displacement chromatography, has been recently developed
by Horvath and coworkers (including the P.I.) into small-scale commerical
separations in pharmaceutical industry. The P.I. proposes to extend the work to
larger and high concentrations of peptides and proteins, and to refine the
theoretical work to include axial dispersion and mass transfer resistances.
