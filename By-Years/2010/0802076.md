The general theme of this project is to investigate methods to create,
distribute, and store quantum mechanical states by exploring entanglement
between light and matter with ensembles of ultracold atoms. Entanglement, one of
the most striking features of quantum mechanics, leads to strong correlations
between separate components of a physical system, regardless of the distance
separating them. The first specific goal of the project is to develop methods of
creating robust entanglement between light and matter with ensembles of
ultracold atoms. This project builds upon previously realized entanglement of
mixed species atomic "quantum bits" (called qubits) and frequency-encoded
photonic qubits. The approach avoids the use of two interferometrically separate
paths for qubit entanglement distribution. The second goal is to realize matter-
light entanglement at telecommunications wavelengths as an enabling technology
to distribute and store entanglement over long distances. The final component of
the program involves investigations of dynamics of the entangled systems
subjected to continuous measurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achieving these goals
should significantly develop atomic physics-based methods for the processing of
quantum information. The program involves extensive undergraduate and graduate
student training and participation in technologically important areas of
physics. The project will include outreach to the Atlanta community through
laboratory tours and summer workshops for local high-school
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
