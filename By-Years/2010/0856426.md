The objective of this award is to investigate the concept of new characteristic
length scale by establishing its existence, its dependence on processing
conditions, and its effects on surface morphologies. Crystalline nanorods are on
the order of 100 nm in diameter, and many surface features have similar
dimension. It is interesting to note that the origin of this dimension remains
unknown while nanorods fabrication has become a routine practice. This project
focuses on the very origin of this dimension. The hypothesis is that this
dimension is characteristic of surface atomic islands that are bounded by
multiple layers. Aiming to confirm this hypothesis, the proposed research uses
density-functional-theory based ab initio calculations, classical molecular
mechanics simulations, and lattice kinetic Monte Carlo simulations; and takes
simple metals Cu and Au as the prototype materials. If successful, the
established concept of new characteristic length scale on surfaces will
represent a new addition to surface science. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to the
benefit to scientific communities, the success of this award will also provide a
new means of controlling surface roughness, or surface morphology in general.
For example, understanding the complete set of surface characteristic length
scales will enable science-based design of reading head of hard disk drives,
that of crystalline nanorods, and that of catalysts for sustainable energy
applications. The award will also provide an opportunity for the education of
undergraduate and graduate students, including an underrepresented minority
graduate student in this case. &lt;br/&gt;
