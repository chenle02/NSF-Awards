This CAREER grant to a young faculty member at Hampton University supports her
efforts to utilize the Compton backscattering of laser light from high energy
electron beams from CEBAF to produce high energy polarized photons for
experiments in medium energy nuclear physics. The technique will also enable her
to determine the electron beam energy to an absolute accuracy of one part in ten
thousand. Prof. Keppel's educational effort is aimed at interesting and
encouraging young women at the middle school level into science careers.
