World-Wide Web searchers are often frustrated by a lack of relevant results, or
more often, overwhelmed by a result set that is too large to examine for
relevancy. With hundreds of millions of queries performed each day, query logs
provide a new source of knowledge for this project to learn how users search,
what people are searching for, and provide suggestions to future searchers. The
goals of this project are to learn what people search for on the Web; to provide
query suggestions for uncertain or inexperienced searchers; and, to offer
relevant query terms for search engine optimization of a website. To these ends,
the bipartite graph of queries and their results are analyzed to identify useful
query-query and document-document relationships; queries are clustered into
topics, using the new relationships as well as more traditional sources of
information; existing information retrieval techniques are adapted to help
identify, organize, and track not simply query popularity, but topic popularity;
and, information from query logs is utilized to help find preferred queries that
express a similar information need. The broader impacts of this work are two-
fold. By exploiting the untapped information present in Web search engine query
traces, this project increases the understanding of how people search on the Web
and for what they are looking. This knowledge is applied to generate algorithms
and tools to support searchers as well as those who want to be found by those
searchers. These tools, as well as datasets collected or generated, will be made
available to the research community via the project Web site
