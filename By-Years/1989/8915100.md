This fellowship award will support study of the Japanese language by an American
scientist or engineer by providing a stipend, tuition, and other course-related
expenses. The objectives of the fellowships are to enable active U.S. scientists
and engineers to acquire sufficient familiarity with the language and customs of
Japan to allow them to function independently there; or to acquire sufficient
expertise in reading Japanese to be able to understand technical abstracts in
their field of interest. There is a critical need for more effective technical
communication between American and Japanese researchers. This award is intended
to help remove language and cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese cooperative
research and to facilitate science and technology exchange.
