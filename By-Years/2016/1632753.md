This award will support a conference "Perspectives on integral geometry" which
will take place at the University of Georgia in Athens, GA on May 30 - June 3,
2016. Despite its long history, only in the past few decades, and especially
since the turn of the century, has integral geometry begun to mature as a
coherent mathematical subject, both in its internal development as a part of
pure mathematics and externally as a source of powerful tools for scientific
applications. This conference will bring together researchers working in all of
the major strands of the subject, with the aim of catalyzing further progress.

Alesker's theory of valuations has provided a penetrating new language that has
greatly enhanced the depth and effectiveness of the traditional ideas on
integral geometry, growing mainly from Blaschke's famous kinematic formulas. At
the same time, integral geometry has found new applications in stochastic
analysis and data compression. The aim of the conference is to bring all of the
major contemporary strands of the subject together in order to promote further
internal development, to explore connections with other parts of pure
mathematics, and to enhance the effectiveness of applications to science and
technology.
