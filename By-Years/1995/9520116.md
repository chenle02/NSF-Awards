9520116 balantekin This grant provides 5,060 to the Gordon Research Conference
on Nuclear Physics, to be held at the Tilton School, Tilton, New Hampshire, July
23-28, 1995. The requested funds will be used to provide support for 11 young
scientist to attend the conference whose theme will be "QCD in Nuclear Physics
and Astrophysics", an extension of the concept that was extremely successful in
1991 and 1993. The program will emcompass a broad array of topics in nuclear
physics in which fundamental theory of the strong interaction, QCD, plays a
significant role. New experimental results on the spin structure functions of
the neutron, lattice QCD, relativistic heavy ion reactions, neutrino physics,
the role of nuclear physics cosmology, and other topics will be available for
discussion. ***
