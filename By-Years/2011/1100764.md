The objective of this research is to model the effect of aerodynamic damping on
the dynamics and stability of flapping flight, based on our recent discovery of
flapping counter torques and flapping counter forces. We will undertake a
combined experiment and analytical method, including aerodynamic force
measurements using dynamically scale robotic wings, flow visualization and
measurement using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry, and mathematical modeling
based on dynamics and control theories.

This work will advance scientific bases and develop comprehensive theories of
flapping flight in animals and man-made systems. It is the first attempt to
model the flapping flight dynamics under different flight conditions and the
first step in explaining why flying animals possesses both superior stability
and maneuverability. The research results will be disseminated broadly to the
biology, physics, and engineering communities. The theories developed in this
work can be translated into other forms of locomotion such as walking, crawling
and swimming. Advances in flapping wing micro aerial vehicles can be used in
various civilian and defense applications. The project will provide a unique,
interdisciplinary training environment for graduate and undergraduate students.
In particular, the undergraduate researchers will participate through Purdue
SURF and NSF REU programs.
