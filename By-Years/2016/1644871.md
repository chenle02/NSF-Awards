This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Conference on Infinite-Dimensional Analysis" that will be held October 28-30,
2016, on the campus of Kent State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective
of this conference is to bring the participants up to date on the latest
developments in infinite-dimensional holomorphy, with special emphasis on the
interplay between operator theory, the geometric theory of Banach spaces, spaces
of multilinear mappings and polynomials, linear dynamics, and lineability and
universality. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate
students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work. More
details about the conference can be found at: http://www.math.kent.edu/~zvavitch
