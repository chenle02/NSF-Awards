This project examines NSF-funded project-level evaluations of the REU and RET
programs which either bring undergraduates or teachers together for summer
research experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a
systematic review tool that incorporates the Program Evaluation Accuracy
Standards and moves beyond them to attend to effects on student learning. Using
the methodology of meta-evaluation, the project will (1) describe and assess the
quality of REU and RET evaluations, (2) test the feasibility of synthesizing and
generalizing across evaluations to support conclusions about program-level
effectiveness, and (3) lay the groundwork for a resource to build evaluation
capacity and align the evaluation needs of local projects and the national
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU and RET projects represent an important
set of activities across the NSF. This exploratory study will determine the
degree to which the evaluations of these projects can be used to make statements
about the effectiveness of these projects overall.
