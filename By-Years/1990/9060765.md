There is an increasing need for improvements in the fabrication of small
diameter orifices in hardened metal components. This need is particularly acute
in the fabrication of fuel injectors for gasoline and diesel engines. In those
engines, the injectors are used to both meter and atomize the fuel. For a given
pressure drop, the flow through the injector orifices varies inversely with the
fourth power of the orifice diameter. Therefore, small variations in hole
diameter result in large variations in flow. Existing microdrilling techniques
(EDM, laser and electron beam drilling, and others) have marginal accuracy and
produce a rough recast layer which results in burrs at the inlet an exit of the
orifices. Poor injector hole quality leads to variations in fuel-to-air ratio
resulting in poor engine performance and increased pollution. This research
addresses an improved microdrilling process. The process is a derivative of
electrochemical machining (ECM) and has the potential to produce burr-free holes
with tight dimensional control and low cycle times. This technique would reduce
costs and improve the productivity and quality of the injector manufacturing
process.
