The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to enhance
scientific and technological understanding in selective harvesting of high-value
crops such as strawberry. The innovation proposed here will be a key component
in creating a compact economically viable autonomous strawberry harvesting
robot. The technology developed in this project will help address the farming
labor shortage which is experienced by farmers more and more each year.
Agricultural robotics market is estimated to be $11.9 billion by 2026. Providing
autonomous harvesting robots will enable farmers to grow more crops with less
business risks related to manual labor shortages and will ensure that US farmers
remain competitive, while creating more skilled, highly paid
jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project will develop critical technologies for delicate selective
harvesting of fragile crops such as strawberries at a competitive pace. Recent
advancements in computer vision object detection and three-dimensional scene
reconstruction will be used to create near real-time operational scenes. Those
scenes will be used to detect ripe berries, create a movement path and navigate
the fast and precise robot arm for harvesting the berries without damaging
fruits while avoiding obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
