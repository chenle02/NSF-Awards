This project deals with extending some general and classic deterministic
combinatorial optimization problems to include probabilistic elements.
Specifically, the extensions will address the shortest path, assignment, minimum
spanning tree, traveling salesman, and vehicle routing problems. The study will
explore solution characteristics and procedures. Amedes Odini is an accomplished
researcher in transportation networks. MIT provides an excellent environment for
conducted such work: The results are important and promising. An award for a
one-year period is highly recommended.
