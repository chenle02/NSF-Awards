One of the main problems in complex geometric analysis is to detect the
existence of "canonical" Kahler metrics in a given class on a compact complex
(Kahler) manifold. In particular one seeks necessary and sufficient conditions
for the existence of a Kahler Einstein metric on a Fano manifold. The presence
of positive curvature makes this extremely difficult to answer and has led to a
striking series of conjectures which relate the existence of these special
metrics (solutions to the complex Monge-Ampere equation, a fully non-linear
p.d.e ) to the algebraic geometry of the pluri-anticanonical images of the
manifold. This geometry was suspected to be related to Mumford's deep "Geometric
Invariant Theory". Recently this speculation has been completely justified by
the PI (building upon work of Gang Tian) and it is the aim of this proposal to
finish the proof of the "standard conjectures" in the Fano case and to develop
and extend the entire Theory in the context of representations of algebraic
groups. Here the PI hopes to make contact with Mikio Sato's beautiful theory of
prehomogeneous vector spaces.

Broadly speaking, there are two ways to mathematically approach, or model, a
given problem: continuously, or discretely. These approaches are traditionally
mutually exclusive. Analysis (differential equations in particular) is the time
honored subject in the continuous domain, combinatorics and algebra (the study
of enumerating a finite amount of data) is the hallmark of the discrete
approach. In this proposal these two methods come together-the PI will explore
the question of how the solution to an equation from analysis might be obtained
by an infinite sequence of a purely finite (but large) collection of data. The
equation arose in Einsteins' theory of Gravitation, whereas the finite set of
data (hyperdiscriminants and resultants) arose in the work of Arthur Cayley a
great Victorian era English mathematician.
