This U.S.-Czech mathematics project is a cooperative effort between Thomas Lada
at North Carolina State University and James Stasheff of the University of North
Carolina with their counterpart in Prague, Martin Markl at the Mathematical
Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Their goal is to clarify the
homotopy invariance properties of various algebraic structures. To do so they
intend to utilize operads to study the question of homotopy invariance in
several algebraic settings. While homotopy invariant structures in the
topological setting have been well studied, similar questions in algebraic
settings still require attention. The problems to be investigated by this
U.S.-Czech team deal with the category of strongly homotopy algebras and their
homotopy theoretic properties. If successful, their investigation will integrate
these ideas with several sophisticated algebraic structures that arise in
mathematical physics. Results should improve the theoretical underpinning for
cross-disciplinary advances in perturbation theory and deformation quantization.

This international project in topology fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
