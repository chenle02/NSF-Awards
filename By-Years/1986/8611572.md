Analysis of multi-body systems requires formulation of mixed systems of
differential equations of motion of non-linear algebraic equations of
constraint. It is not possible to solve these equations in real-time using
serial computers. The PI has derived a novel formulation of the equations of
motion for constrained mechanical systems, using tools of variational and vector
calculus. The feasibility and applicability of parallelism for this new class of
algorithms for machine dynamics to speedup the solution will be explored. The
possibility of real-time dynamic analysis would enable the human to be part of
an inter-active design environment for complex dynamic systems, for example in
vehicle simulation. The potential exists for automatic generation of the
equations for solution purposes.
