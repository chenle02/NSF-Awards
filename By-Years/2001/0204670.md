The adequate numerical treatment of nonlinear phenomena&lt;br/&gt;governed by
partial differential equations with several disparate&lt;br/&gt;scales is a
formidable computational challenge. Modern algorithms&lt;br/&gt;should be able
to resolve fine scales for certain physical&lt;br/&gt;quantities without
overresolving others, thereby optimizing the&lt;br/&gt;computational effort and
making realistic 3d simulations&lt;br/&gt;feasible. Epitaxial and crystal growth
in materials science, and&lt;br/&gt;viscous incompressible fluids are typical
yet quite distinct&lt;br/&gt;examples addressed in this proposal. The goal of
this project is&lt;br/&gt;to design, test, and analyze reliable and efficient
adaptive&lt;br/&gt;finite element methods for such problems, with space-time
error&lt;br/&gt;control and based on refinement/coarsening mesh
modification.&lt;br/&gt;This project blends quite delicate analytical and
computational&lt;br/&gt;issues, and applies them to free boundary problems,
constrained&lt;br/&gt;problems, geometric PDE and the Navier-Stokes equations
of&lt;br/&gt;incompressible fluids.&lt;br/&gt; Scientific computing has joined
theory and experiment to&lt;br/&gt;form together the three central aspects of
scientific inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;The current strengths in computational mathematics
draw on the&lt;br/&gt;widespread acceptance of computational modeling as a
complement&lt;br/&gt;to, and even a replacement for, physical tests in a broad
number&lt;br/&gt;of fields. In this vein, the investigator develops reliable
and&lt;br/&gt;efficient computational tools that may be useful in several
areas&lt;br/&gt;of strategic importance such as nanotechnology,
materials&lt;br/&gt;science, and high-performance computing. This project is
a&lt;br/&gt;collaborative endeavor, involving a number of scientists in
the&lt;br/&gt;US and abroad, as well as several students and postdocs.
A&lt;br/&gt;substantial effort is devoted to education and human
resource&lt;br/&gt;development.&lt;br/&gt;
