9614779 Nyblade This research involves the study of the crust and upper mantle
structure in the Afar Triangle region of Ethiopia, a locus of a postulated
mantle plume. Models of mantle plume structure will be tested by examining the
seismic velocity structure in the upper mantle of the region. The classic mantle
plume model would predict that upper mantle seismic velocities will be lower and
the crust will be thinner at the center of the plume where it intersects the
earth's surface. Data will be used from two WWSSN stations in the region, Addis
Ababa and Dijbouti for earthquakes recorded between 1994 and 1997. ***
