This renewal grant will assess the role of the Southern Ocean in changing the
vertical nutrient tracer distributions during the last glacial maximum and the
last deglaciation. To understand this completely, one must understand the role
of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) on the Antarctic Intermediate Water
(AAIW). According, the chemical history of pure (AAIW) will be reconstructed
using cores collected off the western Tasmanian slope. A number of key points
can be answered, including the amount of CO2 pumped to the atmosphere via the
AAIW, the history of the Southern Ocean nutrient chemistry and production can be
evaluated, etc.
