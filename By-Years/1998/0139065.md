The PI proposes to operate the liquid Xenon detector developed by the
UCLA/Torino group over a period of several years. The detector is designed to
identify rare nuclear recoil events in a liquid xenon chamber. Performance data
from this 30Kg detector will provide key R&D information for a future full-scale
dark matter detector.
