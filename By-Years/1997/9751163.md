Molecular structure is of central importance in all chemical research. Since the
1950s, two techniques have revolutionized the science of structure
determination: x-ray crystallography, particularly with the development of
direct methods, and nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This project
incorporates modern NMR into the undergraduate curriculum and undergraduate
research. NMR experiments and theory of increasing sophistication are introduced
starting in the sophomore year. Among the undergraduate research that uses NMR
are projects in environmental toxicology and art conservation. *
