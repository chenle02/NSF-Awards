This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of Professor Yue L. Tong
of Purdue University. Dr. Tong's project has two parts. The first is to apply
methods that he and D. Toledo developed some years ago in a purely geometric
setting, to the problem of verifying the Beilinson-Shechtman conjecture in
mathematical physics. This involves getting further refinements of the classical
Riemann-Roch Theorem, beyond those developed by Grothendieck over twenty years
ago. The second part of Dr. Tong's project is to study harmonic forms and their
dual geometric cycles in locally symmetric spaces. The examples and the insights
derived will be important tools in attacking the Hodge Con- jecture. This is
research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and Topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in Physics,
theoretical Computer Science, and Robotics.
