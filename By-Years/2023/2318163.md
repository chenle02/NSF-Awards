This award supports registration fees and other associated costs for graduate
students, as well as for female and under-represented minority participants who
are in need of financial support, to attend and present at the 2024
International Conference on Quantum Fluids and Solids (QFS), which will be held
in Jacksonville, Florida. The conference will bring together a community of
students and scientists to discuss a broad range of condensed matter systems
that exhibit quantum mechanical effects at the macroscopic level, including
superfluids, superconductors and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
