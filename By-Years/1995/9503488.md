9503488 Flowers In this project analytical and experimental techniques are
developed for the active control of disk and blade vibrations using magnetic
bearings. Vibration of bladed-disk assemblies is a significant problem in
turbomachinery. Fatigue failures induced by excessive vibration is a major cause
of turbomachine failures. The noise that results from flow-induced blade
vibration is a significant factor in the environmental impact of aircraft
engines. In view of these concerns, strategies are developed to alleviate blade
fatigue and vibration induced noise. Influences of nonlinearities arising from
aeroelastic effects, from rotor support structure, and from magnetic bearings
are considered, and nonstationary excitations due to variations in rotor speeds
are examined. The research results are also applicable to vibration control of
high speed machining.***
