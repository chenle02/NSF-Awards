This project funds the acquisition of five Process Simulator instrumentation
trainers. The College's Engineering Department has modified the electro-
mechanical curriculum and introduced appropriate equipment for laboratory
exercises to more directly focus on instrumentation training. The introduction
of this equipment allows future graduates to enter the job market as
instrumentation technicians rather than trainees or other related
classifications. Employed instrumentation technicians are also served with
continuing education courses paralleling the content of regular curriculum
offerings. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
