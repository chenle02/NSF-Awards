9626824 Gotthelf This grant provides support for Season IV of The Magic School
Bus, the fully animated PBS series targeted at youth ages 6-9. Components of
Season IV will include 13 new episodes, educational support for teachers and
youth leaders, dissemination and presentations at major educational conferences,
promotion, and summative evaluation. The new programs will bring the total
number of programs to 54 making it possible to broadcast the series as a daily
strip without undue repeat broadcast which might cause the series to loose its
freshness. All of the current principal staff of the project will remain for the
fourth season. Cheryl Gotthelf will be PI and Executive Project Director. Jane
Startz will be Co-PI and Executive Producer for the series and Michael Templeton
will be a Co-PI and Science Content Director. Kristin Martin will continue as
Supervision Producer.
