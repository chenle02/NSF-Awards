Abstract

Award: DMS-0505835 Principal Investigator: Xiaobo Liu

These projects emphasize Gromov-Witten invariants of compact symplectic
manifolds, relations in the tautological rings of stable curves, and
interactions of these topics with integrable systems. Roughly speaking, primary
Gromov-Witten invariants count numbers of pseudo-holomorphic curves in compact
symplectic manifolds. A larger class of invariants, called descendent Gromov-
Witten invariants, can be defined by taking into consideration powers of first
Chern classes of some tautological line bundles over the moduli space of pointed
pseudo-holomorphic maps. In the case when the manifold is a point it was
conjectured by Witten and proved by Kontsevich that descendant Gromov-Witten
invariants are governed by the KdV hierarchy from integrable systems. The
principal investigator is pursuing generalizations of the Witten conjecture and
the Virasoro conjecture on by studying universal equations which come from
relations in the tautological rings of the moduli spaces of stable curves.

Geometric descriptions of classical or quantum mechanical systems are based in
symplectic geometry, which takes as its basic measurement the area of two-
dimensional surfaces. The Gromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic manifold can
be described as a family of number that count the number of surfaces of a nice
sort that satisfy certain constraints, such as intersecting specified subsets of
the manifold. Enumerative invariants of this kind are an ancient concern in
algebraic geometry, where we count the number of solutions to a system of
equations, and the subject was recently found to be connected to high energy
physical theory, where the partition functions of certain quantum systems on a
manifold have been found to be related to generating functions that collect
families of Gromov-Witten invariants into a manageable form.
