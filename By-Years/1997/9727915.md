9727915 Cornett The domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) is an increasingly
important human food source and a significant segment of the agricultural
economy of the United States. An important goal of animal agriculture is to
provide an abundant and economical food supply. Substantial economic gain could
be realized by developing better methods to control the growth and reproductive
processes in chickens. Vasotocin is an important peptide hormone produced in the
brain that may be central to attaining this goal This hormone is involved in a
number of functions including the regulation of blood pressure, water balance,
and egg-laying. Vasotocin is released into the blood stream and acts on target
organs (e.g. blood vessels, kidney, shell gland and brain) by binding to protein
receptors on the surface of responsive cells. These receptors, help produce
signals which ultimately cause the desired effect (e.g., increased blood
pressure by stimulating contraction of arteries, water retention by stimulating
the kidneys, or the laying of eggs by stimulating contraction of the shell
gland). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between vasotocin
and its receptors in non-mammalian vertebrates. Dr. Cornett will remedy this
problem. Using a variety of molecular techniques, he will isolate the genes that
encode vasotocin receptors. From the genes, the structures of the vasotocin
receptors will be determined. Dr. Cornett will then make use of this information
to establish a functional characteristics of the receptors. The cellular
processes that are activated by vasotocin receptors will be also be determined
using physiological techniques. Besides expanding our knowledge and
understanding of the action of this important neuropeptide and the physiology of
the domestic chicken, this research promises to provide novel new information
about how the genes encoding vasotocin receptors are turned on and off. It
follows that this new knowledge may provide insight into how this hormone sy
stem can be manipulated to improve egg and meat production.
