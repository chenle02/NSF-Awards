The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the work of Dr. Margaret Etter.
Etter, a professor of chemistry at the University of Minnesota, is investigating
how small molecules naturally organize themselves to form larger complexes.
These newly organized aggregates have the unique ability to trap smaller
molecules. This exciting area of chemistry is sometimes known as "host-guest"
chemistry in recognition of the unique ability of the large complexes (hosts) to
trap the smaller "guest" molecules, and is paving the way for the design of
molecules that can mimic the biological catalysts, enzymes. The work involves
the modelling, preparation, and characterization of hydrogen-bonded host-guest
structures called cyclamers. These aggregates are formed from self-assembling
smaller units through preferred hydrogen bonding interactions. Extensive
molecular modelling to predict cavity sizes will be experimentally tested by
examining the size of the guest molecules that the hosts can trap. Because of
the hydrogen-bonded interactions in the host-guest relationship, the specificity
expected should rival that from sigma-bonded macrocycles.
