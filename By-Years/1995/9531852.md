9531852 Chassignet This project is a contribution to the modeling component to
be carried out as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment (ACCE)
under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The focus will be on
upgrading existing isopycnal models, data assimilation, and integrating
different types of regional models. Comparisons will be made among different
modeling approaches in order to assess the strngths and weaknesses of each, and
to determine the best overall approach for including ocean variability in
climate modeling. Particular attention will be paid to assimilating, into the
models, data from the field phase of ACCE, as well as from historical data
bases. In this particular project, the PI will investigate the sensitivity of
the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to changes in forcing and
boundary conditions in a series of numerical experiments using the Miami
Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM). Specific applications will be made to
seasonal and decadal variability.
