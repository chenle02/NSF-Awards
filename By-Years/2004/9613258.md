9613258 Watts Physicochemical processes that can enhance the biodegradability of
biorefractory organic compounds in process water can serve as a basis for waste
reduction, toxicity reduction, and water conservation through the recycling. The
proposed research investigates coexisting chemical and biological oxidations in
hybrid advanced oxidation process (AOP)-biological systems. The AOP is an iron
oxyhydroxide-catalyzed Fentonlike reaction in which hydroxyl radicals are
generated by heterogeneous catalysis at the mineral surface. Abiotic-biotic
systems containing low microbial numbers may be dominated by Fenton-like
oxidations. Conversely, systems with high biomass would likely be characterized
by fewer Fenton-like oxidations because the hydrogen peroxide would be
decomposed by catalase. However, under optimal proportions of abiotic and biotic
mechanisms, hydroxyl radicals generated in a microenvironment at the mineral
surface would modify biorefractory compounds and subsequent transformation of
the oxidation products would then be promoted by a coexisting consortium of
aerobic bacteria. Perchloroethylene will be used as a hydroxyl radical probe.
13C- labeled pyruvate will be used to assay microbial metabolism. A series of
experiments will investigate interactions of biomass, hydrogen peroxide
concentration, iron oxyhydroxide mineral concentration, and phosphate
stabilization of hydrogen peroxide in promoting parallel abiotic-biotic
oxidations. Transformation reactions will be confirmed by monitoring 14C-labeled
perchloroethylene; degradation products will be tracked by gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of
13C- labeled perchloroethylene to differentiate its products from the mass
spectra of natural organic compounds. The results will provide fundamental data
that can be applied to on site hybrid abiotic-biotic systems. ***
