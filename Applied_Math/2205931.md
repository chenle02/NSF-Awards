This project is in the ?eld of scattering theory of general wave equations. The
aim is to characterize the large-time behavior of solutions of complex-type
nonlinear equations in mathematical physics, which describe wave propagation in
quantum systems and nonlinear optics models, among others. Finding the possible
asymptotic states of such systems is critical to both qualitative and
quantitative understanding of the physical phenomena and to applications. For
example, the fundamental question in quantum mechanics of finding the breakup
components of a molecule that is perturbed by a laser pulse is of this type.
Similarly, the energy loss of light pulses moving a long distance in an optical
fibre and the effects of time dependent noise on the stability of quantum and
optical devices are examples.

The aim of this project is to ?nd the asymptotic behavior and other properties
of the solutions for a general class of nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equations. A key
part of the project is to ?nd all possible asymptotic states. This is an
exceedingly di?cult task for nonlinear equations, and results of general nature
are scarce. The complexity of the equations considered necessitates di?erent
analytical, computational, and numerical tools. A combination of modern
functional analytic methods and physical insights will be developed. In the case
of spherical symmetric initial data and perturbation term, which can also depend
on time and space variables, the goal is to show that the solutions break into a
free wave and a (weakly) localized part and to derive the properties of the
localized part. The project includes the analytic and numerical study of kinetic
equations with multiple ergodic components.
