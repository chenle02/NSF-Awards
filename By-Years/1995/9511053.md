9511053 Rasler This project focuses on the Intifada (1987-1993) in order to
extend the theoretical and empirical work on the relationships between social
movements, political revolts and protest cycles. There are three major
theoretical themes that guide the hypothesis formation and testing stages: 1)
the evolution of protest waves; 2) regime-challenger interactions; and, 3) the
dynamics of ethnic competition. The first section of the study examines the
factors that influence the shape of the protest wave, e.g., policies of
repression/concession, organizational structure and competition, the role of
external parties, inter-organizational strife and the contraction of
organizational resources. The second section investigates the short and long
term effects of repression/concessions on bandwagon and spatial diffusion
prmcesses. The third section investigates the rise of ethnic violence and its
impact on collective action patterns. The temporal domain of the study covers
the 1981-1993 period in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Data on the
occurrence, participation and duration of collective action events will be
collected from two Palestinian newspapers - al-Ouds (Arabic) and al-Fajr
(weekly, English) - one Israeli newspaper - Jerusalem Post - and one regional
news source - The Foreign Broadcast Information Service. The research design is
longitudinal and the temporal unit is weekly. Event-history methods will be
applied to the analysis. This research promises to substantially enhance our
understanding of this topic. ***
