Packing and covering are dual notions that are basic in combinatorial
optimization and in combinatorics, in general. They are different and yet very
closely related. One important instance of combinatorial packing problems is
that of graph packing. Graphs of size n pack, if there exists an edge disjoint
placement of all these graphs into the complete graph with n vertices. Various
classical combinatorial problems can be modeled as packing or covering problems.
For example, the problem of existence of a spanning cycle in an n-vertex graph
is the question whether the n-cycle packs with the complement of G. Important
examples of packing and covering problems are problems on existence of a given
subgraph, coloring problems, Turan-type problems, domination problems and
Ramsey-type problems. These examples (and many more) show that (hyper)graph
packings and coverings are rather general problems and are rich enough models
for many important applications. Areas of application include scheduling,
database access, assignment of computer registers, data clustering, computer-
aided design of printed circuits, positional games, DNA sequencing, etc.

The main thrust of the project is to explore a series of extremal packing and
covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs, with restrictions on degrees of
their vertices. It is expected that the results will make an essential step in
understanding extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs.
Some proofs can lead to efficient packing and covering algorithms; negative
results will impose limits on what can be accomplished. The particular packing
problem of equitable coloring has many applications in scheduling, partitioning,
and load balancing problems. It will be studied also from an algorithmic
viewpoint. A fair amount of the work will be done jointly with graduate students
and recent graduates of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
