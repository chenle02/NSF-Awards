This project aims to use innovative materials called “2D materials” to enhance
the capabilities of modern integrated circuits. These materials have unique
electronic properties that make them very promising for compute, storage, and
sensing technologies. However, integrating them with existing silicon-based
technology has been a challenge due to temperature restrictions. Luckily, a new
group of materials called “indium-based chalcogenides” offers a solution, as
they can be synthesized at low temperatures compatible with current technology.
The project team plans to create a range of devices using these materials to
accelerate the performance of energy-efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs).
These brain-inspired microchips will revolutionize how audio, visual, tactile,
and olfactory information is processed, making devices smarter and more
responsive. Moreover, these microchips could be used in autonomous vehicles,
drones, and robots, helping them navigate and avoid obstacles. The project also
focuses on training the next generation of scientists and engineers and
promoting diversity and inclusivity in the field.

This project aims to address the challenge of integrating novel 2D materials
with the state-of-the-art silicon-based complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) technology at the back end of line (BEOL). The key innovation lies in
leveraging indium-based chalcogenides, such as InSe and In2Se3, which can be
synthesized at low temperatures, making them compatible with BEOL processes. The
team plans to synthesize and characterize these materials to fabricate an array
of sensing, encoding, computing, and memory devices for hardware acceleration of
energy-efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs). The project will involve a
cross-layer co-optimization approach that encompasses material discovery,
synthesis and deposition techniques, process flow development, and device-
circuit-architecture co-design. The goal is to develop brain-inspired SNN
microchips through 2D/CMOS heterogeneous and monolithic integration, which will
lead to substantial reductions in energy consumption and pave the way for
sustainable computing paradigms. The broader impact of this work extends to
applications on the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, where the brain-mimetic SNN
microchips will enable advanced audio, visual, tactile, and olfactory
information processing. Additionally, the project emphasizes education and
training, promoting diversity and inclusiveness in the workforce.
