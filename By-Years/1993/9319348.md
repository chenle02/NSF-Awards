9319348 Ricart The Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA)
proposes to create the first, real, regional electronic library in America. The
Monticello Electronic Library, as the SURA project is named, will use
complementary collection strategies for electronic materials among participating
SURA libraries and SURAnet electronic document collection many times larger than
any single institution, even Harvard, could support. Through the services of a
group of experts in the SURA region, and drawing on expertise from others to
give a critical national perspective, a set of proposals is being generated,
discussed and evaluated that will form the basis for the Monticello Electronic
Library. A meeting of the group of experts together with other representatives
from SURA institutions, SOLINET, and SURAnet will be held so that advocates for
each proposal will give presentations to this larger audience and discussion
will follow. It is expected that through this planning process, an exciting but
realistic set of proposals will emerge. These proposals will be incorporated
into a report that outlines the Monticello Library. ***
