*** 9513217 Nienhaus This research will develop an instrument that allows the
study of protein dynamics over a wide range of times at the level of single
molecules. The instrument is based on- photon excitation of florescence. To
obtain the high spatio- temporal density of photons necessary for a high
probability of two-photon absorption events, florescence excitation will be
provided by focusing the 150 fs wide pulses of a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser
to a diffraction limited spot in an epi-illuminated microscope. The method
promises an extremely good signal-to-noise ratio because the excitation light is
well separated in wavelength from the emission of the florescent probes.
Therefore, Rayleigh and Raman scattering can be efficiently suppressed. Detector
noise will be further reduced by time gating. The instrument is sensitive to
dynamic process with characteristic time scales ranging from nanoseconds to
seconds and longer, which escape from the time window of conventional
fluorescence spectroscopy. Processes that can be studied include rotational and
translational diffusion, internal conformational relaxation of proteins, and
molecular interactions. for example, protein aggregation and binding of small
ligands. ***
