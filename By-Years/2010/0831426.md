A variety of emerging microelectronics applications target portable systems with
tight constraints on the related metrics of power, form factor, and longevity.
For many of these applications, there are severe constraints on the energy
consumption for the electronics in the system. In particular, passive RFID tags
rely on power received from readers so low power consumption is necessary to
enable long-range reads. Nevertheless, these devices are already widely used for
applications with serious security and privacy requirements such as key cards,
public transportation tokens, and implantable medical devices. Current design
approaches and standard cryptographic primitives fail to satisfy the needs for
these systems. As a result, current implementations either resort to "security-
by-obscurity" and ad hoc solutions that fail to provide adequate security and
are frequently broken in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
developing a comprehensive approach to analyzing, designing, and implementing
security and privacy for severely resource-constrained devices such as widely
deployed RFID systems.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to enable designers to create
secure, cost-effective, large-scale RFID-deployments by combining primitives and
protocols from a library with known properties and to implement those designs in
a principled and efficient manner. The research follows an interdisciplinary
approach by bringing together experts in low-energy integrated circuit design,
design automation and embedded systems, system and network security, and
cryptography. In addition to the research, the project includes a modular RFID
security lab course and teaching outreach courses using cryptography and RFID
systems to excite middle school students about pursuing science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
