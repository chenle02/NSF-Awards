One of the fundamental questions concerning the Milky Way Galaxy is its
elemental composition and how this composition came about. It is believed that
the original gas from which our Galaxy formed, consisted of entirely hydrogen
and helium. Most of the heavier elements were formed since then by
nucleosynthesis in stellar interiors and during stellar explosions. The aim of
the research proposed here is to improve our under- standing of the origin and
distribution of the chemical elements in our Galaxy. To this end, the Principal
Investigator (PI) will focus on four distinct, but related projects: 1. Use
abundance distribution curves for the Galaxy's halo stars to deduce the nature
of the first generation of massive stars in the Galaxy and their
nucleosynethesized products; 2. study the mixing of light elements (e.g.,
lithium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen) in the convective envelopes of giant stars in
the Galaxy's halo and disk; 3. use nebular absorption and emission lines of
neutral gas in planetary nebulae to learn about the nuclear history of the
precursor stars; and 4. take very high signal-to-noise spectra of diffuse
interstellar bands towards selected, very lightly reddened lines of sight in
order to obtain clues as to the bands'origin.
