The chemical reaction pathways which determine lubricant degradation during the
later stages of lubricant deterioration will be followed by analytical
techniques. These reactions include oxidation, polymerization, and sludge
formation. The results will be linked together in a mathematical model which can
predict lubricant deterioration as it is determined by operational and
environmental parameters. An attempt will be made to also include actual
lubricant performance data in the model, in the hope that actual performance of
tribosystems can then be predicted. The knowledge developed in this study can
serve as basis for lubricant design and development for severe applications.
