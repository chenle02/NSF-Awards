The goal of this research is to develop methods and computational infrastructure
for launching two major types of queries on the interaction network of cellular
signaling and regulatory pathways. These include: (1) queries to identify
network regions that are conserved across multiple species, conditions, or
points in time, and (b) queries to match observed genetic interactions, such as
synthetic lethals, suppressor mutations, and complex genetic disease linkages,
with the underlying pathways of physical interactions that best explain them.
Research for query (1) will build on the PathBLAST network comparison algorithm
by adding support for protein domains and multiple network alignment, automated
visualization and layout of aligned network regions, and a general model of
protein insertions and deletions in the aligned networks. Proposed research for
query (2) is more exploratory and will evaluate and refine an initial
formulation of the problem as a probabilistic causal model. Successful
strategies for integrating molecular interactions with other genomic data
streams will be crucial for building large-scale wiring diagrams of the cell in
a top-down and hypothesis-driven fashion
