9310155 Lewontin This award will support the research that uses the unique power
of parallel computing to provide a general picture of the dynamics of genetic
frequency change in multi-locus genetic systems with recombination and selection
considered simultaneously. The actual dynamics of the transient will be analyzed
by mapping out the vector fields for gametic frequencies and following the
changes in the conformation of these fields as the selection and recombination
parameter are perturbed systematically. ***
