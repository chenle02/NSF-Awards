With the success of state lottery programs on tribal lands, there is a need to
better understand the risk-taking behavior among those who engaged in these
gambling activities. Opponents of gambling argue that the poor and uneducated
are the primary players in state lotteries. But recent literature does not
support this claim. One study defined three distinct segments in state lottery
programs: non-purchasers, light purchasers and heavy purchasers. Heavy
purchasers tended to be middle-aged two-income middle-class households. Light
purchasers tended to be younger and college- educated. This research aims to
examine who plays what types of lottery games why they play, how often they play
and how much they spend on lottery tickets.
