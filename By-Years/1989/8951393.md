Through the use of a Network Analyzer students will have an opportunity to use
a standard research and measurement tool for radio frequency investigation.
Students design gain blocks, converters and oscillators up through microwave
frequencies. Additionally, complete systems are examined with regard to
input/output characteristics, channel capacities, noise and distortion. This
project is being matched by an amount equal to the award.
