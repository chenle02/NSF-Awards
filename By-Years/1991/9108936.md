The objective of this study is to gain a fundamental understanding of the
relationship between drug transport properties and matrix composition in a novel
parenteral controlled release matrix for polypeptide drugs. Developing effective
parenteral drug delivery systems is critical to realizing the therapeutic
potential of many new polypeptides being developed by the biotechnology
industry. The goals of this study are: i) to define the relationship between
matrix composition and matrix pore sizes; and ii) to define the relationship
between pore sizes and polypeptide diffusion rates.
