The project is to organize a joint US/Japan workshop on smart structures
technology applied to large civil structures on the campus of the University of
Maryland, College Park. The workshop will be attended by Japanese and US experts
from academia, industry and government laboratories. The objectives of the
workshop are to: (1) assess recent developments in smart structure technology
and their recent applications to large civil structures in the US and Japan, (2)
to identify research needs, gaps and future research thrusts and, (3) bring
together researchers and practitioners from the US and Japan to explore and
promote cooperative research activities through active participation of
university, government and industry professionals. This project is jointly
supported by NSF and Building Research Institute, Ministry of Construction,
Japan, under the auspices of the US-Japan Natural Resources (UJNR) Program.
