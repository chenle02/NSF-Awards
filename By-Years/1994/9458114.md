9458114 Sanderson Suspension-feeding fishes filter massive volumes of water to
extract small prey particles. Although they comprise one third of the world fish
harvest, their mechanisms of particle retention are unknown. Hypotheses about
the process of particle encounter with the filtering apparatus and the process
of particle retention inside the oral cavity have rarely been tested in
suspension-feeding fishes. The P.I. will use novel techniques to test hypotheses
about the filtration mechanisms of species that differ in morphology and water
transport method.
