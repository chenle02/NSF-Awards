9728904 Ladinsky This award supports U.S. participation in a Science and
Technology Week in Vietnam. The S&amp;T Week will feature meetings between a
team of U.S. researchers in materials science, information technology, and
biotechnology and corresponding groups of Vietnamese researchers. The objective
is to introduce U.S. researchers to their counterparts in Vietnam and vice
versa, and to explore opportunities for future collaboration. The Vietnamese
counterpart is Dr. Chu Hao, Vice Minister of Science, Technology and
Environment. It is anticipated that this planning meeting will allow U.S.
participants to identify the areas of greatest potential value for future
scientific cooperation and introduce Vietnamese researchers to U.S. approaches
to conducting basic research.
