Identify the memory strategies mothers use in a structured environment when
teaching their preschool children to remember new information. A formal coding
system will be used to determine the frequency of maternal use of various memory
strategies. Both implicit and explicit strategy use will be measured. Determine
maternal ratings of the effectiveness of various memory strategies.
Effectiveness ratings will be assessed by a memory strategy questionnaire.
Determine the relationship between direct use of memory strategies and preschool
memory performance. The child's memory performance will be assessed by the
Memory subscale of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities.
