0209343 Mathews The objective of the research is to investigate the feasibility
of a novel concept in ozone generator design that should enhance mass transfer
by in-situ ozone production using porous electrodes. In addition, enhanced
reaction efficiencies will be achieved through the use of highly reactive ozone
isotopomer species. Ozone is a powerful oxidant that is more potent than
chlorine in the destruction of microbiological contaminants, and in the
oxidation of recalcitrant organic compounds in wastewaters. Also, relative to
chlorine, ozone is a benign oxidant since it does not generate a large number of
toxic compounds as byproducts. However, ozone has not found widespread use due
to its relatively high cost per unit volume of water treated, because of poor
ozone mass transfer and reaction efficiencies. This exploratory research could
help to improve the cost effectiveness of ozone treatment of wastewaters. ***
