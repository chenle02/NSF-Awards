This research is directed at political choice data, primarily roll call votes
in legislatures. It focuses on three distinct components of roll call voting.
The first component studies the dynamics of mass-elite realignments. It
addresses the question of whether changes in congressional voting behavior are
stimulated by grass roots activists. The second component focuses on the
dynamics of change in individual level roll call voting behavior. It addresses
the question of whether legislators fix their ideological positions prior to
entering Congress or whether their positions evolve over time. The third
component develops new methods for estimating legislator dynamics.
