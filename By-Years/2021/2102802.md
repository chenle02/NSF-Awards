This project involves the use of computer experimentation and graphical user
interfaces to study simple but unsolved geometric problems. The PI is currently
studying the paths taken by a superball as it bounces around the inside of a
tetrahedral shaped room. The project will use computer experimentation to figure
out how the patterns change as the room gradually changes shape. As another
example, the PI is studying how bugs will crawl around the surface of a
dodecahedron in order to move as far away from each other as possible. These
simply defined problems exhibit a fascinating and sometimes unexpected
complexity. These types of problems fall under the general rubric of geometric
optimization and polygonal geometry. The project also involves training and
mentoring of students, as well as dissemination via outreach and the creation of
applets and computer programs to aid geometric
visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the PI will work on
questions in geometry and dynamics which fall into two categories: geometric
optimization and polygon geometry. The three main optimization topics that will
be studied in this project are point configurations, paper Moebius bands, and
the Lie group Sol. The three main polygon problems that will be investigated are
polygonal outer billiards, symplectic polygonal billiards, and inscribed
triangles and rectangles. Additionally, the PI plans to continue writing
graphical user interfaces which help with research for the project, and the PI
also plans to continue to write and illustrate children's math
books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
