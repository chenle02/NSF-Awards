This proposal requests a grant of 43.500 in student support of the 2001 Gordon
Research Conference on Nonlinear Optics and Lasers to be held at the Colby-
Sawyer College, New London, New Hampshire. July 29 - August 3, 2001. The field
of nonlinear optics and lasers has been and continues to be an extremely active
and fruitful area of both basic and applied research. Recent Nobel Prizes in
laser cooling, femtosecond chemistry, and laser diodes attest to its impact on
science. The recent explosive growth of the telecommunications indusiry attest
to its impact on our economy and also our daily lives. As in previous years. the
purpose of this conference is to provide an informal forum for the presentation
and discussion of new work on selected topics in nonlinear optics, quanium
electronics and lasers, and their applications to physics, chemistry and
engineering, both in academe and in industry. An informal atmosphere with a
strong emphasis on discussion and interactions is intended to encourage the
exchange of ideas in a manner not possible at regular meetings of professional
societies. Students in particular benefit from these opportunities. A total
attendance of approximately 100 scientists and students from universities,
industry and government is anticipated. Participation at the conference is
limited to under 135. to preserve the informal atmosphere and increase the level
of interactions. It is proposed that the estimated total expense for the
conference of $30,000 be shared by the National Science Foundation (43,500), the
funds supplied by the Gordon Conference ($19,000). and funds to be solicited
from other sources ($7,500). The National Science Foundation funds will be used
to support selected graduate students who, because of limitations of their own
sources of funding, require financial assistance to attend the conference. No
honoraria will be paid to speakers at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;
