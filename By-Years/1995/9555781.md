95-55781 James During each of five years 30-middle school science teachers will
participate in a 3-week research experience at one of 8 United States Department
of Agriculture laboratory sites in Texas. Teachers will spend the first two
weeks of the summer and the fifth week working with a mentoring scientist.
Between weeks two and three teachers will participate in a 2-week workshop
integrating science and pedagogy using pedagogy as the vehicle for science
content.. Academic year follow-up sessions are coupled to state science
conventions or done via the Trans-Texas-Video Network. Teachers participating as
team will be come from the Southern Plains region. Individual teachers will be
expected to develop a mini-research project that can be done by students in
their classroom; the objective here is to translate the research experience into
the classroom. A long range goal of the project is to establish Science Learning
Resource Centers at each collaborating USDA lab site.
