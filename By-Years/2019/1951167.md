This is an Accomplishment Based Renewal award based on the results from Dr.
Andreoniâ€™s previous NSF Award, SES 1658952. He will continue his research on how
ideas of fairness, justice and moral responsibility affect economic decisions,
including decisions about charitable giving. The project will develop new
theories and test the theory with lab and field decision experiments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new research will focus on ideas of fairness and
justice over long time spans. He will use decision making experiments to see how
individuals make decisions in situations where one individual makes a decision
today that harms future participants. This includes work designed to test
whether or not decisions about intergenerational resource allocations are
consistent across different kinds of situations. The work will also incorporate
tests of time preference. If one person creates an economic harm, perhaps his or
her inheritors face a situation where society agrees that the economic harm has
increased over the years (e.g., accruing interest). The alternative possibility
is that the harm dissipates over time. The PI also wants to use the lab
experiments as one component in an online curriculum that can be used in high
school and college classes that consider economic efficiency, justice, and
equity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
