The goal of the James Madison University Particle and Nuclear Physics (JMU-PNP)
group is to integrate important contributions to top notch research in
Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics with an outstanding educational experience
for promising undergraduate students. The three faculty members and their
students focus on research designed to explore the structure of nucleons
(neutrons and protons) which are the basic building blocks of any atomic
nucleus. While it is widely accepted that nucleons are composed of three quarks
(viewed as fundamental particles) in constant interaction via gluon exchange, a
complete picture of the mechanisms that give rise and govern the evolution of
multi-quark systems (protons, neutrons, nuclei) is not yet available. The group
participates in studies aimed at clarifying this picture by charting the
structure of nuclei and nucleons using electron, muon, and neutrino probes. The
group is also involved in measuring the muon lifetime which can be used to
extract the Fermi coupling constant which determines the strength of one of the
four fundamental forces, the weak force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently the
group is actively involved in ongoing research at Jefferson Lab in experimental
Halls B and C (detector design and testing, data taking, data analysis),
Fermilab (Minerva experiment studying Neutrino-Nucleus Interactions), and Paul
Scherrer Institute (measuring the muon lifetime). Additionally, the JMU-PNP
group members are key participants in detector development that is part of the
12 GeV energy upgrade at Jefferson Lab and are principal investigators on
experiments that will take advantage of this upgrade.
