Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-ES) has become the method
of choice for elemental analysis of a wide range of chemical, environmental, and
geological samples. The wide dynamic range, speed of analysis, and ease of
operation of the technique makes ICP-ES an excellent choice for general
elemental analysis by undergraduates. This project establishes a
multidisciplinary ICP- ES facility to strengthen already strong programs in
Chemistry, Ecology, Environmental Science, and Geology. The ICP-ES equipment
provides students with an opportunity to learn the operating principles of this
important analytical technique and to apply the instrument's analysis capability
to environmental and laboratory problems. The grantee provides funds for this
project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
