The objectives of this SBIR Phase II project is the development a modular
desalination unit, confirmation of operational reliability, and demonstration of
economic viability. The Phase I efforts produced a scaled Hurricane Tower
desalination pilot plant and generated a secondary vortex in a closed system
demonstrating the feasibility of the concept. Preliminary results indicate costs
of below $0.90 per1000 gallons, using conventional energy systems while with
renewable energy systems, costs could fall below $0.50 per 1000 gallons. The
results demonstrated the promise of significant cost reduction over conventional
systems. The proposed Phase II research will investigate the feasibility and
operational performance of a modular secondary vortex-based desalination plant
including design, construction and evaluation. Commercial applications include
portable desalination plants on floating platforms; emergency water supply
systems; reliable water supply for islands and economical water desalination
plants to replace aging and expensive fixed plants in use today.
