9304940 Eisenstein The goal of this research is the elucidation of a molecular
mechanism of control for the allosteric enzyme threonine deaminase from E. coli,
with particular emphasis on the regulation of enzyme activity by the small
heterotropic effectors isoleucine and valine. Our approach consists of
characterizing the effects of regulatory ligands on both substrate binding and
catalysis, and then combining the information with experimental measurements of
heterotropic effector-promoted global, and local, conformational changes to
ultimately provide a molecular explanation of control by feedback inhibition.
%%% The activities of enzymes involved at junctures between metabolic pathways
are often controlled by substrate and product concentrations as well as by
products of other pathways. This proposal is significant in that it involves
extensive work on the characteristic enzyme-associated mechanistic specificity
of an allosterically controlled system, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme,
threonine deaminase. These studies involve sophisticated kinetic and structural
studies which in their synthesis will yield a model relating enzyme structure
and binding to alterations in kinetic behavior. This would be a great
achievement. ***
