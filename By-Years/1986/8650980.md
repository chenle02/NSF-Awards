This project will incorporate a 60-MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer
into upgraded undergraduate chemistry instruction at the College of the Virgin
Islands. No other NMR is available in the region, and geographic isolation
precludes instrument-sharing with universities or research centers on the
mainland. Availability of the NMR will enhance the educational experience of
students in organic, analytical, inorganic, and physical chemistry laboratory
courses. In addition, the instrument will be used by undergraduate students for
research projects. NMR spectrometry experiments to be integrated into the
chemistry curriculum are based on experiments published recently in the chemical
literature. Providing hands-on experience with NMR spectrometry will make a
significant contribution to the chemistry education of undergraduate students at
this historically Black college.
