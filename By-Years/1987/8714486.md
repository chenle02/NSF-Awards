This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests instrumentation funds to
support and extend the activities of the Microchemical Facilities at Caltech.
The program has two aspects: The Developmental Microchemical Facility, which is
dedicated to the development of new techniques important to molecular biology,
and the Applied Microchemical Facility, which provides syntheses and sequence
analyses for primarily Caltech researchers. Plans for the Development Facility
include: increasing sensitivity in protein sequencing to femtomole levels,
synthesis and folding of large polypeptide chains, new DNA synthesis methods,
automation of Maxam.Gilbert sequencing, and improvement of the dedeoxy
sequencer, new apparatus for separation of large DNA fragments, new methods for
gene analysis, and new computer methods (parallel processing) for sequence
analysis and comparison. The Applied facility, which until recently has been
devoted primarily to synthesis of polypeptides and polynucleotides, is being
expanded to provide sequencing service as well, first with protein and later
with DNA. These funds will enable the Center to continue to be at the forefront
of instrumentation and methodological development that is rapidly exported to
the biological community at large.
