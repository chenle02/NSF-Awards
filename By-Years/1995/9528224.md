This proposal will support the operation of the University of New Hampshire's
meteor radar for three years to: (1) continuously monitor the dynamics of the
mesosphere and lower thermosphere at midlatitudes, and (2) support analysis of
the data to produce scientific results relevant to spectral content, ranging
from mean and planetary winds to tides and short period gravity waves. Wind
studies will include investigations of temporal and spatial variability of the
planetary and tidal components through intersite comparisons (with the
Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere radar group), mesosphere-thermosphere propagation
studies of the tidal components through coordinated measurements with the
Millstone IS radar, nonlinear interactions between wind components, and
continued climatological studies of the wind field.
