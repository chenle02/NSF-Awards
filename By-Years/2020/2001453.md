The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project would be to develop a novel electromechanical system for on-orbit
servicing of spacecraft so that a spacecraft can be captured, dock. and refuel.
This system will extend the useful life of spacecraft and enable the rescue of
failed missions, representing savings to commercial and public entities alike.
Mission life extensions of commercial projects are expected to translate into
reduced costs of delivering information and services; similarly, extensions of
government-sponsored missions will enable lowered costs associated with
satellite launches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will create a
capture and refueling system for spacecraft to be used in ride-share systems.
Capturing system requirements include: compatibility with proximity and guidance
sensors; low-power operation; and autonomous alignment. Docking and refueling
requirements include: formation of a rigid, leak-proof, structural connection to
deliver fuel; and a mechanism to open the fuel port on the client spacecraft
without secondary actuation systems. Finally, for ride-share compatibility, the
robot arm must be optimized for size, weight, and power; and it must have end-
effectors and a tool exchange mechanism. All subsystems must be fully compatible
with the extreme environmental conditions of space. The proposed effort will
address the systems engineering process of developing requirements and
specifications; conceptual design development; detailed design, analysis and
modeling; and breadboard testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
