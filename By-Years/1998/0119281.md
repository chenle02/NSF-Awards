0119281&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Request for Travel Grant for Graduate Students to
Attend a Conference on the Structure and Mechanical Properties of Nanostructured
Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support 5
graduate students to attend a United Engineering Foundation Conference. The
title of the conference is Structure and Mechanical Properties of Nanostructured
Materials: Promoting a Synergy Among Computer Simulations, Experiments and
Theory. The students will be paired with an equal number of prominent senior
attendees. The graduate students will thus not only increase their professional
and scientific education by attending an international conference on their
thesis subject but also begin to network with leaders in their field. The
scholarship offer would be limited to US citizens and permanent residents, and
special consideration will be given to increase the diversity of the awardees to
include women and underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
