Our goal is to determine how an essential morphogenetic process requiring
extensive intercellular coordination arose as multicellular Volvox evolved from
a unicellular ancestor resembling its closest unicellular relative,
Chlamydomonas. In order to be able to swim, at the end of embryogenesis Volvox
must turn right-side-out in a gastrulation-like process called "inversion,"
which involves coordinated cytoskeletal rearrangements and changes in cell shape
and motility. Transposon tagged mutants with a variety of inversion (inv)
defects have been generated. The first of these to be analyzed was Inv61, in
which inversion is arrested at the halfway point as a result of a transposon
insertion in invA, a gene encoding a novel kinesin that is localized in the
embryo near the cytoplasmic bridges that play a key role in inversion. We have
cloned the C. reinhardtii orthologue of invA (iarA) and found that it encodes a
kinesin (IarA) that is >90 % identical in aa sequence to InvA in both its motor
and tail domains. Because invA encodes a microtubule motor, whereas invA mutants
resemble wild-type embryos exposed to actomyosin inhibitors, we will explore the
possibility that InvA acts as a link between the actin- and tubulin-based
cytoskeletons in Volvox. Meanwhile, we will study expression and localization of
its orthologue, IarA, throughout the Chlamydomonas cell cycle, and will study
the effects of blocking IarA function, using a dominant negative construct,
antibody inhibition, or RNA interference. We will use nuclear transformation to
determine whether iarA can rescue the invA mutant. If it does not, we will test
chimeric iarA-invA constructs to define regions of InvA that are required to
confer an inversion function on IarA. The functional significance of such
structural differences will then be tested with appropriate kinesin binding
and/or motility assays. If iarA does rescue invA, we will compare the proteins
with which IarA interacts in Chlamydomonas versus those with which it interacts
in Volvox.
