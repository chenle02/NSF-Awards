The Acari, ticks and mites, includes the greatest diversity of animals outside
of the insects. In spite of its great diversity, the study of acarine
systematics, evolution, and ecology is hampered by a declining number of active
taxonomic specialists. This study focuses on two major lineages of parasitic
mites associated with mammals: Dermanyssoidea and Sarcoptoidea. These groups,
with more than 1,000 species, have never been analyzed phylogenetically at the
suprageneric level. Field studies will concentrate on poorly known faunas in
Madagascar and the Philippines. Taxonomic monographs will be produced for
several families for these insular areas including descriptions of many new
species, phylogenetic hypotheses integrating morphological and molecular
evidence, and catalogs of mammalian hosts for all dermanyssoid and sarcoptoid
groups worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have immediate and
longterm benefits to a wide range of biologists. It will provide a predictive,
conceptual framework for a large number of mites of medical, veterinary,
ecological, and evolutionary interest as well as an easily accessible source for
identification and host information. Concentration on the endangered faunas of
Madagascar and the Philippines may also aid conservation biologists and
epidemiologists in understanding the interactions of native and introduced host-
parasite systems and their roles in these rapidly changing ecosystems. Students
will develop skills and knowledge in both morphological and molecular methods of
systematic analysis. In all, three graduate students and a great number of
undergraduate students will be trained in the systematics, ecology, and
evolution of parasitic mites. Results of the research will be made accessible
electronically.
