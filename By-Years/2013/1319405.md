Research and development in cloud-based distributed systems is currently
hindered due to the incredible difficulty of running such systems at scale. The
Wisconsin Pocket Datacenter (PoD) project directly addresses this dilemma by
enabling researchers and developers to run large-scale distributed systems on
modest hardware resources. The key novel idea behind PoD is data elision, which
removes actual application data from the underlying disks, memories, and network
transfers of the distributed system under test. PoD thus enables many virtual
instances of such a system to be run upon just a few physical machines, thus
making testing, debugging, and in general development simpler, faster, and less
resource-intensive.

Cloud-based distributed systems represent a critically-important piece of modern
computing infrastructure. As users and corporations migrate their data and
computation into such facilities, it is increasingly important to ensure that
such systems operate correctly and efficiently. PoD enables developers to debug
existing systems and test new designs without excessive hardware resources; with
such a tool in their workbench, system developers will be able to more readily
build and test the next generation of cloud-based systems to support the needs
of a growing percentage of society.
