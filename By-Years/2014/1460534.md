This award will provide funding to further the development of a software suite
used for Argon geochronology data acquisition and data reduction at the New
Mexico Geochronology Research Laboratory. Comprehensive software suites are
vital to all modern analytical instrumentation and are best developed by users
of the instrumentation rather than providers of the instruments. This award will
support the development of user and developer documentation as well as new and
innovative laboratory techniques by an early-career Post-Doctoral researcher.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argon geochronology is one of many critically important
methods to determine rock age and thermal history and user friendly, high
quality software is essential to the success of all argon geochronology
facilities. Hardware automation, efficient data storage and data processing have
greatly enhanced the geochronologist?s ability to make meaningful geologic
conclusions and promotes new discovery by providing streamlined access to
multiple methods of data reduction and acquisition. However, much of the
currently existing software is not ultimately sustainable because of lack of
comprehensive documentation and community involvement towards new development.
This award will help address both of these issues by supporting the writing of
thorough documentation with the intent making it easily available to other
laboratories. This software suite will also serve an important function of
ultra-high precision and accuracy geochronology by conducting detailed
comparability of data outputs from other software suites used in argon
geochronology.
