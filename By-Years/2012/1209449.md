This action funds Matan Shelomi of the University of California, Davis, to
conduct a research project, entitled "Gut Microbial Communities of the Stick
Insects," during the summer of 2012 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Tawian. The
host scientist is Dr. Chih-Horng Kuo.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is that it provides the first
look at the digestive microbes of the walking sticks (Phasmatodea), an
understudied order of which almost nothing is known about their digestive
system. What little we do know suggests that the gut must contain some unique
and so-far unknown adaptations for the grinding and digestion of the insects'
leafy diets, for they do not have the same grinding organs as their relatives,
the grasshoppers, or fermentation chambers like termites and roaches. The
research investigates that the phasmid gut contains a complex microbial
community that may contain symbionts with a digestive function, such as
cellulose breakdown. During the course of this project, walking stick guts,
diet, and wastes are being analyzed with modern, molecular techniques to
identify all bacteria in the samples, their sources, and relative abundance,
with the goal of helping understand how the insect is able to survive on its
leafy diet. The data not only is of interest to biologists, but also to the
biofuel industry, for the challenges these insects must overcome are the same as
those that industry has been dealing with in trying to efficiently break down
cellulosic matter.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
