AST-0340837&lt;br/&gt;Kennefick&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Dr. Kennefick is
awarded NSF funding to study the evolution of the quasar luminosity function and
to conduct two new multicolor surveys for quasars. Using publicly available
data, several large quasar surveys will be mined to construct a quasar
luminosity function that is internally consistent, and to select quasar
candidates over the peak of quasar activity and at the highest redshifts.
Follow-up observations of the candidates will be undertaken at the National
Observatories, and through collaborations. This program will advance our
knowledge of quasars themselves, their relation to normal galaxies, and
structure formation in the early universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
To accomplish the scientific goal, Dr. Kennefick will use large digital optical
and infrared surveys, in a manner that demonstrates the potential of the
National Virtual Observatory (NVO) to facilitate frontline research. The
geographic region in which the research will be undertaken has very few
astronomers, and few women in particular. Hence this program provides
recruitment and mentoring opportunities that will enhance the quality and
diversity of the science workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
