The essence of human experience is interacting with the natural and man-made
environments through the five human senses, and through vision in particular.
The objective of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER)
project is to build analytical foundations for a new science of visual
experience that will bridge basic approaches from cognitive science and systems
engineering. Specifically, the research will build mathematical and
computational models of a human navigating a three dimensional space such as a
factory, museum, or retail store. The idea is to gain insights into the limits
on observability and controllability in human-technology systems, and to improve
the user's situational awareness. If the research is successful, researchers
will be able to describe situations in terms of possibilities for action and
access to information. Such quantitative tools will allow engineers to design
environments to achieve outcomes such as increased focus, improved safety,
better wayfinding, and improved experience. In time, it might be possible to
engineer interactive environments that adapt to the personal attributes and
identities of the humans that inhabit them. The results of the research have the
potential to be used by many disciplines such as engineering, business,
architecture, psychology, cognition, and human factors.

The multidisciplinary research team consisting of academics (engineering,
psychology, and computer science) and two industry personnel suggests moving
visual experience of a three dimensional environment from the realm of intuition
and experience to analytical science. The specific focus of this grant will be
on developing a general set of analytical models that emerge from the analysis
of a variety of context-specific human-environment interactions (e.g., nurse in
CCU, shopper in a retail store). With a solid grounding in the basic psychology
of Perception-Action, the analytical models will integrate three-dimensional
spatial relationships with the human eye's field of vision and the physical
attributes of a human. Most significantly, the research will consider complex
dynamics resulting from human movement in the space, with all the attendant
changes in visual angles, and the appearance and disappearance of visual
obstacles. Human performance will be empirically examined in a Virtual
Environment in order to validate the analytical metrics of visual experience.
