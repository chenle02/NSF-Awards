The University of Texas at San Antonio will initiate an 8-week, commuter, Young
Scholars project in Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering for 900 students in
grades 7-12. The purpose of this program is to identify high achieving middle
school and high school students with the potential and interest in becoming
engineers or scientists and to reinforce them in the pursuit of these fields.
The project consists of an intense mathematics-based enrichment program
emphasizing the development of abstract reasoning skills and problem-solving
skills through coursework assignments, examinations and laboratory projects. A
career awareness component involves guest speakers in science and engineering,
as well as field trips. The program staff consists of college teachers,
outstanding high school teachers, Air Force and Navy officers, and undergraduate
engineering and science majors as mentors. Successful applicants are required to
have a "B" or better average in their current academic year and must maintain a
75+ average to remain in the program.
