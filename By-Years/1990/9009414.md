Redundance control is always considered as one of the most challenging problems
to the automation of reasoning, because of combinatorial explosion in inferences
generated during the search of solutions (of any non-trivial problems). This
project will investigate a powerful inference rule called clausal superposition,
which combines resolution and paramodulation together, but generates much less
inferences. This project will also investigate a simplification rule called
contextual rewriting, which identifies many unnecessary inferences and is more
powerful than demodulation and subsumption together. The approach taken in this
project is based on well-founded term orderings, which play a central role in
the Knuth-Bendix completion procedure and rewriting methods for equational
reasoning. In this project, results of theoretical investigation will also be
implemented and experimented with in a software system called the Rewrite Rule
Laboratory (RRL), an environment for experimenting with and developing new
automated reasoning procedures based on rewrite methods. This research will
increase the power of RRL for solving problems in verification and specification
of hardware and software, as well as those considered a challenge for automated
theorem provers.
