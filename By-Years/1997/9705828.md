In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division with funds for equipment provided by the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities, De Lucia and Herbst investigate the spectroscopy
of low energy molecular collisions and of the interactions which govern them.
Experimental studies of pressure broadening, pressure shifts, and state-to-state
rotational energy transfer rates will be conducted using millimeter and
submillimeter spectroscopic techniques coupled with collisional cooling and
molecular ion production methods. The experimental data will be compared with
results from modern quantum chemical and scattering calculations. Systems of
interest include CO-He/H2, H2S-He/H2, and HDO-He/H2 as well as ionic systems
HCO+-H2, CO+-He, and NO+-He. These results will help give insight into collision
phenomena which occur most visibly at low energies and which are highly
dependent on the shallow, long-range attractive potentials between molecules.
The results of this program have relevance to atmospheric chemistry and
astrochemistry, where interactions involving collisions between atoms molecules
and ionic species at low temperatures predominate. Under these conditions the
types of molecular cluster species under study here form readily.
