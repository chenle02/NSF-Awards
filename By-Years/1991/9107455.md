Traditionally, DBMSs have assumed that all accessible data resides on magnetic
disk with small amounts of data occupying space in a main memory cache. Future
object managers will be called on to manage very large object bases in which
time critical objects resides permanently in main memory, other objects are disk
resident, and the remainder occupy tertiary memory. Moreover, there may be more
than three levels of storage present, and some of them may exist at remote
locations.This project investigates the architecture of a DBMS that can support
a multi-level store in a single software system. The approach is to generalize
and apply ideas from file systems, query optimization, and abstract data types
to multiple levels of storage. In addition, since storage may exist on multiple
computer systems, ideas from distributed data bases must also be applied. The
significance of this research is that the issue ofmassive size is addressed.
Specifically, a new generation of DBMSs is unfolding that will support more
general applications than the business data processing ones addressed by
relational DBMSs. The next frontier is to overcome the dramatic size increase
that these new applications entail.
