Moore 9627614 The Department of Mathematics at Tulane University will purchase
a Silicon Graphics Power Challenge L Server with 324 MB RAM and 4GB Disk and the
software packages Maple and Splus. The equipment purchased with this grant will
be used for several research projects, including in particular: adaptive methods
for solving parabolic systems in three space dimensions possibly coupled with
elliptic systems, computational biofluiddynamics, and simulation methods for
computational statistics. Professor Moore is developing an adaptive local
refinement algorithm that utilizes variation in order and step-size in both
space and time for parabolic systems in three dimensions. Applications of the
code include models in electrophysiology and phase transitions in the mantle.
Professor Fauci has developed a mathematical and a computational method to study
the fluid dynamics of aquatic animal locomotion. Professor Dinwoodie is studying
the Metropolis algorithm for simulating discrete distributions. Project
participants also include one NSF postdoctoral associate, five graduate and one
undergraduate students.
