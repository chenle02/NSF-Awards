This project will support the 12th International Symposium on the theory of
Traffic Flow and Transportation to be held at the University of California
(Berkeley) from July 21 to July 23, 1993. In response to the congestion problem
in cities, the topic of the first symposium was vehicular traffic theory. This
has been the focus of the series, since the pressing need for congestion relief
has not disappeared, and advanced in traffic science can open the door for
solutions that do not require the construction of more and more facilities. With
the same goal in mind, recent symposia have examined subjects related to traffic
flow, encompassing passenger transportation modes other than the automobile. The
Berkeley symposium will continue this tradition, seeking papers in intelligent
vehicle/highway systems (IVHS) and freight/logistics. The distinguishing feature
of this symposium series is that it deals exclusively with the scientific
aspects of transportation and traffic phenomena. As such it provided the World's
transportation/traffic theorists with their main forum.
