This project combines research on the statistical nature and prediction of
magnetic storms with educational components for both university students and
K-12 teachers. Existing storm prediction systems do a good job on global scales
but do not account for local variability. An understanding of local variations
is particularly important since coupling of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system
produces geospace and ground magnetic variations that depend on both local time
and latitude. Several different subtopics will be examined: (1) fractal and
multi-fractal characteristics of ground-based magnetometer time-series; (2)
determination of characteristic differences in the scaling behavior between non-
storm time and storm time dynamics; (3) the spatiotemporal statistical
variations, from spatially separated magnetometers, as a function of proximity
to a magnetic storm. For problem (1) the analysis techniques will include mono-
fractal rescaled range, detrended fluctuation, and multi-fractal wavelet
analyses. These approaches are appropriate since they take into account the very
high resolution of magnetometer measurements, and also the intermittent, non-
Gaussian, and nonstationary character of these data. For problem (2), analyses
will be performed in terms of storm phases. This will develop methods to
determine storm onsets via variations in nonlinear statistics. Problem (3) will
provide a way to extend storm predictions to locations where there are no
observing stations, and to paint a picture of overall (ground-based) storm
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational initiatives will include the
TEACHSPACE and Project LAUNCH programs. These programs address the need to
increase interest in science and engineering education, but also the disparity
in mathematics and science achievement in minority and traditionally underserved
students. The project will focus on workshops for K-12 teachers. The P.I. will
be involved in the delivery of workshops and lectures on space science, and
development of laboratory experiments and instructional materials.
