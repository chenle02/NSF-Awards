The operation of the Bruny Island Radio Spectrometer will be secured for the
next five years. This facility makes radio observations between 3 MHz and 47
MHz, and has pioneered the use of modern digital techniques to avoid and largely
excise the very strong terrestrial radio interference that is normally prevalent
in this frequency band. It is the only instrument in the world that bridges the
gap between low frequency solar radio observations made from space and the
higher frequency observations made from the Earth's surface. As such, it will
continue to provide unique observations capable of tracking interplanetary shock
accelerated particle events between where the space-based observatories cutoff
and where the ground-based receivers begin. Ancillary activities will address
how the observed type II and type III radio bursts are related to the generation
of solar energetic particles.
