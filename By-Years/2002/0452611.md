SoundVision Productions proposes to develop five one-hour radio documentaries,
five five-minute features, and a website to inform a diverse public about the
important advances in genomics and related sciences. Each of the new topics
represents a rapidly developing field within genomics rarely covered in depth by
the media. Those topics include systems biology, neurogenetics, RNA and
Immunology, and Individualizing the Genome. The DNA Files will provide public
radio listeners and web site users informal education in the genomic revolution
and follow-on research and technology, its scientific underpinnings, and related
social, philosophical and legal issues. The project will offer audiences an
awareness of the societal benefits of research and the intellectual tools to
join in legal and social policy debates. A collaboration with the Exploratorium
will extend the reach of the project through the development of a "DNA Workshop
Kit", a series of four or five hands-on workshops for the general public that
can be produced at the Exploratorium and other science museums around the
country. A comprehensive outreach strategy will be implemented by 20 local
public radio stations around the country in partnership with community
organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
