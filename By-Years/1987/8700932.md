A cladistic analysis of diatom chloroplast DNA will be performed on the
Cyclotella meneghiniana group (inluding three to perhaps five species). The
morphology of these centric diatoms has not produced a satisfactory
classification or genealogy, and this project will provide an independent
molecular dataset impacting on these questions. The molecular approach to the
systematics of this group has wider importance because of their fossil record
and their utility as an ecological indicator. The DNA restriction site map will
also add to the growing base of plant molecular data, on which a synthesis of
plant phylogeny will eventually be based.
