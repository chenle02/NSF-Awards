PROJECT ABSTRACT The broad question addressed by this project is: How are some
of the most significant contemporary educational reforms impacting the ability
of schools, especially those serving disadvantaged students, to retain qualified
mathematics and science teachers? The project?s broad goal is to identify
promising tools and strategies that policymakers, school officials,
administrators, and educators could use to improve the retention of mathematics
and science teachers to enhance the quality, quantity and diversity of the
teacher workforce.

The project addresses two specifically related research questions: (1) what
impact have accountability policies and practices had on the retention of
mathematics and science teachers? (2) What impact have teacher preparation,
education and training trends, and levels had on the retention of mathematics
and science teachers?

To address these questions the project analyzes data on mathematics and science
teachers from multiple cycles of the National Center for Education Statistics?
(NCES) nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SSS) and its
supplement the Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS).
