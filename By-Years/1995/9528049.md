Baker/Abstract The objectives of this research are two fold: (1) to examine the
growth and evaporation of individual ice crystals, suspended by means of a new
electromechanical balance, at various temperatures (0 to -60 degrees Celsius)
and pressures (down to 100mb); (2) to measure scattering phase functions over a
wide range of angles using a suitable laser. The results should be applicable to
the physics of cirrus clouds.
