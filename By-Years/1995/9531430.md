9531430 Mermin This grant continues on the well recognized work of the PI on the
generalization of symmetry classification (of periodic crystals) to include
aperiodic crystals. Some specific items include the case of tensorial order
parameter, symmetry changes at commensurate-incommensurate phase transition and
the newly discovered tetrahedral quasicrystals. In addition, there are questions
of the relationship between the recent work in the mathematical literature by
Novikov, Piunikhin and Conway and the PI's classification scheme. %%% Until the
discovery of quasicrystals in the early eighties, the scientific view of a
periodic crystal had been well established for more than 100 years and had been
described in the textbooks. The aperiodic or quasiperiodic structures challenged
that framework and, in a seminal work by the PI, the symmetry classification has
been generalized to include the new developments. The present grant further
explores ways of enriching the new classification scheme. There are also plans
to study and establish relationships with the work of others. ***
