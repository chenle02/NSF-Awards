This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Eain Cornford of the
University of California at Los Angeles and Dr. James W. Paxton of the
University of Aukland. This research is to investigate protein mediated
transport systems capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Recent evidence
shows protein binding in itself does not allow penetration of pharamacological
substances into the brain. This project tests the hypothesis that there may be
specific protein transport systems for certain substances successful for brain
penetration, for one because of their smaller molecular size. The project
represents excellent collation between the New Zealand group and its interest in
anti-brain tumor agents and the Cornford work on blood brain barrier physiology
and the manipulation of the barrier to achieve penetration of pharamacological
substances into the brain. This is important fundamental work on the physiology
of the blood brain barrier, as well as having potential for major advances in
clinical medicine.
