The field of nonlinear dynamics is rapidly growing in the importance both in
basic research and in applications. Interest in nonlinear dynamics is increasing
in optical communications, optical switching, and optical computing. In
addition, interest in quantum mechanical phenomena is growing owing to its
impact on enhanced signal to noise ratio, reduced error rates in switching
devices and enhanced sensitivity in instruments such as interferometers and
gyroscopes. The proposed theoretical research will cover nonlinear classical
dynamics, where coupled expressions of importance in soliton optical switching
will be examined, including femtosecond duration solitons. The research will
also cover nonclassical minimum uncertainty states (optical squeezing),
examining dissipation and amplification, soliton self-frequency shift, multibeam
phenomena, and number-phase minimum uncertainty states.
