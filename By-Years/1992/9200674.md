This project involves a cultural anthropologist from the University of
Michigan-Dearborn in the compilation of a data base of Native American knowledge
of plants as food. The list will probably include in excess of 20,000 uses of at
least 2000 different species of plants, and will be of substantial value in
itself. The data base will be analyzed in terms of its relationship to the
entire flora of North America (some 20,00 species) and to the medicinal flora of
the continent About 2100 species) to see what these different floras share and
how they differ. This project is significant because it will make readily
available the collected wisdom of generations of Native American people to both
specialists and citizens. Second, it will contribute to our understanding of how
human beings construct their knowledge of the world, and by comparison with the
medicinal flora, how people distinguish plants that heals and nourish us from
those that can harm us.
