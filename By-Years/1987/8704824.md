This Engineering Research Equipment Grant is for acquisition of computer
equipment compatible with a microvax II for a new research group for
computational gaseous electronics being established under the direction of
Professor Kushner. The purpose of this group is to computationally investigate
multidimensional and transient phenomena in low temperature, highly collisional
plasmas. These plasmas are applied to technologically important devices such as
gas lasers, plasma processing reactors, lighting sources (plasma displays), MHD,
and pulse power switches. There are three research projects in progress in
Professor Kushner's group during which large computer simulation programs are
being developed: 1) modeling plasma deposition and surface morphology of
amorphous silicon, 2) simulation of surface flashover discharges on spacecraft,
and 3) modeling of fission fragment pumped excimer lasers. Research has also
been proposed to investigate the flow of plasma through constrictions (as
applied to thyratrons), a microwave controlled opening switch, and plasma
instabilities initiated by particulate matter in gas discharges.
