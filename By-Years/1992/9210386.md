Social aphids provide a new arena for the study of the evolution of sterile
altruistic castes. Two basic issues that have not been addressed in any social
aphid are the mechanism of origin of a discrete sterile caste and the
relatedness of the defending individuals to their beneficiaries. Molecular
methods will be used to test a specific hypothesis for the origin of a sterile
caste in some Pemphigus species. Under this hypothesis, some individuals are
forced into sterility because they lack endosymbionts at birth. The tests depend
on methods for the molecular detection of sequences previously established as
unique in aphid endosymbionts; the hypothesis predicts that these are present in
all individuals except sterile defenders. In addition, genetic fingerprinting
methods will be developed and used to examine the genotypic composition of
colonies of a social and non-social Pemphigus species. In both segments of this
project, previously existing laboratory cultures of Pemphigus clones will
provide controls and test material. These methods will be useful in future
investigations concerning the genetic structure of partially clonal aphid
populations. The research involves an important group of insects which feed on
native American trees.
