Increasing volume and variety of data opens opportunities, but much of these
data are not carefully curated, leading to uncertainty. Data analysis techniques
are needed that accurately characterize uncertainty. This project develops
principled approaches to managing uncertainty, particularly through clustering
and subsetting data, and then combining results from analysis of the subsets.
Dividing data into smaller problems promises scalability to Big Data, while the
ability to combine results in a theoretically sound manner manages the
uncertainty inherent in large data collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key
idea is that Wasserstein barycenter of subset posteriors can be used to
efficiently perform posterior approximation. The project extends the theoretical
understanding of Wasserstein barycenters, enhancing ability to model
uncertainty. New mathematical tools are being developed to bound the accuracy of
approximations in terms of the problem's size and nature, and computational
time. The algorithms are evaluated on a rich variety of massive data sets,
ranging from large-scale networks to biomedical data sets collecting huge
numbers of biomarkers. In addition, the project provides interdisciplinary
training to young talent in big data analytics to improve competitiveness of the
workforce and increase the cohort of data science researchers.
