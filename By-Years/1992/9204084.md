The objectives of the proposed program are (1) to generate relatively
monodispersed nanoparticles containing Fe and Cr by laser-induced gas-phase
particle formation processes, (2) to effectively remove particles by a surface
discharge/liquid nitrogen electrode assembly , (3) to consolidate nanoparticles
into nanophase composites and measure their enhanced magnetocaloric effect under
varying external magnetic field, and (4) to compare the experimental data with
theory for maximum magnetocaloric refrigerating capacity. Three techniques are
used for the generation of nanometer- sized particles: laser ablation,
photolytic dissociation, and pyrolysis. For both the laser ablation and
photolytic dissociation experiments, excimer lasers operating in the ultraviolet
frequency range will be used. The reaction chamber configuration, gas pressure
and flow patterns will be optimized for controlled generation of monodispersed
nanoparticles. The photolytic pyrolysis technique using CO2 lasers will be
developed for the eventual scale-up production of nanocomposite at high rates.
Using CO2 laser-induced pyrolytic process, the proposed new nanocomposite
material may be prepared in large quantities for the construction of prototype
magnetic refrigerators operating near room temperature. The creation of
nanocomposite refrigerant particles by gas- phase nucleation processes and their
consolidation into superparamagnetic materials with enhanced magnetic moments
will result in significant materials with increases of the magnetocaloric
effect.
