Abstract

This proposal is one part of a collaborative research effort between Dr. Yeung
of Georgia Tech and Dr. Sreenivasan of Yale University (CTS-0121007) on the
Reynolds and Schmidt number scalings in turbulence and turbulent mixing. The
research will include simulations and experiments. Dr. Yeung who has access to
the Teraflop IBM SP at the San Diego Supercomputer Center under NPACI will make
direct numerical simulations of the flow. With Teraflop capability, simulations
will be carried out at much higher resolutions than here-to-fore. Dr.
Sreenivasan will carry out experiments in a tunnel using cryogenic liquid helium
or nitrogen as the working fluid, which will result in much higher Reynolds
number flows. The data generated at high Reynolds numbers both by DNS and
cryogenic experiments will be used together with existing data at lower Reynolds
numbers to test the scaling laws. Both proposals were sent to the reviewers at
the same time, and they were requested to return a single evaluation.
