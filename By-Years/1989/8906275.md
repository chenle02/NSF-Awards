The objective of this project is to conduct exploratory research on the
conditions under which use of discrete interface penetration analysis can be
used as a diagnostic procedure for identification of the mechanisms that are
responsible for changes in the permeability of soils. Permeability changes
result from combinations of mechanisms such as colloid destabilization and
dispersion, shrinking or swelling of clay minerals, precipitations or
dissolutions, gas liberation, and altered microbial activity. Discrete interface
penetration analysis is a new technique for modeling the impacts of reactive
liquids based on the assumption that impacts can be represented by traveling
interfaces separating areas of changing soil properties. Much recent concern has
focussed on interactions between hazardous wastes and hydraulic barriers, but
this is a general class of phenomena significant in many areas of science and
engineering. Results of this project may have immediate applicability toward
improved engineering design of containment locations for hazardous wastes to
minimize groundwater pollution. This project results from a proposal submitted
in accord with NSF 87-90, Expedited Awards for Novel Research.
