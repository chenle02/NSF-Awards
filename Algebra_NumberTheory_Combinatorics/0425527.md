The Canadian Number Theory Association (CNTA) was founded in 1987 at the
International Number Theory Conference at Laval University. The purpose of the
CNTA is to enhance and promote learning and research in Number Theory. To
advance these goals the CNTA organizes major international conferences, with the
aim of exposing students and researchers to the latest developments in number
theory. The previous meetings have been held in Ban(r) (1988), Vancouver (1989),
Kingston (1991), Halifax (1994), Ottawa (1996), Winnipeg (1999) and Montreal
(2002). These have been conferences of extremely high quality which have
received generous financial support and enjoyed wide participation by the
international number theory community.

At a number of the previous meetings a component of that support has been
provided by the National Science Foundation explicitly dedicated to the coverage
of expenses for participation by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and
early career mathematics faculty who are resident in the United States. This
award will support the participation of young American academics at the CNTA
Conference.
