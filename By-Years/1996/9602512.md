9602512 Crowley This Americas Program award will support a workshop on the
Foundations of Computational Mathematics, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
on January 5-12, 1997. The U.S. organizers are James M. Crowley, executive
director for SIAM and Michael Schub of IBM-T. J. Watson Research Center. The
Brazilian organizer is Martin Tygel of UNICAMP. This conference will focus on a
variety of topics in which the computational process and the foundational
mathematical underpinnings of algorithms will be studied. There will be twelve
plenary speakers, nine workshops and several tutorials. A second part of this
proposal will involve visits by Brazilian researchers to the U.S. to initiate
collaborative research in the subject areas. Emphasis will be placed on
involving women, minorities and young researchers. ***
