This award will support student travel to three co-located conferences: the
International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2013), the
International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2013),
and the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming
(PPoPP 2013). The conferences are being held in Shenzhen, China in February
2013. These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of architecture, compilers
and parallel programming. Supporting student travel to attend professional
conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader
impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research
area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware
workforce.
