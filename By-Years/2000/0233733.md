6th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award supports partially the expenses for participation by 15 graduate students,
post-doctoral fellows, and young faculty in Sixth Annual Green Chemistry and
Engineering Conference, which will be held at the Georgetown University
Conference Center in Washington, DC, on June 25-27, 2002. The subtitle of this
conference is " Meeting Global Challenges Through Economic and Environmental
Innovations." Like its predecessor conferences, this meeting is organized around
the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards and is intended to accelerate
the adoption of cleaner processes in all sectors of industry. In addition to
presentation by award winners, research papers and posters on relevant topics
are given. This year's conference is focusing on the role of science and
technology in addressing such environmental issues as climate change, energy and
food production, water and resource depletion, and the reduction of toxics in
the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support is given to expand
exposure and participation of young scientists and engineering and thus to
contribute to education and expansion of research activities in this important
environmental area.&lt;br/&gt;
