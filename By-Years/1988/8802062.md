This research is concerned with the study of invariants for torsion-free
abelian groups of finite rank and finite valuated p- groups. Successful
completion of this project will result in a complete set of invariants for a
large class of mixed abelian groups that includes the class of Warfield groups.
Other areas of investigation include the connection with vector space
representations of finite partially ordered sets, the structure of torsion-free
abelian groups that are flat as modules over their endomorphism ring, and
E-modules. This project is in the general area of abelian group theory and is
concerned with the classification of abelian groups. Although the classification
of finite abelian groups has been well understood for a century, the
classification of infinite abelian groups remains elusive. This research
involves this old problem of classification of the infinite abelian groups,
approached with new techniques.
