This award supports the C4 and CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) Plant Biology
2013 symposium, to be held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
IL, August 6-9, 2013. The symposium aims to bring together a diverse group of
scientists to discuss the evolution, ecology, functional biology, genomics, and
biotechnological engineering of C4 and CAM plants. These two groups of plants
possess evolutionary modifications to their photosynthetic machinery that
improve their performance in hot and dry conditions. Maize and pineapple are
classic examples of C4 and CAM plants, respectively. The symposium aims to
facilitate discuss on how lessons learned from these groups of plants can be
harnessed to improve crop production in an era of global climate change. The
interdisciplinary nature of the symposium means that the expected attendeed
typically do not collectively attend any one scientific society meeting. As a
result, the symposium will be a unique opportunity for knowledge transfer,
initiation of new collaborations, and recruitment and exposure of early career
scientists. The symposium is expected to attract 125 participants from around
the world, including from developing regions where C4 and CAM plants dominate
agricultural and/or natural ecosystems. The resources derived from this award
will be used to (1) record video and audio footage of conference presentations
for dissemination via the symposium web page to a broader audience; and (2) to
promote participation of under-represented groups including under-represented
racial groups, under-represented geographic regions, early-career scientists,
and female scientists. Overall, the symposium will provide a face-to-face and
on-line gathering point for plant biologists who together can advance efforts to
deal with major societal problems of food security, fuel supply and ecological
sustainability.
