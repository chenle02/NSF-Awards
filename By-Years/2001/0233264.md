0233264&lt;br/&gt;Neiman&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI, co-PI, and
graduate students from the University of Missouri-St. Louis in a collaboration
with Peter Tass of the Institute for Medicines at the Research Center Juelich,
Germany. The joint research effort will combine theoretical and experimental
studies of mechanisms of stochastic synchronization and de-synchronization for
deep brain stimulation therapy of Parkinson's disease by the German group and
experimental electrophysiological and theoretical modeling of stochastic
synchronization and phase resetting in electroreceptors of paddlefish by the US
group. The specific goal of the collaboration is to understand general
mechanisms for controlling synchronization in noisy oscillating neurons and to
validate the effectiveness and neural basis of novel stimulus protocols
developed by the German group for treating Parkinson's patients by deep brain
stimulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has an educational objective.
The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing
research in another country. They will develop a heightened appreciation of the
world around them while also learning important new technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;
