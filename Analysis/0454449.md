This is a proposal for a small regional conference in each of the next three
years. This conference, Virginia Operator Theory and Analysis Meeting (VOTCAM),
has been held yearly since 1992 and attracts several people from well beyond
Virginia, in spite of its name. Indeed, it often attracts international
participants.
