This award continues support for semiannual meetings concentrating on two areas
of mathematical research: harmonic analysis and real analysis. There have been
eleven meetings to date. They center on two or three primary speakers, usually
invited from major research centers. Other guests present results as well. In
addition to local faculty, about 30 visiting participants attend, most coming
from institutions located in the Southeastern United States. Considerable effort
is made to attract graduate students by providing them with modest funding. In
addition to the research which develops from these conferences, important
contacts are made which provide the principal investigator with new avenues for
recruiting students as well attracting visitors and permanent faculty.
