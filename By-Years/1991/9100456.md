This project will test some major assumptions of life history models for body
size and norms of reaction in age and size at maturity. The intraspecific
scaling of reproductive effort will be described and mortality and the
relationship between larval growth and adult life history parameters in four
species of carrion flies from two families (Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae)
measured. Comparisons of the shapes of reaction norms provides a powerful tool
for testing the assumptions of life history models. The proposed work will
significantly increase our knowledge of the factors influencing the evolution of
insect body size and the consequences of alternative criteria for fitness in the
prediction of values for life history traits at evolutionary equilibria. Body
size is correlated with virtually all other aspects of animal life histories,
therefore insight into the evolution of animal size should lead to an improved
understanding of the evolution of many other features of life histories.
