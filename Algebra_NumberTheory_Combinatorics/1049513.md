This project concerns the application of algebraic and combinatorial tools in
two settings: (1) cluster algebras and totally positive varieties: in
particular, the study of the Fomin-Zelevinsky positivity conjecture and
construction of canonical positive bases for cluster algebras; and the study of
the topology of the totally non-negative part of a flag variety. (2) physical
combinatorics: in particular the exploration of connections between the
asymmetric exclusion process, orthogonal polynomials, soliton solutions of the
KP equation, and total positivity on the Grassmannian.

From a broader perspective, this research project will reinforce interactions
between combinatorics, representation theory, statistical physics, and
integrable systems, with hopefully a significant impact on all fields. In the
longer term, it may also have applications to the mathematics of traffic flow,
translation in protein synthesis, or shallow water waves. Integrating education
and research, the PI will organize student seminars and a two-week summer school
on cluster algebras, a field containing many accessible open problems. This
project also seeks to achieve two other educational goals: increasing the
visibility of women mathematicians, via a series of Colloquium lectures at
Berkeley given by distinguished women; and bridging the student-faculty divide
at Berkeley, by organizing activities that will bring together undergraduates,
graduate students and faculty.
