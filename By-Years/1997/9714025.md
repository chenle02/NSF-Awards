9714025 Hardin This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is based on the
unexpected observation that a set of guanine-rich oligodeoxynucleotide primers
as well as related telomeric sequences from yeast, Oxytricha and Tetrahymena are
capable of priming DNA synthesis by Taq DNA polymerase in the absence of an
independent DNA template. This research will determine the rules for base
incorporation by DNA polymerase using non-B DNA template structures, which
preliminary data indicates is very specific. Polymerase fidelity will be
determined by cloning and sequencing products of multiple, independent
polymerase chain reactions using a variety of primers, and the sequence data
will be analyzed for consistency of base incorporation. Results from this
research will facilitate development of a system to investigate the chemistry
and enzymology of genome expansion as it relates to genome evolution, and may
reveal an alternative mechanism for maintaining chromosome ends (telomers). This
