Small islands in the Gulf of California support extraordinarily high densities
of many species compared to larger islands or the mainland. Three variables are
important: productivity flowing from the marine to terrestrial ecosystems; the
presence of predators; and relative colonizing ability. Small island receive
more nutrients from shore drift and marine birds (land plants provide little
energy). The scaling effect is counter-intuitive to the general notion that
larger islands are more productive. Scaling also influences predation: small
islands lack many predators found on larger islands, allowing high marine
productivity to produce large populations. Predators drastically reduce
population size on larger islands and the mainland. Thus community and food web
dynamics vary greatly with habitat size, productivity, species composition and
dependence on habitats. Overall, the research objectives are to connect the
seemingly unrelated food webs form marine and terrestrial systems and to
integrate elements of landscape ecology with the effects of variable production
and productivity to understand food web and community structure. In general this
research provides an understanding of factors affecting abundance and
biodiversity. This system is a general model for fragmented habitats, each of
different size and each exhibiting different combinations of species and
interconnections to other habitats.
