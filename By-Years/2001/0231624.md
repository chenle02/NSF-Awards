Since September 11, 2001, major efforts are underway in the U.S. to update and
improve emergency management capabilities, plans, and practices in order to deal
with terrorism. Therefore, it is timely and important to critically analyze and
connect past major disaster events and their outcomes. This project will
document recent major defining terrorist events and the emergency management
infrastructure of laws, regulations, practices, and expert systems that have
evolved, during the period 1988-2001. This systematic examination of recent
terrorist events and their outcomes will lay the groundwork for educators and
practitioners seeking to understand past events and their outcomes and
contribute to more informed decision-making in the future.

The approach will be to:

? Systematically identify and analyze major defining events and document them in
a narrative chronology;

? Identify and describe the major outcomes from each defining event, including
(a) reports and studies; (b) legislation and regulations; and (c) policies,
program and organizational changes; and

? Describe the causal relationships between the events and their major outcomes,
to the extent that the information collected allows.

The final products of this six-month effort will include professional papers and
journal articles. Also, the products will be available on a project website.
