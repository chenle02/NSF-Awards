Researchers in genetics, ecosystems, and soils sciences will unite to develop an
integrative proposal to assess the interrelationships between above and
belowground biodiversity and ecosystem function in pastoral and wildlife
dominated savannas in East Africa. The research will: 1) assess the diversity of
the major components of these ecosystems from microbial genes to landscapes and
human land uses, 2) relate this diversity to selected ecosystem functions, and
3) test basic hypotheses that relate diversity and function of the parts to
system-level resilience or 'health' in the face of stressors such as land-use
changes and human population growth.

These findings will elucidate the importance of biodiversity for human well-
being, and enhance efforts to conserve the Greater Serengeti-Mara and other
world-renowned wildlife ecosystems that are inhabited by humans who depend on
sustainable ecosystem services. A symposium will be organized around the themes
and objectives of the project to convey our current understanding and thoughts
for moving forward to the broader community and to the public. A planning
meeting will be held with members of the local East African community to present
ideas, obtain their feedback, and design the study to provide useful
information.
