*** 9661477 Pirzada This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will
investigate the synthesis and processing of nano-engineered materials for
switching power supplies operating above 5 MHz. Conventional materials have
excessive eddy current losses at frequencies above 1 to 5 MHz levels, making
them unsuitable for higher frequency applications. Monodisperse, nano-engineered
materials offer breakthrough potential in enabling very high frequency (1 GHz)
operation while maintaining unavoidable eddy losses to an acceptable level.
During Phase I, this research will show that commercially useful, nano-
engineered materials for switching power supply applications can produced. Phase
II effort will seek to optimize the process and produce prototype ferrite
components. Phase III will commercialize the technology. If successful, this
research would help launch miniaturized switching power supplies. Proposed
research would provide the material related breakthrough eagerly sought by high
frequency power supplies market. Potential specific customers include the
electrical, electronic, and communication industries. The technology will also
be timely for the anticipated market trend towards miniaturization of multilayer
chip inductors for SMD applications. ***
