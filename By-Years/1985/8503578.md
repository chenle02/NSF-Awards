Traffic control at intersections of highways and streets is currently performed
by pre-timed signal devices. This method of controlling traffic at an
intersection is inefficient because the green and red lights stay on for the
present time whether there is traffic or not. This project will investigate the
feasibility of replacing the pre-timed devices with traffic actuated controls.
By this method, the traffic in a particular highway or street will actuate the
controls when needed. The technique will provide real-time optimization of the
traffic signal operations. The benefits to be derived are increased efficiency
of traffic flow at intersections with an accompanying decrease in air pollution.
