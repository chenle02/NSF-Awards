The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) is planning and developing a
STEM concentration within its recently-launched Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT)
degree program. The concentration is focused on preparing aspiring teachers to
meet the state requirements for licensure in Middle School Science in the
District of Columbia. The project is developing UDC's capacity in areas that are
critical to offering a high-quality teacher preparation program for aspiring
middle-school science teachers. Key outcomes for the project include:
&lt;br/&gt;1) Ready-to-teach curriculum for a MAT concentration in Middle School
Science; &lt;br/&gt;2) Program approval within UDC, and through the state
education office; &lt;br/&gt;3) Programmatic materials to wrap around the
curriculum; and &lt;br/&gt;4) A strong, engaged network of STEM professionals
and partner institutions prepared to support program implementation as adjunct
faculty and/or experiential learning partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Urban
Teacher Academy at UDC prepares teacher candidates to differentiate instruction
for exceptional learners and students building academic language proficiency.
The project team includes teacher educators, a special educator, and language
development experts in addition to STEM faculty and content experts from partner
organizations. Project FAST Capacity is leading to the creation of a well-
designed teacher preparation program for middle grades science, tailored to
preparing teachers for high-needs urban schools, as well as a strategic plan for
recruiting and preparing aspiring teachers from underrepresented minority
backgrounds.
