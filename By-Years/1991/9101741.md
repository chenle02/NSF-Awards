The work will focus on regional (as opposed to single site) flood frequency
analysis with the purpose of estimating flood quantiles based on information
available at many sites in a region. One specific objective is to study in
detail the characterization of floods which exhibit correlations among the sites
of the region. The analytical work will be carried out to allow both spatial
dependence and parametric structure to be considered, and to assess the utility
of historical/paleo-data in a regional setting. The potential gains of regional
analysis over single site analysis will be determined by comparing various
simulation models. Models that have features in common and that are compatible
with real flood data will be identified and corresponding applications will be
made.
