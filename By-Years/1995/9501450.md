In this project funded through the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)
Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Andrew Cooksy of the Department of
Chemistry of the University of Mississippi will investigate and characterize
electronic states of a series of combustion related hydrocarbon chain radicals
for which the chemistry is likely to differ substantially from the ground state.
The excitation energies of these states, their structures as well as their
electron distributions will be determined spectroscopically. The radicals C3H,
C4H, HC4H2 and HC3O, as well as the triplet states of H2C3 and H2C4 will be
produced continuously in a supersonic free jet by a modified version of
pyrolysis sources. Accompanying the research activity is a specified education
effort appropriate to the development of a full, balanced, academic career. The
study of the properties of combustion related free radicals is important in that
it provides data and models for the improvement of combustion processes in
internal combustion engines as well as in other power sources.
