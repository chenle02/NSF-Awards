9414424 Wu This research project focuses on the development of an innovative
technique calculate transient as well as steady-state acoustic radiation from an
arbitrarily vibrating object moving in the proximity of a solid, stationary
surface. With this method, engineers involved with the design of automotive
components such as side panels, hoods and oil pans are able to explore
alternative designs for minimizing the noise levels and satisfying the pass-by
noise requirements SAE J986, J1470 and ECD51. The approach uses an explicit form
of solution for the radiated acoustic pressure in the frequency domain in terms
of the normal component of the velocity distribution on the surface of an object
via the Kirchhoff integral theory. The time-domain signal is obtained using an
inverse Fourier transformation. The effect of sound scattering from a nearby
solid, stationary surface is accounted for by rising the image source method.
Although the technique is of immediate value to automotive industry, its
applicability is much broader since it deals with acoustic radiation from an
arbitrarily vibrating object. ***
