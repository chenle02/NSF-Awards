Global Climate Change Research and Education (GCCRE) Workshop, Geneva,
Switzerland, January, 2009

OISE - 0855007 Ed Geary, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research

The Global Initiatives program in the Office of International Science and
Engineering will support the Global Climate Change Research and Education
Workshop that will be held at the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva,
Switzerland in January, 2009

This Workshop is about collaboration building. This Geneva Workshop is intended
to create a synergy that will hopefully launch several climate campaign planning
workshops during the coming two-three years in all six GLOBE Regions. This
initial workshop is intended to build international support from the climate
science and education communities for the Student Climate Research Campaign that
GLOBE will hopefully launch in 2011. This initial set of collaborators will in
turn, help GLOBE to identify additional scientists, educators, and organizations
to collaborate within each GLOBE region during the next 2-3 years.
