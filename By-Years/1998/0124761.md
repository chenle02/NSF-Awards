0124761 Stuart The goal of the proposed research is to develop a modeling
framework and rapid materials identification methodologies to significantly
improve resource utilization in the thermoplastics supply cycle. The specific
goals are to: (1) design and develop an instrumental methodology for the off-
line and in-process composition monitoring of pure and mixed polymer feed stocks
(resin pellets/regrind, and (2) design and develop a computational model that
links composition information derived from material analysis in the supply chain
with knowledge of molder demand to decide new criteria for selecting blending
compositions and inventory quantities in the plastics supply cycle. The ultimate
objective is to provide viable means to overcome significant barriers to the
development of a sustainable supply cycle for plastics manufacturing.
