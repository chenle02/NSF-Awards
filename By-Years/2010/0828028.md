University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Principal Investigators (PIs) plan to design, synthesize, and characterize the
properties of a new family of silk-based diblock copolymers. This work builds on
a recently completed NSF grant, in which the PIs have described many aspects of
silk-protein biophysical features related to material properties for this unique
family of proteins. These studies provided insight into the mechanistic behavior
of silk protein self-assembly into organized material structures, as well as
various biomaterial applications for these assembled
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact of the planned studies will be both technical and
educational.&lt;br/&gt;The new polymers may have impact in many areas of
specialty materials as well as providing fundamental insight into self-assembly.
Impact on green chemistry is anticipated due to the all aqueous processing in
the designs, assembly, and degradability of the structures derived from the
proteins. Educational outreach for undergraduate and graduate students as well
as the faculty involved will also be significant. This will be realized via
laboratory rotations in the labs of the coPIs to gain a complete
interdisciplinary experience; classroom impact for K-12 programs run through the
Center for Engineering Education Outreach (CEEO); and opportunities to engage a
wide range of undergraduate students, such as through the Summer Scholars, NIH-
sponsored BREEM (Biomedical Research Experiences for Engineering Majors) and
NIH-sponsored BEND (Bringing Engineers into New Disciplines) programs at Tufts.
The coPIs will develop new course modules for both the new Engineering Biology
Course and the Biophysics Course under this activity. Specific plans to address
Women and Underrepresented Minorities are an integrated aspect of the program.
