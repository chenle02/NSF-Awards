leading set theorists, model theorists, proof theorists, reverse mathematicians,
computer scientists and philosophers of logic and of mathematics. The quality of
the program can be inferred from just the list of plenary speakers: Martin

and abstracts received thus far can be seen at http://people.cohums.ohio-
state.edu/tennant9/titles_and_abstracts.html The conference will be a key
opportunity for foundationalists to learn about and discuss important advances
in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific projects.
Travel grants will allow graduate students and young researchers to come to the
conference. Most of the participants will be research mathematicians and
university teachers. What they learn at the conference will have a positive
impact on their research and teaching.
