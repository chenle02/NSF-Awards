The Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP) will organize a full-day
workshop that explores the Japanese research efforts towards next-generation
extreme computing at the SC14 international conference to be held in November
2014 in New Orleans. The workshop has been accepted and is a part of the SC14
workshop series. A full copy of the workshop proceedings will be available
through the ATIP website at and/or the Association of Computer Machinery (ACM)
Digital Library. ATIP's workshop contributes to improving a general
understanding of Japanese research approaches towards high performance computing
(HPC) at scale. The workshop also facilitates discussion between government
agencies and HPC scientists and vendors at an international level, which could
stimulate new directions of research and practical use.

This workshop brings together top scientists and graduate students from both the
US and Japan (supported by Japanese government) to form connections that may
lead to future research collaborations or cooperative commercialization efforts
for practical HPC applications.
