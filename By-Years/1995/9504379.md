Statistical Theory and Methodology' ABSTRACT: The main research areas
investigated under this award include: (1) Exact methods for large, sparse
contingency tables based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques; (2)
Improvements on the accuracy of classical normal and Edgeworth expansions, based
on Stein's method; (3) The use of specially designed exponential families for
density estimation and empirical Bayes situations; (4) The application of
bootstrap-based techniques for confidence intervals, likelihood analysis, and
bias-correction; and (5) Length and volume calculations based on Hotelling's
tube formula for routine use in simultaneous testing situations. The long-term
goal of this research is the development of promising theoretical ideas into
methodologies of direct value to applied statisticians and their scientific
clients. This form of technology transfer aims to take advantage of current
developments in the range and power of new statistical methodology. The ideas
here fall into the general category of "computer-intensive methods", which are
methods that take advantage of modern computer power to free statistical
analysis from the bounds of classical mathematical tractability. The research
does not banish mathematics, but uses mathematics to produce statistical tools
that can work automatically on a wide variety of problems. The computer-
intensive part comes in at the level of the statistical consumer, where
computation is substituted for the usual normal theory approximations and
routine but difficult mathematical computations.
