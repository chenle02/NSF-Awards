9707183&lt;br/&gt;Kutzner&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical and computational studies of
atomic photoionization which include core polorization and relaxation are
performed using many-body perturbation methods. This research from an RUI
institution contributes substantially to the training of undergraduates in
atomic physics.&lt;br/&gt;
