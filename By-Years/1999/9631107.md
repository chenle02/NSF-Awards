9631107 Beauge Calcium (Ca) ions act as transducers of the information reaching
the cell surface into a language known by the cell interior in nearly all animal
cells. Changes in intracellular calcium concentrations is the signal that
activates functions like hormone secretion, muscle contraction, and nerve-cell
communication. The actual signal is a large increase in the concentration of the
intracellular Ca, after which the Ca concentration returns rapidly to the
"resting" levels. The research funded by this grant is directed at one of the
mechanisms responsible for the "recovery" of resting Ca concentration levels -
sodium (Na) ion/calcium ion exchange. The emphasis is on the control of this
exchange system by two phosphoryl group donors: ATP and phosphoarginine. This
work is carried out on a giant axon in the squid where the internal and external
environments can be controlled by the experimenters.. Understanding the
mechanisms by which Na-Ca exchange is regulated is crucial for understanding the
mechanisms that underlie neural signaling in all animals. In addition, it is
crucial for understanding muscle contraction.
