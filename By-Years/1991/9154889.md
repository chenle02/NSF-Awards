The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, will initiate a six- week,
residential, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project in Biology, Chemistry and
Physics which will offer science enrichment activities to 40 students entering
grade 9. The talented participants (principally drawn from inner-city Baltimore)
in the Horizons Exploration Program (HEP) will acquire knowledge, develop
skills, learn about educational opportunities and gain insights into a variety
of careers in these disciplines. This work will be augmented by instruction in
mathematics, computer science and technical reading and writing. Although the
goals of the program will be achieved through the three themes of biology,
chemistry and physics, strong emphasis will be placed on biology as the major
discipline; this is the first science class that most ninth graders face as they
enter the city high schools.
