Abstract

Title: Combinatorial problems arising in finite group theory, 3-manifold
Topology and other areas.

Shareshian works on combinatorial problems with applications in other fields.
His joint work with R. Roberts and M. Stein involves using the theory of group
actions on tree-like objects to investigate foliations of 3-manifolds. His joint
work with R. Guralnick on actions of symmetric and alternating groups on k-sets
is used to investigate monodromy groups of branched coverings of the Riemann
sphere. His joint work with M. Wachs and others on graph and hypergraph
complexes has applications in commutative algebra, finite group theory and knot
theory. His work on topology of order complexes of intervals in subgroup
lattices is intended to provide a new approach to a longstanding problem in
universal algebra.

The principal investigator works on various problems in combinatorics. Roughly,
combinatorics is the study of discrete (often finite) mathematical objects which
admit fairly elementary descriptions but whose structure can be quite
complicated. It is often the case that problems in other disciplines (such as
computer science, electrical engineering and biology) and other more technical
and abstract areas of mathematics can be reduced to combinatorial problems.
