This award supports the travel and living expenses of 12 US participants to a
US-France workshop on population and evolutionary biology, scheduled for January
6-10, 1998 in Paris, France. The co-organizers are Susan Mopper of the
University of Southwestern Louisiana and Yannis Michalakis of Marie and Pierre
Curie University. The topic of this workshop is local adaptation in parasite-
host associations. The goals are to broaden the participants exposure to diverse
study systems and empirical and theoretical strategies for investigating
parasite-host interactions and to develop a long-range strategy for renewing,
creating and sustaining productive international collaborations in population
and evolutionary biology. The workshop will lead to new collaborations between
American and French participants and advance understanding of common biological
principles and general theories of population and evolutionary biology of
parasite-host interactions.
