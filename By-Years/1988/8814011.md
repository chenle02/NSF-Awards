Applied mathematicians at RPI will develop a calculus course sequence in which
computer technology is used to equip students with powerful and versatile
problem.solving tools in order to gain deeper understanding of the underlying
mathematical concepts. Content will include numerical computation, sophisticated
graphics, symbolic computation, relations between mathematics and natural world,
and mathematical modeling. During the summer of 1988 a team of mathematicians, a
physicist, an electrical engineer and students will develop insturctional
materials to support the use of the computer in calculus. These materials will
be used in the following academic year in two or three pilot sections of the
calculus sequence. RPI is contributing $36,000 or 40% of the project.
