9310795 Cranor This study will examine scientific and ethical parameters in
decision procedures for identifying carcinogens. It involves philosophic and
scientific examination of the desirability of various carcinogen identification
procedures. The focus of the project is on substances that have been introduced
into commerce as products or into the environment as by-products of production
without having been subjected to extensive toxicity testing, where a
governmental burden of proof must be satisfied before they could be removed from
commerce. The desirability of imperfect institutional procedures for identifying
carcinogens is a complex function of their accuracy, their rate, their costs,
and the social costs of evidentiary mistakes. The philosophical research in the
project will assess the social costs of mistakes and their relative importance
and develop a philosophic rationale and a model to assess the desirability of
different procedures. The investigation will consider ways to vary relevant
parameters so as to contextualize the ethical questions. For instance, costs of
mistakes may be a function of size of exposed population, its age, or whether it
can consent to the risk. Costs may include social as well as biological costs,
factors such as perceptions of risk and social distrust. Scientific research,
augmenting the philosophical, will evaluate the accuracy, rate, and costs of the
identification procedures, and will be incorporated into the overall evaluation
and model. It will use identified carcinogens as a reference class, comparing
standard hazard identification procedures with alternatives that are being
currently used, developed, or considered. Results from the research will be
published in journals and reported at conferences and professional meetings. ***
