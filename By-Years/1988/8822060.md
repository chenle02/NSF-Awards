This research, in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is aimed at
understanding gas phase reaction dynamics at the quantum state level. Nascent
vibrational product distributions, measured by infrared chemiluminescence or
laser-induced fluorescence will be obtained for reactions proceeding on ground
potential surfaces. Improved experimental techniques will be developed to
enhance the ability to observe rotational distributions of reaction products
before relaxation occurs. Product states will be identified from visible and
ultraviolet fluorescence for reactions proceeding on electronically excited
surfaces. Laser excitation techniques will be used to prepare the initial
reactant states. The reactions to be studied involve rare gas atoms and van der
Waals complexes of rare gas atoms with halogenated molecules.
