This project will attempt to develop new concepts, methods, and algorithms for
the servomechanism of nonlinear dynamic systems using artificial neural
networks. The main thrust of the research is directed toward the investigation
of incorporating neural network controllers with nonlinear plants whose dynamics
are unknown. These controllers can be implemented by the modern systolic array
and parallel processing architectures. Servo compensator design for a general
class of nonlinear stable plants is introduced. Servo compensators in general
require the knowledge of the input/output Jacobian of the plant. An off-line
trained neural network can be made to implement the steady-state input/output
Jacobian of the nonlinear plant. The new servo scheme, utilizing the concepts of
integral manifold and singular perturbation, achieves constant set-point
tracking in plants with unknown dynamics. For tracking dynamic signals and
robustness improvements, on-line specialized training is introduced.
Decentralized experiments will be developed for estimating the input/output
characteristics of multi-input-multi-output unknown nonlinear plants using
neural networks for subsequent decentralized servo objectives. This is an
extension of the linear scheme that is valid only in unknown linear systems.
