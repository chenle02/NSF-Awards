Professor Stern will investigate the use of Lamb-shift quench radiation to map
the rich spectrum of fields (fluctuations, instabilities, elementary
excitations) supported by and excited in a plasma. The phenomena investigated
will have an important impact on solar and astrophysics as well as the
fundamental physics of plasmas.
