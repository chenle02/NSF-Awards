The University of Tennessee, School of Information Sciences and Center for
Information Studies, is partnering with the Department of Energy's Office of
Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) in this project to help
undergraduate users recognize, access, and evaluate high quality scientific and
technical information. The project's intent is to ameliorate the fact that
college students, in particular lower division undergraduates, often do not
recognize the importance of high quality scientific journal literature. Faced
with many choices, they may opt for accessing information that is most
convenient, rather than carefully evaluating the content and quality of the many
digital resources available to them. The work builds on OSTI's efforts to enable
access to scientific and technical report literature, through web-based services
such as DOE Information Bridge and the PrePRINT Network. These resources are
available to undergraduate users, yet they do not have components that will
bring undergraduate science students to them. Such collections have great
potential for undergraduate use via collaborative learning environments and
provide testbeds for enhancing educational access to all parts of a national
digital network of learning environments for SMET education. Focus groups are
identifying useful search and retrieval features for undergraduates, graduate
students, and science faculty; and selected features are being implemented and
tested.
