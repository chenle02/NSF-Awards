Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics VIII is the eighth workshop in the series
that was begun in 1991. These workshops aim to advance statistical practice by
examining Bayesian methods in specific applied contexts. The workshops are held
in odd years at Carnegie Mellon University in early fall. The eighth workshop is
planned for September 16--17, 2005. The objectives of the workshop, "Case
Studies in Bayesian Statistics VIII" is are to explore the interplay of
statistical theory and practice in the context of substantive scientific
research; to promote the continued development of Bayesian statistics by
highlighting problems in the sciences that require non-standard approaches; to
provide an opportunity for scientists and statisticians to present their work in
depth, highlighting both the scientific background and the analytical
approaches; and to encourage dissemination of the findings presented at the
workshop via well-documented and peer-reviewed case studies. As it has evolved,
this workshop series has become an important meeting for younger researchers in
Bayesian statistics. The workshop aims to encourage young researchers, including
graduate students, to present their applied work; provide a small meeting
atmosphere to facilitate the interaction of young researchers with senior
colleagues; expose young researchers to important challenges and opportunities
in collaborative research; and include as participants women, under-represented
minorities and persons with disabilities who might benefit from the small
workshop environment.
