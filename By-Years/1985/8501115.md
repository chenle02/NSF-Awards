The 1985 Gordon Research Conference on Nonlinear Optics and Lasers is to be held
at Brewster Academy, Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, July 29 - August 2, 1985. The
purpose of this conference is to provide an informal forum for the presentation
and discussion of new work on selected topics in nonlinear optics, quantum
electronics, and lasers, and their applications to physics and chemistry. An
informal atmosphere with a strong emphasis on discussion is intended to
encourage the exchange of ideas in a manner not possible at regular meetings of
professional societies. A total attendance of approximately 120 engineers and
scientists from universities and industry is anticipated.
