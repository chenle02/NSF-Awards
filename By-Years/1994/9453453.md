9453453 Chang-Hasnain Topic areas included in this research grant include: two-
dimensional semiconductor diode lasers and optoelectronic devices; novel
epitaxial growth and fabrication techniques; and the applications of these
devices in novel optical interconnects and communications architecture. Specific
projects include single mode, multi-wavelength vertical cavity surface emitting
laser arrays, novel micromachined wavelength vertical cavity surface emitting
laser arrays, novel micromachined wavelength tunable laser and switches, and WDM
optical networks implementations. ***
