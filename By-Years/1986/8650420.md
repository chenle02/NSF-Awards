A computer-aided design and drafting, CADD, system is being developed for use in
the undergraduate curriculum in basic engineering at Fort Lewis College. The
CADD approach is being used to varying degrees in different classes (e.g. as a
primary apparatus in drafting courses; as a secondary learning aid in
mechanics). In this way, undergraduate instruction is being modernized and
strengthened, so that undergraduate students in engineering will be prepared for
further education and careers in engineering.
