The research program funded by this award will provide experimental data on
nucleon structure that can be probed via the weak and the electromagnetic
interactions. These objectives are sought through two major projects which are
scheduled to take data at Jefferson Lab during the award period: the QWEAK and
DVCS/Hall A experiments.

The QWEAK experiment is a precision measurement of the weak charge of the proton
at very low energy scale. The weak charge of the proton at various energy scales
is predicted by the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and its precise value at
low energy scale would be sensitive to various physics processes beyond the
Standard Model. Thus QWEAK may provide a measure of the influence of new
particles which would be complimenatry to the direct observation at the LHC. The
DVCS/Hall A experiment will study of the correlation between the momentum and
spatial distribution of the quarks within the proton. This correlation provides
a novel way to study the proton that bridges between two well explored avenues
of nucleon studies: form factor (spatial) distributions and parton distribution
(momentum) functions.

The research group supported by this award is responsible for the data
acquisition and data analysis systems for QWEAK, and for a variety of hardware
and software projects within the DVCS/Hall A experiment. These experiements
provide outstanding opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students
to get hands-on experience with hardware and software tools and contribute to
research at a major national laboratory.
