A critical issue for process-based software development tools and methodologies
is to balance the need for innovation with knowledge of past experiences and
best practices. Achieving this balance is particularly important for software
development, which involves the development of a highly variable product
requiring continuous process adjustments. Past work has focused on either
creating process frameworks at a high level of abstraction that avoids issues of
variance or composing fine-grained activities with process languages. These
approaches miss important opportunities to capture and reuse process knowledge
as a resource for future development efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advance the state of research in
knowledge-based support for process-centered software engineering through meta-
modeling tools capable of constructing a variety of organization-level
methodologies that can be tailored to specific development efforts. The tools
are complemented by an experience-based approach that captures development
practices to continuously refine and improve the methodology to meet emerging
needs of software development organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Employ a
mixture of empirical studies to investigate process improvisation and the impact
of delivering process and product knowledge sources during the development
process. This strategy will be used to both evaluate innovative system building
efforts and improve the overall understanding of software development
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
