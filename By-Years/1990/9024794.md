This grant supports research to study nucleon interactions and nuclear dynamics
with neutrons. Nuclear reactions and scattering at neutron energies from 60 to
260 MeV will be carried out at Crocker Nuclear Laboratory and Los Alamos
National Laboratory for a range of nuclear targets. In addition, studies of
relativistic nuclear collisions centered at the Heavy Ion Superconducting
Spectrometer at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory will be augmented with a new time
projection chamber, which is now under construction.
