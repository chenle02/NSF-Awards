For medical, biological and chemical applications, microfluidic devices such as
valves, mixers and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) cantilevers are of particular
importance, but the simulation tools available to design these devices are quite
limited. This research focuses on development of fast integral equation based
solvers for the convection-diffusion equations associated with mixing and for
the Navier-Stokes problems associated with microvalves and AFM cantilever tips.
We plan to interface these fast nonlinear solvers with model reduction
techniques so as to automatically extract system models of these microfluidic
components, making it possible for designers to perform system level simulation
and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research developed in this proposal
will be carried out in conjunction with an educational program. The educational
objectives are to promote the involvement of minorities and women in the
research area of design of Micro/Nano systems. To create impact of the proposed
research on MEMS industry, software resulting from this research will be placed
in the public domain and will be available via the web.&lt;br/&gt;
