The project concerns universal large-scale behavior of random growing
interfaces, which are mathematical models that describe real physical processes
such as propagating fire fronts, growing liquid crystals, bacterial colonies and
coffee stains. These processes are typically modeled using the statistical
mechanics approach, i.e. by considering large systems of interacting particles,
where each particle corresponds to a molecule or an individual bacterium.
Imprecision of our measurements and dependence of physical processes on many
factors are typically described by random perturbations of particles. Large-
scale behavior of such models is observed when one looks at the systems from a
sufficiently large distance, after a sufficiently long period of time.
Universality in this case refers to the fact that such growing interfaces
exhibit similar large-scale behavior. Description of this universal behavior
gives a better understanding of the real physical processes in nature. Recent
breakthroughs in probability theory, particularly in stochastic partial
differential equations and integrable probability, have provided the tools to
study such mathematical models.

The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality arises in non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics, when studying limiting behavior of random growing interfaces. On the
mathematical level, growing interfaces appear in free energies of directed
random polymers, random growth models, interacting particle systems, stochastic
Burgers and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and stochastically perturbed
reaction-diffusion equations. Depending on the characteristics of models, two
universal objects are conjectured to govern such interfaces: the KPZ equation
and the KPZ fixed point. Recent developments in the area of stochastic PDEs
allow to prove scaling limits of various discrete systems to singular stochastic
PDEs. Moreover, methods of integrable probability (exactly solvable models)
provided a complete characterization of the KPZ fixed point. The goal of this
project is to study universal scaling limits of such random growing interfaces
using these new results.
