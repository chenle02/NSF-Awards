With the ultimate goal of improving elementary teachers' concept understanding
of physical science and their physical science teaching skills, the objective of
this proposed project is: To encourage and enable colleges and universities to
provide physical science courses which are more appropriate to the entry-level
background of students, which better honor the learning process, and which are
more attuned to the exit-level needs of future elementary school science
teachers. To accomplish this stated objective, the AAPT proposes to provide a
carefully orchestrated program of awareness and training sessions and follow-up
support activities for physics and physical science faculty using Powerful Ideas
in Physical Science: A Model Course (NSF#TPE-9154024) which is based on well-
documented research findings about science learning. It features a hands-on
constructivist approach, represents a "less is more" philosophy, includes
content selected specifically for the needs of future primary teachers, and uses
both traditional and alternative assessments. The model represents the
cumulative efforts of a group of physics, chemistry and science education
faculty representing twelve different colleges and universities. It has been
intentionally designed to be transportable to a variety of institutions. This
proposal requests funding for a three-year program to train and support physical
science faculty from colleges and universities across the nation to use the
model to reform their physical science courses for prospective elementary
teachers. Three levels of disseminatimn are proposed: 1) Awareness Workshops, 2)
Professional Development Seminars, and 3) Summer Faculty Enhancement Programs.
Technical assistance visits to participants' institutions will help assure the
quality of reform efforts. Continuing follow-up support for program participants
will be provided through an electronic bulletin board, articles and information
in AAPT publications, and special session s at meetings of the AAPT.
