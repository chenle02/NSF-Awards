The goal of this research is to develop an innovative and unified methodology
for designing self-repairable ultra-large integated (ULSI) circuits and multi-
chip module (MCM) chips. This research will exploit the combinatorial
optimization capabilities offered by adaptive circuits consisting of simple
threshold devices interconnected programmable resistive networks for the purpose
of adding a self-repair capability to hardware devices. The proposed research
will be conducted in three phases. In the first phase, theoretical models for
both regular array logic and unstructured random logic repar problems will be
developed, and entensive simulations will be performed to measure the
performance of the adaptive self-repair circuits. In the second phase, adaptive
circuits will be designed using CMOS technology, and experimental chips willbe
fabricated and tested as "proofs. of concept." In the third phase, software will
be developed to allow the proposed adaptive bult-in-self-repar circuits to be
automatically synthesized by VLSI/CAD software and invorporated within macro
blocks. This project initiates a new area of research that is a natural sequel
to the on-going works in the fields of Built-In- Self-Testing (BIST) and Design
for Testability (DFT).
