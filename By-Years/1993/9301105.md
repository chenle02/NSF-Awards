9301105 O'Sullivan Under this award the Principal Investigator will investigate
various aspects of middle atmospheric dynamics using two global circulation
models. The first topic involves the secondary circulations which result from
the cross-equatorial flow that results from inertial instabilities in the
stratospheric flows. Better definition of these circulations is essential to
understand vertical diffusion of atmospheric constituents. The second
investigation will be into inertia-gravity wave generation and subsequent
effects on the polar vortex and transports in and out of the vortex. Results are
important to understanding the chemistry that occurs within the vortex,
including ozone depletion. The third task is to explore the relationship between
the quasi- biennial oscillation and interannual variability of stratospheric
ozone at high latitudes. Finally, Dr. O'Sullivan will attempt to model the
tropospheric-stratospheric response to large-scale localized tropical heating,
that is, deep convection such as that found over the western tropical Pacific.
