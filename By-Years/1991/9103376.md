The research project will focus on the development of experimental techniques
for studying nuclear spin relaxation behavior and molecular motion in solid
materials of chemical, biological, and technological interest. The main tool of
investigation is deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), where spin
relaxation and lineshape analysis have proven to be extremely powerful
techniques for elucidating motion in solids on timescales ranging from
microseconds to picoseconds. One aim of the proposed work is to extend the range
of systems amenable to slow motion analysis and to invent pulse sequences which
are routinely applicable by nonspecialists. A second project involves using
molecular dynamics simulations in new ways to interpret spin relaxation data. If
successful, this project may provide a new and general method of matching the
optimal simulation procedure to the dynamic process of greatest experimental
relevance.
