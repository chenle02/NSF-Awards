This project involves laboratory studies to improve the understanding of the
conditions by which hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) are
produced by electrical discharges such as lightning. This research will also
investigate the generation of lightning produced ozone and nitrogen oxides.
These efforts will improve the parameterizations of the production of lightning-
produced hydrogen oxide radicals in chemical transport and climate models,
leading to better predictions for air quality and climate
change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes 7 tasks: (1) Performing more
laboratory studies over a greater range of temperature, pressure, and water
vapor ranges that match atmospheric conditions at different altitudes; (2)
Testing the dependence of lightning-produced hydrogen oxide radicals, (LHOx),
lightning-produced ozone (LO3), and lightning-produced nitrogen oxides (LNOx) on
the presence of cloud particles with different cloud water content; (3)
Generating the visible and subvisible electrical discharges by different
methods; (4) Exploring the generation of LHOx, LO3, and LNOx with subvisible
discharges, corona, and sparks over a wider range of charge transfer; (5)
Determining the cause of the slower-than-expected decay of LHOx in the presence
of 100â€™s of ppbv to ppmv levels of spark-generated LNOx; (6) Examining particle
production; and (7) Working with cloud modelers and chemical transport modelers
on parameterizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort includes the training of
both undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar who will
participate in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
