Traditional cost analysis in manufacturing contains many assumptions that
eventually lead to incorrect decisions. Cost accounting does not include
adequate production models and assumes that costs are linear. Cost allocation
rules used in these models may distort the perceived part costs and lead to
incorrect decisions. The proposers propose a new method of analysis: a total
system model. It creates a complete model of both the production system and
business expenses. It uses queling theory to model the production system.
Details and benefits of this model are included. The cost model contains the
production related costs as well as all non-production resources and their
expenses. This data needs to be sufficient to create a financial statement for
the manufacturing unit. Analyzing each production scenario will involve building
a system model of that scenario. Decisions are made by comparing the system
models of each possible scenario. This method of analysis avoids the pitfalls of
traditional cost analysis and can answer previously unaddressed questions in a
simple and understandable manner.
