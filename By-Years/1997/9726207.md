This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
dielectric studies of structure and properties of polymeric materials during
cure and use. The project involves David Kranbuehl and his students at the
College of William and Mary, researchers at NSF's Science and Technology Center
for Higher Performance Polymeric Adhesives and Composites at Virginia
Polytechnic University, and G. Boiteux and J.P. Pascault at the University of
Lyon. The investigators will study model systems which focus on and isolate the
topology of the various stages of thermoset cure, linear step growth, pregel
formation, branching, onset of gel, network structure and glass formation. The
US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise on cure process modeling
and life monitoring and cure of high performance polymeric materials. This is
complemented by French expertise on structure-property relationships of
polymeric materials, dielectric measurements, and synthesis and formulation of
polymer blends. The project will advance understanding of the relationships of
molecular mobility and polarity as a molecular probe of macroscopic properties
of polymeric materials.
