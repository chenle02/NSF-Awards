This is a proposal to examine the evolutionary genetics of a pair of New World
primates, the mantled howler monkey and the black howler monkey ( A. palliata).
The goals of this study include a reconstruction of the ancient invasion of
Central America by howler monkeys and, as a secondary objective, a genetic
analysis of social structure in a well-studied population of mantled howlers. A
SGER grant is requested here to support a preliminary survey of genetic
variation in mantled and black howler monkeys that will demonstrate the
feasibility of this study. This study will significantly augment our
understanding of primate evolutionary dynamics in two ways: (1) The results of
this study will provide a preliminary model for the population genetics of
Central American primates. (2) The information generated by this preliminary
study about New World primate genetics will also contribute to future ecological
and evolutionary studies in this group.
