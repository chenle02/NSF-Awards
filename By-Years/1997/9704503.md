This project plans to investigate how to best use multiple workstations to
support modern, highly interactive applications. The initial focus is on the
real-time rendering of 3D computer generated scenes. These applications present
two key new problems in the use of multi-computers: they stress resources in the
machines (e.g., memory bandwidth and outboard video processing capability) other
than just processor speed and network bandwidth, and "good performance" means
meeting the short time deadline by which the next frame must be produced rather
than minimizing the duration of a fairly long execution. The focus of this
project is on resource allocation: how to divide system-wide resources among the
components of the problem that must be done so that performance objectives can
be met. The current effort is aimed at solving this problem in an environment
where both the work to be performed and the total resources that are available
are relatively constant from frame to frame. A longer term goal of the work is
to investigate the use of replication to help assure that deadlines will
continue to be met in more dynamic environments.
