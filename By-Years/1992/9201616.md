This U.S.-Venezuela award will support a research collaboration between
Professor Richard Hanlin of the University of Georgia and Professor Omar
Tortolero of the Universidad Central de Venezuela in Maracay, Venezuela. The
purpose of the research is to collect, identify and study Venezuelan
ascomycetes, with emphasis on plant pathogenic species. The ascomycetes comprise
a major component of the fungal flora in tropical countries. Many of them grow
parasitically on plants, and some cause serious diseases of economically
important crops. Many of the plant pathogenic ascomycetes in the tropics,
however, are poorly understood biologically, and even their exact identification
is often uncertain. By combining the expertise of a Venezuelan plant pathologist
acquainted with numerous plant diseases caused by tropical ascomycetes, with one
of the world's leading ascomycetes researchers, this project will increase our
understanding of this important family of fungi.
