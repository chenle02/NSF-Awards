This award provides funds to modernize and expand the Neurobiology and Animal
Physiology laboratories in the Biology Department at Wake Forest University. The
science of physiology is the analysis of function in living organisms.
Physiology should be a part of any well-rounded undergraduate biology
curriculum. Physiology can serve as a bridge between molecular biology and
behavioral and ecological biology. Neurobiology, which includes the physiology
of the nervous system, is a growing area of biology as evidenced in the
increasing number of participants at the annual society for Neuroscience Meeting
and the increase in funding in that area. Laboratories in neurobiology
(neurophysiology) and physiology give undergraduate students a chance to
manipulate and examine systems which they can relate to their own bodies. Many
of the students taking these courses are preparing for professional careers in
medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine. Physiology laboratories give
students an opportunity to test their manual skills and dexterity which they may
use in their future careers. The Neurobiology and Animal Physiology courses are
taught in alternate semesters and the new equipment will be used in both
courses. The new instrumentation will have several effects. (1) It will free
research equipment that the P.I. is now using to teach the Neurobiology
laboratories. (2) It will allow more students to take the Neurobiology lab. (3)
It will allow for an increase in the number of experiments performed in Animal
Physiology. (4) It will allow students in Animal Physiology to do the same
experiments at the same time. (5) It will introduce students to the use of
computers in physiological science. The grantee is matching this award with non-
federal sources.
