PI: Gloria M. Coruzzi (New York University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Robert
DeSalle (American Museum Natural History), W. Richard McCombie (Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratories), Dennis E. Shasha (New York University), and Dennis W.
Stevenson (New York Botanical Garden)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senior Personnel:
Eric Brenner (New York Botanical Garden), Manpreet Katari (New York University),
Ernest Lee (American Museum of Natural History), and Robert Martienssen (Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
exploit plant genome diversity to discover new genes involved in the development
of seeds. This project combines the expertise of scientists from four
research/educational institutions specializing in evolution and genomics to
build upon a previously funded pilot project to generate new data, resources,
and bioinformatic tools and analytical pipelines to enable functional trait-to-
gene predictions for any species based on phylogeny and/or machine learning
approaches. It is envisioned that the data and software resources generated will
empower Comparative Genomic researchers to exploit plant diversity to identify
genes associated with any trait of interest or economic value. All sequence data
will be available at GenBank and all germplasm through the New York Botanical
Gardens. In addition, the public can access data, tools, and resources generated
from this project at the following links: OrthologID
