This award is a to develop an intelligent gear inspection system to measure the
dimensions of manufactured gears, quickly and precisely using non-contact
measurement sensors. This gear inspection system, which is being developed in
close collaboration with an industrial co-sponsor, will utilize laser
vibrometers and proximity probes to measure the gear parameters in an extremely
rapid fashion in comparison to conventional gear checkers. The development of
software to evaluate the gear will also be an integral part of the project. This
award which will enable an academic to work in close cooperation with an
industrial co-sponsor, while tackling a serious manufacturing problem, will be
of considerable benefit to both parties involved. Increased awareness of the
problems associated with gear manufacturing in the university environment will
be an additional benefit.
