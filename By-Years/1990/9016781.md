This project is supported under NSF Announcement No. 90-23 "Repair and
Rehabilitation Research for Seismic Resistance of Structures." Pilot tests using
bolts in slotted holes with Belleville spring washers show an excellent
potential for energy dissipation during severe cyclic loading due to slip
between faying plate surfaces. Such tests indicate stable repetitive hysteretic
behavior during numerous load reversals such as may occur during a severe
earthquake. The slip at a connection occurs at a slip-critical shear force on
the bolts. Therefore it is possible to accurately design braces and other
elements such that they would not buckle or yield under forces caused by a
seismic event. This would eliminate the most undesirable behavior occurring in
conventionally designed steel bracing. In this project the earlier studies will
be extended to a larger range of bolt sizes and types of cyclic loading. The
behavior of several bolts at a connection under cyclic loading will also be
investigated. After analysis of these results, a model test frame for
experiments on the table will be designed. Practical design procedures for
energy dissipating connections and the range of their applicability will be
developed by testing the frames with simulated earthquake loadings. It is
expected that the proposed system utilizing conventional fabrication procedures
will be exceptionally cost effective for practical applications.
