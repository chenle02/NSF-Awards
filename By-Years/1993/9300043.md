9300043 Stark The work will validate three dimensional (3 D) slope stability
analyses by using field case histories. The purpose is to evaluate the accuracy
and applicability of existing 3 D slope stability methods to field conditions;
to improve the understanding of the parameters and assumptions that affect the 3
D back calculated shear strength parameters; and to develop a new 3 D slope
stability method. The results from the project will improve the understanding of
the slope destabilization process and will have direct benefits on safety design
and slope failure avoidance. ***
