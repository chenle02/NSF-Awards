Flowering plants have been classified as self-incompatible if they do not set
seed following self-pollination, and self- compatible if they do. Recent work
shows that this fundamental distinction is oversimplified. Some plants,
including the glacier lily, can produce selfed seeds if only self pollen is
applied to the stigma, but will preferentially produce outcrossed seeds from a
mixture of self and outcross pollen. The proposed research uses genetic markers,
pollen-color markers, and DNA- staining fluorescent pollen-nucleus markers.
Novel techniques for transplanting styles and for determining the genetics of
aborted seeds will be combined with the markers to isolate the post-pollination
stage(s) at which preferential ourcrossing is expressed following mixed
pollinations. The possible role of inbreeding effects will receive special
attention. The result should constitute the most complete investigation to date
of a little known, cryptic "incompatibility" process that can potentially
determine the level of inbreeding in a population. Such knowledge will enrich
any attempts to understand the function and evolution of plant reproductive
systems, and may have practical utility in agricultural plant breeding,
especially in the production of inbred lines for hybrid seed production.
