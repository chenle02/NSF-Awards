Theoretical research in elementary particle physics and in cosmology will focus
on basic analyses of strings - both the cosmic strings which may play a role in
the clustering of galaxies and the tiny strings which are models of elementary
particles. An effort will be made to improve our understanding of the evolution
of the cosmic strings, and of the symmetries of the tiny ones. The cosmic
strings are an intriguing possible explanation for the observed clumping of
matter in the universe, and the tiny strings show promise of enabling us to
unify the description of all the fundamental forces, including gravity.
