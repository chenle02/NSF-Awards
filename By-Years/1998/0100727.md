This research investigates the generation and synthetic applications of short-
lived reactive intermediates, including 1,3-dipoles, ortho-quinodimethanes,
alpha-keto carbocations, beta-trimethylsilyl- and beta-alkoxy-substituted
carbocations. Both electrochemical and chemical means will be utilized to
generate the intermediates. The use of microemulsions and/or ionic liquids may
prove to have advantages over classical solvents as media for organic
electrochemical reactions. In addition, there is a potential benefit to society
if new "green" electrochemical methods are realized from this research.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Professor Albert J. Fry in the Department of
Chemistry at Wesleyan University. Professor Fry's research investigates the
generation and reactivity of a number of short-lived organic intermediates. In
particular, the proposed electrocatalytic regeneration of hydrogen iodide as a
reducing agent and the electrocatalytic oxidation has the potential to lead to
the development of new, environmentally friendly reactions. These reactions
could become new environmentally benign and efficient industrial processes.
