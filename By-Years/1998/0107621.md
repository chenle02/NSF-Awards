This proposal concerns the exploration of new approaches to computational
problems that arise in robotics, geographic information systems, and in
biological applications. These approaches involve techniques that lie at the
intersection of mathematics and computer science and the application of
mathematical perspectives in the development on new algorithms to solve a
variety of problems. The primary goal is to use techniques from Morse theory,
homology theory, geometric group theory and combinatorics to study problems of
shape, configuration, motion planning, and structure in computer science.
Applications include computer graphics, visualization of scientific data,
computational analysis of molecular docking problems and robotics. A key element
is that this work will be done within an interdisciplinary team that includes
researchers in computer science, biochemistry and chemistry at Duke, UNC and
Stanford.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this project will be important to
advance our understanding in a number of important areas. Techniques developed
will give new approaches to analyzing noise in data sets such as those from
x-ray Crystallography, brain scans, satellite images, and ocean temperature. The
robotics work will enhance our ability to create automated devices that perform
tasks in dangerous or remote environments. And the biology work has as its long
term goal the development of better computational tools to help biomedical
researchers find appropriate molecules that can interact with
