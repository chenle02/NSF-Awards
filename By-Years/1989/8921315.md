This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separations science. Professor Sarah Rutan will study the
structure of stationary phases used in liquid chromatography. By using a
combination of optical spectroscopy of molecular probes in specific solvent
environments she will determine the so-called solvatochromic parameters of the
system. From this approach the fundamental structure and reactivity of the
molecular species at the liquid solid interface can be determined. A better
understanding of the mechanisms of molecular interactions which give rise to
separations of molecular species in flow will result. Molecular interactions
between probe molecules and liquid chromatographic stationary phases will be
determined. Optical (uv-visible and infrared spectroscopic band shifts will be
measured and analyzed to remove solution phase interferences. Dipolarity-
polarizability, hydrogen bond acidity and basicity will allow an understanding
of solvent based reactivity and adsorption effects underlying separations and
other liquid solid interfacial systems. The particular solvent systems will
include methanol, acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran - water mixtures commonly
used in high performance liquid chromatography. Hydrocarbon and phenyl modified
silica as well as unmodified silica will be studied. The probe molecules include
a series of nitroaniline dyes commonly used to probe solvent solute
interactions. Unique capabilities to perform multicomponent analysis and
eliminate the contributions of liquid phase effects will allow improvement over
the current level of understanding of the dynamics of adsorption at the
molecular level in solution.
