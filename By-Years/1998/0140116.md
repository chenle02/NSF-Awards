The Pittsburgh group studies spectroscopy of subatomic particles (size less than
1 femtometer) in a variety of ways. They come in two kinds, baryons (e.g.
proton) and mesons (e.g. pion). By measuring the masses, widths (effectively
lifetime)and decay brancing fractions to the possible final states for each
excited state, a large body of information is available as a test for models of
the strong interaction. Quantum chromodynamics is strongly felt to be the
appropriate theory, but has not been adequately tested in hadron spectroscopy.
Experiments must be done at large accelerators; we have been active at Jefferson
Lab where a large number of experiments have produced results in the last few
years. We were prominent workers in the details of tracking particles in CLAS
and had primary responsibility for one of the key results, eta
electroproduction. We have also been very active in constructing a theoretical
framework and doing complex fits to the data in order to determine the
parameters discussed above. Our results are expected to cause major
modifications to the Particle Data Group compendium of baryon properties. A new
program to study mesons in a particularly clean experimental environment at
Cornell Electron Storage Ring has been started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
