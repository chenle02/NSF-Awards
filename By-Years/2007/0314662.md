This award provides funding to operate the Core Project Office (CPO) of the
International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project, a component of the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). IGAC's goal is to promote
and facilitate international atmospheric chemistry research that will lead to a
better understanding of the Earth System. IGAC seeks to provide an international
framework for planning and implementing scientific activities in atmospheric
chemistry to address these issues, particularly when they demand human,
technological, or monetary resources beyond the capacity of single nations. IGAC
also seeks to serve as a vehicle for coordination of various U.S. national
programs with relevant national and regional programs in other countries in
order to focus attention and resources on key problems in atmospheric chemistry
at regional and global scales. Functions of the IGAC CPO include: (1) project
administration: a fundamental function of the CPO is to provide administrative
support for Project leadership in their task of overseeing execution of the
Project; and (2) communications: a key task of the CPO is to act as the
communications nerve center for the Project by ensuring an effective channel for
communicating information about the Project and its scientific results to the
broader scientific and other client communities. This project is supported
jointly by NSF, NASA, and NOAA.
