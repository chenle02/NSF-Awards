The Center for Cosmological Physics brings together astronomers
and&lt;br/&gt;physicists, experimentalists and theorists, to address the
most&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions in modern cosmology. It establishes
an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary environment essential to address the cross-
disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;problems, thereby fostering an ideal climate for
nurturing new talent&lt;br/&gt;(students and postdocs) and stimulating faculty
and other senior&lt;br/&gt;scientists to think in different directions.
Measurements of the remnants&lt;br/&gt;of the early universe will be performed
by Center scientists; this data&lt;br/&gt;will be interpreted by them and center
theorists to reconstruct the&lt;br/&gt;conditions and laws in effect at the
earliest moments of the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments in Cosmology
over the past decade have revealed phenomena&lt;br/&gt;which are simply not
understandable in our "Standard Models." Thus they&lt;br/&gt;constitute
important clues to the deepest secrets of nature. These&lt;br/&gt;include the
fact that most of the matter in the Universe is "dark" and&lt;br/&gt;appears to
only interact gravitationally; that most of the energy in the&lt;br/&gt;Universe
is of a mysterious form whose dynamics is totally unknown; that&lt;br/&gt;points
on the sky which have apparently never been in contact with each&lt;br/&gt;other
have the same temperature to very high precision; and that there&lt;br/&gt;are
particles striking the Earth with energies well beyond what we
can&lt;br/&gt;understand. The Center exploits the interrelations among these
phenomena&lt;br/&gt;and will address them with new experiments and new
insights.&lt;br/&gt;
