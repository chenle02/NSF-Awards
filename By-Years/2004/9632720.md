9632720 Lewis This award supports a Plant Biochemistry course which will be
given at Washington State University in the summers of 1997, 1999, and 2001.
Experts in the field from the University as well as investigators from other
institutions will lecture and give informal presentations during an intensive
two week program. This course, which has been successfully been given several
times in the past is an excellent chance for graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, and college teachers from all over the United States to update their
knowledge in a field which has not received sufficient attention recently and
hear about the latest advances from the leaders in the field. The use of
university facilities reduces costs and leads to an informal atmosphere. ***
