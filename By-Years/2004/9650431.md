This project involves the use of new laboratory experiments that verify basic
properties of quantum mechanical systems, including the interference of quantum
states and the existence of conjugate variables, for the sophomore-through
senior-year undergraduate physics curriculum. Students are employing ultrafast
measurement techniques, including time-dependent spectroscopy and laser pulse
auto-correlation. These techniques involve the use of an ultrashort-pulse laser
oscillator capable of producing pulses of 20x10-15 second duration at a
repetition rate of 108 Hz. This experimental equipment is based on solid state
optical components and is easily maintained.
