This project focuses on spectral properties of random matrices of a large size.
A random matrix is used to model a typical behavior in many problems arising in
high-dimensional convexity, functional analysis, as well as in physics and
computer science. In all these areas the size of a matrix, i.e. the available
number of degrees of freedom is very large, but fixed. This project aims to
investigate the spectral phenomena which arise with high probability, and obtain
explicit probability bounds. One of the central questions here is evaluation of
the probability that a large random matrix is non-singular, and obtaining
quantitative characteristics of non-singularity. To this end, the project brings
into play a wide array of tools, ranging from classical probability, to
asymptotic geometric analysis, and additive combinatorics.

The theory of random matrices is currently undergoing a period of rapid
development. In a large part this is due to the demand for explicit
probabilistic estimates arising in various problems of computer science and
engineering. This includes, among others, the wireless communication, where
random matrices are used to model interactions between antennas and obstacles on
the ground. The study of random matrices is also of importance for internet
privacy protection, since certain kinds of random matrices became tools of
choice in constructing hacking algorithms. The project will develop explicit
quantitative spectral bounds, which are required for the aforementioned
problems.
