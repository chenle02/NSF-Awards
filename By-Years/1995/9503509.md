9503509 Pang This award will provide partial support for the International
Conference on Complementarity Problems: Engineering and Economic Applications
and Computational Methods to be held at Johns Hopkins University from November
1-4, 1995. The goal of the conference is two-fold: (1) to have engineers and
economists explain to the complementarity community the applications and needs
in their fields and (2) to introduce to engineers and economists the latest
computational tools for solving complementarity problems. There are three major
themes of the conference: engineering applications, economic equilibria, and
computational methods. Major topics to be covered include the relationship of
complementarity to the following problems or areas: contact mechanics problems,
structural mechanics problems, nonlinear obstacle problems, elastohydrodynamic
problems, game-theoretic models, computational methods, and software
development. The conference will bring together leading researchers in this
field from the international community and participants will include both junior
researchers and senior experts.
