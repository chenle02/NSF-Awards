Equipment for X-ray diffraction experiments will be purchased which will
support the work of three research groups involved in solid state and materials
research. The projects involve ab initio structure solutions from powder data,
synthesis and characterization of new metal rich chalcogenides, rare earth metal
clusters, and the application of small angle and wide angle diffraction to
structure-property relationships in amorphous polymers.//
