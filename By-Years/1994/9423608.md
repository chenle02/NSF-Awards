9423608 HU, Qing This project will develop millimeter- and submillimeter-wave
SIS heterodyne receivers using a novel integrated horn antenna structure. The
essential part of this structure is a micromachined horn antenna made by
anisotropically etching the Si wafers on which the SIS devices are fabricated.
Recent work at University of Michigan (using a room-temperature Schottky
detector at W-band) has shown excellent antenna beam patterns and antenna
efficiencies for such structures. Because of the easy fabrication associated
with photolithography, this structure can be scaled to above 1 Thz. It will also
be feasible to construct focal-plane arrays using this integrated horn structure
.
