The analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) Program of the Division of Chemistry
supports the research project of Prof. Amy walker of the University of Texas at
Dallas. Prof. Walker and her students will develop methods for chemically
selective deposition of metals on organic thin films and apply these methods to
construct complex multilayer structures. The reliable production of stable
metallic contacts to organic thin films is critical in many technologies,
including polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs) and molecular and organic
electronics. Fundamental to this goal is a quantitative understanding of the
interactions of deposited metals with the terminal functional groups in organic
films. Prof. Walker and her students will define and explore these critical
interactions using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as model systems. The study
will focus on the deposition of aluminum, copper, nickel, platinum, palladium
and gold. These metals all have important applications as contacts in
molecular-, organic- and magneto- electronic devices. The study will provide
excellent training opportunities to students who wish to train in the cutting
edge research of molecular electronics.
