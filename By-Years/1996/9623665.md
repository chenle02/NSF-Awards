Recent progress in the speech recognition field suggests great promise for
practical spoken language interfaces within the next decade. But this technology
is not yet ready for many applications because of the lack of effective methods
for handling spontaneous speech. This project focuses on techniques that can
provide additional information to a natural-language parser beyond the output of
the speech recognition system. This extra information will be used in handling
the following problems that arise in spontaneous dialogue: the segmentation of
utterances into meaningful units, the identification and correction of speech
repairs, the detection and correction of speech recognition errors, and the
interpretation of the intended speech act from surface structure, lexical cues
and intonation. The approach involves using stochastic techniques to identify
likely recognition errors, speech repairs, utterance unit boundaries and
prosodic features and then passing this information on to a parser which
determines the best interpretation given all the information. The results of
this project will help the development of accurate speech recognition systems
for spontaneous dialogue. The techniques developed will be evaluated using a
series of empirical tests on a corpus of human-human dialogues, and by
integrating the techniques into a fully functional dialogue system.
