9302216 Barsoum One of the major factors restricting the widespread use of
ultra- refractory composites for high temperature structural applications has
been the difficulty, and associated cost, of producing complex- shaped
components from these materials. Furthermore, both the difficulty and the
expense increase dramatically as the refractoriness of the constituents
increases. An innovative processing technique termed as Transient Plastic Phase
Processing (TPPP) will be used for in-situ net-shape manufacturing complex-
shaped, fully dense, ultra-refractory composites at temperatures that are about
0.65 of their melting temperatures. The technique also has the potential of
yielding new and as yet unexplored compositions and microstructures that may
very well have superior mechanical, electrical and magnetic properties. The work
is a combined experimental-modeling-computational research program to study the
processing-microstructure/composition- properties relationships for this new
class of the mixture of soft and hard phases, the relationships between
microstructure and mechanical properties such as elastic moduli, flexural and
compressive strength, fracture toughness, creep resistance and high temperature
ductility will be established. ***
