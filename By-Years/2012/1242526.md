Millions of people around the world carry heavy loads, causing significant
stress to their bodies. This can lead to musculoskeletal injury, which is the
second most common reason for seeing a doctor in the United States. Based on
previous NSF-funded research on load carrying during locomotion, the team has
developed a proof-of-concept handle suspension technology for carrying loads
that significantly reduce the likelihood of injury.

With this I-Corps support, the team will investigate the commercial potential of
the proposed effort. Musculoskeletal injuries are common and cost over $850
billion/year in the United States alone. If successfully commercialized, it is
believed that the proposed innovation has the potential to address this
significant market opportunity.
