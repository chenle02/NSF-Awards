In this effort, the Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics
(CTIPe) model, originally developed for use on supercomputers, will be
implemented in the desktop computer environment for broader use at the Community
Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The PIs
will reassess and modify the current model to achieve improved accuracy. The
proposers plan a three-step approach to quantifying the energy sources and sinks
that affect the outputs of the CTIPe model. The first step will reproduce the
global steady-state thermosphere and ionosphere derived from the MSIS and IRI
models by self-consistently adjusting the energy sources and sinks in the CTIPe
model (e.g. UV and EUV heating, NO cooling, Joule heating, etc.). The intention
is to systematically adjust the appropriate energy sources and sinks in CTIPe in
order to reproduce the global structure of the empirically modeled thermosphere
and ionosphere. The second step will compare steady-state CTIPe model runs
against climatology data from the TIMED mission for further adjustment of the
energy sources and sinks. The third step will compare the model, with
appropriate sources and sinks, to TIMED and ground based data.
