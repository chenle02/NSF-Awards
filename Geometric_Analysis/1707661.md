Algebraic varieties are objects defined by polynomial equations. Their
classification is the far-reaching problem in this field, and this project aims
to answer a few central questions in this framework. After the ground-breaking
work of B. Riemann in dimension one, the theory of higher dimensional algebraic
and analytic varieties developed impressively fast under the impetus of
differential geometry and global analysis methods. The concept of positivity,
with its twofold incarnations - in algebraic terms (positivity of divisors and
algebraic cycles), or in analytic terms (plurisubharmonicity, positive
curvature) - played a key role in such development. These investigations will
pursue further this circle of ideas by treating problems arising from algebraic
geometry via analytic techniques. The main motivation is to show that the
methods developed in analysis can offer a very powerful complement to the purely
algebraic methods. A successful implementation of this project would lead to
important progress towards classification problems in both algebraic and
analytic geometry.

These projects are structured in three main parts. The first concerns
generalizations of the Ohsawa-Takegoshi theorem on analytic extensions, with
connections to questions arising in the minimal model program of algebraic
geometry. The second line of investigation concerns regularity properties of
degenerate Monge-Ampere equations and planned applications to certain relative
canonical bundles. Given an algebraic fiber space, one of the main objects of
study is its corresponding relative canonical bundle. In many instances, this
bundle carries some positivity, and the project is to use the Monge-Ampere
theory in order to quantify the amount of positivity this bundle has. The third
research direction is an analysis of the positivity properties of the canonical
bundle of rank one holomorphic foliations defined on the jet spaces
corresponding to a projective variety. This is in connection to the notion of
Kobayashi hyperbolicity, where such foliations appear naturally.
