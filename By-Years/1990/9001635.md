This research will apply asymptotic approximation techniques in the study of
the dynamics of molecular systems in the so- called Born-Oppenheimer limit. In
particular, the principal investigator will consider scattering problems, the
effects of electron energy level crossing, avoided crossings and the effects of
oscillating electromagnetic fields. This will be accomplished using analytical
and numerical methods. Most molecules consist of complicated systems of
electrons whose behavior determines the macroscopic (or bulk) properties of
materials. It is especially important to have mathematical models of these
electron systems, since understanding the behavior of the electrons enables us
to understand the conductivity of a material, for example. In this proposal the
principal investigator will use analytical and numerical methods to study how
electrons behave in crossing from one energy level to another.
