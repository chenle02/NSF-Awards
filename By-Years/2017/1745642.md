The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to introduce
a fully integrated current sensor with an order of magnitude performance
improvement over the state-of-art technologies. The developed technology will
enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power
electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as
renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer
electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an
essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic
and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with
specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to
investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These
approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-
response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of
such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and
more efficient through the use of wide band-gap semiconductors and high
switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement
information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability.
Applications include power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the current sensor
technology in different industry sectors such as automotive, telecommunications,
and data centers. Today, there is no current sensor that can be used in many
power electronics systems or integrated into semiconductor modules optimized to
operate with switching frequencies beyond 1MHz. This project will address the
need and requirements for such sensors by moving away from commonly-used Hall-
Effect sensors and utilizing magneto-resistors. With proprietary IC circuitry
and packaging, the project team is developing contactless, lossless sensors with
bandwidths up to 10 MHz, while overcoming the measurement challenges due to EMI,
asymmetrical current distributions and non-uniform magnetic field.
