This research will investigate a method for fabricating microchannel plates
which will preserve the gain and efficiency of existing techniques while
improving spatial resolution and response time at least tenfold. This new method
is based on accelerator bombardment and particle track etching. Passage of a
high energy particle through a sheet of base glass leaves a latent damage trail
of broken bonds. When submerged in an etching solution, material along the
damage trail etches preferentially to form conical pits which grow toward each
other. Pairs of etch pits from opposite surfaces merge to form cylinders which
may be shaped into microchannels controlled by etching conditions. Phase I will
determine whether the resulting surface in the channel has electrical,
structural, and bulk material properties suitable for particle detection and
signal amplification.
