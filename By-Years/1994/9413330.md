Abstract Florida Community College at Jacksonville - J. Tinsley Connection to
NSFNET Proposal No. NCR-9413330 Florida Community College at Jacksonville
requests support from NSF for connection of their campus networks to SURAnet.
SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern United States. It
will provide operations management and information services and it will give
Florida Community College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to
access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able
to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to
explore innovative educational resources.
