Professor Andrew A. Gewirth of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of
Chemistry to examine the structure and reactivity associated with two types of
electrode processes. The first involves the catalysis of nitrate reduction on
bare and bimetallic electrode surfaces. The second examines the structure of
solvents and other molecules on bare and monolayer-modified electrode surfaces.
Information on molecules adsorbed on electrode surfaces will be obtained with a
battery of spectroscopic, microscopic, and electrochemical techniques in
combination with theoretical calculations. Fundamental information resulting
from these studies will impact all areas of electrochemistry. Improved
understanding of the structure and reactivity of electrode surfaces impacts
technological processes as diverse and important as remediation, corrosion,
deposition, energy storage, and catalysis. The work serves as a vehicle for
interdisciplinary research training. Students from underrepresented groups will
be mentored, and hands-on science and chemical demonstrations will be performed
in local schools.
