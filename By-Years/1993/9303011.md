Normalization, matching, and unification are three computational steps found in
virtually all symbolic computation systems. Applications of these operations
include term rewriting, functional, equational and logic programming languages,
abstract data type specification and verification, automated deduction, code
generation, type inferencing, and computer algebra. This project addresses these
problems in computing and the means to design and analyze efficient algorithms
for them. Practical algorithms are designed on both sequential and parallel
machines. Algorithms which learn efficiently from their history are designed for
normalization with respect to several important and useful classes of rewrite
systems. Several facets of matching and unification problems are studied from a
novel perspective. Algorithms that correlate information from previous
match/unify operations are designed for tree pattern matching and its
interpreted versions, and subterm unification and its interpreted versions. The
practical performance of these algorithms is investigated. This research is
useful in enhancing the efficiency of symbolic systems as well as provide
understanding of the inherent complexities of these operations.
