This is the first year of a three year continuing award. The research explores a
theory of visual analysis of movement for use in computer vision. This theory
deals with use of motion information for object recognition and addresses
segmentation of motion trajectories into groups of individual objects, such that
all trajectories in a given group are consistent with a single set of 3D motion
parameters; detection of cyclic motion and its use in the trajectory matching;
study of relative motions for articulated objects, and its use in modeling and
detection of fundamental movements; discovery of the invariant relations between
2D and 3D motion and their use in recognition; recognition of motion using
temporal and spatial information, including the matching of motion trajectories
of unequal length, using time warping.
