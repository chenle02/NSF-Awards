This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware acquire a FT-Mass
spectrometer and a high-powered laser system which will be used in research. The
research activity to be supported includes (1) studies of gas phase
metalloporphyrin chemistry, (2) laser desorption/ionization and molecular beam
studies of polypeptides, (3) method development for analyzing high molecular
weight material, particularly biological molecules, and (4) studies of photo-
processes involving high molecular weight, polyfunctional or otherwise complex
material. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate
structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules. The addition of the technique
of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid molecular
weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in
combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques available in
mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools
available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry. A tunable laser can provide important
information about chemical reactivity. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our
understanding of the properties of reactive and nonreactive of molecules.
