Studies indicate that plastid inheritance in two thirds of the sexual hybrids
of angiosperms is maternal while in a majority of sexual hybrids of gymnosperms
it is paternal. This difference may be because in angiosperms pollen plastids
degenerate prior to pllen maturation and fertilization, during fertilization, or
in the zygote, while in gymnosperms the female plastids become excluded from the
neocytoplasm following fertilization. In tree species, factors such as long
generation cycle, lack of plastid mutants, and in most cases delayed
fertilization following pollination has limited investigations based on sexual
crosses. An alternative is to utilize somatic hybrids and reciprocal cybrids
produced via protoplast fusion. In the research planned, the control of plastome
transmission patterns(s) in an angiosperm tree will be investigated. More
specifically, reciprocal cybrids will be produced, plastome transmission
pattern(s) will be identified in elm fusion products, and the possible role of
cytoplasmic/nuclear genome interactions in such transmission will be
investigated. This is a promising approach to an importent problem in plant
biology.
