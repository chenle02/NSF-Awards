9614776 Nabelek This award will provide support to strengthen multi-national
collaboration for a project being planned to study active mountain building
along the Himalayan-Tibetan collision zone. The project entails extensive
fieldwork in Nepal, Tibet (China), and India; and will involve eight
collaborating institutions from Nepal, China, India, France, and the U.S., with
the Oregon State University and University of Illinois as lead-institutions. An
initial proposal of this project was submitted to the Continental Dynamics
program of the Earth Sciences Division at the NSF in June 1996. Scientific
aspects of the reviews were generally positive. However, it became apparent that
the international collaborative aspects need to be further bolstered. This award
will support a trip to each of the collaborating countries in order to clearly
define the responsibilities of each institution and to obtain official
documentation of cost-sharing from each country. The principal investigators
expect the trip to result in a well- orchestrated, multi-national collaboration,
ultimately increasing the effectiveness of the project while lowering the cost.
The Division of International Programs (India, Nepal and China) has provided
support for this project. ***
