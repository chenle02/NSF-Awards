The potential of ceramics and intermetallics for numerous applications has not
been realized due to the lack of sinterable powders which are cost effective and
of high purity. An innovative technique is proposed to produce SiC, NiA1,
Ti-22A1- 27Nb, and MoSi2 ultrafine, spherical, and stoichiometric particles.
This method involves vaporization, reaction, and extremely rapid quenching of
the materials to form submicron particles with a wide range of compositions
possible. The sinterability of these powders will be evaluated through
pressureless sintering. An economical projection of the cost for the scaling up
for commercialization of each system will be completed. The synthesis of high
purity, spherical, ultrafine ceramic and intermetallic particles will enable
production of sinterable high performance materials, which have applications in
heat engines, a variety of energy conversion systems, aerospace applications,
and military and defense systems.
