This project studies the effect of the simultaneous introduction of an
orthography for Somali and the establishment of Somali as the official national
language of Somalia in 1972. The order was followed immediately by two years of
mass literacy campaigns followed by establishment of newspapers and magazines,
then pamphlets and government documents, followed by textbooks, historical
works, and works of literature in Somali. The project studies how spoken Somali
has changed during this period of rapid and broad-scale popular movement into
literacy and how written Somali differs from spoken Somali. Large amounts of
Somali text will be computationally processed to pinpoint and quantify
differences and changes during this highly dynamic period. Few studies to date
have analyzed speech and writing in a non- western language. Moreover, although
quite a few languages have recently been the recipients of standardized
orthographies, most of them remain marginal within their countries, whereas
Somali has been the national language of its country for the last sixteen years.
In view of recent works on the relationship of literacy and cognitive style,
this project provides empirical data for testing such hypotheses.
