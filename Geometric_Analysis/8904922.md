This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of Professor David
Gieseker of the University of California at Los Angeles. Dr. Gieseker's
investigations will be in the isospectral theory of difference operators,
considering the Picard group of the Bloch manifold of a two-dimensional periodic
difference operator. He will also explore generalizations of the Bloch manifold
construction to other contexts such as the triangular- ization of a surface of
arbitrary genus. This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of the
oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis
and Topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in theoretical Computer Science, Robotics, and Physics.
