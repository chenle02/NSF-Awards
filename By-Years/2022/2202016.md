Mountwest Community and Technical College (MCTC) will partner with the Robert C.
Byrd Institute (RCBI) at Marshall University to implement a project aimed at
revitalizing an ailing regional economy that was previously dependent on the
coal industry. MCTC and RCBI propose to expand the existing welding technician
program by designing and implementing a curriculum that includes a skillset in
aerospace welding. The project activities will include a comprehensive effort to
create flexible learning options within manufacturing programs, strengthen
student support, and address underrepresentation of female and underserved
students. Program improvements will not only strengthen aviation maintenance
education but also position the program to better meet workforce needs of
employers across the tri-state manufacturing sector of Kentucky, Ohio, and West
Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will pursue the following objectives:
1) enhance MCTC/RCBI’s Welding Technology program to include stackable
credentials, including a skillset in aerospace welding, 2) design of a new
modular curriculum and the addition of up-to-date equipment to meet
instructional needs and prepare students to contribute to the region’s growing
aerospace industry, 3) provide enhanced support services and career-learning
experiences in order to help students, especially women and those who are
underserved, attain their college goals and meet the needs of the region's
manufacturing employers, and 4) work with the K-12, universities, and employers
to create robust career pathways that have documented entry/exit points and are
supported by articulation agreements and aligned skill sets. This project is
funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the
education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the
Nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
