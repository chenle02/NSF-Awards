This program will develop new analysis methods for current and upcoming
cosmological hydrogen 21cm intensity mapping data from the Tianlai experiment,
located in a radio quiet area of Western China. Such mapping provides important
clues to the evolution of gas and galaxies in the early universe. Broader
impacts include training of undergraduate students and postdocs, and development
of inexpensive radio telescopes at Fermilab and UW-Madison using new software-
defined-radio techniques for use by high-school and college students, through
the NSF/DOE QuarkNet program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiment will measure
the three dimensional large scale structure of the universe via hydrogen
emission from distant galaxies. The primary goal is to develop ways to handle
the large foreground signal, which has been previously quantified in a path-
finder 21cm program conducted on NSF's Green Bank Telescope.
