Duke University will purchase and ultra-highfield nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer for advanced biochemical and chemical research. Highfield NMR has
become an indispensable tool for studies of macromolecules with experience
showing that the most productive approaches involve a combination of
advanced/methodologies and the highest magnetic fields available. Basic
scientists in six department will use one-and-two- dimensional NMR methods to
study the solution structure and functional activity of biologically-important
molecules in the following areas: 1. Repressor proteins and DNA regulation 2.
Protein folding 3. Metalloenzyme structure and function 4. Macromolecular
binding sites of molybdenum cofactors 5. Characterization and structure of
complex sugars and membrane lipids 6. Biodynamics of photosynthetic metabolism
7. Structure/energy relations of aggregated systems 8. Interactions of human
immunodeficiency virus glycoproteins 9. DNA processing enzymes 10. Initiation of
DNA replication 11. Characterization of opiates and other drugs The proposed
ultra-highfield spectrometer represents a significant new addition to the Duke
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Center, a shared instrument facility serving the
region.
