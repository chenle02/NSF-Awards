This award supports theoretical research and education on inhomogeneous
materials that contain layered nanometer scale superconducting and magnetic
regions. The PI will involve undergraduate and graduate students at a Hispanic-
Serving Institution in a research project to explore the interplay between
magnetism and superconductivity in these inhomogeneous materials and discover
new phenomena. The magnetic regions contain domain walls in which the direction
of the magnetization changes along particular directions. Superconductivity is a
collective quantum mechanical state of electrons with remarkable properties,
often noted is the ability to conduct electricity without dissipation.
Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are generally incompatible and do not
coexist in the same uniform material. In these inhomogeneous materials, novel
spatially varying superconducting states may arise intertwined with magnetism.
The PI will study the resulting spatially varying superconducting and magnetic
states and how they may be tuned by applying an external magnetic field. The
presence of superconducting regions that are weakly interacting with each other
may lead to interesting dynamical effects that may be useful for future
superconducting device technologies.

The project may lead to new understanding of the role played by inhomogeneities
for the stability of spatially varying phases at the nanoscale, to the discovery
of new phenomena for future electronic and spintronics nanodevices with new
functionalities, to broader participation of underrepresented minorities in the
physical sciences, and to new experimental activity in the department that
provides newresearch opportunities for students.

This project will be carried out in a Hispanic-Serving Institution with a
predominantly female student population and one that has a high population of
underrepresented minorities in Physics. Integrating students in the proposed
research project will therefore promote science among groups that are typically
underrepresented in the sciences. This project will also contribute to
developing a computational physics Master of Science degree program.
