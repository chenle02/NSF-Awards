A summer research program in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Oklahoma
will provide undergraduates with an opportunity to materially participate in
scientific research. Ten external students will be funded by the REU site grant
and at least five internal students will be funded by a variety of sources
within the University. A biweekly seminar series with strong emphasis on student
participation and interaction with faculty and graduate students will enable the
participants to gain the most benefit from their research experience. A
distinguishing feature of the program will be the exposure of all student
participants to both theoretical and experimental research in four distinct but
well focused areas: astrophysics, atomic and molecular; condensed matter, and
particle physics. External students will be recruited nationally and regionally
with emphasis on underrepresented groups and participants who otherwise lack
opportunities for research experience. The goal of the program is to encourage
and prepare students to seek further educational and career opportunities in
physics and astronomy.
