This Superconducting Quantum Interference Device Magnetometer enables state-of-
the-art measurements of the magnetic properties of materials, under study in the
Department of Physics, Department of Chemistry, and Division of Engineering at
Brown University. The flux detection system and superconducting magnet are
capable of measuring magnetization or susceptibility in a wide range of
temperatures (1.8-400 Kelvins) and magnetic fields ranging from -5.5 to +5.5
Tesla, with high sensitivity, resolution, accuracy and stability. This
instrument is particularly well suited to low magnetic fields and small samples.
Its large dynamic range also accommodates strongly ferromagnetic samples in high
magnetic fields.
