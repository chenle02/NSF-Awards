The research entails applying a number of existing methods of numerical
analysis to develop strategies appropriate for the solution of ill-posed
problems in the general area of partial differential equations. An outcome of
this investigation will be the derivation of stability inequalities from which
significant error estimates may be obtained. Methods of approximation and of
finite elements will be exploited and adapted to the classes of ill-posed
problems in question.
