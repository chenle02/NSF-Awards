This award is to study a paired sand-silt eolian system on the Columbia Plateau,
in order to better understand the sensitivity of mineral-dust aerosol emissions
to changes in vegetation, soil moisture and topography. This information will be
used to improve global dust model routines in general circulation models
(GCM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field work will be undertaken to characterize the
history and variability of mineral-aerosol sources and chronology of dune and
loess formation for the Columbia Plateau since the last glacial maximum (LGM).
Information will be obtained on vegetation area and type, soil texture, soil
moisture and topographic features that resulted in the observed downwind
accumulations. Modeling will be used to improve the sensitivity of a global
transport model used in general circulation models (GCM) of the Earth climate
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atmospheric mineral aerosols are increasingly
recognized as playing an important role in radiative and biogeochemical forcing
of climate. The broader impacts of this proposed research center on documenting
the evolution of an important eolian sequence within a well-constrained
chronologic framework to better understand the processes responsible for and
factors that effect mineral-aerosol emissions. &lt;br/&gt;
