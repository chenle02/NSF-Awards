Triton College is developing a computer-integrated engineering classroom. The
computers will be used primarily for the teaching of three mechanics courses:
Statics, Dynamics, and Strength of Materials. The software used will include
software written and tested at the College as well as commercially available
software including symbolic manipulasators and special purpose structural
analysis programs. The classroom will initially be equipped with 12 computers,
with two students per computer.The computers will be used during class time to
allow the faculty to improve visualization skills as well as to allow students
to solve problems which require the variation of several parameters. Students
will be assigned traditional homework problems as well as projects which will
entail the use of computers. Evaluation of the project will be performed via a
test data bank, which was developed with a previous NSF grant.
