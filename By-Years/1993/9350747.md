The physics program presently supports an introductory laboratory environment
which encourages students to design their own experimental approaches to
problems and communicate those approaches in an informal manner. Laboratory
activities are heavily oriented toward exploratory planning activities with an
emphasis on graphical presentation and analysis of data. The student directed
experimental design coupled with graphical analysis requires that large amounts
of data must be rapidly acquired, and analyzed. To support this need 10
networked micro-computer based data acquisition and analysis systems, together
with a variety of sensors, are being introduced in the laboratory. Each micro-
computer provides an icon oriented interface (Lab-View) consisting of virtual
instruments and virtual probes that may be schematically linked to reflect
individual student approaches toward an experimental problem. High level
commands allow the students to acquire, display, and analyze data ways which
they find most meaningful. The computing environment is sufficiently powerful to
include new probes as demand warrants, and thus provides added incentive for
more advanced students to attempt alternative experimental strategies. The
flexibility in the icon oriented interface also allows the laboratory to
gracefully adapt to new experiments and to individual learning styles, thereby
enhancing student development of science skills and concept understanding.
