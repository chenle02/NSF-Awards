Plant cells differentiate in a position dependent and not a lineage dependent
manner. They must, therefore, receive signals that inform them of their position
within the multicellular organism and differentiate accordingly. The nature of
the signals, their origin, and how they are transmitted is largely unknown. This
research project will address these questions by examining how cells in the
three layers of the shoot apical meristem maintain functional coordination over
the course of meristem ontogeny. To achieve this objective Dr. Sussex proposes
to generate graft chimeras between wild type tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum and
tomato carrying mutations that affect specific stages of vegetative or
reproductive meristem function. The graft partners will also differ in cell
layer autonomous markers by which each of the three meristem layers in the
chimeras can be identified. The specific aims are: 1) To determine for each of
the chimeras whether function and organization of the meristem at a specific
stage of its ontogeny is cell layer autonomous or depends on interactions
between the cell layers, 2) Where such interactions are fund to occur to
determine whether the signal originates in one specific layer and if so whether
the position of the layer in the meristem is important. %%% The results of this
investigation will provide specific instances in which interactions between cell
layers of the growing tip of a plant are required for normal development and how
those interactions contribute to development of the plant.
