9733156 Schmidt The overall goal of this career program is to build a nationally
competitive program at the University of Texas- Austin that integrates research
and education in the field of molecular and cellular tissue engineering, with a
particular focus on the nervous system. The research part of this program seeks
to link quantitative molecular information on the migration of the neuronal
growth cone, which guides axonal extension, to phenomenological observations of
nerve regeneration. An electrically conducting polymer, oxidized polypyrrole
(PP), will be used as a model system with which to stimulate axonal extension.
This material also has clear potential applications as a component of devices to
locally stimulate nerve regeneration. To gain a fundamental understanding of how
nerve regeneration is affected by an electrical stimulus, it is to be determined
whether electrical conduction through PP directly modifies various intracellular
events which are critical for growth cone motility. These experiments are to be
related to in vivo studies assessing rat sciatic nerve regeneration under
similar conditions. The education part of this program includes: course
development; curriculum revision; mentorship; and outreach programs. ***
