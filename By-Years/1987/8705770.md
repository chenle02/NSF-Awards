This grant concerns eclipsing binary stars. Caton will improve on methods to
extract from eclipse data a more nearly exact time of light minimum and an
estimate in the errors of that time. The procedure will be developed using the
computer program of Wilson and Devinney for binaries with eccentric orbits and
spotted stars. An observing program will be continued. Most stars occur in
binary pairs. A few binaries move about each other so that one star eclipses the
other. The timing of eclipses yields orbital periods, which inform us about the
stars, and sometimes changes in orbital periods with time, which inform us about
gases leaving the system or transferring from one star to the other. This grant
is to seek more accurate methods to detect the slow changes in orbital periods.
The grant is made under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Program
and is the first astronomy research grant both to this investigator and to his
institution.
