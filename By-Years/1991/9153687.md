The Resource Center for Science and Engineering of the University of Puerto
Rico has formed a consortium with the major universities and systemic research
projects on the island including the CRCM, EPSCOR, and MRCE, and through the
Mendez foundation Project Causa. The Alliance will focus on the following foci:
1. expansion and strengthening of college transition programs, 2. major
curriculum assessment and development, and 3. the expansion of graduate
programs. The major thrust of the PR-AMP will be to transform, in a fundamental
way, science and engineering education through the undergraduate curriculum.
Specific quantitative and qualitative indicators of the project's impact will be
put in place in order to disseminate the Project's results.
