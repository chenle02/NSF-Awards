This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed
research is to explore cyber-infrastructure that will enable and promote large
scale collaboration in building, maintaining, and using (towards discovery)
scientific knowledge bases that are grounded in published literature. Although
the focus will be on the Biology domain and articles and abstracts available
through PubMed, project will develop infrastructure that can be adapted to other
scientific domains such as archaeology, material science and
ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project will develop a web-based platform where
automated named entity recognition, automated named entity identification, and
automated relation&lt;br/&gt;extraction are used only as boot-strap steps and
voluntary collaboration is used for making corrections, adding missing facts to
the database and in maintaining the database.
