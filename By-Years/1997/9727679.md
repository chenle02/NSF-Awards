This is a study of the Heaven's Gate religious group. The research is supported
under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) rubric, having severe
urgency with regard to availability of data. Heaven's Gate illustrates an
extreme level of member commitment, and one research theme will be the social
processes that built up this high degree of social control and organization over
time. Related themes are conversion, defection, and charismatic leadership. The
primary data collection method will be in-depth interviews with members who left
the group in the last ten years. Other sources of data will include archives,
recordings of group activities, and interviews with relatives of members. This
research will help develop an emerging research area: the sociology of high-
tension religious movements that exist outside the standard cultural traditions.
At the same time, it will provide a fundamental basis of knowledge concerning
deviant religious groups that will help government officials and policy makers
deal with the many challenges that these group increasingly present in modern
society.
