With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Michael A. Walters of the Department of Chemistry at Dartmouth College.
Professor Walters will focus his work on the development of methodology for the
formation of carbon-carbon bonds. The research will lead to new ways for
preparing chiral synthetic compounds. The focus of this research is the
preparation of N-substituted oxyallyl cations from alpha-halo amino ketones for
use as intermediates in (4 + 3) cycloaddition reactions. The use of chiral
auxiliaries will enable the synthesis of optically active compounds.
