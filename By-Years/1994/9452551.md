laboratory enables professors to sponsor meaningful research at the freshman
level. Fourteen weeks of this two-semester course now includes elements of
molecular techniques. Seven weeks are devoted to basic techniques. Four weeks
are devoted to creating a restriction map of a plasmid. Three weeks are spent
using a thermal cycler to map the dispersal of "genetically modified organisms."
