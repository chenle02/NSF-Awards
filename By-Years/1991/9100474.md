This is a dissertation improvement grant. The research studies influences which
originate in prayer groups, and extend to social relationships outside the
group. Considerable theory in sociol- ogy identifies consensual values as
fundamental to society. Through observations and interviews, PIs will
investigate the extent to which relationships established in Charismatic
Catholic ritual are replicated in participants' social relationships outside the
church. Investigators expect to find changes in external social relationship
following conversion to the reli- gion, and they will explore development of
these relationships over respondents' lives. Results permit test of several
hypothe- ses relating religious forms to social forms, and the signif- icance of
moral values in building social cohesion.
