(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to improve an existing
seasonal ensemble forecasting system that they developed and use the system to
predict sea ice conditions in the arctic and subarctic seas with lead times
ranging from two weeks to three seasons. Their primary objectives
are:&lt;br/&gt;(1) To develop seasonal ensemble forecasting capabilities by
improving model physics and expanding data assimilation
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;(2) To conduct and distribute twice monthly near real-
time hindcasts and seasonal ensemble forecasts of sea ice thickness,
concentration, and extent in the arctic and subarctic seas.&lt;br/&gt;(3) To
determine the predictive skill of the system through careful forecast evaluation
and uncertainty analysis and identify areas for further
improvement.&lt;br/&gt;(4) To maximize the exposure and utility of the seasonal
forecasts through extensive outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these
goals they will develop seasonal ensemble forecasts based on an enhanced
synthesis of an ice?ocean model, forcing data, assimilation data, and validation
data. Improvement of model physics will target sea ice processes that are
particularly sensitive in a warming Arctic with a thinning ice cover. Near real-
time hindcasts with the assimilation of ice concentration and SST data will be
developed to provide an improved approximation of the current ice and ocean
conditions and to create the best possible initial conditions for the forecasts.
Wind, temperature, and cloud data from six to eight recent years will provide
the forcing data to extend the initial conditions into the future in six to
eight realizations (ensemble members). Extensive uncertainty analyses and
predictability assessments will shed light on how to further improve the
forecasting system, which will be a significant advance in seasonal forecasts of
sea ice for all regions of the Arctic and a useful tool to address important
science questions about the impact of preconditioning, atmospheric forcing,
Pacific water inflow, and summer heat storage in the upper ocean on the seasonal
variability and predictability of arctic sea ice.&lt;br/&gt;
