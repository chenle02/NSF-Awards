This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to lay the
foundation for scaleup and commercial application of a powerful new thin film
Jet Vapor Deposition (JVD) source, the `electron jet, or e-jet`, recently
invented at Jet Process Corporation (JPC). JVD is gaining increased recognition
for its use of `sonic jets in low vacuum` to deposit high quality films of
metals, semiconductors, oxides, nitrides, and organics at high rate. The e-jet
has the potential to combine very high rates of deposition with very precise in-
situ control of the properties of the growing film. This is done by high flux
ion bombardment with low energy ions, a capability made possible by the
unusually high ion density of the e-jet's plasma. JPC is collaborating with
several large companies on applications where the e-jet offers the only
promising, commercially viable solution. In order to realize the e-jet's promise
of ultra-high throughput and fine property control they propose to investigate
and optimize e-jet performance factors critical to film quality: cluster
formation and growth, plasma ion density, and ion impact energy on biased
substrates. In Phase I JPC will use mass spectrometry, Langmuir probe methods,
and retarding potential techniques to address those issues. Success in Phase I
will result in a JVD source capable of extremely high throughputs, control of
film quality, pollution free operation, and application to many materials; in
Phase II a tenfold faster e-jet will be constructed for commercial applications.
Enhancement of e-jet performance will lead to immediate economic benefits for
JPC and its contractors in a wide range of applications.
