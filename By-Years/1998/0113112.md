C. Michael Elliott of Colorado State University is supported by the Division of
Chemistry under the Information Technology Research (ITR) program to study
molecular systems that have potential application in developing fundamentally
new ways of reading stored magnetic information. New molecules and molecular
ensembles that exhibit significant chemical responses to magnetic fields in the
form of changed decay kinetics of the transient, photogenerated charge-separated
state will be explored to optimize the systems for magnetic field responses.
Project goals are: (1) to develop an understanding of how structural features of
these new systems are related to the magnetic field dependences of their
electron-transfer kinetics, specifically the kinetics of photoinduced charge-
separated state formation and recombination, (2) to learn if molecular designs
not necessarily closely related in structure to previously discovered assemblies
will give similar field dependence kinetic responses, and (3) to investigate
whether reverse micelles can serve as satisfactory hosts for these systems.
Characterization and analysis of the dyes and materials under study will be
carried out using pulsed laser spectroscopy, magnetic field effect experiments,
and other standard analytical and materials analysis methods.

This research project has clear technological underpinnings, motivated by the
potential for the research outcomes to enable development of optically based,
magnetic field sensors. Significant practical and economic benefits will result
if this work leads to fundamentally new ways of detecting magnetic fields that
could be used to read magnetic data.
