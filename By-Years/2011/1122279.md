During the funding period a systematic reduction of the equations of motion for
the cochlear amplifier will be carried out. The objective is to derive an
effective surface approximation for the partition, after which multiple-scales
will be used to derive an asymptotic approximation of the nonlinear waves
propagating in the cochlea. The objective is to be able to achieve quantitative
agreement with the known properties of these waves, including the apical shift
in the tuning curve at low intensity levels, the decrease of the relative
contribution of the amplifier with increasing stimulus level, the odd-order
distortion tones, the observation that the temporal position of the zero-
crossings on the basilar membrane remain largely unaffected by stimulus
intensity, and the dearth of harmonic distortion in the basilar membrane
response to pure tones at low to moderate sound pressure levels in the basal
portion of the cochlea.

The fundamental open question in understanding how we hear concerns the role of
a nonlinear feedback mechanism known as the cochlear amplifier. One of the
reasons why progress in delineating the exact mechanism responsible for
amplification is so slow is that it requires the solution of a three-
dimensional, coupled, nonlinear, time-dependent system. The PI proposes to
develop approximation methods that can be used to help study this problem, both
the mechanistic basis for amplification as well as its effects on wave
propagation in the cochlea. The results from this study will provide a rigorous
framework to help answer the amplifier question.
