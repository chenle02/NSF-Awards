0105431&lt;br/&gt;Schlottmann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant to support
theoretical research on strongly correlated electron systems is coordinated with
a similar grant at DOE. The topics to be studied include heavy fermions, related
mixed valent phenomena, properties of manganites, and integrable one-dimensional
models of correlated electrons and magnetism.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This grant
