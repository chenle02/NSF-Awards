The objective of this project is to investigate the influence of chirality on
phase transitions in liquid crystals through the use of optical activity and
light scattering measurements. Previous work has demonstrated that high
chirality has a significant effect on the isotropic to liquid crystal phase
transition, both increasing the complexity of the pretransitional effects and
weakening the transition itself. The project seeks to extend this work by (1)
performing similar optical activity experiments in a different liquid crystal
system, including measurements at lower chirality in both the isotropic and blue
phases, (2) utilizing light scattering as a new probe into the complex
fluctuation phenomena which take place near transitons involving chiral phases,
and (3) investigating three liquid crystal to liquid crystal transtions in
chiral systems (smectic A - smectic C*, chiral nematic - smectic A, and chiral
nematic - smectic C*). The same techniques used to study the isotropic to liquid
crystal transition should reveal new information about the effect of chirality
on these phase transitions.
