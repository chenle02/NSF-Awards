Dr. John Ellis, Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division to study highly reduced organometallics of the early d- and
f-block elements. The two primary themes are the use of arene radical anions as
precursors to classes of homo- and heteroleptic arene complexes and the search
for new carbon monoxide and related acceptor ligand complex chemistry of these
elements. Homoleptic arene complexes containing polycyclic arenes such as
naphthalene, anthracene and substituted versions thereof will be investigated.
Such species are expected to be quite labile and may function as neutral or
anionic `naked` atom reagents for the early transition metals. Access to unknown
or rare homoleptic anionic complexes will be pursued through reactions of these
and related arenemetallates with ligands other than carbon monoxide, such as
phosphanes, phosphites, isocyanides, dienes, and alkynes. Highly reduced
organometallics are important to an understanding of the chemical and structural
properties of unusually electron-rich compounds of very electropositive
elements, and provide a means of studying the chemistry of these elements in
previously inaccessible or unknown oxidation states. Some metals, especially
zirconium and tantalum, form highly reactive and useful reagents in the presence
of organic ligands such as naphthalene (a common ingredient in moth balls) and
when they are in a highly reduced state. `Highly reduced` simply means that more
electrons have been added to these metal complexes than they would normally
have, often giving them an overall negative charge. This work addresses the
synthesis of such highly reduced complexes and the issues which control their
reactivity once they are formed. These complexes may prove to be useful reagents
in inorganic, organometallic and organic synthesis.
