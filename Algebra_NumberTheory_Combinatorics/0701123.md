Abstract: Modularity and p-adic Langlands

One of the most fundamental objects of arithmetic is the absolute Galois group
of a number field. A rich source of representations for such groups is the
p-adic cohomology of algebraic varieties. The Fontaine-Mazur conjecture predicts
precisely which p-adic Galois representations ought to arise in this way. What
is remarkable about the conjecture is that the most subtle condition in its
formulation involves only the restriction of the Galois representation to the
decomposition groups of primes above p. In certain situations Fontaine-Mazur
combine their philosophy with that of Langlands, and predict which Galois
representations come from modular eigenforms. Recently work on this conjecture
has been given new impetus by a connection with Breuil's p-adic Langlands
program, especially for representations which arise from higher weight modular
forms. The project's aim is to pursue this connection by exploring new cases of
this correspondence as well as their connections to geometry and applications to
modularity.

A little over ten years ago Wiles proved Fermat's Last Theorem. He did this by
relating elliptic curves to modular forms. The latter are complex functions
which admit an incredibly large number of symmetries. Wiles' breakthrough
involved the use of the p-adic Galois representation attached to an elliptic
curve. His result can be viewed as a special case of a more general philosophy
due to Fontaine and Mazur, which predicts that a certain class of p-adic Galois
representations always arise from modular forms. Recently Breuil has proposed a
p-adic analogue of the Langlands correspondence. This is a completely new
ingredient which seems to have very strong applications to questions about
modularity. The project aims to develop Breuil's correspondence and explore its
relation to geometry and modularity of Galois representations.
