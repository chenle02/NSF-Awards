This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Chemistry Program. Dr.
Matteson is developing new synthetic tools based upon the boron atom. This
technique provides an extremely powerful way of controlling the relative
stereochemistry of parts of a complex molecule. It will be very useful in
preparing extremely pure pheromones needed in controlling insects. Directed
asymmetric synthesis based on boronic ester chemistry has been found to be
applicable to a wide variety of problems in natural product synthesis, and the
proposed project will extend our basic knowledge of boronic ester chemistry and
extend its applicability to new types of synthetic problems. To demonstrate and
refine the features of the method that are already known, synthesisof several
chiral insect pheromones will be undertaken. These provide significant but
realistic synthetic challenges which will demonstrate some of the advantages of
the approach, which is now theoretically capable of providing >1000:1 chiral
isomer ratios of crude products The unequivocal stereochemistry and ability to
produce all stereoisomers in highly pure form provided by this method should be
useful for proving configurations of as yet unknown pheromones. New boronic
ester chemistry will be investigated which has as its goal the connection of
boronic esters produced via this chemistry with molecular fragments which may be
obtained by other means, so that this chemistry can be applied more readily to
the synthesis of highly complex natural products.
