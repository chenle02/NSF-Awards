It is proposed to study the nonlinear dynamics of bubbles containing gas and a
small amount of vapor. This study is an extension of the PI's past research on
the modelling of single bubble dynamics and bubbly liquids. The purpose of the
present research is to extend the model and apply them tc specific technological
problems. The proposed work has a significant impact on many industrial
applications such as bubble columns used for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions,
vapor production systems, heat exchangers, and boiling water nuclear reactors.
