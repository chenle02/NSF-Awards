Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS 0454437&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kara L.
Nance&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Alaska Fairbanks&lt;br/&gt;Program:
NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: ASSERT:
Advanced System Security Education Research and Training
Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning award will enable the PI's team to
plan for a regular proposal to support research in information assurance. The
planning funds will enable the PI's to visit other lower 48 labs such as Purdue,
West Point, and University of Southern California to enable them to plan a
facility that complements existing capabilities in information assurance
research. The PI's will work with other disciplines at the university, state
government, the private sector and other stakeholders to plan a research
activity that serves the unique needs of Alaska. The project builds on a prior
NSF Collaborative Capacity Building Grant that enabled the institution to obtain
certification as an NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance
Education. The planned full proposal will build on the education activities and
resources developed under that award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
