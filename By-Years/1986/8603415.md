This research is aimed at testing a novel concept of transferring heat between a
hot zone and a cold zone. The high rates of heat transfer occur due to
oscillation of a fluid which connects the two zones. As of now, the concept is
more or less theoretical. The focus of the research is to test the concept by
means of definitive experiments.
