Description: This project supports Dr. C.N.R. Rao, Professor, Solid State and
Structural Chemistry Unit of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, for
collaborative research with Dr. John Honig, Materials Research Center, Purdue
University. The research will cover development of novel oxide materials with
special focus on high-temperature superconductors. The research to be carried
out by Dr. Rao deals with the synthesis of interesting oxide systems and
examination of structure-property relations. It also deals with the discovery of
new classes of oxide with unusual electronic and magnetic properties, including
the very important property of superconductivity at relatively high
temperatures. This project is a continuation of research that Dr. Rao has
carried out under an earlier NSF grant INT-8309897. Scope: The collaboration of
Professor Rao's team at Bangalore and Professor Honig's team at Purdue has been
successful and resulted in a significant number of publications. Rao is one of
India's most distinguished scientists. He has done pioneering research in
numerous areas of materials and structural chemistry. It is likely that this
project will result in significant advances in the field of new materials and
better material characterization. Dr. Honig is a participant in a newly
established Indiana Center for Innovative Superconductivity Technology, which
has provided $500,000 for the first year of operation by the State of Indiana.
His work with Dr. Rao would fit well with the objectives of that center, and
with enhancing materials science research in the U.S.
