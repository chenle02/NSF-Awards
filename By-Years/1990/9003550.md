This award will support research in the geometry of Banach spaces. In finite
dimensions, all vector spaces are essentially the same. But in the infinite
dimensional situation of interest here, this is far from the case. Banach spaces
are infinite dimensional spaces with the additional structure introduced by
varying notions of distance between points in the space. Such spaces have wide
application in mathematics, both pure and applied. The particular problems which
Professors Johnson and Pisier will address include the Lipschitz theory of
finite metric spaces, operator theory and the factorization of operators, weak
Hilbert spaces, probability theory, factorization of operator valued analytic
functions, and completely bounded maps.
