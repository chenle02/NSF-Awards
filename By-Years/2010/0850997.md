This research will contrast and test two competing views about human genetic
diversity and evolution. One view sees our genetic diversity as the outcome of
founder effects that occurred as the human species expanded from Africa and
filled the rest of the globe. The other view sees our genetic diversity as the
outcome of genetic drift in a vast network of stable populations connected by
local gene flow. To resolve these opposing views, this project will collect new
DNA sequence data, and it will conduct analyses in a novel quantitative
framework that is built from stochastic population genetic models. The
intellectual merit of this project is that it uses a specific research design to
resolve long-standing questions about human evolution and diversity. It uses the
alternative scenarios for human evolution to make precise numerical predictions
about patterns of DNA sequence differences. To test these predictions, the
project will collect new data that are directly relevant to the questions at
hand. The project's broader impact on the scientific community has several
dimensions. It will produce a new body of DNA sequence data, and it will make
these data publicly available in GenBank. It will develop new statistical tools
that the principal investigator will distribute to other researchers free of
charge. The project has a training component that will fuse the talents of
graduate students with those of undergraduates. Students at both levels will
help conduct the research and participate in analyses and reports. The principal
investigator will use the results of this research to write an article for lay
audiences on the topic of diversity and race in light of modern genomics. This
article will explain to the lay public how human evolution provides a new
nonracial framework to understand human differences and likeness.
