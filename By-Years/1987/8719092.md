The Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of California,
Riverside, has held a symposium the past ten years on timely topics in plant
physiology. This year (January 14-16, 1988), it will be entitled, "Physiology
and Biochemistry of Plant Microbial Interactions," organized by Professors Noel
T. Keen, Linda L. Walling, and Tsune Kosuge (UC Davis). The objective is to
bring together scientists working in this area plus interested individuals, with
the hope that discussion and presentations on this topic will lead to increased
understandings of plant microbe interactions. In addition, speakers, especially
young investigators, from abroad and other institutions in the United States
will be invited. The symposium's papers will be published rapidly and
inexpensively, as previously done.***//
