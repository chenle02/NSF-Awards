With NSF support, Drs. Michael Gazzaniga and William Uttal will lecture at the
Fifth Annual the fMRI Experience, an educational conference at which
neuroimaging experts present their current data and ideas alongside student
speakers. Professors Michael Gazzaniga (Dartmouth College, USA) and William
Uttal (Arizona State University, USA) will give the two keynote lectures. Dr.
Gazzaniga will discuss the National MRI Database and meta-analysis. Dr. Uttal
will discuss his provocative critique of neuroimaging. Their topics represent
different aspects of contemporary thinking about the role of functional
neuroimaging in the cognitive sciences. The broader impacts of the project
include training opportunities for numerous attendees and the possible
initiation of new inter-disciplinary collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
