This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of
Oklahoma Norman provides eight undergraduate students each summer the
opportunity to participate in research on topics in astrophysics, atomic,
molecular and optical physics, condensed matter physics and high energy physics.
In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU
students will engage in activities such as seminars and lectures. Students will
give two oral presentations on the research, one after two weeks and a final
twenty-minute talk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) site, where each summer two high school teachers
from nearby school districts participate in a research project. The teachers
will develop and build small scale experiments that can be transported or
replicated in the high school classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU/RET site
will have a number of broader impacts. The site has a strong plan to recruit
undergraduate students from institutions offering little or no research
opportunities and from groups underrepresented in physics. The site has a strong
evaluation plan which is designed to give feedback and to improve the project on
an on-going basis.
