In recent years, geochemists and a wide variety of earth scientists have
searched for reliable tools to apply to the rock record in order to understand
how the climate of earth has changed in the geologic past. To a great extent the
subject of climatic change is also intertwined with changes in the rate of
weathering of continental land masses and the transport and deposition of the
weathering products to the world ocean. Of particular interest in recent years
is the changing isotopic composition of strontium preserved in the marine
sedimentary record and what that change tells us about the rate of continental
weathering. One of the problems with strontium, however, is that its geochemical
association with calcium means that its response to weathering is buffered by
(calcium) carbonate - water interactions. In this project the principal
investigator will carry out basic studies of the chemistry of a more reliable
(or, at least, what is believed to be more reliable) weathering paleoindicator -
the trace metal osmium.. Osmium is geochemically associated with silicate rock
and, because its geochemistry is not buffered by carbonate, its runoff and
preservation in the marine sedimentary record should more accurately reflect
paleoclimatic change and paleoweathering than does strontium. These studies will
attempt, for the first time, to determine the concentrations and isotopic
compositions of osmium in river waters and seawater. This will be an exceedingly
challenging analytical task; however, it is one that must be undertaken before
we can further explore the value of this trace metal as a tool for understanding
global environmental change.
