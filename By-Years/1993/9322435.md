This project continues research efforts on the morphology and dynamics of the
Earth's magnetosphere. The methodology emphasizes particle precipitation data
and auroral imagery from low altitude satellites. Ionospheric convection as
determined from HF radars as well as middle-magnetosphere satellite data will
also play crucial roles in the program. Research will be conducted in four broad
categories. The first category concerns the low-altitude signatures of
magnetopause processes in which we will clarify the distinctions between various
high altitude magnetospheric plasma regimes. The second category addresses
dayside auroral phenomenology using coordinated satellite imagery and particle
precipitation data, particularly from the DMSP satellites. The third category
involves coordinated observations using the extensive DMSP satellite data and
ground-based coherent radar data to investigate the dynamics of substorm
behavior. Finally, the fourth category involves magnetic field-aligned processes
that connect the low altitude regions to the middle magnetosphere.
