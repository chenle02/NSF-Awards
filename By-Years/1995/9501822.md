This CAREER award supports research in methods and tools for performance
prediction of parallel programs. The goal is a tool set that incorporates
general and accurate methods to predict the performance of a parallel
application in advance of its execution. The approach taken is based on prior
work that has built tools to measure the performance of parallel programs
(Predicate Profiling) and automatically construct performance models of existing
applications (Lost Cycles Analysis). While the prior work has relied principally
on dynamic whole-program analysis, this research will add static analysis
techniques and apply dynamic tools to program fragments. By applying those tools
to program fragments, the research seeks a flexible method for the performance
prediction of alternative program structures. The resulting tool is expected to
aid computational scientists attempting to tune the performance of programs
running on high performance, massively parallel architectures. The educational
component of this CAREER award addresses course development and teaching of
parallel processing for undergraduates, performance measurement and prediction
for graduate students, and a new approach to introductory computer science for
freshmen.
