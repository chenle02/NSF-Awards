9409882 Peck This research will explore the impact of demand uncertainity-
-uncertainty about the number and types of customers-- on the workings of
markets. The study is divided into two parts. The first part will demonstrate
that, under suitable conditions, the only firms who survive competition are
those who commit to sell at a fixed price. If demand is higher than expected,
firms ration some of their customers rather than increase their prices. This
"price competition" has been assumed by previous authors; this study attempts to
explain it. The second part of the study will show how the nature of demand
uncertainty can effect the efficiency of manufacturer-retailer relationships.
Specifically, it will compare resale price maintenance, where the retail price
is set by the manufacturer, to a perfectly competitive retail market. Conditions
will be derived under which resale price maintenance provides higher profits to
the manufacturer and higher utility to the customers than a perfectly
competitive retail market. Under these conditions, perfect retail competition is
"destructive" in the sense of yielding lower economic welfare than resale price
maintenance. The project is important because it attempts to explian the
organization of retail markets. The results from the study promise to give us a
better understanding of pricing "processes" beyond the traditional view of price
competition.
