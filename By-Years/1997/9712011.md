Wind testing facilities in the United States are generally limited to small
scale and component testing. A very small number of the existing full-scale
facilities carry out only partial destructive tests. To improve the
understanding of the action of extreme wind on structural systems large scale
facilities are needed which can model real structures at or near full-scale to
the point of total destruction. Currently, different concepts for such a
facility are being investigated. A workshop will take place on May 1st. and
2nd., 1997 in Arlington, Virginia, to critically examine the merits and
shortcomings of these various concepts. The American Association for Wind
Engineering (AAWE)) will organize this workshop with the purpose of evaluating
and recommending the concepts that meet the needs of the wind engineering
research community. A report on the discussions and findings will be published
and disseminated nationally and internationally.
