9552565 Osberg The San Jose Children's Discovery Museum will develop an exhibit
"Take Another Look." A semi-permanent version will be installed at the
Children's Museum and a 600-750 sq. ft. traveling version will be developed and
circulated under the auspices of the Association of Science and Technology
Centers Traveling Exhibition Service. Consisting of 14 individual elements, the
exhibit is to communicate the essential role and significance of observation in
the human experience and its more purposive character in science; the role and
importance of instrumentation in scientific observation; and the importance to
science of observing and interpreting phenomena in different ways. "Take Another
Look" is aligned with nationally developed science education goals as outlined
in Goals 2000, the AAAS Benchmarks, and with the California's Science Framework.
The project targets the adult/child unit (parents and teachers with children age
2 to 10 that they accompany). Particular attention is being paid to reaching
traditionally underserved audiences including Latino, Asia, and African
American. Complementary materials include a Teacher's Guide, a Family Activities
Guide, and a free/low cost "take-away" card with suggested activities and
recommendations for other activities. It is estimated that in four years it will
reach over two million children and adults both at the San Jose Children's
Discovery Museum and host museums of the touring version.
