Through self-assessment efforts, the Department of Psychology has identified a
major shortcoming of the undergraduate psychology degree, namely, the inadequate
coverage of statistics, research design, and experimental psychology. This
project funds a dedicated computer laboratory for the purposes of teaching these
necessary and requisite research and statistics skills. With a teaching
laboratory with 16 student and 1 faculty computer stations, a facility is
available to allow the implementation of an integrated research curriculum
centered around computer applications. This teaching laboratory is utilized by
three required and two optional undergraduate courses that have been coordinated
to lead students through a cumulative, integrated research course sequence in
such a way that they move from lack of knowledge to ability to conduct research
and data analyses with minimal faculty supervision.
