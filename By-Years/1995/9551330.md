The college is incorporating FT-NMR into its courses to strengthen an already
successful program. To reach this goal, the college is purchasing a Hitachi
R-1500, a Fourier transform spectrometer operating at 60 MHz for 1H, and a 486
computer to provide a necessary data station. By incorporating FT-NMR into the
organic chemistry courses, the college provides students concrete experience in
FT-NMR spectroscopy and computer-operated instrumentation. NMR theory is taught
early in lectures so that laboratory experiments involving NMR are continuous
throughout the courses. Lectures include the basic theory of Fourier Transform
NMR, emphasizing the effects of radio frequency pulses and the benefits of
signal averaging. With the goal of fully utilizing the capabilities of the FT-
NMR instrument, the college is enhancing pre-existing experiments and
introducing new experiments.
