all animal cells and serve in a myriad of cellular functions. These include cell
division, cell movement, the transport of cellular components within the cell,
the organization of cell organelles and the maintenance of cell shape.
Microtubule protein is most abundant in the brain, where it contributes to the
highly specialized strucutre of neuronal cells. Neuronal cell processes, the
axons and dendrites, are filled with microtubules. Associated with these
microtubules are additional proteins which have been shown to promote the
assembly of microtubules. These proteins are known as microtubule-associated
proteins. The goal of our work is to study how a specific microtubule associated
protein, named "tau", is involved in the growth of axons and what parts of the
tau protein are required for activity. Our biological system is a type of brain
cell where tau protein is found in the cell's axon. When these cells are treated
with an inhibitor that depletes tau protein in the cells, the cells do not
develop axons. We plan to reintroduce fragments of tau protein into cells that
have been inhibited to see what parts of the protein are required to restore the
growth of the axon. We also plan to introduce fragments of tau protein into
cells to see which parts of tau protein are responsible for its properties of
axonal growth and localization. Lastly, we plan to introduce into brain cells
hybrid proteins which compose partially of tau and partially of another
microtubule-associated protein. Among the microtubule-associated proteins we
will try are "MAP2" protein, which localizes to the dendrites and is required
for an earlier stage of proce ss growth and "MAP4" protein, which is not found
in neuronal cells. By introducing the hybrid proteins and looking to see whether
axonal growth is normal and whether the hybrid protein localizes to the axon,
these experiments will tell us which parts of tau protein are uniquely required
for its neuronal functions.
