Chemical Oceanography is increasingly becoming a global science. In order to
foster communication and interaction with scientists throughout the globe, this
action provides support for travel of fifteen foreign scientists to the 1991
Gordon Research Conference. Over the years the Gordon Research Conference in
Chemical Oceanography has become one of the major forums for discussion and the
exchange of ideas and information in the field of marine chemistry.
Approximately 100 scientists from all over the United States attend this
meeting. In addition, in recent years, students nearing completion of their
graduate work have also been invited. This year the theme of the conference will
be "Chemistry at Oceanic Interfaces - An Interdisciplinary Approach."
