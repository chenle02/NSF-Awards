This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar 2016" that will be held on October 15 and
16, 2016, on the campus of the University of Wyoming.

This conference is the twenty-fourth installment of the West Coast Operator
Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group
of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator
algebras. Some of the foci of the 2016 event are the following: the Elliott
classification program for C*-algebras; the Baum-Connes conjecture and its
applications; rigidity for actions of countable discrete groups on von Neumann
algebras; subfactors and their invariants; graph C*-algebras; free probability
and its applications; quantum groups; crossed products, imprimitivity, and
duality for C*-algebras. The conference program provides ample opportunity for
graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
