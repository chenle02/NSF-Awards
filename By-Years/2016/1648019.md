The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism
for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation. Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the
leading causes of death and debilitation. A common means of terminating harmful
rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator. The
pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable
defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical
for atrial fibrillation. The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted
under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation
therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable
medical device technology.

The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that
achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the
painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening
arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from
sudden cardiac arrest. The project intends to initially target the development
of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening
arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the
proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients. Additionally,
by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device
may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias. The phase I project will develop
instrumentation, conduct experiments and develop a cardiac model and simulation
environment to validate the technique in support of the development of a
prototype system. The determination of a dose response characteristic of the
proposed therapy in this phase of the research is an expected long-term outcome
of the project.
