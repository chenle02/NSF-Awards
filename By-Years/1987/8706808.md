The purpose of this project is to investigate optimizing models of unemployment
in which the long-run equilibrium rate of unemployment is not unique. In the
case of these models, the equilibrium rate of unemployment actually realized
depends on the history of significant events affecting the economy. For example,
shocks to the economy such as an oil embargo can affect the long-run equilibrium
unemployment rate. Classical economic theory puts great stress on a unique
equilibrium for output and employment. Questioning this fundamental proposition
by testing these optimizing models may have important implications for
stabilization policy. Two types of optimizing models are analyzed in this
project. In the first, current unemployment may depend on past events because in
response to negative employment shocks those still employed raise wages, making
the effect of transitory shocks more permanent. In the second part, a dynamic
business cycle model is developed based on difficulties of unemployed workers
and firms with vacancies finding one another. It is then shown how this model
can replicate co-movements in unemployment and other macroeconomic variables.
