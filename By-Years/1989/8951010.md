This project incorporates a capillary gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-
MS) into the undergraduate curriculum at Williams College. The goals of this
project are to update our GC instrumentation to include capillary capability and
to provide our students with hands-on exposure to mass spectral analysis. The
GC-MS impacts the curriculum at the level of the introductory and advanced
courses, as well as the undergraduate research program. The project includes
experiments that demonstrate applications is analytical, organic, environmental,
and bioorganic chemistry. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funding.
