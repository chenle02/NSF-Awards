9224015 Cozzens The growth of the neurosciences is one of the major developments
in biology in the post-war period. This professional development fellowship will
enable a social scientist who has been studying these developments to gain
training and experience in the neurosciences and coordinate that training with
study of the historical evolution and institutionalization of neuroscience. She
will use this background to complete research on the connections between the
development and directions of this scientific field and its consequences for
various social groups. The award provides for tutorials, coursework, and
laboratory work under the guidance of the neuroscience faculty at the Johns
Hopkins University. It also allows the awardee to interview a number of the past
presidents of the Society for Neuroscience. At the conclusion of this period,
she intends to have a detailed chapter outline for a monograph on autonomy and
power in the neurosciences. ***
