Despite several decades of successful Antarctic aviation, centered upon flight
operations in the McMurdo (Phoenix Field, Ross Island; RsI) area, systemized
description of radar observations such as are normally found essential in
operational aviation settings are notably lacking. The Ross Island region of
Antarctica is a topographically complex region that results in large variations
in the mesoscale high wind and precipitation features across the region. The
goals of this project are to increase the understanding of the three-dimensional
structure of these mesoscale meteorology features. Of particular interest are
those features observed with radar signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will leverage observations from the scanning X-band radar installed during the
AWARE field campaign in 2016 and the installation of an EWR Radar Systems X-band
scanning radar (E700XD) to be deployed during the 2019-20 field season, at
McMurdo. Several science questions and case studies will be addressed during the
season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
