This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports a
joint project by Dr. Gregory J. Grant of the Chemistry Department, University of
Tennessee at Chattanooga and Dr. William Setzer of the Chemistry Department,
University of Alabama at Huntsville. New medium-sized cyclic tridentate and
macrocyclic hexadentate polythioethers will be prepared and used to bind a
variety of divalent and trivalent metal ions, including Pt(II), Pd(II), Hg(II),
Cd(II), Re(III), V(II), Cr(II), and divalent lanthanides. Organometallic
compounds of Rh will be synthesized and tested as stereospecific hydrogenation
catalysts. The compounds are expected to exhibit unusual properties due to
imposed structural constraints and to display differential affinities for metal
ions. %%% Large cyclic organic molecules containing sulfur can bind to metal
ions via the sulfur atoms. When, as in the molecules chosen for this study,
three or six sulfur atoms are available for such bonding, the metal can be
trapped inside a large organic structure. Depending on the size of the ring, the
number and orientation of the sulfur atoms, and the properties of a particular
metal ion, metal ions differ in their tendancy to remain trapped in these
molecules. This research will prepare new cyclic compounds and examine the
properties of the metal complexes they form. The project is potentially
important to developing methods of heavy metal extraction, bioinorganic
chemistry, and catalysis.
