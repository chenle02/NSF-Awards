This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professors
Martin Saunders and R. James Cross at Yale University in collaboration with
Professor Robert J. Poreda at the University of Rochester to study the
encapsulation of noble gases, small organic molecules (methane, carbon oxides),
and metals (lithium) within fullerene. Enrichment of C60 with isotopically
labeled 3He will be explored for tracer studies and applications for
synthetically modified fullerenes. They will also examine naturally occurring
fullerenes for encapsulated atoms and molecules. %%% In this project Professors
Saunders and Cross in collaboration with Professor Poreda will seek to
incorporate atoms and molecules in the fullerene C60 frame. They will improve
their method for fullerene doping with larger quantities of isotopically labeled
helium for synthetic purposes, for environmental tracer studies, and biomedical
applications.
