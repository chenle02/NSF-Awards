In this project a high performance, multi-user computer system supports senior-
level realtime instruction. Students use the networked, graphics-oriented system
for data acquisition, reduction, analysis and presentation. The laboratory
system provides high speed analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion;
TTL-compatible digital input and output; programmable counters/timers; two large
screen, high resolution color graphics workstations; and access to the campus
ethernet backbone. Both low-level and icon-based data acquisition and analysis
software are available as well as a realtime version of UNIX operating system.
Also included is the industry standard networking and computer graphics
software. This distributed system allows students to experience modern,
distributed laboratory computation. Individual students will be able to
simultaneously edit source code and reduce data remotely through network access,
while one project group acquires new data and another group analyzes and
displays old data on the two workstations directly connected to the realtime
host. Student access to the specialized hardware and software is maximized. The
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
