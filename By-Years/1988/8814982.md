This research will entail the design of magnetically levitated micro- robots
which are capable of submicron-level six-degree-of-freedom motion over large
ranges. Micro-robots are microelectromechanical devices capable of repeatable,
precise automated, micron-level motions. They potentially have great application
in such technologies as the construction of hybrid devices with associated
semiconductor devices. The magnetic levitation approach was selected because
magnetically-levitated systems can function in harsh environments and minimize
friction effects and the associated problems of fine particle matter generation.
Additionally, such systems can be designed to provide movement to absolutely
defined locations so that motion errors do not compound. The research will
entail four major paths of study: development of analytical tools which may be
used for design of magnetic levitation microbiotic systems, development of a
sensor system suitable for a levitation system at least four degrees of freedom,
design of a macro/micro-robot pair system which permits high precision motion
over a wide range, and demonstration of the system performing a variety of
tasks.
