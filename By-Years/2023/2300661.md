This award is to assist US-based students to attend the 2023 IEEE International
Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom) to be held in
Atlanta, Georgia on March 13-17, 2023. Participation in PerCom 2023 and similar
conferences are valuable and important activities of the graduate school
experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more
senior researchers and exposes students to leading work and practical industry
practices in this important area of research. This may have an important impact
on career development.

The conference spans five days and will consist of technical paper
presentations, panels, industry presentations, posters, and demonstrations. It
will also feature keynote speeches from leading researchers and practitioners in
the field.

Student travel to conferences is an important activity. Funds will be dispersed
with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the
conference and paying particular attention to diversity and relevance of the
student's research interest.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
