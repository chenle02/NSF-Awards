This project involves Earlham College undergraduates in the study
of&lt;br/&gt;differences in proton and neutron behavior in exotic nuclei.
Proton&lt;br/&gt;and neutron contributions to excited states can be disentangled
by&lt;br/&gt;comparing experimental measurements that have
different&lt;br/&gt;sensitivities to protons and neutrons. The advent of
radioactive&lt;br/&gt;beam technology has enabled such investigations of nuclei
away from&lt;br/&gt;stability via inverse kinematics proton scattering,
electromagnetic&lt;br/&gt;lifetime measurements, and Coulomb excitation. The
focus of this&lt;br/&gt;project is on collective excitations in N=8 and Z=8
single closed&lt;br/&gt;shell nuclei. Three measurements are planned, a gamma-
ray lifetime&lt;br/&gt;measurement of the first excited state of Ne-18 at
Florida State&lt;br/&gt;University (FSU) and inverse kinematics proton
scattering&lt;br/&gt;measurements of the first excited states of Neon-18 and
Oxygen-22 at&lt;br/&gt;the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL).
The&lt;br/&gt;project will span three years and involve one to two students
for&lt;br/&gt;8-10 weeks per summer. Participants will to travel to the NSCL
or&lt;br/&gt;FSU to perform experiments and will analyze the data at
Earlham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
