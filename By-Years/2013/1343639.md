Big Data analytics requires bridging the gap between data-intensive computing
and data-driven computing to obtain actionable insights. The former has
primarily focused on optimizing data movement, reuse, organization and storage,
while the latter has focused on hypothesis-driven, bottom-up data-to-discovery
and the two fields have evolved somewhat independently. This exploratory project
aims to investigate a holistic Ecosystem that optimizes data generation from
simulations, sensors, or business processes (Transaction Step); organizes this
data (possibly combining with other data) to enable reduction, pre-processing
for downstream data analysis (Organization Step); performs knowledge discovery,
learning and mining models from this data (Prediction Step); and leads to
actions (e.g., refining models, new experiments, recommendation) (Feedback
Step). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: As opposed to the current
practice of considering optimizations in each step in isolation, the project
considers scalability and optimizations of the entire Ecosystem for big data
analytics as part of the design strategy. The project aims to consider big data
challenges in designing algorithms, software, analytics, and data management.
This strategy contrasts with traditional approaches that first design algorithms
for small data sizes and then scale them up. The project aims to treat data
complexity, computational requirement, and data access patterns as a whole when
designing and implementing algorithms, software and applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project could advance the state of
the art in big data analytics across a number of key applications such as
Climate Informatics and Social Media Analytics. The software resulting from the
project is being made available to the broder scientific community under open
source license. The project offers enhanced opportunities for education and
training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at Northwestern
University.
