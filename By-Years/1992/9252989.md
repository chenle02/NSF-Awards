Project VISTA (VIsual/Spatial Thinking Activities) is a curriculum
development/research project designed to produce a bank of
enrichment/enhancement science-oriented VST learning activities for grades K-8.
University science educators, scientists, cognitive psychologists and
educational technologists will collaborate with 36 exemplary Teacher Associates
to develop and refine Project VISTA activities over a phased three-year period.
The project will produce the following outcomes: 1) a baseline of assessed VST
abilities for children in grades K- 8; 2) a battery of new VST assessment
instruments; 3) a large collection of innovative VST science learning
activities, including hands-on experiences, interactive videotape-based
experiences, computer-based experiences, and inquiring demonstrations. These
enrichment materials will be made available nationally to build upon and
supplement all existing K-8 science programs.
