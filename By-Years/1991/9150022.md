Teachers College, Columbia University, will carry out a project which will
develop curriculum and create student teaching experiences at the High School
for Teaching in New York City. The High School for Teaching is part of a network
of special-interest magnet high schools established by the New York City School
System, and its student body is 88% minority. This school attracts students from
across the city who plan to go into teaching careers and develops innovative
programs to support their career choice. The goals of this project are two-fold:
(1) to give preservice teachers an outstanding field experience in teaching
secondary science in an urban setting, and (2) to attract and enable high school
students at HST to pursue a career in teaching science. The University's cost-
sharing is 11.5% of NSF's contribution.
