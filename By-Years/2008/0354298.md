This is an interdisciplinary proposal by a team of researchers lead by Alexey
Voinov at the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College and Robert
Wheelersburg at Elizabeth College to do an integrated social and environmental
assessment of the Lake Imandra watershed on the Kola Peninsula, Russia. The
proposed research would be part of an ongoing effort to integrate local
stakeholders and scientific knowledge in order to better inform policy
concerning the degradation of the local ecosystem from decades of industrial
pollution. &lt;br/&gt;
