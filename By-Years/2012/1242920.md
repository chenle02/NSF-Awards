This award will help to support the first U.S.-Brazil Frontiers of Science and
Engineering Symposium (USBFOS&amp;E) organized by the National Academy of
Science (NAS) and the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), respectively, in
partnership with the National Academy of Sciences of Brazil. The symposium, to
be held in Brazil in early 2014, is designed to facilitate exchange and
collaboration across scientific and engineering disciplines and to enhance
networks among early-career scientists and engineers. This would be the first
bilateral Frontiers meeting involving both young scientists and engineers at the
same meeting, and will also be the first to be held in Latin America.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 60-70 outstanding early-career scientists and
engineers from the United States and Brazil (30-35 from each side) are expected
to participate and attend this symposium. A program organizing committee, led by
co-chairs from the U.S. and Brazil and consisting of additional members, will
identify topics and speakers. The symposium format will include formal sessions
with presentations by speakers on leading edge research, emerging technologies,
and with multiple opportunities for informal interactions across science and
engineering fields. Similar symposia in other regions have fostered
interdisciplinary and international collaborations, and have served as a
reference point for many of the emerging frontiers in research and innovation in
the U.S. Presentations from the USBFOS&amp;E will be posted on the NAS and NAE-
FOE web sites.
