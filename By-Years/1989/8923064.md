Recent results from studies of the energetics of the atmosphere show bimodal
peaks in the vertical energy spectrum of large-scale motions. However, few
details are known of the physical processes responsible for the vertical energy
spectrum or of energy transformations. The principal investigator will examine
the energy spectrum, its maintenance, and energy transformation in the vertical
spectral domain using the analyzed fields of data from the 1979 Global Weather
Experiment (the so-called FGGE III-b data) and a three-dimensional spectral
model. The research will employ a numerical framework known as normal modes for
the analysis. The results will show how energy is redistributed vertically to
motion at many scales. Ultimately, the research could serve as a basis for
improvements for global numerical models.
