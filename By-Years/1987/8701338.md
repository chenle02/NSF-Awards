The aim of this project is to investigate certain inverse problems for elliptic
and parabolic partial differential equations that contain unknown coefficients
which are functions of the dependent variables. These coefficients can be
recovered by giving overposed boundary data, that it prescribed Dirichlet type
data and a chosen curve lying on the boundary region. The method consists of
converting the inverse problem into a fixed-point problem in which one has a
mapping from the unknown coefficients to the overposed data. The fixed point
problem is solved through an iteration scheme. The authors have been able to
demonstrate the convergence of that scheme in some cases. They propose now a
number of research questions to be investigated to improve the knowledge of the
technique. The inverse problems arise in a number of applications where one has
observed data and the problem is to find the parameters of the equation
describing the phenomenon. Continuum mechanics, mathematical biology and
chemical combustion theory are among potential applications of this inverse
method.
