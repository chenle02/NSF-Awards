This project integrates the use of real-time meteorological data into the
undergraduate studies in five departments: Biology, Chemistry, Geography and
Planning, Physics and Astronomy, and Technology. Three automatic recording
weather stations provide data in a rugged, mountainous area of North Carolina.
The data from these stations is available on a university-wide broad-band
network and is available in computer and science laboratories in each of the
five departments. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal
match for the NSF award.
