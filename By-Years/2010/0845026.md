In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program,
Professor Guillermo Moyna at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia and
his group will employ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to probe the
structure and dynamics of a series of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium based ionic
liquids (ILs) and solutions containing these ILs, cosolvents of different
polarities, and various carbohydrates. Specifically, deuterium isotope effects
on chemical shifts, relaxation measurements, and diffusion determinations will
reveal the connection between molecular level interactions and such properties
as viscosity, and the ability of certain ILs to dissolve other species such as
carbohydrates derived from biomass. Molecular dynamics simulations will be
performed to complement the experimental studies and develop atomistic models of
these systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to gaining a better
understanding of the basic science of IL-based systems and IL-mediated
processes, achieving the project objectives will impact a broad swath of
disciplines. For example, the data from these studies may aid in the design of
new IL-based media that could find direct application in fields ranging from
water remediation to biomass processing. In addition, the project will engage
students at various levels of their careers in both experiment and theory. This
will allow senior members of the research team to hone their skills as teachers
and mentors, while at the same time providing the younger investigators in the
group with the unique opportunity of learning advanced chemical concepts by
doing chemistry.
