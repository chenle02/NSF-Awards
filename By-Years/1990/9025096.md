Integrated Optical Circuits (IOCs) currently perform several operations on
optical signals, and the more important functions are: switching or routing,
amplitude and phase modulation, time delay and detection. In all cases, the
structures are passive, and lossy, which in turn impinges on the system
performance. Furthermore, couplers, interferometers and other components that
make up these structures are long, up to several millimeters each. The active
guide structures to be used for the proposed Active Integrated Optical Circuits
will have gain or attenuation depending on the biasing condition, and thus loss
is no longer an issue. Since the proposed structures are not dependent on
coupling lengths, these may be made in very compact form. Furthermore, the
guides are basically laser structures biased to transparency, gain or loss, and
thus integration with similar laser sources is feasible. Proposed structures in
the form of Ys, Xs, and crossbars may be used as switches, routing structures,
and modulators, and these are to be investigated for switching speed,
polarization dependence, temperature, bandwidth, current loading, and noise
contribution. Several other optical integrated circuits are also possible with
these active guides, but this one year exploratory research grant will confine
itself to investigations of the above structures.
