Non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas are a new and fascinating type of a
plasma that has tremendous potential in medicine and nanotechnology. Our
understanding of the atmospheric microplasmas and the nature of the plasma
interaction with biological matter is very limited. In this project, we will, in
particular, advance the knowledge of atmospheric microplasmas relevant for
medical applications. This research program will serve as a vehicle for
undergraduate and graduate education in the field of plasma science. The PIs
will make a concerted effort to involve women and under-represented minority
students in this project by working closely with the relevant student
organizations at George Washington University. To recruit women, the Society of
Women Engineers will be contacted and informed of the project activities. In
addition, undergraduate students will be engaged in the research through the
Work Study program or a Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement. The
experience will impart them with the knowledge and the skills to excel in
independent academic or industry careers they pursue after completing their
education. The educational plan for this project also aims to generate interest
in science and technology in the area of plasma science and bioengineering and
to reach out to K-12 teachers, school children and their parents. In particular,
we plan to interact with local schools in the Metropolitan DC
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central objective of this project is to
understand the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas
with a view towards biological applications. To this end we will develop and
implement a wide range of new diagnostic methodologies and tools applicable for
atmospheric microplasmas. The overall project will address the ionization
mechanism, energy balance and conditions for streamer propagation as well as
effects related to overvoltage. This project has both fundamental and
technological significance. The fundamental significance of this project is in
understanding the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric
microplasmas. To this end a wide spectrum of diagnostic instrumentation for
atmospheric pressure microplasmas will be developed. Availability of this
instrumentation has critical importance for the future progress of the field of
atmospheric microplasmas. Enabled by these advances, the technological
significance lies in exploring the wide range of applications of atmospheric
microplasmas, such as plasma medicine and nanotechnology.
