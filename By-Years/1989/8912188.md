A variety of theoretical applications of artificial intelligence make use of
modal operators. A modal operator is often thought as a function that takes a
well.formed formula as an argument and is assigned a semantics. This project is
an investigation into the theoretical and computational properties of a new
formalization of modal operators. This formalization views a modal operator as
consisting of both a syntactic and semantic component. The aim of this research
is to examine how this new formalization would work under a number of different
modal operators and to construct a general purpose implementation of this
formulation that allows us to look at specific examples involving the modal
operators arising in the analysis of belief, knowledge, casuality and simple
temporal reasoning.
