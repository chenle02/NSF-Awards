Recent discoveries of shocked feldspar and quartz near the Triassic-Jurassic
systemic boundary in Tuscany seem to provide the stratigraphic record of the
latest Triassic Manicouagan impact, which created one of the five largest impact
craters on Earth. This Manicouagan impact is of the magnitude necessary to
generate the large-scale global darkening, thermal variations, and other
environmental changes as proposed for another mass extinction at the K-T
boundary. A quantitative paleoecological study of marine bivalves and associated
invertebrates across the T-J systemic boundary sections in Tuscany will document
the marine diversity record relative to the Manicouagan event. The
paleobiological data will be collected in conjunction with sampling for shock-
metamorphosed minerals and geochemical anomalies. The objective of this
exploratory study is to calibrate the marine diversity record in the Tuscan
sections with the new evidence for the stratigraphic location of the Manicouagan
event.
