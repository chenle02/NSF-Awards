An interdisciplinary conference on inverse design methodology will be held at
the Pennsylvania State University, October 26 through 28, l987. Inverse design
is the process by which the desired boundary parameters are prescribed with
certain constraints and the boundary shapes are to be determined. For example,
if the surface temperature distribution is given one then wishes to find the
shape of the surface for a given total heat flux or given bounds on the acoustic
power output from an oscillating body of fixed volume find the shape of the body
that will result in the most uniform radiation pattern. The goal of this
interdisciplinary conference is to review the global state of the art and to
provide for a unique forum for the exchange of ideas between the various
disciplines. The Conference shall be comprised of six invited lectures and a
number of refereed contributed technical papers. In addition to the National
Science Foundation the Office of Naval Research is also providing partial
support for this Conference.
