9724819 Clements This U.S.-Brazil award provides support for Dr. Kevin A.
Clements of Worcester Polytechnic Institute to work with Professor Antonio
Simoes Costa at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina in Florianopolis,
Brazil on the study of optimal power flow methods in competitive electricity
markets. Optimal power flow is a tool which can be used to look at the problem
of figuring the marginal costs of electricity. In computing these costs, several
constraints must be taken into account such as physical lower and upper limits
for individual generators, security-related transmission loading limits of
transmission lines, and the required amount of reactive support. By developing
this tool, they can model consumer demand elasticity as well as consumer energy
use. They will develop models in parallel in Brazil and the United States. Both
sides have been working on this problem and by joining research teams and
facilities, they can advance their research more quickly and efficiently. ***
