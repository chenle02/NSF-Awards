Axler 9424417 The investigators will conduct research on problems arising from
the interaction between complex function theory and functional analysis. Primary
emphasis will rest on the study of certain important spaces of analytic and
harmonic functions and operators on these spaces. The topics to be considered
include approximation by harmonic functions, iterations of the Berezin
transform, hypercyclicity, Koenigs functions, composition operators, Toeplitz
operators, Hankel operators and Bergman spaces. The project will also include
the development of software for the symbolic manipulation of harmonic functions,
appropriate for use by pure and applied mathematicians and scientists/engineers
who utilize harmonic functions in their research. Operator theory has its
origins in mathematical physics, in particular, in the study of quantum
mechanics. The modeling of the atom required the development of non-commutative
analysis. The commutator of operators is the measure of non-commutativity.
Harmonic functions are encountered in the study of potential functions whose
origins can be traced to electrostatics. Analytic functions are complex
analogues of harmonic functions. A good portion of this project deals with
operators and the analysis of their commutators that acting on spaces of
analytic functions. The research on this project should be of benefit to the
mathematical analysis community and to other scientists whose work involves non-
commutative models and potential theory. ***
