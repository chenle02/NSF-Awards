This project involves the purchase of six Silicon Graphics workstations, a color
printer, and related software to constitute a distributed laboratory for
scientific visualization. It will be housed in computer laboratories in the
various science buildings with access for all science students and faculty. A
one-month course on scientific visualization will be taught for faculty and
students during Winter Term. The chemistry, computer science, geology and
physics departments plan to enhance existing courses with modules on
visualization.
