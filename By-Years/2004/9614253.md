This study proposes to elucidate the role of high latitude ecosystems in the
global carbon cycle and to assess the sensitivity and uncertainty of terrestrial
carbon storage responses to transient changes in climate. The study will
synthesize and integrate data from investigations of carbon cycling at local,
regional, and global scales with the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). Once the
TEM is tested, the model will be run for the historical transient climate to
compare estimated temporal and spatial variations in terrestrial carbon storage
with those estimated by analysis of the historical record of atmospheric carbon
dioxide. The results will be useful for identifying the uncertainty in carbon
storage responses of high latitude ecosystems and for assessing the effects of
climate change in terrestrial systems.
