9511989 Mariano This award provides funds to permit Dr. Patrick S. Mariano,
Department of Chemistry, University of Maryland at College Park, to pursue with
Professor Ung Chan Yoon, Department of Chemistry, Pusan National University,
Korea, for 36 months, a program of cooperative research in the area of electron
transfer photochemistry. The four thrusts of this project are to (1) probe
important scientific questions regarding the mechanisms and synthetic
applications of organic photochemical reactions which are promoted by excited
state electron transfer, (2) bring an international cooperative perspective to
an ongoing research project supported by the Chemistry Division, National
Science Foundation (NSF), (3) develop strong scientific interactions between
scientists at the University of Maryland and their counterparts at Korean
institutions, and (4) provide an introduction of young American scientists to
unique research opportunities as part of their doctoral dissertation research.
It is well recognized that electron transfer (SET) photochemistry is a key
mechanistic event in a wide variety of ground and excited state chemical and
biochemical processes. Organic photochemistry is one discipline where this
recognition has profoundly impacted the understanding of mechanistic pathways
and the development of new reactions. The PI and his Korean collaborator have
made a number of significant contributions in the field of SET-photochemistry
and are highly respected researchers in the field of the proposal. This project
is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program
which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean
scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,
skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.
Korean participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and
Engineering Foundation (KOSEF). This project adds an international coopera tive
dimension to the PI's ongoing research under NSF Grant No. CHE-9420889 ***
