Talaria, Inc., proposes a three-year project to increase understanding of how to
get research results on teaching and learning into teachers' minds and actions.
To accomplish this, a teacher professional development program will be designed
to implement DIAGNOSER, a computerized diagnostic instructional tool. The
DIAGNOSER is a web-delivered system in which students answer
assignments/questions and teachers access the report on the students after they
have completed the assignments. DIAGNOSER focuses on physical sciences, force
and motion at the middle-school level. The professional development program will
provide teachers with opportunities to use formative assessment tools, interpret
student data, interact with and reflect on each other's practice, and access
research and science resources. Participating teachers include those involved in
three middle-school Local Systemic Change Projects in Washington State. The
program involves one workshop, teacher networks, face-to-face meeting with
teachers and resource teachers for in-class coaching. The improvement of the
program will be done through iterations (design-testing-redesign). The research
will focus on two questions: What are the effects of the professional
development and diagnostic instructional tools on teachers' teaching and
students' learning? What are the teacher and system factors related to the
effective implementation of the tools? The premise of the proposal is that at
the end of the study there will be a prototype program that can be scalable
nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
