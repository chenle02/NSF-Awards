This project will support 6 students to attend an 8 week summer research
program followed by academic year research at the student's home institution.
The first 3 weeks of the summer will include instruction in parallel languages,
data structures for parallel programming, and exposure to parallel algorithms.
In the remaining 5 weeks students are separated into teams of two members each
to do research on problems such as parallel combinatorial algorithms and
parallel composite graph coloring.
