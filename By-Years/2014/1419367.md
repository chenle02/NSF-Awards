The project involves the design and development of pedagogical games to
introduce cybersecurity and cyber safety concepts to students in grades K-6. It
will engage students with activities demonstrating the relevance of
cybersecurity to the world around them; challenge students with creative puzzle-
solving exercises; and will analyze the effectiveness of age-appropriate
cybersecurity games to introduce cybersecurity knowledge. A major aspect of this
project is the dissemination of cybersecurity principles to elementary school
students. If successful in test cases, the games will be provided to school
districts for their use nationwide to help establish a national culture of
cybersecurity.

To address the vast difference in capabilities of students in these grades, the
project will develop a series of short interactive fun games designed to convey
age-appropriate lessons. After delivery to participating school districts in
Texas and California, an analysis of their effectiveness will be conducted and
the results will be made available to other researchers. The proposed research
will be conducted in three phases. In Phase 1, the project will create at least
six prototype games accessible to a wide audience, that foster curiosity in
security topics. The games will use established and familiar game engines. In
Phase 2, the project will develop and deploy at least two of the prototypes in
San Antonio, TX and Los Angelos, CA school districts. In Phase 3, the project
will evaluate acceptance and impact of the games; disseminate curricular
materials, evaluation materials and lessons learned; and will make all software
tools available to other educators.
