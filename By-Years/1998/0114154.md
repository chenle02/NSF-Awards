This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program in DMR
supports instrument development and student training at Boston University. The
new system under development will enable, for the first time, the in-situ study
with synchrotron x-ray radiation of materials' surface structure while
undergoing plasma processing. The system will permit both a realistic plasma
processing environment and the necessary diagnostic access while conforming to
the space afforded by a standard four-circle diffractometer. An important
advantage of the system is its portability, permitting transport between the
synchrotron and other laboratories for multiple process characterizations.
Initial studies with the system will concentrate on silicon surfaces undergoing
high density plasma etching to address the void of data available on the
structure of such surfaces. Future applications of the equipment will be
directed at compound semiconductor
surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation
for Materials Research Program in DMR supports instrument development and
student training at Boston University. Faculty and students at Boston University
are developing a system that will enable study of the atomic structure of
surfaces as they are being bombarded by energetic particles in a set of
processes known collectively as "plasma processing". Such information will
advance our fundamental understanding of these important techniques that are
widely used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and microwave devices. The
system will allow the integration of a reactor used for plasma processing of
materials into a high flux x-ray characterization facility. The high flux of
x-rays will permit atomic surface structure characterization during plasma
processing for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;
