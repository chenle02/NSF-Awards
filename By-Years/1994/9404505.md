9301989 Kelly This project provides additional, supplemental funding to enable
the completion of the renovation of University of California earthquake
simulator facility this facility has been the major experimental resource of the
U.S. over the last two decades and the renovation in progress will upgrade the
capability to a much higher level than before as required for testing of
complex, large scaled structural model to the nonlinear, inelastic range. The
supplemental funds are required to acquire new hydraulic equipment and to carry
out new designs of the hydraulic system which is an essential part of the
shaking table in the simulator facility. ***
