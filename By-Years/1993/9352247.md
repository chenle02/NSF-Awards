Frostburg State University's Physics and Computer Science departments have
initiated an ambitious program with two main goals, to enhance physics students'
experiences with computers as laboratory tools, introducing experiments in which
a computer is a fully integrated element in the procedure. Some existing
experiments have been redesigned and some new experiments have been developed
for the Intermediate and Advanced Laboratory courses to use a computer to
control certain aspects of the experiment, as well as collecting and analyzing
data. The second goal involves a plan to create a framework for a double major
in Physics and Computer Science with a concentration on the computer as a
laboratory tool.
