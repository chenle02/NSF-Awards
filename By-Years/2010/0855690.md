IIP 0855690&lt;br/&gt;University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;Briggs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington (UW)
is planning to join the existing multi-university Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "The Center for Advanced Forestry
Systems" (CAFS) which was established in 2007 with four member institutions:
North Carolina State University (lead university), Oregon State University,
Purdue University and Virginia Tech. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;UW expertise and
proposed projects will expand and complement the areas of managing plantation
site resources; measuring and monitoring their growth, yield and quality
response with remote sensing; developing improved growth and yield and wood
quality prediction models; and improving landscape-level decision support
systems. The proposed activities at UW will augment current CAFS projects, and
will more fully address the needs for scientific and technological advances for
enhancing the competitiveness of the US forestry sector.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort at UW has the potential to improve the
competitiveness of the forest products industry by solving key problems using
applied research and enhanced institutional collaboration. Members will benefit
by becoming knowledgeable about a wider range of technological capabilities.
Technology transfer will be facilitated by direct interactions between the
scientist of member academic institutions forest sector members, refereed
publications and presentations at scientific meetings, and training of graduate
and under-graduate students. Aggressive recruiting for graduate students among
under-represented groups will be conducted, increasing the diversity of the
workforce for both academia and industry. The diversity promoting activities are
part of the UW's overall commitment to and plan for increasing diversity.
