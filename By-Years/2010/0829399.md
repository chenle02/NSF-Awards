With the goal to address the severe national shortage in the number of domestic
members of underrepresented populations (i.e., African Americans, Hispanics,
American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders)
pursuing doctoral degrees in the STEM disciplines (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics), the Alliances for Graduate Education and the
Professoriate (AGEP) Program was initiated by the NSF in 1998. During the last 7
years, the program has grown from a few alliances in 1998 to 22 AGEP alliances
nationwide in 2005. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) will partner with the Alliances for Graduate
Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) to especially address the AGEP goal of
preparing underrepresented minorities in the fields of social, behavioral, and
economic sciences for faculty leadership in academia.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CASBS was established in 1954, around the same time as
NSF, for the purpose of advancing the fields within the behavioral sciences
(broadly construed) and being of service to society. This Center has a long and
distinguished history of bringing together in an interdisciplinary setting, the
very best scholars in the nation and beyond, and thereby advancing fields, with
some examples of serving society. An AGEP-CASBS partnership will more
effectively advance fields, improve institutions, and serve society by engaging
younger minority faculty scholars with fresh ideas and supporting them to
develop into future academic leaders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pilot
partnership will identify and mentor young post-tenure faculty from AGEP as
residential Fellows at CASBS for the 2008-2009 academic year. These fellowships
will be jointly funded by NSF and CASBS. A Steering Committee of SBE AGEP
leadership would work with the CASBS Director and Deputy Director to accomplish
the goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will also help CASBS
design the assessment of first use of an application system for selecting
Fellows. CASBS seeks a process that will yield more diversity among Fellows in
terms of age, institution, gender, and especially ethnicity. CASBS aims to
improve this process over the next four years. The AGEP-CASBS partnership will
enhance this assessment and resulting modifications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
