9419424 Babu Description: This project is to provide support for a planning
visit by Dr. Gutti Babu, Department of Statistics at Pennsylvania State
University. He is to interact with Professor Arup Bose at the Indian Statistical
Institute in Calcutta. Dr. Babu's experience on bootstrap methods and Bose's
expertise on auto- regressive processes complement each other. Another area of
collaboration will be in classification of stellar populations, where the
development of multivariate classification schemes is required to handle the
effects of selection biases and possible censoring. ***
