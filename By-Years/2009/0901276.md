ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Furedi, Zoltan Proposal Number: DMS - 0901276
Institution: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Title: Extremal
hypergraphs, codes, designs, and combinatorial geometry

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The PI has studied how local properties affect the global
parameters of various combinatorial structures. This is a very general framework
of the so-called Turan number problems. The PI plans to continue his work on
this topic and investigates four different aspects: 1. To study the Turan
numbers of triple systems and multigraphs, as a tool to achieve a general theory
for r-graphs, e.g., to prove Kalai's conjecture. 2. To investigate natural
generalizations of Turan's question, like the number of substructures, stability
questions, and consider other host-graphs, like the hypercube. 3. To study
general coding theory, design-theory, combinatorial geometry problems, geometric
and algebraic graph representations, which lead to hypergraph intersection and
other Turan type problems, e.g., superimposed and covering codes, and the
completion problem of partial G-designs. 4. To find geometric/algebraic graph
representations where Turan numbers naturally emerge, e.g., Prague-dimension,
intersection and geometric representations of graphs.

The subject of this proposal is the effect of local properties on global
parameters of combinatorial structures, in other words, extremal combinatorics.
The PI continue to find applications in theoretical computer science, coding
theory and discrete geometry. Combinatorics deals with finite but very large
problems arising from computer science, data mining, and communications.
Extremal combinatorics applies a broad array of tools and results from other
fields of mathematics, on the other hand, it has a number of interesting
applications in in geometry, integer programming, computer science, coding
theory, dimension theory of partially ordered sets, and cryptography.
Combinatorics is the theoretical basis of the economical, fast and reliable
algorithms to store and reach data structures. Applications of extremal
combinatorics and coding theory in computer science, computer graphics and in
communication theory are indispensable.
