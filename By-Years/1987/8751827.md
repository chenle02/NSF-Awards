The American Association for the Advancement of Science will establish a
program of targeted recruitment and placement of outstanding black, Hispanic and
Native American students into its Mass Media Science and Engineering Fellows
Program. Over a four year period, a total of fifteen advanced students from the
natural and social sciences and engineering will spend ten weeks during the
summer working as reporters, researchers, or production assistants with mass
media organizations. By the conclusion of the award, corporations and other
private sources will be contributing the costs of stipends and recruitment and
effective minority recruitment will be an ongoing part of the AAAS Mass Media
Program. The AAAS and corporate donors will contribute more than $90,000 in
stipends and support over the four year period.
