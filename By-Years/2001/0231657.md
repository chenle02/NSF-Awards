This award provides funding for a Summer School on Applications of Advanced
mathematical and Computational Methods to Atmospheric and Oceanic Problems (MCAO
2003), which will be held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
at Boulder, Colorado, during the time period of July 14 to 26, 2003. This
interdisciplinary summer school will bring together specialists of atmosphere
and ocean sciences, and applied mathematicians interested in such problems. The
purpose of this school is to provide to graduate students and young researchers
of one field the basic elements of the other fields, as well as some more
advanced openings into current research. It is also hoped in this way to
initialize or further develop the communication and interactions between
specialists of different fields speaking different languages, conducting
different methodologies but interested sometimes in the same problems. Many of
the proposed lecturers have participated in earlier conferences on mathematical
problems in atmosphere and ocean sciences, and they have already invested into
interactions between mathematics, computing and geosciences. Most of the
requested funding will be devoted to support the students and the lecturers.
