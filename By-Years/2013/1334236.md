The Workshop on Security and Human Behavior (SHB) was started in 2008 to
facilitate a dialogue about behavioral aspects of safety and security that is
developing between psychologists and security engineers. Related conferences
include the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) which brings
together security people and psychologists but is more narrowly focused on the
usability of security products and systems. The Workshop on the Economics of
Information Security (WEIS) has much broader scope but as its name suggests its
focus is security and economics. The goal of SHB is to bring in a broader set of
social scientists than those involved in SOUPS, WEIS, and similar conferences,
with a 50/50 mix between social scientists and computer
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides financial support to cover
travel, accommodation and registration for students and social science faculty
members, allowing expansion of access to workshop scheduled to be held at
University of Southern California's National Center for Risk and Economic
Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE - www.usc.edu/create) on June 3-4 2013.
Past workshops have been hosted at MIT, Cambridge, MA (2008 and 2009),
Cambridge, UK (2010), CMU, Pittsburgh, PA (2011), and Google HQ, New York
(2012). The program committee of this year's workshop consists of (1) Bruce
Schneier who is Chief Security Technology Officer of BT, (2) Professor
Alessandro Acquisti of Carnegie Melon, and (3) Professor Ross Anderson of
Cambridge.
