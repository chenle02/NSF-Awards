The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
long distance data transmission. The global consumer internet traffic
experiences annual growth requiring continuous improvement in internet backbone
efficiency. A wide range of industries are impacted by such improvements. Some
applications, such as smart cities, require considerable improvements in
infrastructure network efficiency. For example, in order to accomplish smart
cities with the heterogeneous applications on Internet of Things (IoT),
improving infrastructure network efficiency is necessary. Furthermore, the fifth
generation (5G) wireless network as the next generation mobile system is also
reliant on a resilient high speed telecommunication backbone network. On a broad
scale, these improvements to networks will increase efficiency of data centers
and computing platforms and can improve the energy efficiency of such systems.
Dynamic multi-layer network optimization will make networks adaptable to traffic
variation and potential failure events, and consequently eliminate the costly
and wasteful over provisioning of system resources.

This I-Corps project explores the commercialization path for telecommunication
networks optimization technology. This method monitors traffic requirements from
higher layers and performs multi-layer optimization on the optical and internet
protocol layers. It achieves improvements in data transmission speed and network
resource usage while guaranteeing network stability. These techniques do not
require prior knowledge of the network equipment specifications, are scalable,
provide high accuracy and are able to adjust and learn changes on the network.
The implementation feasibility has been successfully demonstrated in small-scale
prototypes and the performance improvements at scale has been extensively
studies by numerical evaluations proving up to 2x improvement in transmission
speed and 10 percent reduction in equipment usage.
