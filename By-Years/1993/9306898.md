This award supports the research of Professor Ribet to work in number theory.
Since 1986, Ribet has been working on Serre's conjectures which relate mod p
modular forms and mod p two dimensional representations of the Galois group of
an algebraic closure of the rationals. Ribet also proposes to continue his
interests in variants involving Shimura varieties, base fields other than the
rationals and representation modulo powers of p. This is research in the field
of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such
as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest
fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic
reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an essential tool
in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes
for electronics.
