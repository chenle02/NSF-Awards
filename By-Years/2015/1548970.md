The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project, if successful, is an improvement in diagnosis
and treatment of middle ear infections, a disease that affects greater than 90%
of the world's population. Middle ear infections are the leading cause of
hearing loss in children and responsible for more surgeries than any other
childhood disease. Correct diagnosis of fluid in the middle ear space is crucial
to proper treatment to avoid extended hearing loss. The American Academy of
Pediatrics recommends pneumatic otoscopy as a key diagnostic for the
identification of fluid in the middle ear, yet only 25% of physicians even
attempt this exam because it is difficult to obtain a seal of the ear canal,
which is a requirement for the technique. Over-prescription of antibiotics has
become a significant problem, leading to antibiotic resistance and wasted
resources. This project will prove the concept of a pneumatic otoscopy technique
that does not require a seal of the ear canal, leading to a much simpler, yet
equally effective exam. This will, in turn, lead to increased compliance with
the academy-recommended guidelines and improved patient outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop tools to improve the success rate
of pneumatic otoscopy, enabling physicians to comply with the guidelines set
forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics and to better diagnose and treat
otitis media with effusion. In pneumatic otoscopy, a physician views the surface
of the eardrum while changing the pressure in the ear canal to cause the eardrum
to move. If the middle ear is filled with fluid, then the eardrum does not move
appreciably. The proposed tools will leverage thermodynamic principles in novel
ways to abolish the requirement of sealing the canal. They will be low-cost,
enabling access to the technology even for the solo practitioner. The proposed
project will (1) design and build prototypes of these tools, (2) characterize
the tools on a lab bench, and (3) characterize the tools in a simulation model
of the human ear. The project will culminate in data that teaches whether or not
the proposed tools will suitably inform the physician about the presence of
fluid in the ear.
