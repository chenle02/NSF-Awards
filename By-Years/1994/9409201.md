Chemical messenger molecules, including hormones and neurotransmitters, mediate
communication between adjacent and distant parts of all organisms. Many of these
messengers are first produced in inactive precursor forms that requireactivation
before they can exert their biological action on cells and tissues. Many
precursor molecules give rise to more than one type of active messenger through
this activation process. This study will examine what rules the organisms uses
in the processing of these precursors. A model precursor molecule,
proenkephalin, will be studied. The structure of proenkephalin will be modified
using recombinant DNA technology to reveal what parts of the molecule are the
usual sites for processing and what influences various structural features of
the molecule have on processing. Also using this same technology, an attempt
will be made to construct new types of precursors that will generate single
active messengers without having to go through extensive procession. Such
"minimal" precursors may be useful for delivery of specific hormones or
neurotransmitters in gene therapy.
