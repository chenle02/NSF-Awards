9354023 Uno This project intends to help prepare new instructors to teach
undergraduate biology courses at junior colleges, community colleges, or four-
year colleges. Because graduates of research institutions usually receive little
training in biology education or experience in developing their own course,
first-year faculty members often face a task for which they are poorly trained.
This proposal outlines a two-year project including: (a) four workshops
presented at annual meetings of professional biologists; and (b) the production,
review, and distribution of a handbook (based on the workshops) for
inexperienced instructors on developing and teaching undergraduate biology
courses. The workshops will be led by faculty experienced in: (a) teaching
biology using inquiry (Gordon Uno, Univ of Oklahoma); (b) assessment, critical
thinking skills, and cooperative learning (Leona Truchan, Alverno College); and
(c) open-ended biological computer simulations (John Jungck, BioQUEST and Beloit
College). Workshops will: (a) introduce participants to contemporary pedagogical
strategies and concerns; (b) have participants develop a syllabus for their
biology course(s); and (c) determine the content of the proposed handbook. The
handbook also will be based on questionnaires and selected parts of Developing
Biological Literacy, a biology curriculum framework developed by the Biological
Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS). The handbook will be distributed at annual
meetings of a variety of professional biological organizations. ***
