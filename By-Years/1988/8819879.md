Past research shows that many behaviors and physiological processes tend to
vary cyclically. It has been suggested that during social interaction, these
behavioral and physiological rhythms become coordinated between partners; and
that greater coordination between partners is accompanied by more positive
feelings. However, few studies have actually examined coordination of rhythms
during social interaction. This study will explore the coordination of rhythms
in 100 dyads. Variations in amount of talking, blood pressure, heart rate, and
palmar sweating will be analyzed to evaluate (1) whether there is evidence that
each of these processes tends to vary cyclically; and (2) whether pairs of
subjects who show close coordination of physiological rhythms tend to show more
positive affect than pairs of subjects who show little or no coordination.
Another question that will be considered is the relative importance of
coordination of rhythms compared to other well.established factors that are
known to influence liking (such as attitude similarity and physical
attractiveness). This research will provide new information about a basic and
controversial question that is central to social interaction research. Many
theorists believe that when there is marked cyclicity in behavioral and
physiological processes and close coordination between partners, the social
interaction is going well, and that these smoothly coordinated rhythms are
associated with positive feelings and interpersonal attraction. There is
speculation that (over the long term), disorganization or decoupling among
behavioral and physiological rhythms is detrimental to physical and mental
health. However, there are a few researchers who have argued the opposite point
of view, claiming that coordination of cyclical behavior between partners is an
indication that the social system is not functioning well. They argue that close
coordination is an indication of a lack of flexibility or spontaneity. The
results of this study will help to decide whether more rhythmically structured
social interactions have positive or negative consequences for the way
participants feel.
