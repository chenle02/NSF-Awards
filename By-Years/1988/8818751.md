This award to the Michigan Meteorological Resources Program (MMRP) at Michigan
State University will enhance instruction and research in the areas of
meteorology and climatology. Funds are provided for the acquisition of an
interactive meteorological computer system (UNIDATA/PC- McIDAS). This computer
system will provide hardware and software for the near-real-time display of
satellite images and conventional and diagnostic parameters. Contributions of
PC-McIDAS to instruction include providing students with experience in
interpreting satellite imagery and permitting classroom and laboratory
demonstrations of the relationships between upper-air features, surface
patterns, and cloud systems. Satellite images also will be archived for research
purposes. In particular, this archive will be used for further research
concerning the climate of Michigan.
