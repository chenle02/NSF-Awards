This grant is for continued investigation of the interaction between mixed
Hodge theory, 1-adic cohomology, rational homotopy, etale homotopy and the
topology of singularities of algebraic varieties. The theory of mixed Hodge
structures, recently developed by Deligne, is a powerful tool with potentially
far- reaching applications to singularities. Investigation will continue into
the consequences of the existence of a mixed Hodge structure on the rational
homotopy of links of the singular set of varieties. In particular, restrictions
will be put on the knot type of links. The purity of their cohomology will be
investigated, and an 1-adic minimal model will be found for them. It is
important to master powerful techniques for handling singularities, since
mathematical models of aspects of the real world are seldom smooth everywhere
but exhibit essential singularities.
