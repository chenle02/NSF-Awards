This Small Business Innovation Reseach Phase I project is addressed toward the
isolation of antibodies which demonstrate catalytic properties by encapsulating
cells in gel microdrops and analyzing using flow cytometry. Fluorescent products
will be retained within the agarose microsphere and cells of interest can be
recovered for cloning or gene analysis using fluorescent activated cell sorting.
Successful completion of Phase I studies will lead to development of a rapid,
automated method for isolating, analyzing and recovering cells producing
antibodies of interest. This novel technology can be adapted as a back end
screen for recombinant and chemical libraries currently used in a wide array of
applications. Catalytic antibodies can be used to produce a virtually
inexhaustible source of biocatalysts. The ability to generate specific proteases
would have a significant impact on biotechnology and medicine for use as
therapeutics as well as industrial enzymes. The total estimated worldwide market
for catalytic antibodies is estimated to be in excess of $ 1.0 billion.
