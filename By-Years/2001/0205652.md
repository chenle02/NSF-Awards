University of Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ITR: The Community Information
Technology Entrepreneurship Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loyola University has
been awarded an ITR grant to educate students and contribute to the economic
development of impoverished communities by means of collaborative projects with
small community businesses and not-for-profit organizations in Chicago and
surrounding areas that are heavily populated with groups that are under-
represented in science and technology. The project will build a technology
outreach program that brings together in a mentoring relationship, faculty,
students and community members to create an IT entrepreneurship program which
focuses on business software development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two academic goals
of the project are to enhance the computer science education and experience of
university students, and instill a sense of civic engagement in students and
faculty. The research design will use data gathering and analysis techniques to
measure outcomes related to these and other goals. The benefits to Loyola
students will include hands-on experience in helping to develop real world
software applications, as well as an understanding of the poor communities. The
benefits to the Austin community include the learning of IT skills, a sense of
entrepreneurship in IT and improvement in their environment coupled with
financial gains. &lt;br/&gt;
