Understanding magmatic processes requires detailed knowledge of the
thermodynamics and kinetics of crystallization and melting in silicate systems.
This research will focus on measuring the heat capacities of both simple model
silicate melts and of molten rocks. The enthalpies of fusion of important rock-
forming minerals will be determined. The calorimeter will be used to directly
measure enthalpy release in crystallizing basalts as a function of cooling rate,
and to relate this to observed crystal modes from quench experiments. This study
should greatly expand both the data base and the fundamental understanding of
the interrelationships among thermodynamic and kinetic factors during
crystallization.
