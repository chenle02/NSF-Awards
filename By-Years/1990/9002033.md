This research will develop new computational methods and software for
determining the conformation states and kinematic behavior of mobile molecules
by means of geometric reasoning. The resultant computer programs are expected to
be of value to researchers in many areas of structural chemistry and
biochemistry, including spectroscopists who wish to interpret their data in
terms of a precise molecular model, stereochemists who need to find all the
conformers consistent with a given bonding arrangement, and molecular biologists
attempting to predict protein and nucleic acid conformation. Because a wide
variety of information concerning the structure of molecules can be encoded in
terms of constraints on their interatomic distances, our first goal is to
improve our understanding of and ability to reason directly with these
constraints. The next goal is to devise more efficient and reliable methods of
finding atomic coordinates compatible with the constraints, and determining what
motions are consistent with them. The final goal is to develop a user-friendly,
window-oriented interface that enables one to visually prepare the input,
perform the computations, and analyze their results graphically.
