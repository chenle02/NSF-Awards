The technical feasibility of using a mixed-liquid-electrostatic-coalescence
method for the separation of micronized particles of differing surface
characteristics will be investigated. The proposed method uses emulsified water
as a getter selective to hydrophilic particles suspended along with hydrophobic
particles in organic liquids such as kerosene and fuel oil. In the
ElectroCoalesce process, the emulsion is broken electrostatically with the aid
of de-emulsifying agents, and the immiscible liquids and their associated
particulates are then separated by first coalescing the water-dydrophilic-
particulate pulp electrostatically and then removing the water droplets and
entrained particulates by differential settling. The application proposed is
different from any other electrostatic coalescence method studied to date in
that the hydrophobic particles remain suspended in the organic-liquid phase.
