An X-ray crystallographic system including and X-ray generator, an area
detector, and associated computing equipment will be acquired to support
research in biotechnology. A wide variety of projects in structural biology,
molecular biology, neurosciences, cellular biology, and biochemistry will be
enhanced by the new equipment. Among the projects to be supported are studies on
pea lectins and lectin mutants, as well as lectins from other species; trypsin
inhibitor complexes; flavoprotein dehydrogenases; complement factor; and smaller
organic molecules. A strong emphasis will be carbohydrate-binding protein
experiments. The new equipment will allow the molecular structure of these
macromolecules to be determined.
