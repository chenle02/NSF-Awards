This is a Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award. The PI
will use this award to learn new techniques in electrophysiology, particularly
voltage-clamp studies. She will apply this new technology to study the problem
of how polyspermy (second fertilization) is blocked in fucoid algae.
