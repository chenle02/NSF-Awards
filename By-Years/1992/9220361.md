The effectiveness of most protein hormones is monitored in part by the number of
cell surface receptors for these hormones. By internalizing the number of cell
surface receptors after binding hormone (down regulation), a cell can regulate
its sensitivity to that messenger. The insulin- insulin receptor complex is one
system that responds in this fashion. Any deviations in this self- monitoring
mechanism can have profound effects on the ability of the cell to respond to
these hormones, and this in turn can have great impact on cell function. The
goal of this proposal is to determine the roles that particular molecules,
notably membrane lipids, cytoskeletal proteins and phosphorylated membrane
proteins have on this process. The cell system used is the human erythrocyte. In
the lipid studies, the lipid content or fluidity will be altered, and the
effects on down regulation studied. In the cytoskeletal work, chemical and
antibody-induced changes, and pathologically -altered cytoskeletons will be
studied. Chemicals know to alter protein phosphorylation will be used to
determine the impact of this protein modification on down regulation. These
studies should lead to a clearer understanding of the role of these components
in this process.
