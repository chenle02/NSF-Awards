Three successful marine science curricula and teacher training packages, For
Sea, Mare, and Living in Water, developed by the Marine Science Center, the
Lawrence Hall of Science, and the National Aquarium in Baltimore, will be
refined and enhanced in preparation for the production of two, multimedia
compact discs (CD ROM). Advances in CD ROM technology coupled with increasing
accessibility to the technology, make the compact disc an effective tool for
curriculum development, utilization, and distribution. The compact disc will
contain all text and graphic images from the three curricular projects; and, a
comprehensive indexing system allowing materials to be utilized in a variety of
manners, including thematically and topically, to effect curriculum integration.
Training will be provided to an existing cadre of teacher trainers to maximize
the implementation of the new curriculum and CD ROM disc.
