Frank Morgan will continue his studies of the behavior and structure of
m-dimensional area minimizing surfaces. Soap films are the prototypical examples
of such surfaces. Much current work is directed towards the study of their
singularities. Singularities occur at points where there is no well defined
tangent plane. Work of Almgren has established upper bounds on the sizes of the
singularity sets, but so far little is known about their structure. In
particular they may even turn out to have fractional dimension. Morgan will
involve undergraduate students in these investigations and thereby expose them
to the excitement of modern mathematical research. They will be involved in
various computational and experimental aspects of the work. Morgan will be
joined by Colin Adams whose work is of a more topological nature. He will study
the cusp volumes of hyperbolic three dimensional manifolds. The techniques to be
employed by Morgan belong to geometric measure theory. This is an extremely
powerful theory which is accessible to relatively few mathematicians. Morgan
will use these methods to study the structure of singularity sets of m
dimensional area minimizing currents. In addition he will use calibrations to
find further examples of area minimizing surfaces. These are closed differential
forms which take extreme values on the tangent spaces of such surfaces. They
have recently been used to great effect in the study of submanifolds of
Grassmannians.
