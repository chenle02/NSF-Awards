Significant progress has been made during the past decade on identifying the
molecular components of the regulation of mammalian cell proliferation by
peptide growth factors and their cell surface receptors. Since this regulation
underlies many current problems in the reliable and reproducible design of cell
culture-based technologies, a translation of this progress into useful
quantitative engineering terms is crucial. Preliminary studies are proposed to
test the hypothesis that the mitogenic responsiveness of fibroblast cell lines
to epidermal growth factor (EGF) is related to the trafficking properties of the
EGF receptor. A variety of kinetic EGF binding and dissociation studies will be
performed in order to estimate values for various trafficking constants in a
mathematical model. These studies intend to determine whether any changes in
trafficking parameters are correlated to proliferation responses. If this is so,
a substantial research program along these lines will be motivated.
