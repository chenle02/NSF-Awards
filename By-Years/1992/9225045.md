This REU site award supports six undergraduate researchers working under the
supervision of the principal investigator. It continues a tradition of summer
research programs conducted every year (except one) since 1977 by the principal
investigator who often recruits former students to assist with the program. The
quality of the work is exceptionally high, Of the forty-four students who have
been through the programs, thirty-two have gone to graduate school, and twelve
have already earned the Ph.D. Thirty-two papers written in the program have
already been published, nine are in press and a dozen or more are under review
and in preparation. The principal research theme of the program is discrete
mathematics as reflected in problems from graph theory, combinatorics, finite
groups and coloring problems. Problems often build on work done in previous
programs, through correspondence with colleagues, and by searching journals.
Each student is given an individual problem and a write-up at the end of the
program is required. Students are encouraged to present their work at various
professional meetings.
