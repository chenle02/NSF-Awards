This project is a component of the Tropical Instability Wave Experiment (TIWE).
The P.I.'s, in collaboration with the TIWE investigators will deploy several
clusters of satellite-tracked drifters in northward-flowing filaments of water
that are frequently observed as part of the field of instability waves. Ship-
board surveys, measuring subsurface velocity, temperature, salinity, and surface
heat flux will also be carried out while following the drifters, in order to
investigate local dynamics and thermodynamics of the filaments.
