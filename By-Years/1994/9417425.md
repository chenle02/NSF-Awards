In this research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, Professor Arthur Hubbard and his students at the University of
Cincinnati will measure the detailed angular distributions of emitted Auger
electrons for a variety of well characterized surfaces with atomic and molecular
overlayers. These angular distributions will be carefully compared with the
distributions predicted based on competing models of the electron emission
process, in order to develop a method for extracting surface structural
information from the angular distributions. Surface structural information for
overlayers on electrode surfaces will enable a detailed understanding of the
electrochemistry occurring at these interdaces. Electrochemistry is important in
an enormous number of technological applications, ranging from sensors to
batteries. In order to understand the chemistry which occurs at the electrode
surface in these wide ranging electrochemical applications, one must know the
structure of the electrode and any atomic or molecular overlayers associated
with it. This research project is designed to develop a method for structural
analysis of these overlayers based on the measurement of the angular
distribution of electrons emitted from these surfaces.
