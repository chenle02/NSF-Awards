The limited host range (LHR) biovar strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens form
tumors on grapevine but on virtually no other plants. Wide host range strains
(WHR) fail to induce tumors on grapevine, but often induce necrosis at the site
of inoculation. We hope to understand the molecular basis of these several
different interactions of LHR and WHR Agrobacterium strains with grapevines as a
model system for plant microbe interactions. These studies build on the physical
and functional divergence of the VirA protein in each strain and the critical
role this protein plays in plant signal transduction and plant cell
transformation. To distinguish transformation from tumor formation, the
biological assays for plant cell transformation will be performed using a binary
vector system carrying a B-glucuronidase gene behind a 35A CaMV promoter. To
demonstrate the significance of the four domains of VirA with host range, we
will exchange domains between WHR and LHR strains and observe the biological
consequences. We will isolate and identify compounds in grapevines that induce
vir genes in LHR and WHR strains and determine their sites of interaction with
the VirA protein. The locus responsible for inducing the necrotic response in
grapevines will be identified by mutant analysis of T-DNA.
