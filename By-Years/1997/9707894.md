Support for Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference On
September 19-21, 1997, the second Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing
Conference is being held at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, California. The
meeting is a technical conference presenting talks by successful women in the
computing field, short technical presentations by a range of conference
participants, as well as panels, workshops, and birds-of-a-feather sessions.
This grant provides travel costs and registration expenses for approximately
eighty people in computing and related fields who otherwise would be unlikely to
attend. The awards are made to selected advanced undergraduates, graduate
students, and people early in their processional careers. Cost sharing by the
institutions represented covers part of the costs for a large majority of the
participants.
