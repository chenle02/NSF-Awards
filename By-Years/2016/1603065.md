This projects aims to better constrain the seasonal behavior of Indo-Asian
monsoon rainfall and related atmospheric dynamics (e.g. the jet stream) during
climate transitions at the end of both the last and penultimate ice ages. The
researchers will use recently developed methods for ion microprobe analysis to
measure oxygen isotope ratios (delta18-Oxygen) recorded in the calcite mineral
structure of speleothems at seasonal resolution. The speleothem delta18-Oxygen
values record changes in past rainfall amount, source, and seasonality that are
preserved as the speleothem grows, generating a record of past rainfall changes
that can span tens to hundreds of thousands of years. Studies of past changes in
precipitation are important because they potentially provide valuable insight on
the fundamental controls and potential response of rainfall during climate
transitions.

The research team will analyze speleothems from Yemen and Israel to complement
seasonal-resolution analyses from northeastern China. These samples represent a
component of atmospheric circulation over Asia, each with an important seasonal
component: the Westerlies (Israel), Indian Monsoon (Yemen), and East Asian
Monsoon (China). Additionally, the team will to use global climate model
simulations (i.e., Community Climate System Model version 3, TraCE-21K Community
Atmosphere Model version 3) of rainfall delta18-Oxygen to assess the level of
coherence between modeled and observed seasonal rainfall patterns across Asia
during key climatic periods that followed the last two ice ages. The team will
model a suite of seven diagnostic time-slices from these two periods when large
changes in monsoon rainfall, including during a warming event ~11,500 years ago
when an abrupt decadal-scale change may have occurred.

The Broader Impacts involve supporting two early career scientists in research
that could help improve the understanding of the timing and monsoonal rainfall.
The Impacts also include participating in outreach programs with the UW-Madison
Geology Museum.
