9312634 Labes In this project, two themes of importance to current liquid
crystal research are chosen for intensive study. The first is to understand how
the macroscopic periodic structures which develop during reorientation of liquid
crystals affect their properties. The fundamental study of the dynamics of
formation and relaxation of a liquid crystal polymer film will continue.
Annealing the resulting solid films with and without tension and/or orienting
fields being applied will be investigated. Both main chain and side chain liquid
crystal polymers will be examined. Utilizing optical probes, the fluctuations in
the orientational ordering and light scattering in these films under various
processing conditions will be studied. The second theme involves the utilization
of low molecular weight nematic or cholesteric liquid crystals as reaction
media. The investigations set the stage for attempts at chiral synthesis in
cholesteric media, for a mechanistic understanding of the reactivity control at
phase transitions, and for a systematic exploration of the range of utility of
liquid crystals as solvent media. ***
