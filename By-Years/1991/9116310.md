Tissue Engineering is a new discipline that has as its goal the reconstitution
of tissues and organs for use as model systems in basic and applied research as
well as for use as grafts to replace damaged of diseased body parts or body
functions. The tissues and organs built ex vivo may consist of living cells
combined with extracellular molecules, or of acellular structures designed to be
remodeled in vivo. It is perceived that the products of Tissue Engineering must
be standardized and quality-controlled. Regulatory issues related to their
manufacture and use need to be formulated and resolved. Tissue Engineering is a
nascent science and technology that draws support from many fields, including
cell culture, extracellular matrix biochemistry, cell and developmental biology,
immunology and biomechanics. Shaping Tissue Engineering through the synthesis of
the sub-disciplines on which it depends is one of the objectives of this
Conference, which is organized around challenge topics that attempt to highlight
the roles of the sub-disciplines. Tissue Engineering has the potential of
accelerating the application of discoveries made in basic research to useful
products for both the laboratory and the clinic. How this potential is realized
is in large part the focus of this Conference.
