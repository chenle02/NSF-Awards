The problem of determining properties of an unknown function by evaluating it
at scattered points arises in many different contexts. If the function is
arbitrary, it may be necessary to evaluate the function at all points in its
domain; however, when the function is well-behaved, it is often possible to
determine global information with relatively few probes (evaluations). The
determination of zero of a monotonic function is a classic example of this
problem; other examples include finding the extremum of a unimodal function, the
game of Battleship, and geometric probing in which one wants to find various
shape parameters of an object by probing it at the fewest possible points. This
research applies an approach, based on Kraft's inequality, to such discrete
search problems. Using generalization of Kraft's inequality to prove lower
bounds are applicable to problems in which an algorithm for the problem can be
mapped to a computation tree; Kraft's inequality then captures the minimum
``degree of imbalance'' that must be present in any computation tree solving the
problem.
