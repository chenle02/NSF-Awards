The primary goal of this research is the study of the invariants for a class of
torsion-free Abelian groups of finite rank known as the Butler groups. The
invariants are to be examined concurrently in the context of representations of
finite partially ordered sets. A study of Coxeter correspondences and almost
split sequences is included in the project with the aim of expanding the menu of
potentially classifiable groups and representations. The research is in the
general area of algebra and is concerned with the structure theory of infinite
groups having a commutative multiplicative structure - the Abelian groups. These
groups arise in a variety of settings in algebra, geometry, and analysis. This
research concerns the classification of invariants for selected families of
these Abelian groups in anticipation of obtaining a general structure theory.
