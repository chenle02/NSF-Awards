The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves large
scale asset tagging -- to monitor and track an organization's physical assets.
Potential areas that could be impacted include distribution centers,
manufacturing and assembly facilities, ports, and vehicle fleets. This project
enables geo-location information to be collected about assets, providing
opportunities for data analysis and productivity and movement optimization. A
focus on these and other applications will result in faster shipping times,
lower fuel consumption, and increased traceability of products. At ports, for
example, a specific impact of the project may include tracking of intermodal
chassis (i.e., the wheeled frames used for moving shipping containers),
addressing classic problems such as chassis shortages and chassis storage
dilemmas, thus enabling faster product movement and shipping times.
Additionally, tracking intermodal containers at ports may present opportunities
to dimension, in 3-D, entire collections of stacked containers as well as those
placed adjacent to each other. As a result, intermodal container search-time is
decreased enabling higher container throughput at the
port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Project utilizes a novel configuration
of low-cost communications technologies, including Bluetooth, GPS, and cellular
modules, to support rapid and cost-effective asset tracking coupled with
software utilizing complex algorithms. The combination of these technologies
yields real-time direct results including rapid deployment response with a
simple user interface. Competing systems often require facility-wide, permanent
infrastructure to support deployment that can result in lengthy installation
times coupled with very high operating costs. The system developed for this
I-Corps project significantly reduces the amount of infrastructure necessary and
can be installed in less than one day for any size facility.
