Many interesting optimization problems are nonsmooth, i.e. either the function
to be optimized or an associated constraint is not differentiable on some part
of its domain. The main goal of this project is the design of efficient
algorithms for some important classes of nonsmooth optimization problems. This
is possible only by taking full advantage of the structure which is present.
Because of the lack of smoothness, standard algorithms are not applicable. The
investigation primarily addresses three issues. The first is the optimization of
eigenvalues of symmetric matrices which depend on parameters. Typically,
solutions involve multiple eigenvalues which are not smooth functions of the
matrix elements. Applications of interest include the optimal design of columns
and plates against buckling. The second major issue is the design of methods for
a broad problem class: convex composite optimization. By appropriate
parameterization of the generalized gradient set it is hoped to obtain efficient
methods with superlinear convergence. The third issue concerns non-Lipschitz
optimization problems involving eigenvalues of nonsymmetric matrices. For
example, an important application arising in the stability of control systems is
to minimize the spectral radius of a matrix.
