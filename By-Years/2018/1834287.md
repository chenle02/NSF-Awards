There is an established need for highly qualified K-12 science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers, especially in high-need schools.
It can be particularly challenging to recruit middle grades STEM teachers who
have a strong content background in a specific STEM discipline. With funding
from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program,
the Preparing and Mentoring Middle Grades STEM Educators to Teach in High-Need
South Carolina School Districts project is recruiting career changers from STEM
fields and preparing them to become middle grades STEM teachers. The project is
funding 40 scholarships over 4 years. In this project, Clemson University is
collaborating with Greenville County Public Schools. Recipients will be enrolled
in a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program that includes initial teacher
certification for Middle Grades Education. The Noyce Scholarships will expand
opportunities for STEM career changers to complete the MAT program and hence
also expand the number of middle grades STEM teachers in the
state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the impact of the Noyce
Program by analyzing 16 years of data from the Clemson MAT in middle grades
program, which has enrolled more than 250 individuals, 86 of whom have been or
will be Noyce Scholars. Research questions include: (1) How do teacher efficacy
and other personal characteristic affect teacher retention and success among
STEM instructors? (2) Do STEM career changers possess different characteristics
than STEM majors who come directly out of undergraduate majors? (3) How does the
performance of the students of Noyce Scholars and non-Noyce-Scholars compare?
(4) How does the performance of the students of STEM majors and non-STEM majors
compare? The goal is to identify characteristics of successful STEM teachers and
to determine the extent to which a STEM background strengthens the impact of a
middle grades teacher.
