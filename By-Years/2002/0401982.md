0401982 Shen Drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of cancer.
Forms of resistance effectively reduce the cell drug concentration by mechanisms
such as slowing drug uptake, ejecting drugs out of the cells by P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) pumps, and bio-transforming. Thus, conventional dosages have low
therapeutic efficacy, are very toxic and cause various side effects.

Nanoparticles are ideal drug carriers because of their subcellular sizes,
stability, and ability to evade the reticulo-endothelial systems. However,
currently developed nanoparticles for cancer treatment generally have issues of
premature drug burst release in the blood stream, but slow drug release and slow
cellular uptake in cancer tissues. Coupled with drug resistance, these issues
cause low drug concentration in the cancer cells and low therapeutic efficacy.

The goal of this project is to design, synthesize, characterize and in vitro and
in vivo evaluate nanoparticles that can overcome cancer drug resistance for
effective chemotherapy. The hypothesis is that a fast release of a large amount
of drugs inside the cancer cell cytoplasm would overwhelm P-gp pumps and other
forms of drug resistance and thus build up a cell drug concentration higher than
the cell killing threshold.

To test this hypothesis, the investigators will use nanoparticles with no
premature drug release as the drug-carrier, exploit the leaky nature of cancer
capillary to have the nanoparticles preferentially trapped in cancer tissues,
use electrostatic-interaction based adsorptive cellular uptake for efficient
cell-internalization of the nanoparticles and use the lysosomal pH to trigger
the rapid release of the drugs.

This multidisciplinary research effort combines the elements of polymer
synthesis and characterization, nanoscience, biomedical engineering,
thermodynamics, and self-assembly. Results obtained may provide an effective new
cancer therapeutic strategy for the war with cancer. Selected topics on
biomedical applications of polymers and nanoparticles would be developed for a
variety of courses.
