"Mitigation of Extreme Event Risks: The Case of Electric
Power"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Risk management in the electric power industry has
been greatly complicated by the advent of deregulation, increasing competition,
and threats of terrorism. Electric power failures in a disaster have the
potential to generate regional catastrophes through cascading effects on other
critical infrastructure systems such as telecommunications, water,
transportation, and hospitals. The objectives of this study are to investigate
the potential for these cascading impacts and to identify promising mitigation
strategies to contain them. The research will involve three closely linked
tasks: development of influence diagrams, fragility curves, and other measures
of cascading effects; development of disaster scenarios that set these effects
within the context of specific hazards; and identification of promising
mitigation strategies through an expert-based ranking exercise. The hazards to
be addressed include earthquake and severe winter storm, as well as flood,
drought, and terrorism. The study focuses on the Pacific Northwest. &lt;br/&gt;
This study attempts to broaden risk management frameworks by investigating the
interaction effects of multiple infrastructure systems, adopting a multi-hazard
perspective, and bringing together expertise in engineering and the social
sciences. Through training and course content, the project will expose students
to multidisciplinary research. The study will also forge a new research
partnership between U.S. and Canadian research institutions. Benefits of the
research include mitigation strategies for addressing the potentially
catastrophic effects of electric power disruption in natural and human-induced
disasters. &lt;br/&gt;
