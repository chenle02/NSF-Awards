This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Estimating
global microbial diversity: A bioinformatics approach." Scaling law, probability
and combinatorial theory are being used to quantify biodiversity patterns across
a wide range of spatial scales and at different levels of phylogenetic
resolution. Using computer intensive spatial statistical analyses and simulation
modeling, hypotheses are being tested with a microbial genetic database two
orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported (~73,000 16S rDNA clones
collected over ~ 1 m2 to ~10,000 km2 in Australia, analyzed by RFLP and other
sophisticated genetic techniques).
