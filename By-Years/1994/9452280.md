9452280 Jardim The biology curriculum at a community college is significantly
strengthened through attention to biotechnology. Students investigate biological
phenomena at the molecular level via performing a series of "hands-on"
innovative laboratory experiments, including the following: cloning with pAMP
and pKAN fragments; amplifying of DNA by PCR; and electrophoresis and
spectrophotometric analysis of DNA. More than 600 majors and non-majors
enrolling in four different courses-General Biology, Introduction to the Science
of Living Organisms, Genetics Laboratory, and Introduction to Human Physiology--
are enriched by this project each year.
