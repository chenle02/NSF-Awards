This project will support the establishment of a statistical teaching
laboratory. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of supporting projects to develop
new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in science,
mathematics, or engineering. The Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
Program provides matching support for the instrumentation necessary to implement
undergraduate instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and universities. In
particular, the main objective of this project is to enhance the teaching of
statistics to undergraduate engineering students. The statistical teaching
laboratory will be configured so that demonstrations of simulations and
statistical engineering principles can be brought to students and so that
students can use the laboratory to perform exercises, simulations, and otherwise
interact with computer programs designed to demonstrate statistical concepts.
The primary courses to be affected are introductory engineering statistics,
introductory probability and statistics, and statistics for quality and
productivity improvement.
