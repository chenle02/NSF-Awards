Although astrocytes constitute the major cell type in the mammalian central
nervous system (CNS), their functional properties in maintaining homeostatis
during neuronal activity have been reconsidered, with the ability to prepare
homogeneous cell cultures. Using these cultures, recent studies indicate that
this previously considered electrically silent cell possesses voltage-sensitive
channels for sodium, calcium, potassium and chloride. Voltage-sensitive channels
meditate changes in membrane permeability to selected ions in response to a
change in membrane voltage. This project deals specifically with types of
voltage-gated sodium channels in astrocytes. In electrically excitable tissue,
two distinct types of sodium channels have been found. These types of voltage-
gated channels have separate binding sites for saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin. Rat
brain astrocytes also have these types of sodium channels. They are present in
differing proportions at early and late stages of astrocyte maturity. Using
neurotoxin-activated 22Na+ flux, intracellular and whole-cell recording
techniques and toxin binding methods, physiological and pharmacological
properties of both types of astrocyte sodium channels will be compared to
properties in excitable membranes; the density of sodium channels will be
discovered at different stages of morphological differentiation; electrical
excitability will be determined in early and late astrocyte cultures; and
factors that trigger or retard the expression of toxin-insensitive channels and
toxin-sensitive channels will be explored. In addition, an astrocyte membrane
preparation will be incorporated into planar lipid bilayers in order to study
the biophysical characteristics of single toxin-insensitive and toxin-sensitive
sodium channels and to compare their properties with those from electrically
excitable tissue. The results of this proposal should provide a new basis for
understanding some of the complex interactions between neurons and glia and
whether astrocyte sodium channels are similar to those in nerve and muscle.
