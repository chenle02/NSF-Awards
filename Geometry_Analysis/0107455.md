Abstract

Award: DMS-0107455 Principal Investigator: Mikhail Lyubich

The International Conference on Graphs and Patterns in Mathematics and
Theoretical Physics at SUNY Stone Brook in 2001 will bring together researchers
in several branches of mathematics and theoretical physics in which graphs play
a central role, hoping to encourage fruitful interactions between these fields.
This conference is a celebration of Dennis Sullivan's sixtieth birthday and
addresses some of the topics of recent interest to Sullivan. Themes to be
emphasized include (1) graphs and algebra, (2) graphs and discrete Riemannian
geometry and discrete gauge theory, (3) graphs and bifurcation patterns in
dynamical systems, (4) graphs and quantum field theory and topology. Minicourses
on conference topics will be pointed towards graduate students and junior
researchers.

A graph in the sense used in the title of this conference is a data structure
consisting of some number of "vertices," usually drawn as dots, joined by
"edges," usually drawn as curves beginning at one vertex and ending at another.
This kind of graph is a common combinatorial structure, encountered every day in
problems of transportation and scheduling (consider a network of roads or
telephone lines, for example), but useful in many less obvious ways. Some of the
recent uses of graphs in geometry and physical theory grow out of Richard
Feynman's celebrated idea of describing parts of quantum theory with graphs that
represent possible lifetimes for a particle in space-time. Feynman's notion that
a quantum theoretic quantity may represent a sum over all possible histories is
reduced from a large, continuous calculation to a summation indexed by the
different possible Feynman graphs. In a similar manner, modern geometers and
physicists are exploring ways to work with the very large collections of all
possible geometric structures on a particular space by reducing to manipulations
of a family of graphs.
