9730518 Knio The project is for numerical and theoretical study of the role of
gravity waves in the long-time evolution of the global oceanic circulation. The
model used is SEOM developed at Rutgers University, and an multiple-pressure-
variable approach will be implemented. It would lead to an order-of-magnitude
enhancement in the efficiency of SEOM, thus allowing extended high-resolution
ocean simulations that include adequate representation of free-surface
phenomena. The model will first be used for two-dimensional simulations of tidal
circulation in the global ocean. After the model is optimized, extended three-
dimensional simulations of the global wind-driven circulation will be performed.
