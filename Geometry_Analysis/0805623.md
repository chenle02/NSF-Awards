Abstract

In a series of papers, the PI and her collaborators started the systematic study
of valuations or finitely additive measures within affine geometric analysis. In
Euclidean geometry, the concept of valuation has long been known to be of
fundamental importance. A landmark result was Hadwiger's classification of rigid
motion invariant, continuous valuations on convex bodies in 1950. However,
classical affine surface area and centro-affine surface area are not continuous
and therefore not characterized by Hadwiger's theorem. In joint papers, the PI
and M. Reitzner obtained a classification of affine invariant, upper
semicontinuous valuations and established the first characterization of affine
surface area and centro-affine surface area. The main goal of the proposed
research is to complete the classification of affine valuations and use the
results and techniques developed for this classification to solve fundamental
problems in affine geometric analysis.

The proposal is centered on fundamental open questions in affine geometric
analysis. The basic objects are functions and operators in ordinary Euclidean
space that are invariant or covariant under linear transformations. Within the
last few years, a substantial amount of research was devoted to investigate in
depth the relations between these functions and operators. There are numerous
applications of these results and the proposed research to the asymptotic theory
of Banach spaces, differential geometry, ordinary and partial differential
equations, and even to seemingly unrelated fields like geometric tomography,
image processing and information theory.
