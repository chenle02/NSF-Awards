ABSTRACT 0301666 JOHN J. WILD ELLEN L. WILD

It is proposed to finalize development, construction, testing and evaluation of
the tentative prototype of a novel system for mapping from the surface ectopic
foci within pleomorphic soft tissues. The research will produce an entirely
distinctive approach to scanning, detecting, and characterizing the presence of
abnormal foci in soft tissues. The proposed system is expected to provide far
more accurate, numerical, objective characterization of soft cellular tissues as
compared to that of extant leading technologies.
