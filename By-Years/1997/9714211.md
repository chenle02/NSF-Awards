There are three objectives for this workshop, the most important of which is the
articulation of emerging interdisciplinary research domains, called
organizational informatics and social informatics, that focus on the social
dimensions of the integration of computerization and networked information into
social and organizational life, including the roles of information technologies
in social and organizational change. Organizational informatics is viewed as a
subarea of social informatics. Findings and theories belong to organizational
informatics when they can be characterized in terms of the participants of
organizations. Using this criterion scholarOs and researchers understandings of
the adoption, use, and impacts of groupware fall well within organizational
informatics. In contrast, the Internet is used by millions of people outside of
their worklives, and the character and consequences of the public's use of the
Internet is a topic outside of organizational informatics, but within social
informatics.
