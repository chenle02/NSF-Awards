Microarthropods influence rates of soil organic matter decomposition and
nutrient release in forest ecosystems. Their most important effects are assumed
to occur through interactions with the microflora. Although microarthropods
generally increase decomposition rates of litter, their effects on nutrient
fluxes in the forest floor have not been well documented. This is especially
true for nitrogen, which is often immobilized in decaying litter during the
initial stages of decomposition. This one-year project will test and develop the
methods for the long range study and will focus on: 1) identifying and
quantifying potential non-target effects of naphthalene using both field and
laboratory approaches, 2) completing a one-year field study of the effects of
microarthropod exclusion on litter decomposition rates, the microbial decomposer
community, and nitrogen dynamics in litter and soil pools, and 3) using 15N in
conjunction with the litterbasket technique to quantify the effects of
microarthropod exclusion on immobilization and movement through the forest floor
profile of exogenous sources of nitrogen. Experiments will also be completed on
the 15N labeling of litter for use in long-term studies of decomposition and
nitrogen mineralization. //
