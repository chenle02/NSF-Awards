This project permits undergraduate students to carry on experiments and
individual research projects with an upflow pack-bed bioreactor. The pilot unit
in this lab is used in conjunction with mutant bacteria cultures to study the
effectiveness and kinetics of the aerobic fixed- film, submerged bed process in
treating industrial and/or toxic wastewaters. The instruments funded with this
award are necessary for monitoring the various parameters of the process and for
analyzing various quality parameters in the raw and treated waste. The
laboratory equipment includes: TOC Analyzer with accessories; TOD Analyzer with
accessories; dissolved oxygen meters; COD test systems, BOD standard test units;
spectrometer; binocular microscope; muffle furnace; glass still; total suspended
solids analyzer; turbidimeter; balance; temperature logger; aspirator pump; and,
other accessories. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
