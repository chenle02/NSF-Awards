Recent studies in medicine, economics and engineering have demonstrated that
fuzzy set theory may indeed by a useful tool for the expression of professional
judgement. Studies in structural engineering have been on damage assessment due
to fatigue, and seismic loads. This research will emphasize the reliability and
safety of existing (including newly constructed) plane frame structures.
Classical reliability analysis will be used first to calculate the structure's
reliability measure using objective information such as yield strength of
materials, geometry of structures and applied loads. The reliability measure
will then be updated utilizing the fuzzy set logic to include the quality of
connections and structural members through inspections. Other parameters
pertinent to the overall safety of a structure will also be investigated. An
algorithm for updating the objective reliability will be presented. The
significance of incorporating the subjective information in reliability analyses
will be discussed. The results of this proposed study are expected to provide a
more precise assessment on the safety of structures. These results are expected
to enhance the engineers or owners' decision-making process in determining
appropriate action to the structure such as maintenance, and rehabilitation,
etc.
