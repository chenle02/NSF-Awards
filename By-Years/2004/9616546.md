Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies: An Automated Reading Assistant
That Listens Carnegie Mellon University will build a prototype to serve as a
testbed for experimental in-school use by students and teachers. The
investigator will advance, adapt, and integrate methods from speech recognition,
computational linguistics, cognitive and motivational psychology, machine
learning, human computer interaction, and education. Expected outcomes include
implemented, evaluated methods to analyze oral reading, provide cognitively and
motivationally effective response, and author interactive reading experiences.
