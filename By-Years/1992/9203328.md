Cold air cyclones are intense cyclonic storms that form on the cold air side of
polar fronts and do not fit the classical mold of extratropical cyclones. The
Principal Investigator will study the formation and structure of these storms
using both observational and numerical modeling studies. The Investigator has
carefully chosen four specific cases for investigation. These cases represent a
wide range of cold air cyclone characteristics and results will provide insight
into the different formation mechanisms and forcing function. Specific research
objectives include: examining the dynamical and physical distinctions between
different types of cold air cyclogenesis; delineating the roles played by
baroclinic and diabatic processes; detailing evolving structures of each case;
contrasting the characteristics of cold air cyclones to classical extratropical
cyclones.
