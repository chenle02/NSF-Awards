The objective of this doctoral dissertation research is to use faunal remains
from archaeological sites on Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, NWT, Canada, to
analyze the cultural contacts between European and Inuit populations. The study
will focus on three aspects of the archaeological record: (1) systematic
examination of animal bones from Inuit sites representing different phases of
European contact; (2) an analysis of changing Inuit settlement patterns; (3)
differences in butchery patterns relating to the intoduction of metal trade
goods. It is proposed that this study will also shed light on human-animal
relations and climate change.
