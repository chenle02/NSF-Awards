9309280 Garverick The general objective of the proposed research project is to
develop closed-loop control electronics for electrostatic micromotors which
improves motor performance and enables the development of microelectromechanical
systems with increased sophistication. Two modes of operation will be supported
by the electronics: 1) continuous rotation, needed for devices such as pumps,
and 2) discrete stepping, such as required in switching applications. The
control electronics will be designed to obtain approximately smooth, continuous
rotation with maximum average torque, independent of motor loading (gaseous or
liquid medium). Both salient-pole and wobble micromotors will be investigated.
