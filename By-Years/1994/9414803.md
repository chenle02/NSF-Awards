*** 9414803 Barth West Chester University of Pennsylvania is the recipient of
ARI funds for the renovation of research space on the second floor of the
science center to create an interdisciplinary Material Research Center (MRC).
This project will enable six faculty members to consolidate and enhance the
focus of their materials research and training activities. Research is presently
conducted in cramped locations dispersed throughout the Chemistry department.
Laboratories are subjected to dust, flooding, and lack adequate temperature and
humidity control, creating an unsafe working environment. Utilities systems such
as the HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection will be upgraded and
installed to meet current codes. Once renovations are completed, the MRC will
consists of six faculty/student research laboratories surrounding two centrally
located service laboratories that will contain spaces for instrumentation,
sample preparation, thermal treatment, and glass blowing, and equipment
fabrications. The centralization of research activities, and the provision for
shared spaces, will promote better interaction among faculty and students
involved in materials research, and provide a more concerted interdisciplinary
approach to the study of materials science. Efficient and improved space will
provide students with more research opportunities and will enhance the
productivity of faculty.***
