ABSTRACT

PI: Krzysztof M. Jarosz Proposal: DMS-0135219 Institution: Southern Illinois
University at Edwardsville



This proposal requests funding for a Fourth Conference on Function Spaces
featuring several internationally known leaders in the field as principal
speakers. This conference has a long an successful history and it is expected
that it will attract a fair number of graduate students and young researchers
form all of the US. Most of the award funds will be used to enable them to
attend the Symposium. We are confident that the event will once again be of
significant benefit to a broad mathematical community and enthusiastically
recommend the award.
