The amino acids threonine and methionine are not only essential protein
building blocks, but also serve as precursors for other important plant
metabolites. Although the basic biochemical pathways for the synthesis of
methionine and threonine in plants have been identified, relatively little is
known about the catabolism of these amino acids and their partitioning into
downstream metabolic networks. Work on Arabidopsis lines with increased seed
threonine and methionine levels identified two mutations that are the subject of
ongoing research. One of the mutations is in threonine aldolase, a threonine
catabolic enzyme that has not been previously studied in plants. Further
research will accomplish the following goals: 1. The biochemical characteristics
of Arabidopsis threonine aldolase, the role of this enzyme in plant amino acid
metabolism, and the effects of mutations in the Arabidopsis threonine aldolase
genes will be investigated; and 2. A second mutation causing ten-fold increases
in seed methionine and threonine will be characterized, and the function of this
gene in plant amino acid metabolism will be determined.&lt;br/&gt; Broader
Impact: Methionine and threonine are two of the essential amino acids that
cannot be synthesized by humans and other animals. Many crop plants, in
particular legumes, have sub-optimal levels of methionine or threonine for the
mammalian diet. Therefore, there is interest in discovering new plant genes that
can be employed to raise levels of these amino acids in crops through
biotechnology or plant breeding. The project will also provide research
opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. An
established summer internship program will be used to recruit students,
including underrepresented minorities, from local high schools and from colleges
throughout the USA. These students will be trained in the most modern techniques
of metabolic biochemistry and molecular genetics to prepare them for future
careers in industry or academics. &lt;br/&gt;
