Ultracold atoms are excellent probes with which to make precise measurements.
Because ultracold atoms are very slow (with temperature now reaching a few
billionths of a degree above absolute zero), they are very sensitive to weak
interactions. During the past few years, major progress in the manipulation of
atoms and ions (i.e. atoms that lost or gained extra electrons) has led to a
revolution in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) Physics, with discoveries of
new phases on matter, and application ranging from more precise clocks to
quantum computing and cryptography. This research program initiates a new effort
in our understanding and, ultimately, control of the interaction between
ultracold atoms and ions. For example, one aim of this research is to manipulate
individual particles so that an electron jumps (or not) at will between an ion
and a neutral atoms. This level of control depends on a precise understanding of
the minute interactions between particles, and with their environment (such as
magnetic fields), and will impact research for more precise time-standards, and
our ability to engineer setups mimicking very complex systems, such as quantum
diffusion or superconductivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is always
difficult to "predict" the broader impact of any research program, a better
understanding of ultracold systems containing a few charged particles will
impact not only the development of new frequency standards and quantum
information processing, but also many aspects relevant to other fields in
science (the application of the results will be relevant to plasma physics,
condensed matter physics, chemical physics, information science, etc.). In
addition, this activity will promote teaching and training at all levels, from
K-12 to the graduate level, and thus help in our goal of maintaining a highly
trained workforce for the future.
