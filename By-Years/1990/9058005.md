Area of proposed research is in the design of composite columns, where there
remain fundamental questions regarding behavior and detailing, particularly for
slender columns and those with high strength concrete. Another potential topic
involves the design and behavior of steel or composite frames with concrete,
masonry, or composite infill walls. This would involve research related to the
behavior of both individual wall elements, and entire structural systems. There
are also outstanding questions stemming from Principal Investigator's previous
research on composite beam-column connections. In particular, additional joint
configurations should be studied to develop a unified set of design guidelines
having more general applicability. Finally, for these and other areas of
composite construction, the applicability and requirements for seismic design
need to be established, particularly with regard to special detailing
considerations.
