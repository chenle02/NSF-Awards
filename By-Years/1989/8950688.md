It is the aim of this project to upgrade an existing facility used o determine
flow velocities in a laboratory experiment associated with a fluid mechanics
course. The facility currently uses a single-channel laser-doppler velocimeter
(LDV), which limits measurements to one dimension. Flow systems of engineering
interest are rarely one dimensional. This facility is upgraded to a double-base
system which can measure two components of flow velocity simultaneously.
Experiments to be performed illustrate more completely the concepts of fluid
mechanics taught in the course and train the students in the theory and use of a
state-of- the-art instrument. Laser-doppler velocimetry has made possible the
measurement of flow velocities with much greater accuracy and precision than was
possible previously. In addition, it is a non-invasive technique not strongly
dependent upon the properties and composition of the flow medium and can be used
over a velocity range of more than six orders of magnitude. Because of these
reasons, it is widely used to measure flow conditions in wind tunnels, narrow
passages, rotating machinery, combustion systems, flames, and plasmas.
