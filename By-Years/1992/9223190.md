The Physical Chemistry Structure and Reactivity Program of the Chemistry
Division is supporting research at Brigham Young University under the
supervision of Professors Izatt and Oscarson on the calorimetric study of
chemical reactions in the water critical region. The work involves measurements
of heats of reaction and dilution, with associated density measurements, for ion
association of alkali and alkaline earth hydroxides and chlorides in near-
critical water solutions. Changes in the standard thermodynamic variables, free
energy, enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity are being evaluated. %%% The
chemical properties of solutions of simple salts and bases are very different at
high temperatures and pressures than under ordinary conditions. Izatt and
Oscarson are engaged in thermodynamic measurements of such solutions to permit
prediction of equilibria of importance in such applications as supercritical
water oxidation of chemical wastes, geothermal wells, and steam generation.
