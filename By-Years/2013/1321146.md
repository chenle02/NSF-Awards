The goal of this project is to determine how turn-taking in human-human dialogue
works, and use this as a basis for developing a flexible model of turn-taking
for use in spoken dialogue systems. The first two aims focus on determining
whether turn-taking is solely determined by the current speaker or is negotiated
by both conversants. The first aim measures how well human subjects, listening
to excerpts of speech, can predict whether the current speaker will continue the
turn or release it. The second aim analyzes timing lags at turn transitions.
Many turn transitions have short lags, which favors a speaker-control model;
however this might be an artifact of common speech act sequences, back channels,
early onsets, and provisional turns. The third aim, using the findings of the
first two aims, is to determine the cues and mechanisms that are used by
conversants in taking the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better understanding of
turn-taking in human-human dialogues is important as it will help in building
more efficient and natural spoken dialogue systems, allowing the user and system
to better collaborate to solve complex tasks. It should also allow spoken
dialogue systems to deal with a broad range of users, from experts to novices:
for experts, letting them take the initiative (and the turn), in order to
efficiently complete the task, while guiding novices with more directions and
examples. Furthermore, understanding human-human turn-taking might have
biomedical applications. For example, Autism, which is a disorder that affects
social communication, might impact how people engage in turn-taking, and so
turn-taking biomarkers might help in diagnosing it.
