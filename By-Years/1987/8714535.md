This award provides partial support for the cooperatively organized Third Pan
American Symposium on "Perspectives for Pan American Collaboration in
Experimental Physics" to be held in Rio de Janeiro in October, 1987. The
Symposium is being organized by Dr. Leon M. Lederman of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in cooperation with Dr. Alberto P.S. Santoro of the
Laboratory of High Energy Experimental Physics of the Brazilian Center for
Physics Research, Rio de Janeiro. During the Symposium a review of the status of
high energy particle physics and a survey of other physics fields will be
presented. The aims of the Symposium are to increase Latin American
participation in high energy physics and in its associated technology and to
explore opportunities for intra-Hemispheric cooperation in this scientific area.
High energy physics, while of itself a vital field of modern scientific
exploration, also provides training for diverse types of scientific endeavors,
and therefore aids in the development of a general scientific infrastructure.
Until such time as Latin American countries can afford to build more of their
own accelerators, this Symposium can stimulate and assist in the formation of
high-energy physics groups which can use U.S. facilities. The two previous
symposia in this field, in 1982 and 1983, were quite successful in stimulating
important collaborative efforts in which Latin Americans made substantial
contributions to collaborative experiments conducted in the U.S., and benefited
greatly from their experience here. In addition, the effect of the leverage of
these collaborative efforts can be great in terms of physics education, with
each Latin American teacher or researcher affecting in turn perhaps hundreds of
students or colleagues. Overall, both the scientific and educational benefits of
this Symposium can be expected to be large.
