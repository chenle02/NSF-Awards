Proposal: 1445992&lt;br/&gt;PI: Wax, Adam&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Duke
University&lt;br/&gt;Title: EAGER: Cell phone enabled
spectroscopy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) systems
have become an essential retinal imaging tool for ophthalmologists but their
cost of up to $150,000 for clinical systems has restricted access to only large
eye centers. There is significant opportunity for using OCT at the point of
care, if a low cost instrument were available. The lower cost will permit use of
OCT technology by a wider range of physicians and optometrists. The technology
and innovation in this project will enable low cost novel mobile health
applications currently unavailable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this EAGER
proposal is to create a low cost, high performance spectrometer based on line
scan sensors typically used for fingerprint scanners in cell phones. Many cell
phones incorporate fingerprint scanners based on a variety of sensing methods.
Most fingerprint scanners use an optical sensor, which are an ideal format for
spectroscopy with single line high pixel count sensor elements. In this project
the PI seeks to demonstrate proof of principle using an optical fingerprint
scanner for high performance spectroscopy. The proposed spectrometer will be low
cost (&lt;$500) and enable high resolution spectroscopy as well as fast signal
acquisition. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed platform, they will
create a spectrometer design suitable for spectral domain optical coherence
tomography (SD-OCT).
