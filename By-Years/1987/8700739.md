Insect cell tissue cultures can potentially be used for the production of viral
insecticides and for the production of proteins obtained from recombinant DNA
that can not be made in bacterial or yeast cells. A practical large scale insect
tissue culture system is not yet available and if it were, it could have immense
economic implications for the production of the above materials. This proposal
seeks to develop a novel bioreactor suitable for the cultivation of insect cells
that is also amenable to scale-up while providing a high level of control over
the microenvironment. The proposed work is truly innovative and novel and meets
the criteria for Expedited Awards for Novel Research (see attached AD/ENG
Bulletin No. 85-25). The PIs are considered to be quite capable of carrying out
the proposed research and I strongly recommend that this proposal be funded in
accordance with the budget submitted with the proposal.
