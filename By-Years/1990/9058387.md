This presidential Young Investigator award encompasses three projects in the
general area of ceramic and zeolite chemistry. One of these concerns mass-
transport limitations in sol-gel synthesis; the rates of diffusion of small and
large precursors in viscous reacting systems. Another is the diffusion of guest
molecules in zeolites and the influences thereon of zeolites structure, crystal
defects and cation occupancy; both theory and experiment are applied. The other
project is a study of the chemistry and kinetic behavior of polyoxoanions, the
precursors to zeolite-like materials and most ceramics; silicates, aluminates,
borates, phosphates, and ferrites are studied. A variety of techniques, both
experimental and computational, are employed, with an emphasis on nuclear
magnetic resonance methods. This effort is directly applicable to the synthesis
and processing of zeolites, zeolite-like materials, and ceramics in general.
Some of it may also have application in polymer synthesis and processing and in
processing of glasses and thin films.
