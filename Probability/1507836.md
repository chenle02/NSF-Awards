This award supports participation in the conference "Stochastic Analysis and
Related Topics" to be held May 20-22, 2015 at Purdue University. The primary
goal of the conference is to provide a venue for researchers in probability
theory to share recent advances in the field. The conference will consist
primarily of talks by 17 invited speakers. This grant will help to cover the
expenses of the invited speakers and also provide travel and local expenses for
graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other junior researchers
attending the conference.

Much of the research in probability theory can be classified into one of two
classes: 1) discrete probability models (random walks, interacting particle
systems, models in statistical physics), and 2) stochastic analysis (stochastic
PDE, diffusion processes, Malliavin calculus). The speakers in the conference
are distinguished researchers whose work covers a wide array of topics in both
discrete probability and stochastic analysis. The broad array of topics covered
should provide a wonderful overview of the field of probability to the younger
participants in attendance, and will also offer opportunities for researchers to
form connections between different areas of research within probability theory.
