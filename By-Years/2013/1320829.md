The investigator, students, and collaborators will develop and establish the
mathematical foundations of new models for image processing, implement, test and
compare these new models with existing ones, and directly apply these models to
problems in image fusion, medical imaging, and video processing. The proposed
work has several over-arching goals. The first is the development and
mathematical analyses of a new framework for image denoising that exploits the
rich information of the curvature of an image in a new and effective way. The
second is a better understanding of how to model geometric features in learned,
structured, and overcomplete dictionaries for processing and fusing degraded
data. The new models proposed in this work will be formulated in both the
variational and patch-based frameworks, and will mainly address data that have
been compromised by noise and linear degradations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital
images are now used in almost every area of science and technology. The models
developed in this project will be used to solve real world problems, including
problems in image fusion, video processing, and medical imaging. However, the
models will be formulated in enough generality to potentially be applied to a
wide array of applications in the sciences. Software developed under the
auspices of this grant will be made publicly available. This project will also
support undergraduate researchers who will implement, test and compare new and
existing image processing models, determine appropriate numerical schemes, work
directly with scientists to apply these models to real world problems, and
present their results at local and national meetings. The investigator regularly
teaches courses on image processing, and leads workshops on image processing for
middle school students and high school women and minorities. Thus this work will
be applied to problems in the sciences, be accessible for others working in
directly and indirectly related fields, promote the training of young
scientists, and provide educational opportunities for underrepresented groups.
