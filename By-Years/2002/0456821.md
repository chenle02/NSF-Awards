The purpose of this grant is to provide support for student travel to the 2004
Workshop on Internet Signal Processing, being held in San Diego, California on
November 11-12, 2004. It is a new workshop focused on application of signal
processing techniques for traffic analysis, understanding of complex networks,
and diagnosis and prevention of cyber attacks. This grant offers support for not
only student paper authors, but also for student attendees from a state
university serving under-represented populations. This workshop travel support
insures that deserving students will be able to participate, thereby nurturing
the next generation of researchers.
