The objective of this research is to design and demonstrate integrated circuits
that can generate signals at terahertz frequencies and process information at
tens of giga-samples per second with low power consumption in standard silicon
processes. The approach is based on special wave propagation phenomena and
applying them to nonlinear or inhomogeneous electrical
lattices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The research is focused on
developing a new method of circuit design when the devices operate close to or
even beyond their maximum unity power gain frequency. The main contribution is
to demonstrate fundamentally novel high frequency signal generation and
processing systems with orders of magnitude better performance in terms of
maximum output power, operating frequency, power efficiency, and bandwidth
compared to the existing methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The
expected research results have the potential to have a transformative impact on
electronic systems, such as communication devices, radars, signal sources, and
processors, where higher operation frequency translates to higher data rate or
better resolution. The research blends multiple disciplines within the fields of
electrical engineering, applied physics and mathematics into a coherent research
theme. This provides an excellent educational opportunity for the students that
carry out the research. Women and minority students from underrepresented groups
will be actively recruited and trained in this research environment. The
research results will be used to develop new courses that emphasize on
fundamental understanding and are project-based. To involve the public in the
research, workshops and short online videos are planned.
