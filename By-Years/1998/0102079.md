This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Can selection to minimize the
effects of translational and/or mutational errors explain codon usage patterns
in microbes despite their diversity?" The investigation of error minimization
mediated by biased codon usage will be extended from bacteria to their
bacteriophage parasites, using both comparative genome analyses of natural
isolates and laboratory evolution experiments. Primarily, the research pursues
the preliminary observations that 1) patterns of codon usage bias in bacteria
appear to reflect selection for error minimization, and 2) phage genome type
(e.g. dsDNA vs. ssDNA) appears to influence the degree of error minimization,
but not the degree to which phage codon usage reflects host codon usage.
