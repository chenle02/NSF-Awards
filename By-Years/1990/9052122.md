Beaver College is integrating molecular biology and biotechnology across the
curriculum so that every student will have adequate background to understand
developments in modern biology, medicine, and biotechnology. Electrophoresis and
high speed centrifugation equipment enable students to gain experience in
molecular biology in the introductory biology and in the interdisciplinary
science courses taken by every student. The equipment is also being incorporated
into teaching methods courses taken by elementary and secondary school teachers.
Students use electrophoresis to explore the relationship between genes and gene
products, and to understand how it can be used to demonstrate relationships
among organisms. Students in upper level biology courses also use the equipment,
along with more sophisticated electrophoretic and blotting techniques, protein
purification and characterization, gene cloning, amplification, and screening,
to extend their knowledge of molecular biology and biotechnology. The college
will contribute an amount equal to the award.
