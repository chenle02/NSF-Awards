Dr. Christopher C. Cummins, Chemistry Department, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career
Advancement Award to study radical bond-forming reactions of inorganic compounds
and to contribute to several aspects of the MIT teaching program. A major
portion of the research is directed toward the design and synthesis of new metal
complexes that will undergo clean radical reactions with a variety of inorganic
substrates. Examples include Ti(III)-amido species which will react with early
transition-metal oxo-complexes to yield heterometallic bridging oxo compounds
and with nitrido complexes to form metal-nitrogen-metal units. The teaching plan
has several goals including the design of a new course in inorganic chemistry
which is based on Nobel Lectures, the institution of an informal seminar series,
and service as an undergraduate academic advisor. In many chemical compounds
each electron is paired with another. In some, however, this pairing is not
complete and compounds which contain one or more unpaired electrons are called
`radicals`. While radicals are known to be very reactive, they have not been
extensively explored as precursors for inorganic substances. The purpose of this
study is to prepare stable metal containing radicals and utilize them to develop
new routes to important classes of inorganic compounds. The teaching portion of
the project is designed to improve the effectiveness of the chemical education
program, mostly in inorganic chemistry, at MIT.
