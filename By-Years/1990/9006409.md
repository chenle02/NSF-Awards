The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction witnessed the disappearance of many
organismal groups, but the planktonic Foraminifera (a floating one-celled animal
group) survived as a single lineage of dwarfed species. These surviving species
diversified in the world's oceans and are common microfossils in marine
sediments. Drs. Gerta Keller and Norman MacLeod propose a study of the surviving
lineages preserved immediately following the extinction. Quantitative study of
their morphology will allow reconstruction of ancestor-descendant relationships.
Analysis of species diversity patterns, as well as carbon and oxygen isotope
ratios preserved in shell material, will provide new insight into the
environmental changes that may have coincided with or caused the extinction and
subsequent evolutionary radiation. The proposed study will find a wide audience
among all paleontologists interested in extinctions, among paleoecologists and
paleoceanographers, and among evolutionary biologists in general.
