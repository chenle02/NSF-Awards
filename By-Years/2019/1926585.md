Quantum computing is at the cusp of a revolution. A quantum computing industry
is emerging and hardware prototypes have been deployed for public use. Yet a
significant gap remains between the quantum applications that have been
developed in theory and the size and reliability of the hardware that will be
available in the near future. The key to closing this gap is to develop a
science and workforce around quantum computing software and systems. With more
efficient quantum software and careful system design, quantum applications can
run on much smaller machines with many fewer instructions, by a factor of 100 or
even 1000. This greater efficiency will allow practical quantum computing to be
realized 10 to 20 years earlier than with technology progress alone. This award
seeks to catalyze the creation of this workforce by funding a faculty position
at the interface of Quantum Information Science and Computer Science at the
University of Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Computer Science
at the University of Chicago will use NSF QCIS Faculty Fellowship to recruit a
new faculty member in this area of Quantum Computing Software and Systems, with
expertise in one or more of the following: quantum algorithms, programming
languages, compilation, verification, and circuit optimization. The QCIS Faculty
Fellow will catalyze efforts to create useful software abstractions that will
enable use of near-term hardware advances in quantum computing. Such addition
plays an important role in growing the School of Molecular Engineering at the
University of Chicago in computational aspects of quantum technologies. The
Faculty Fellow will expand course offerings in Quantum Information Science at
the University of Chicago and train students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
