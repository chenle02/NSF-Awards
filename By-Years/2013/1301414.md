The research objective of this award is to develop robust, high-performance
control algorithms for Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) processes. LMD is a class of
additive manufacturing processes that builds metal parts layer by layer,
introducing dynamics that propagate in time and also layer-domains. While
conventional control strategies consider only the time-domain dynamics, the
layer-domain dynamics introduce significant part defects that affect process
reliability and efficiency. Physics-based 2-D (time- and layer-domain) dynamic
models of the LMD process will be created and validated on a LMD machine at
Missouri S&amp;T and an industrial LMD machine at Optomec, Inc. New Repetitive
Process Control (RPC) algorithms will be developed to control the 2-D LMD
dynamics addressing issues of robustness and performance. The methodology
employed may also be beneficial in other additive and layer-based manufacturing
processes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will spur innovation in additive
manufacturing by advancing the science, education, and practice of LMD process
modeling and control, potentially leading to dramatic improvements in
reliability, efficiency, and productivity. Additive manufacturing processes hold
tremendous potential to transform the way parts are manufactured, away from
multi-step hands-on fabrication, to single-step automation directly from CAD
models. The LMD process in particular is a critically important additive
manufacturing process because it is able to produce service-ready metal parts
with little material waste, repair high-cost parts, and produce functional
gradient material metal parts. The PI will develop an online distance course on
repetitive process control. The investigators will involve undergraduates
directly in the research activities through Missouri S&amp;T undergraduate
research programs and their existing REU Site in Additive Manufacturing. With
the joint support of OIIS/ISE the PI and graduate students will collaborate with
researchers in Poland to leverage expertise and facilities.
