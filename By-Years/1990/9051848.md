The objective of this project is to integrate Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy into the chemistry curriculum wherever students can use it to solve
chemical problems. With the acquisition of the computer-driven FT/IR, 250
students will use this modern technique in eight different courses during a
five-year period. They are identifying organic and inorganic structures,
searching spectral databases, measuring fundamental physical constants,
determining the composition of complex mixtures, and conducting undergraduate
research projects. They are developing analytical skills that are preparing them
for graduate school or careers in chemistry and related disciplines. The
institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
