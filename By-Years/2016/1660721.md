With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship program, the Preparing Secondary Teachers of Mathematics and Science
in Rural Districts project will recruit undergraduate majors in biology,
chemistry, earth science, mathematics, and physics and prepare them to become
secondary science and mathematics teachers. This Track 1 project will fund 34
scholarships over 5 years. In this project, Morehead State University (MSU) will
collaborate with Carter, Fleming, and Rowan County School Districts in Kentucky
and the Bronx, New York New World High School. The project is designed to
increase the number of undergraduate STEM majors becoming highly effective
secondary STEM teachers in the high-need districts of rural Eastern
Kentucky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSU Noyce Scholars will engage in the rigorous
MSUTeach curriculum, replicating the successful UTeach model. Scholars will
collaborate with secondary teachers and MSU faculty on designing and
implementing a cross-cultural STEM Speaker Series for high school students.
Select Noyce Scholars will participate in a one week onsite clinical experience
with students, faculty, and staff of the New World High School. Beyond financial
assistance, MSU Noyce Scholars will benefit from 1) the collegiality and
educative effects of participating in a Noyce cohort, 2) participation in cross-
cultural experiences to develop knowledge of economic and cultural challenges
related to STEM development in high-need areas, and 3) the opportunity to become
a leader in larger regional STEM initiatives.
