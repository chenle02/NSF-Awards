w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9705080 Conradi This experimental research project
is based on NMR techniques, and has two main thrusts: (1) study of metal
hydrides and (2) development of innovation in NMR technique. The work on
hydrides (1) focuses in one case on motion of hydrogen or deuterium in elemental
hcp dilute hydrides, in the temperature range near 60- 80K. In a second aspect,
the YH2-YH3 system, with possible application as a switchable mirror, will be
examined. (2) Spin- echo double resonance (SEDOR) will be extended as an NMR
technique in such a way that the echo amplitude A will be measured as a function
of the flip angle on the unobserved spins.This new method will be applied to
amorphous hydrogenated silicon. The nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) will be
exploited to enhance the use of optical techniques, which have previously been
developed by others to provide 20-50% nuclear spin polarization of helium 3 or
Xe 129. The nuclear Overhauser effect will be used to transfer some of this
polarization to spins of analytical importance, such as protons and C13. An
additional application of the NOE will be made in a proposed technique to avoid
inhomogeneous broadening in NMR study of dilute solute resonances in a solvent.
%%% This experimental research project is based on the technique of nuclear
magnetic resonance. In one aspect of the work, the hydrogen or deuterium
resonance in metal hydrides will be studied to clarify the state of motion of
hydrogen or deuterium ions in the hydride structure. Metal hydrides are of
interest for potential use as an energy storage medium. In a second aspect of
the work, the project will research an enhancement of the nuclear magnetic
resonance technique, in conjunction with a separately developed nuclear spin
polarization technique. The new method will make use of the nuclear Overha user
effect, and may permit new applications of nuclear magnetic resonance in
analytical studies. Secondly, in solutions, where a dilute solute is of
interest, the new method will greatly reduce the broadening which arises from
interaction with the solvent molecules. This research project is
interdisciplinary in nature and involves graduate and postgraduate students who
will be excellently trained to enter positions in industry, government or
education. ***
