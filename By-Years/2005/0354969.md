This research effort involves a collaboration among Mark Edwards of Georgia
Southern University (GSU), Charles Clark of the University of Maryland, College
Park and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (UMCP/NIST), and
Keith Burnett of Oxford University. Important topics to be investigated include
patterned loading of optical lattices and their subsequent evolution, Superfluid
and Mott-insulator state properties of quantum gases confined in optical
lattices at finite temperature, modeling of the operation of condensates
suspended above atom chips of various designs, and careful study of the
decoherence properties of such devices.&lt;br/&gt;
