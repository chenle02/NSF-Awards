The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to
provide a fully automated and versatile biological foundry technology
biotechnology to accelerate the biotechnology research and development (R&D).
Biotechnology industry spends over $35 billion/year on research and development
world-wide. However, the current R&D process mainly relies on manual work of
highly experienced research scientists. Such manual operation is slow,
expensive, and prone to human errors, which has constrained the growth of this
industry. The application of such fully automated and highly versatile
biofoundry may help biotech companies greatly expedite their R&D and reduce the
cost. Thus, the risk of R&D can be further reduced to enable the development of
more bio-based specialty chemicals, fuels, pollution remediation, as well as
healthcare products for the market. Initial work suggest the biofoundry
technology may have an initial opportunity in the strain development market for
fermentation companies.

This I-Corps project proposes to study the specific markets for the advanced
biomanufacturing technologies. The first prototype of such a robotic platform
has demonstrated its throughput and versatility in the proof-of-concept studies.
It is capable of conducting most molecular and cellular biology experiments with
minimal human intervention. With its modular hardware and software systems, this
platform can be rapidly reconfigured to a variety of tasks for engineering
biological systems. The modular system architecture also allows programming of
long and complex workflows that were very difficult to implement in previous lab
automation systems. When used for assembling complex DNA molecules, it achieved
a throughput of over 400 constructs/day with close to 100% success rate. Such
throughput and consistency was unattainable by conventional manual operations.
Such capacity opens the door to fast prototyping of biological systems by in
silico design, such as proteins, cells, and plants.
