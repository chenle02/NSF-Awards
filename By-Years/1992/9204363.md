This grant is to support the travel of six US researchers in unification theory
to the Annual Unification Workshop to be held in the Dagstuhl International
Conference and Research Center in Dagstuhl, Germany. The grant would fund only
airfare, as all other funding is provided by the Center. There has been little
interaction between the American and European researcher in unification theory
although there is a great deal of important work in this area taking place on
both sides of the Atlantic. This grant will bridge this gap, and bring together
the two communities in order to share our knowledge and foster continued
cooperation.
