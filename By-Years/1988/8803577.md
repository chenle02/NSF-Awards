Society has come to rely heavily on standard census and survey methods for
determining the number of individuals who may be classified as belonging to some
definable subpopulation. However there are many subpopulations that cannot be
enumerated by direct count, such as the number of women who have been raped, the
number of alcohol or drug abusers, the number of runaway children, or the number
people who are particularly susceptible to certain diseases. The increasing
frequency with which hard-to- count situations are being encountered has greatly
heightened interest in finding probabilistic methods for estimating the size of
such sets, and the present project offers an original and promising approach to
the problem. The research team consists of an anthropologist, a physicist, and a
mathematician who have successfully collaborated for many years--most recently
in developing a form of social network analysis in which relatively small-scale
personal acquaintanceship data are projected into minimum and maximum boundaries
according to a mathematical model of network size. Activities over the next two
years will focus on improving the theoretical basis for the model, testing and
refining it through reanalysis of existing data, and performing further
fieldwork aimed at exploring the effects of different techniques of data
collection. The anticipated results should considerably increase our knowledge
of social network phenomena, and perhaps open the way for developing a family of
models capable of predicting the size of different kinds of hard-to- count
populations.
