Abstract 9420750 Jong This award renews partial support of a large collection
of yeasts and fungi maintained by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
The collection currently consists of approximately 26,000 strains representing
in excess of 6,500 species and 1,500 genera, and includes a wide variety of
fungi and yeasts used in genetic, medical and agricultural research as well as
strains needed for production of food, pharmaceuticals and other chemicals.
Though large, the collection represents less than 10% of the known species of
these organisms. Currently, about 500 new strains are placed in the collection
each year. On request and for a small charge, the ATCC provides researchers,
teachers and industrial users a sample of any member of the collection; in the
most recent year, over 13,000 such samples were provided. Periodically, the ATCC
also publishes information about of the collection, including names and
properties of the strains, as well as limited information of use in culturing
the organisms. Such information is also made available through electronic media
such as the Internet. ***
