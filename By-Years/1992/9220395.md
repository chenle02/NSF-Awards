This award supports an integrated stratigraphic, paleontologic, structural,
geochemical, and geochronological study of the Ellsworth Mountains. The purpose
of this work is to determine the depositional and tectonic history of this
region during late Proterozoic and Paleozoic time. The Ellsworth-Whitmore
Mountains block is an important tectonic element within the collage of
continental crustal blocks of West Antarctica. This investigation will be
accomplished by careful geological mapping and sample collecting for purposes of
microstructural kinematic analysis, trace and rare-earth geochemical analysis,
and geochronological work. The project will use 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb isotopic
dating methods to define the absolute timing of events. This work will help to
constrain tectonic models for an important region of West Antarctica. In
particular, a proper understanding of this block is key to evaluating hypotheses
about the formation or breakup of supercontinents, such as Rodinia in the
Neoproterozoic or Gondwana in the Paleozoic.
