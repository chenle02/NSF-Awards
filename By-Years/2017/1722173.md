The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide accurate indoor location services
to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones, tablets and
laptops. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by
satellite-based positioning systems like navigation, tracking and location-based
advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based
beaconing system to enable sub-meter location accuracy within large GPS-denied
environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current
smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure
comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-
harvesting instead of requiring expensive AC wiring. Accurate indoor location-
aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail and
manufacturing all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the
visually impaired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to develop a
robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like
smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost RF tags to better than 1 meter of
accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor
localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy,
especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes
energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight
ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded
and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to
humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and
technologies required to scale this localization technology so that it can
support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require
tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of scalable multiple
access protocols for ultrasound communication, networking protocols for
synchronization and data collection, inertial sensor fusion algorithms for
robust and accurate localization and APIs for app integration by third parties.
