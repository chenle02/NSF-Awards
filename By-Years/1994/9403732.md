9403732 Tilly This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral
Dissertation Research program. It is a study of the role of prominent
intellectuals in the consolidation of the Cuban revolution after 1959. Data will
be collected from analysis of newspaper and magazine articles, from
organizational membership lists, and through oral history interviews in order to
analyze the social networks that linked Cuban intellectuals during the years
between 1959 and 1966. The resulting data on social networks among Cuban
intellectuals will be used to illuminate how the structures of power were
altered in that society as a result of the revolution. Previous work on
revolutions tends to underemphasize the processes by which the power of the new
rulers becomes consolidated. By focusing on that period and process
specifically, this project will help us better understand the social basis and
roots of the Cuban revolution. This project will also form a useful basis for an
attempt to understand how different revolutions compare and contrast. In
addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.
D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
