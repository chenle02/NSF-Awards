This research is on defining requirements for computer aided design of electro-
optical information processing systems. Three steps are being pursued. First,
define levels of abstraction for electro- optical systems, analogous to the
behavioral, structural, electrical and physical abstraction levels of VLSI
design. Second, characterize functional, physical and parametric models
necessary to analyze designs at different levels of abstraction. Third, specify
requirements for a multi-level simulation system.
