Peatlands are wetlands that have accumulated significant amounts of soil
organic matter. Northern peatlands are an important component of the global
carbon cycle and contain one-third of the global soil carbon pool. Under a
warmer climate, this soil carbon may be oxidized and emitted to the atmosphere
as carbon dioxide and/or methane, two important greenhouse gases, and thus
exacerbate human-induced climate change. Therefore, it is important to predict
the response of peatlands to climate change. The objective of this incubation
proposal is to bring together two research groups that have developed separate
models of peatlands which display complex behaviors. One model focuses on
feedbacks between carbon accumulation and hydrology, whereas the other model
focuses on feedbacks between plant communities and nutrient availability. A
framework will be developed for a comprehensive simulation model that can both
(i) simulate the initiation and development of peatlands over thousands of years
and the resulting pattern of different peatland ecosystems that form on the
landscape, and (ii) explore their shorter term response to climate change. This
model will provide great insight into the complex behaviors of these unique
ecosystems and will be invaluable in predicting the effects and potential
feedbacks of climate change on peatlands
