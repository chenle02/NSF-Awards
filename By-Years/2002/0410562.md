Chemistry (12) Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) are used as
essential components of a complete toolbox for chemical analysis. With GC-MS, we
adapt several new laboratory experiments using a problem-based format in
organic, analytical and criminology laboratory courses. We also employ problem-
based learning (PBL) in the labs to motivate students to use high-level
reasoning. While working in teams, students devise solutions to problems using
PBL. An Assessment Coordinator provides feedback on strengths and weaknesses and
how the pedagogical process affects student learning.
