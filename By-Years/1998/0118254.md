The Mantle Electromagnetic and Tomography (MELT) geophysical experiment, carried
out around 17 degrees south on the East Pacific Rise, utilized seismic and
electromagnetic observations to determine the geometry of the region of partial
melting and the pattern of upwelling beneath a spreading ridge. This project
will further the analysis of the MELT electromagnetic data by : (1) developing
an improved, numberical-based approach for stripping out the topographic effects
from the seafloor, (2) developing an anisotropic version of a 2D inversion
algorithm, (3) applying both of these tools to the MELT data, and (4) conducting
an integration of the MELT seismic and electromagnetic
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
