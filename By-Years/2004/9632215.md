OCE-9632215 This project will develop a new technique (U-Th) for dating marine
aragonite sediments beyond the range achievable by 14C. Preliminary results on
aragonite have produced ages for Stages 5 and 7 in agreement with the orbitally-
tuned 18O scale. The project will test these results by attempting to duplicate
them elsewhere, extend the dating to Stage 9, and improve the precision. Direct
and independent age control on deep-sea carbonates is essential for models
concerning the ocean's role in global climate change, especially such aspects as
regional linkages and feedbacks.
