DMS-9501559 PI: Its Its will investigate several topics in mathematical physics.
These include Riemann-Hilbert approach to the asymptotic analysis of the
correlation functions of quantum exactly solvable models, the isomonodromy
method in the theory of Painleve equations and its application to the inverse
monodromy problems, and Riemann-Hilbert scheme of the asymptotic analysis of the
matrix models and orthogonal polynomials. The research involves the theory of
nonlinear integrable equations, which was first used to integrate the Korteweg-
de Vries equation via the so called inverse scattering method. During the last
twenty years this method has been developed into an important branch of
mathematical physics and is one of the principal sources of new analytical and
algebraic ideas of many branches of modern mathematics, including quantum group
theory and the theory of special functions.
