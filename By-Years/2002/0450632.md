This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
a transfemoral prosthesis which will allow wearers to walk and run more
smoothly, with greater stability and less effort. Typically, transfemoral
amputees have difficulty achieving a natural gait, thus causing discomfort and
greater energy expenditure. It is expected that the development of this advanced
prosthesis will greatly enhance the function and comfort of amputees and bring
new technology to the prosthetic industry. In Phase I research, a unique
engineering model of the knee and the ankle was developed, implementing the
pneumatic compliance (spring) and electrically-controlled hydraulic damping. In
Phase II, complete prototypes of the microprocessor-controlled knee/ankle
prosthesis will be developed, with the following features: (a) compliant
(elastic, rather than stiff) knee flexion during stance phase, which will return
energy to the wearer and improve comfort, (b) co-ordination of knee and ankle
impedance to match desired walking cadence, and minimal energy expenditure by
tuning the spring rate to the natural frequency; and (c) myoelectric control of
knee impedance. In addition, high-performance features will be integrated into
the prosthetic device, including adaptive swing phase knee impedance, and
automatic control of stance phase impedance.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of prosthetic
devices for use by people with knee and foot (transfemoral) amputation. The
proposed product will allow the amputees to wear their prosthesis for a longer
time period, with less effort and more safety, and to walk on more rugged and
uneven terrain. Estimates of revenues resulting from this project show gross
sales starting at $750,000 per year, growing rapidly after 5 years to over
$8,000,000.
