This proposal is aimed at the synthesis of a new class of liquid crystal
materials that exhibit changes in selected properties by the polarization states
of incident light. Photochemical, physical and chiroptic properties of model
chiral chromophores will be examined as potential photoresolvable mesogens or
dopants. Phase formation will be studied by optical or electro- optical means
such as reflection, rotation, or ferroelectric behavior, and the photoinduction
of twisted phases by irradiation with circularly polarized light will be used to
examine oriented liquid crystalline phases of appropriately constructed
photoresolvable mesogens.
