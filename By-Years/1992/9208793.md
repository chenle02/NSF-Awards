This grant provides travel assistance to enable attendance by about 30 graduate
students at 1992 Solid-State Senors and Actuators Workshop, Hilton Head, South
Carolina, June 1992. This important conference is held every two years, and
provides an opportunity for U.S. researchers to gather and discuss progress in
the field of microelectromechanical systems. Strong student participation is
hallmark of the workshop, and about one third of the papers may be presented by
students.
