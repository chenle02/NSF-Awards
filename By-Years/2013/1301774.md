This effort will organize an NSF CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop to introduce
junior faculty to the NSF CAREER program, and help them prepare their CAREER
proposal. The NSF CAREER program serves a critical role in the National Science
Foundation's efforts to identify, foster and support the nation's most promising
junior faculty in both research and education. Junior professors who are just
starting their careers often have limited experience with grant writing and
evaluation. They also have little or no interaction with the program directors
at NSF. During this workshop, young faculty members will have the opportunity to
improve their skills in proposal writing, as well as interact with NSF program
directors from different divisions (IIS, CNS, and CCF) as well as recent NSF
CAREER awardees. The major components of the workshop include presentations on
proposal writing, experience sharing, mock panels, and proposal clinic. A
limited number of travel support will be made available for HBCU/MEI faculty to
attend this workshop. This 1-day event is tentatively scheduled to be held on
March 15, 2013 at Temple University Center City campus, located opposite to
Philadelphia City Hall in downtown Philadelphia.
