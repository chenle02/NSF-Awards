This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a motionless
magnetic shape memory (MSM) micropump to fill the need for draining bodily
fluids and delivering dosages with small, lightweight, and highly reliable micro
fluidic pumps. The motionless MSM micropump is important because it enables
dosage of micro fluids at higher precision and greater reliability which will
advance research in many areas of biology, chemistry, and medicine. For instance
the motionless MSM micropump will drain fluids from organs such as brain and
lung continuously without or with minimally invasive surgery as opposed to
removal of such fluids through repeated surgical interventions which is the
current state of the art. The project will result in a scalable prototype of a
motionless MSM micropump. This motionless MSM micropump has the following unique
features: it is lightweight, actuated contact-free, and can transport a large
range of volumes from picoliter to milliliter. These features provide advantages
such as reliability, precision, versatility, contact-free actuation, low power
consumption when compared to the leading competing peristaltic pumps and syringe
pumps in this market space.

This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from
research discovery toward commercial application. The MSM pumping concept was
demonstrated in 2012 at a pump actuated by a rotating permanent magnet. The
micropump makes use of a magnetic shape memory alloy that shape-shifts in
response to a dynamic magnetic field. Researchers will replace the rotating
magnet with a set of electrical coils and a yoke turning the pump into a solid
state device without moving parts. This will simplify the design, enable further
miniaturization, and reduce weight. In addition, personnel involved in this
project, including a post-doctoral engineering researcher and a MBA student,
will receive experiences in innovation, product development and technology
translation through combining a multifunctional, magneto-mechanical, smart
material with electromagnetic field manipulation and through using a customer
development process - namely the Lean Launchpad process - to build a sustainable
business model around the motionless MSM micropump.

The project engages the animal hospital WestVet to establish clinical needs for
a micropump in context with bodily fluid drainage in this technology translation
effort from research discovery toward commercial reality. The project also
engages Idaho TechHelp to connect the researchers with manufacturers in Idaho
and the region.
