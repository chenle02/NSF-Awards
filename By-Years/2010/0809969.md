William A. Lester, Jr. of the University of California Berkeley is supported by
an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research
to develp a hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) molecular mechanics (MM) method.
This new computational technique is expected to provide the scalability needed
to study large biomolecular systems. In this work, the chemically important
active region, such as the active site, is modeled by a diffusion Monte Carlo
method while the surroundings are modeled classically using molecular mechanics.
Lester and his group are developing algorithms that are easily parallelizable to
take advantage of the expected increase in computing power to petascale levels.

The work is having a broader impact both on other areas of science and through
Lester's extensive collaborations with students and faculty at a number of
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) such as Jackson State
University, and through his work with the National Organization for the
Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE). In addition, the
software developed in this research will be available for downloading from the
PI's website, further broadening its use by the research community.
