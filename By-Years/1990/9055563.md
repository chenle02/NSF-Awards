The this project seeks to improve the appeal and approachability of science to
college students by preparing materials to be used with science fiction films to
teach science and its relationships to technology and society. Among the
principal outcomes will be a student textbook, Learning Science Through Science
Fiction Films, suitable for use as the primary or secondary textbook for an
introductory level physics, physical science, biology or technology course for
non-science majors, and including an accompanying instructor's manual. Both
volumes will be published by the American Institute of Physics. Prior NSF
support has demonstrated that using science fiction films to teach science has a
very positive effect on students' attitudes towards science, knowledge of
science as a discovery process, and cognitive development. The project materials
will be tested with classes of college students, and faculty will be trained to
use the materials.The institutional support for this project exceeds the award.
