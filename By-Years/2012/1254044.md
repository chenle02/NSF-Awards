Developing new analytic tools and proof techniques will advance computer science
in a fundamental way. The aim of this project is to explore techniques used in
several different areas of theoretical computer science and mathematics in a
unified way. One such development involves the study of low-degree polynomials.
This research will address problems arising from two main
considerations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Understanding the analytical structure of
functions which have a small but significant correlation with a low-degree
polynomial over a finite field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Understanding the
expressive power of low-degree polynomials over reals for capturing proofs of
several combinatorial facts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The former leads to many
questions spanning the areas of arithmetic combinatorics, coding theory,
learning theory, hardness of approximation and Fourier analysis. Some of these
questions extend the notions of list-decoding in coding theory and are also key
to developing an algorithmic version of the theory of higher-order Fourier
analysis, developed recently to study questions in arithmetic combinatorics. The
latter consideration will strengthen our understanding of techniques from
combinatorial optimizations and proof complexity. Progress on these questions
will shed light on the design of new approximation algorithms using linear and
semidefinite programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of this project also includes
designing two new courses, to be offered at Toyota Technical Institute and the
University of Chicago. The PI also plans to collect short "research summaries"
to outline some of the exciting questions in different areas of theory, and make
them accessible to advanced high-school and undergraduate students.
