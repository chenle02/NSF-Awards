The project is developing materials for a course in mathematical applications as
a modern alternative to existing precalculus and related courses. The course is
an introduction to mathematical models at the precalculus level and is a
counterpart to the mathematical modeling course offered to upper division
mathematics majors. The models developed in the course are primarily based on
discrete mathematical topics such as difference equations, systems of linear
equations, networks and probability. It involves a considerable degree of
computer and/or graphing calculator work to explore the implementation of most
of the mathematical models. It also involves a variety of live classroom
experiments to investigate the accuracy of the mathematics in predicting the
results of actual processes or to help develop mathematical models based on
observed experimental data. The course features a series of student
investigations to provide a real life dimension and provides students with the
motivation and impetus to continue on in mathematically related fields by
exposing them to the wide applicability of mathematics.
