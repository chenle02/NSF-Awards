To examine the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the formation of specific
connections in vivo, the investigator recently developed a transgenic mouse line
in which there is overexpres- sion of NGF in the pancreas. The overexpression of
NGF in specific regions of the pancreas is correlated with large increases in
the synaptic density of sympathetic innervation in these regions. This
transgenic line will now be used to study the development of synapses employing
immunocytochemistry for a synapse-specific molecule, synapsin. The pancreas and
the celiac ganglion of adult control and transgenic mice will also be
immunocytochemically stained for beta-amyloid, which has been demonstrated to
increase in response to NGF. Studies of the ganglion using this antibody will
reveal the ganglionic neurons that project to the islets and indicate
consequences of this chronic exposure in vivo for their development, maintenance
and possibly, their degeneration. In addition, new transgenic mice will be
created in which there is overexpression of NGF in the central nervous system.
These mice will be used to determine whether there are important differences
between the peripheral and central nervous systems in the balance of trophic
factors regulating synaptogenesis.
