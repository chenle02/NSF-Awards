The principal investigator will study the subtle correspondence between the
movement of particles and the propagation of waves in a variety of geometric and
physical situations. In the quantum world, this goes by the name of the
"correspondence principle" and has long been understood in the simplest
settings. However, many mysteries remain in the application of the
correspondence principle to problems involving "bumpy" geometries or large
scales. One of the principal investigator's projects addresses how waves (e.g.,
light waves or gravity waves) propagate on space-times of interest in Einstein's
theory of general relativity, and in particular, how their decay is viewed by
distant observers. This decay is influenced by the geometry of space-time on
very large scales. Another part of the research will study how the familiar
phenomenon of diffraction of waves influences the waves' rates of decay. This
applies, for instance, to sound waves in the presence of sharp corners or cone
points, and it is of practical importance in acoustics and in a variety of
computational problems involving wave propagation.

The project will study the asymptotic behavior of waves propagating on certain
Lorentzian space-times such as arise in the theory of general relativity. A main
goal is to understand the asymptotics of the Friedlander radiation field for a
range of Lorentzian geometries, including asymptotically static space-times with
asymptotically Euclidean ends (with long-range perturbations). The principal
investigator will also study the decay of waves near their source in different
geometric settings, especially in singular geometries. In particular, he will
investigate the distribution of quantum resonances in a variety of geometries
involving cone points and corners, as well as continue collaborations on more
applied problems motivated by numerical analysis for high-frequency asymptotics
of the Helmholtz equation. Finally, the principal investigator will study the
closely related problem of the structure of the propagator for the Dirac-Coulomb
equation, where the singularity of the potential diffracts the singularities of
the solution, producing an outgoing spherical wave.
