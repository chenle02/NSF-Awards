Trinkaus 9723054 The overall objective of the proposed research is to
understand how normal tissue cells and cancer cells move invasively within
organisms - as individual cells, cell clusters, cell streams and as cell sheets.
Since there is now abundant evidence that normal tissue cells and cancer cells
utilize the same mechanisms for their invasive movements, both in vitro and in
viva, any increase in understanding how one moves will aid in understanding the
movement of the other. The emphasis in this research is on the mechanism of cell
motility, particularly during directional cell movements, how cells make
contacts with each other and with various substrata over which they move, how
tightly-joined cells in epithelia move to rearrange, and how their movements are
coordinated, and how cells respond to possible exogenous signals and move
directionally. More specifically, the investigations will be concerned with
protrusive activity of the cell surface, particularly at the leading edge,
contractility, cytoplasmic structure and programmed endocytosis as morphogenetic
mechanisms, the organization of actin-containing microfilaments as related to
cytoplasmic contractilitv, and tension during gastrulation, presence and
orientation of microtubules as related to the spreading movements of cortical
cytoplasm during epibolv, the ingression of cells at the surface of the gastrula
as related to the formation of the epiblast and hypoblast, the role of contact
inhibition and other coordinated interactions between and among cells during
directional morphogenetic cell movements, and the possible role of retraction
induced protrusive activity in the promotion of the persistence of cell
movements in a particular direction. The principal techniques that will be
utilized are: cell culture, high resolution differential interference contrast
and phase contrast optics, confocal micrography, time-lapse video filming of
moving cells in vivo and in vitro, high resolution photomicrography,
microsurgery and micr omanipulation for transplantation and deletion
experiments, inhibiting cell contractility with cytochalazin D and
depolymerizing microtubules with nocodazole and immobilizing them with taxol,
staining microtubules with fluorescent antibodies against tubulin,
microinjecting fluorescent labels to follow moving cells, transmission and
scanning electron microscopy - all in relation to cell motility. As many of
these techniques as apply will be brought to bear in the analysis of each
problem.
