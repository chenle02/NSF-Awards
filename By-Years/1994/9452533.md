9452533 Beals Funding for a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy
dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) has been received. The facility is being
used to develop the curriculum in biology, chemistry, physics, art courses and
for senior research and honors projects. The SEM-EDS provides the nucleus for
paired-course curriculum development in the natural and physical sciences,
reducing the artificial disciplinary barriers between subject matter and ways-
of-doing science. It is also being used in correlative TEM/SEM studies in the
Electron Microscopy course offered by the Project Director. Mary Baldwin College
serves several student populations: traditional-age undergraduate women; young
women in the PEG program who begin their college work one to four years early;
students in the Adult Degree Program, a non-residential B.A. program for women
and men; and students in Young Women in Science, a summer program for
outstanding high school science students. The presence of the SEM at Mary
Baldwin College aids in recruiting talented female students into the sciences.
It enhances the technical and research skills of female science majors,
increasing their qualifications for employment or graduate research, and
facilitates their research in biology, chemistry, physics and art.
