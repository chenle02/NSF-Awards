This proposal will study a particular class of proteins, ion channels, by the
tools of bioinformatics. The subclass of ion channels to be studied are
potassium channels, that selectively permit the passage of passage of potassium
ions. Traditionally, the detailed function of ion channels has been studied by
biophysical means. This proposal will study the functioning of potassium
channels with a different set of tools, the tools of sequence bioinformatics.
Essentially, this project will correlate sequence data with knowledge about the
structure and function of some members of the potassium channel family, and use
that to extrapolate to a prediction of functional details for the very large
number of potassium channel genes for which we have no direct structural and
functional data.

This is very important in expanding our knowledge because it is now much quicker
and cheaper to get sequence data than functional and structural data. Any
advance that we can make in inferring function from sequence will therefore lead
to big advances in functional knowledge.

This research clearly can have a large ultimate beneficial pay-off for
biomedicine and biotechnology. In addition to disseminating results by the usual
route of publishing and presentation at meetings, we will also develop for the
general community use profiles and motifs that are specific for particular
subclasses of potassium channels, and build them in the formats that are
standard for motif/profile databases such as BLOCKS, PROSITE, PFAM, and PRINTS.
The findings from this research will be able to be seamlessly and easily used by
other researchers with existing analysis software.
