&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to bring high levels of system
reliability and integrity to application domains that cannot afford the cost,
power, weight, and size associated with physical redundancy. The approach is to
develop complementary monitoring algorithms and novel computing architectures
that enable the detection of faults. In particular, there is a significant
opportunity to reduce the reliance on physical redundancy by combining model-
based and data-driven monitoring techniques. Implementing this approach to fault
detection would be difficult with existing software and computing architectures.
This motivates the development of a general purpose monitoring framework through
monitoring-aware compilers coupled with enhancements to multi-core
architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is
twofold. First, it has the potential to lead to a novel fault detection approach
that blends complementary monitoring algorithms. Second, advances in multi-core
processors are leveraged to enable implementation of these fault detection
approaches. This addresses key themes in cyber-physical systems by investigating
the fundamental issue of fault detection for physical systems and by developing
a generic processor architecture for monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
respect to broader impact, project offers the potential for positive influences
on industrial practice and education. If successful, the design ideas from this
project can be incorporated into low-cost multi-core architectures suitable for
embedded systems. The potentially transformative performance improvement offered
by this framework could also impact current research in run-time verification
and on-line monitoring. The research is to be incorporated into the course
"Design, Build, Simulate, Test and Fly Small Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles" for
senior undergraduate and first-year graduate students.
