The advent of array detectors sensitive in the near infrared region of the
electromagnetic spectrum promises to revolutionize astronomical observations in
this wavelength interval. A consortium of universities has, with non-federal
funds, undertaken a development program for such detectors in cooperation with
Rockwell. this award provides support for Dr. Hereld to lead the test and
evaluation of the Rockwell detectors, and to use these detectors in a research
program to search for very young galaxies.
