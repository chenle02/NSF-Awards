McBay &lt;br/&gt;OIA-0123262&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quality Education for
Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in
improving the education of under-represented groups that have been historically
undeserved by the nation's educational system. A successor to the Quality
Education for Minorities Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop
effective strategies of SMET education for minorities, and focuses on issues and
barriers that prevent minorities for receiving a high quality education. In
order for minority serving institutions to offer competitive research and
research training programs in the sciences, faculty and students must have
access to state-of-the-art instrumentation to enable them to conduct high
quality research. This award to QEM will make it possible to provide technical
assistance to minority -serving institutions; equipping faculty with the
essential tools needed develop competitive instrumentation proposals to NSF's
equipment programs, including the Major Research Instrumentation Program. As a
result all US institutions will have opportunity to secure funds needed to
facilitate their efforts in the quest to unravel the challenges presented by the
universe.&lt;br/&gt;
