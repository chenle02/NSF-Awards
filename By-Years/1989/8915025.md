The objective of this research is a quantitative, computationally efficient,
atom-based description of the dynamics of rotational isomerism in
macromolecules. The formalism can be used to determine the rate of initial
passage into any specified subset of the conformations of the chain. The
validity of the theoretical formalism will be assessed by two types of
experiments. The first type of experiment, performed in the laboratory with real
molecules, is the measurement of the dynamics of the occupation of that subset
of conformations that produces an intramolecular excimer, to be performed as
functions of the fluorescence lifetime of the chromophore, chemical structure
and length of the flexible fragment, and conformations of the flexible fragment
that belong to the subset that produces excimer emission. The second experiment,
performed with a computer, is a computationally intensive molecular dynamics
simulation, with femptosecond time steps, the results of which will be compared
with those obtained from the computationally much more efficient dynamic
rotational isomeric state theory.
