The National Academy of Sciences will extend for two more years the Government-
University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR). Initiated as an experiment six
years ago, the Roundtable is now recognized as an established, unique
organization in national science and technology policy affairs. Federal
agencies, state governments, universities, and industry all look to the
Roundtable as the only forum in the United States that brings together the
leaders of all sectors of the research enterprise on an ongoing basis and in a
manner that injects imaginative thought into the policy process and more
effective procedures into the nation's research system. The focus of the
Roundtable continues to be on the three areas that have been the core of the
Roundtable agenda since it was established: 1) the academic science and
engineering research enterprise--its organizational arrangements, physical
infrastructure, and support mechanisms; 2) new alliances between universities
and other sectors and between federal and state governments--their contributions
to academic research and teaching and to the processes of technical change and
innovation in industry, and the difficult policy issues that arise as a result
of the increased interactions; and 3) the identification, recruitment, and
retention of science and engineering talent. A new proposed initiative, a
comprehensive look at the management of the overall R&amp;D enterprise, is a
logical extension of the work in these three areas. This agenda is the result of
extensive discussions within the working groups and the Roundtable Council over
the past year, together with input from the relevant constituency groups, and is
based on the accomplishments of current activities. In addition, the Roundtable
will respond to issues vital to science and engineering that emerge in the
policy environment. The topics addressed by the NAS Government-University-
Industry Research Roundtable have direct relevance to NSF planning and
evaluation activities.
