Careful design of an experiment may yield a more direct as well as a more
efficient and precise analysis at the experiment's completion; this research
gives mathematical constructions for optimal designs in several important
experimental situations. Optimal repeated measurements designs can be used
whenever sequences of observations are made on each experimental unit or
whenever a collective analysis of curves is planned. For the many circumstances
where the greatest source of uncertainty lies in the initial choice of model,
designs will be constructed which are robust against deviations from a
postulated model. For situations in which some highly desirable observations are
impossible or excessively costly, criteria and algorithms will be developed
using combinatorial and optimization theories for choice among "near-optimal"
designs.
