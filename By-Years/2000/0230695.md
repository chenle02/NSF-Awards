PROPOSAL NO.: 0230695&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Cheville,
Richard&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Oklahoma State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:
Relevancy Enhancement Achieved by Laboratories and Lecture Integrated for
Engineering Education (REAL LIFE) Adoption of a Relevant Undergraduate
Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a critical need for
engineering education at reform at Oklahoma State University (OSU) due to an
unacceptably low retention of students, particularly women and under-represented
minorities, in the engineering program . The thesis of this proposal is that the
root cause of low retention is that students do not perceive engineering courses
as relevant to their lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oklahoma State University
proposes a one-year curriculum reform effort designed to bring relevancy to the
engineering curriculum. The proposed reform effort is based on proven
pedagogical models for which local expertise exists. Planning, implementation,
and assessment are addressed. Both short-term and long-term goals are clearly
defined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
