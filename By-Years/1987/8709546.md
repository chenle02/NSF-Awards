The project contributes to our understanding of economic applications of
repeated games. It builds on important new techniques for characterizing
repeated games developed by the investigator and it extends surprising and
potentially significant results obtained by the investigator about repeated
games under imperfect information. The high quality and significance of the
investigator's past research show that he has the ability to successfully
complete this project. The project consists of two parts. The first part
develops an ingenious theory of implicit and explicit contracts. The theory is
based on a model in which a principal negotiates a contract with an agent,
making the latter's compensation contingent upon output (or some other publicly
observable variable) but not upon some choice variable of the agent (perhaps the
level of effort or care taken by the agent). Implicit inter-temporal contacts
emerge in repeated games when the authorities (the courts) take into account
only the output and not the choice variables but the principal can observe the
choice variables and can retaliate against an agent who deviates from the
implicit agreement. Implicit and explicit contracts are shown to coexist, but
the principal will always pay the agent more than the amount called for in the
explicit contract, if behavior is efficient. This is original research because
this problem has never been rigorously analyzed. The results promise new
insights into contracts (Why are non-binding clauses included in contracts?) and
the relationship between business cycles and implicit labor contracts. The
second part concerns the strategic dynamics of implicit collusion in markets
with renewable resource, the so-called "Great Fish War" problem. The
investigator shows how previous work can be generalized into a solution for this
complicated and important problem.
