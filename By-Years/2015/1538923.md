This award will provide partial participant support for US junior scientists and
members of under-represented minorities to participate in the 2015 Conference on
Science at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) to be held on May
18-20, 2015 on the campus at the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology in
Rapid City, South Dakota.

The conference will address the science that can be carried out at SURF:
Neutrino Physics, Proton Decay, Nuclear Astrophysics, Dark Matter, Neutrinoless
Double Beta Decay, Materials Science for Nuclear and Particle Physics, Geology,
and Astrobiology and Life in Extreme Environments.

For Broader Impacts, the conference has a particular focus on junior scientists
as well as scientists who are members of groups underrepresented in science and
engineering (e.g., underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with
disabilities). The PI is also working to encourage the participation of Native
American students, scientists, and engineers in the conference. This conference
is important in the education of young scientists not only because of the
presentations they listen to, but also because during the meeting they directly
communicate with the more experienced scientists who are in attendance.
