ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No. CTS-0210242&lt;br/&gt;Title NER:
Exploring the Limits of Nanoparticle removal by Pulsed Lasers&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Cetinkaya, Cetin&lt;br/&gt; Clarkson
U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A method for removal of nanoscale particles
based on pulsed laser particle removal technology is being proposed. The novelty
of the method is based on the removal process based on rotation and removal of
the particle instead of the translation and removal. It is well established that
removal through particle rotation would require a fraction of the force compared
to removal by axial force. The PI proposes to develop a fundamental
understanding for modeling the dry removal process of nanoparticles with pulsed
lasers, to study the potential damage mechanisms and to determine techniques for
avoiding damage in required fluences, to perform experiments to improve and
confirm analytical models, and to determine a parameter space for an efficient,
practical dry cleaning technique.&lt;br/&gt;
