For the past two decades, astronomers have made great strides in identifying
where currently in our and in other galaxies new stars are being formed. Our
understanding of the physical processes of this formation process is, however,
far from complete. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes fundamental and
extensive studies in this field, dealing with virtually all of the major
problems of star formation that are currently identified. The most significant
topics the PI will be focusing on are the relationship between young stellar
objects (YSOs) and the giant molecular clouds in which they form, the evolution
of YSOs and their associated disks and winds, factors affecting the efficiency
of star formation, and the mass distribution among YSOs.
