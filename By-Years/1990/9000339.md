This work divides into two main topics, propagation of conormal singularities
in nonlinear caustics and the propagation of the same type of singularities in
nonlinear diffraction. Underlying this research is the general question of how
the past wavefront set of a solution of a differential equation influences the
wavefront set in the future. In the first project, work will be done
investigating the propagation of conormal singularities of solutions to the
Cauchy problem for second order strictly hyperbolic equations in three space
dimensions. The initial data is assumed to be conormal to the smooth part of a
characteristic hypersurface with a swallowtail singularity. One object of this
study will be to show that there is at most a cone of anomalous singularities
propagating from the swallowtail point. In the second project, the propagation
of conormal singularities for semilinear hyperbolic mixed problems with
Dirichlet conditions on domains with diffractive boundaries will be considered.
Here, the object will be to show that there is at most a cone of anomalous
singularities propagating from the glancing points.
