9310384 Dryhurst This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma in the
purchase of an x-ray diffractometer and an associated data analysis system. This
new instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of areas including
the following: 1) Structure and reactivity of metal-CO2 complexes and
stereoselective synthesis with chiral (propargylium)Co2(CO)5 complexes, 2)
Approaches to catalytic asymmetric allylic oxidation, 3) C3-symmetric tripodal
phosphine ligands, 4) Ligands that impose chiral electronic environment about
metal centers, 5) Design and synthesis of chiral organometallic compounds for
applications in asymmetric catalysis, 6) Synthesis, stabilization and
application of reactive organic species: metal stabilized quinodi-methanes,
cyclophane monomers for cyclopolymerization, and electrically conducting organic
and organometallic complexes, 7) Fast-ion or super-ionic materials. %%% The
x-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the
full three-dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives
the precise values of all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule
and it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of that molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. *** s t Z \ ~ ^ ` p, P p, P p, P p,v P p,
