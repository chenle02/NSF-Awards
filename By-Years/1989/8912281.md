The Guam Marine Laboratory is a research unit of the University of Guam, the
major institution of higher education within the geographic region of
Micronesia. Functions of the Marine Laboratory include basic and applied
research relevant to the development, conservation and regulation of the
region's marine resources. In addition, the Marine Laboratory helps to develop
the analytical capabilities of future leaders of the region. The University of
Guam Marine Laboratory is uniquely situated near a variety of thriving coral
reef habitat that are easily accessible by land and by small boats. It is
located at Pago Bay, on the eastern coast of Guam and is presently housed in two
main buildings. The laboratory currently has four small research boats and an
11.4-m research vessel for studies around Guam and nearby areas. A flowing
seawater system allows the successful rearing and maintenance of marine
organisms. The equipment provided in this award will enhance the laboratory's
research capabilities for the study and documentation of microscopic and
cellular phenomena. The microscope and dissecting scope will be employed in a
wide variety of studies of biological events requiring substantial clear
magnification. Such studies range from direct observation, particularly in
studies of larval fish and invertebrates, to the demonstration, through the use
of fluorescent anti-body techniques of specific metabolic capabilities of marine
organisms. The low-temperature freezer will allow scientists to properly store
cells and tissues to be used in examining molecular and cellular aspects of
genetics such as the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA. The pure-water system will
be of use in the many studies requiring reagents to be mixed at the laboratory.
