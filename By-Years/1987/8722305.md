The Chesapeake Bay Institute of Johns Hopkins University has requested several
items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V RIDGLEY WARFIELD, a research vessel owned and operated by the University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -shipboard computer
components for upgrading the SAIL data acquisition and data logging system, and
-several oceanographic and meteorological sensors for collecting scientific
data. The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the
University to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
