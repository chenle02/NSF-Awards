This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in astronomy
involves Arlin P. Crotts of Columbia University and Jean Kaplan of the College
de France, Paris, France. The objective of their research is to survey
gravitational microlensing of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). Microlensing
is a technique used by astronomers in their effort to observe dark matter. It is
also used for planet searches and for probing the structure of the milky way.
The investigators will survey intrinsically variable stars and monitor star
fields in M31. The collaboration takes advantage of parallel investigations
conducted by the French group and will allow both groups to address weather and
scheduling gaps in their respective data sets. Observations at the VATT (Vatican
Advanced Technology Telescope) and at the Pic du Midi Observatory will provide
for better and continuous coverage.
