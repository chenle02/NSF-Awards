According to the central dogma of molecular biology, the information contained
in the hereditary material, DNA, is passed to proteins via an intermediate
molecule called RAN. Proteins direct the control of most cell functions. While
the overall process of gene expression is understood, the details of the
mechanisms involved in gene expression need clarification. For example,
intervening sequences (or introns) are extra pieces of information inside genes
that are not used to produce the final gene product. The significance of introns
inside genes remains to be determined. This project is looking at requirements
for splicing , in the bacterial virus T4, a process that removes introns from
RNA during gene expression. RNA splicing mechanisms are varied, but in all
cases, the sequence of nucleotides (chemical subunits of RNA and DNA) is
important to the splicing process. %%% In this project, changes in the
nucleotide sequence of the introns will be generated by chemical mutagenesis and
the effect of these changes on splicing and gene expression will be evaluated.
The overall goal of this study is to use chemically induced changes in the
nucleotide sequences of introns to identify particular nucleotides in the
introns important to splicing. This information will be used to enhance models
for splicing mechanisms.
