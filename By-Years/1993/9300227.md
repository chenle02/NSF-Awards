This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will provide for the
purchase of needed laboratory and research supplies that were lost or damaged
during the passage of Hurricane ANDREW. The $50,000 from the National Science
Foundation is for immediately available seed money to permit the university to
acquire certain necessary items of shared-use equipment and supplies to allow
investigators to continue ongoing marine research projects and to implement
research that is directed at mitigating damage from major storm damage in the
future.
