This program will analyze over 100 IRS archival spectra from the Spitzer Space
Telescope with the objective of understanding infrared emission from dust
structures in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The investigation will address a
number of important questions about dust in AGN, and will determine if the
simplistic dust torus plus orientation explanation for the differences between
Seyfert Type 1 and Type 2 galaxies requires significant
revision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergrad and graduate students, and outreach to local K-12 schools by educating
students on cutting-edge astronomy topics.
