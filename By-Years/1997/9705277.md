9705277 Campbell Guatemala has an extremely diverse herpetofauna, but most
regions of this country remain poorly explored, and new species continue to be
discovered frequently in this country. It is estimated that at least 10% of the
species occurring in this country remain unknown to science. This project will
emphasize field investigations in the most poorly known regions, and will
produce extensive new collections, including whole specimens, tissues, and
photographs. Additionally, this comprehensive survey of the herpetofauna of
Guatemala will provide a unique opportunity to gain information on their
parasites. The number of parasite species can be expected to be more numerous
than their hosts by at least an order of magnitude. Internal and external
parasites will be collected from amphibians and reptiles using traditional
techniques and prepared in a manner consistent with long-term museum
preservation and study. The biology of some of these parasites will be studied
and reported by parasitologist colleagues and their students. Other
parasitological material resulting from these field investigations will be made
available to a range of other specialists. As a direct result of the research
proposed, a comprehensive National Herpetological Reference Collection will be
developed within Guatemala that will be a valuable aid to persons working in
that country in many diverse areas of research including systematics, ecology,
and conservation. Also, a computerized database will be developed and made
available online. This database will be used to produce a checklist,
distribution maps, and identification keys for the herpetofauna of Guatemala and
will correlate their parasites with the host species.
