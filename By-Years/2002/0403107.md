Saal&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207136&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goals of this study are to
provide additional constraints to improve our knowledge of the Galapagos plume
and its interaction with the Galapagos Spreading Center. Two scientific issues
pertaining to the geological evolution of the Galapagos will be addressed as
part of this study. Firstly, in order to understand which processes are
responsible for the geochemical variations of the Galapagos lavas and which
current model is most suited to explain them, we propose a study that combines
oxygen and radiogenic isotope analyses with major and trace elements
compositions on the same sample set. Secondly, we propose to develop a
geodynamic picture of the upwelling velocities and melting of the mantle beneath
the Galapagos archipelago. Traditionally, geodynamic pictures of mantle
upwelling and melting have been obtained through detailed geophysical studies.
In the last 15 to 20 years, the study of U-series (238U-230Th, 230Th-226Ra,
235U-231Pa) has allowed scientists to image the mantle upwelling and melting
using a geochemical tool. In contrast to other radiogenic isotope systems, the
short half lives of the U-series will allow us to get a first look at the
present-day mantle composition, the extent of melting represented by a suit of
lavas and estimate the mantle upwelling at different points in the archipelago.
The combination of U-series, oxygen and other radiogenic isotopes with major and
trace elements contents measured in the same samples combined with ongoing
geophysical studies, will provide our best opportunity to obtain a reliable
geodynamic image of the Galapagos plume and the surrounding
asthenosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
