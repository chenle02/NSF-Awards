This award will provide partial support of the eighth in a series of
conferences in January at the Aspen Center. These conferences are given in three
areas of physics, and the present award covers the area of elementary particle
physics. Conferences in this series accommodate about 65 physicists both
experimentalists and theorists. The focus for the conference this year will be
both on the virtually massless particles called neutrinos and on the heaviest
particles which are expected to accompany them in the theory called the
"standard model" which has so far been successful in explaining the most
fundamental aspects of the forces of nature. Any evidence for failures of this
theory will be explored in this conference.
