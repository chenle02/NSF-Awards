The principal investigator will study the mechanisms of the phase
transformations in magnesium and magnesium-iron olivine under a wide range of
pressure and temperature conditions, employing multi anvil apparatus and
transmission electron microscope techniques. The results will have important
implications for understanding the dynamics of the upper part of the Earth's
mantle, including the rheological behavior of subducting oceanic slabs and the
mechanisms of deep focus earthquakes.
