The main objective of this research is to explore the feasibility of coupling
the Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) method for the detection and
delineation of underground cavities with the concept of geotomography, so that a
three-dimensional mapping of subsurface features can be accomplished. The
presence of subsurface voids and objects can cause serious challenges for
structural, geotechnical, and environmental engineers, and can jeopardize public
safety. Therefore, methods are needed to locate such features as part of the
site investigation program in suspect areas. SASW method with the proposed
enhancement will provide such a means.
