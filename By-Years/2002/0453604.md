The overall goal of this research is to demonstrate new architectural solutions
for the converged information and communication networks of the next century in
nontraditional applications.

Intellectual Merit This project focuses on the societal impact of engineering
systems and technologies. We have developed various collaborative technologies
(tele-immersive laboratory, experimental economics), to explore how humanists
and social scientists may take advantage of the vast digital information and
interactive capabilities that the Internet offers in communication.

Broader Impact Students will be able to do research in every area of CS-IT:
algorithms, complexity theory, computer graphics and vision, artificial
intelligence, robotics, networks, wireless communications, software engineering,
operating systems, human computer interaction, computational biology,
programming languages, and computer architecture, under the supervision of
faculty with outstanding qualifications, who are committed to undergraduate
research.
