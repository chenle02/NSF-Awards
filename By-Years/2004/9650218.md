The project involves implementing polymer characterization by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) into the
chemistry program. The use of GPC and DSC provides essential information to
enhance student understanding of the properties of polymers. GPC yields polymer
molecular weight and DSC provides thermal properties of polymers. The labs
affected by these instruments include polymer, organic, physical-inorganic, and
instrumental chemistry. In the polymer lab, polymerizations are being performed
with subsequent characterization. Other experiments include polymer
fractionation, polymer blend miscibility, and annealing studies. In the organic
chemistry lab, molecular weight and thermal characterization of polyethylene
terephthalate and nylon 6,10 are being conducted. The integrated physical-
inorganic lab utilizes GPC to measure the molecular weight of an inorganic
polymer and DSC to obtain enthalpy values corresponding to ligand strength in
inorganic complexes. The instrumental lab is being updated by employing DSC in
thermometric titrimetry.
