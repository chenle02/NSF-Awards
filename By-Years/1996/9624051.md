9624051 Rausher Natural populations of the ivyleaf morning glory (Ipomoea
hederacea) contain two distinct leaf shapes: some plants possess leaves with
three lobes, while others possess unlobed leaves. Leaf shape differences of this
magnitude have been shown to affect leaf temperature regulation (lobed leaves
dissipate heat more effectively), and herbivore preference (some insects use
leaf shape to recognize edible plants). However, an affect of leaf shape
variation on plant performance in the field has never been demonstrated.
Preliminary results from field observations of this plant species suggest that
lobed and unlobed plants are specialized for different environmental conditions.
The study will use large scale field experiments to quantify plant performance
as a function of leaf shape in a natural setting. The study will also use
greenhouse experiments to precisely control relevant environmental factors. This
approach allows the determination of the effect of leaf shape on plant
performance; may lead to an explanation of how this peculiar polymorphism is
maintained; and may provide some insights into the importance of leaf shape for
survival of plants in different environments.
