Fundamental and applied problems associated with the contamination of the
subsurface environment are receiving attention at local, national, and
international levels. Groundwater contamination is clearly an urgent technical
issue in our society. The University of Virginia has taken an interdisciplinary
approach to the study of quantitative contaminant hydrogeology that places it in
a unique position of national prominence in the field. With additional support
for graduate students, the ongoing research and teaching program should allow
them to craft a cohesive program that will provide the basis for understanding
the fundamental technical issues of groundwater contamination and produce
competent professionals who can address the details of this complex
interdisciplinary problem from a variety of perspectives. Collaboration across
departments is generating new research funds, additional faculty members, and
new space; the University of Virginia is primed to expand its role in the
training of critically needed technical professionals. This interdisciplinary
academic program, encompassing hydrogeology, geochemistry, microbial ecology,
chemical engineering, and civil engineering, shall evolve into a national
resource by producing outstanding graduates to fill positions at other
universities, national research facilities, federal agencies, and industry, and
to train them to contribute to solving our Nation's problems in contaminant
hydrogeology.
