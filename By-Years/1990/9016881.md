With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr.
William G. Dauben of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
California, Berkeley. The proposed research seeks to probe the effects of either
high pressure or sonication on hindered substrates in reactions run under mild
thermal conditions. In the area of high pressure chemistry, Dr. Dauben will
probe the development of charge in the transition state and the effects of
stoichiometric ratios of reactants on the rates of reactions run at 15 kbar.
Acid catalyzed reactions, bioorganic transformations and enolate conjugate
additions will be included among the target reactions to be studied. In the area
of sonochemistry, the focus will be on evaluating rate enhancement by sonication
of homogeneous reactions that have previously been studied under controlled
pressure conditions. This comparison will help to elucidate the source of
exalted reaction rates under aegis of sonication.
