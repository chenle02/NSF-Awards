Title: Postdoctoral Fellowship in Law and
Health&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
support a postdoctoral fellow who will conduct research under the mentorship of
senior scholars of law, gender, and health at the University of Michigan.
Concerted field-building efforts over the last few years have resulted in a
promising set of theoretical tools and methods for approaching the scientific
study of relationships between law and health. The postdoctoral fellow's
research program will advance scientific understandings by bringing theoretical
depth to the study of the intersections of law and
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will nurture a post-doctoral scholar
to be housed at the Institute for Research on Women and Gender at the University
of Michigan. The postdoctoral fellow will spend two years at the University of
Michigan performing research in gender, law, and health using interdisciplinary
methods such as interviewing, statistical analysis, and participant observation.
The postdoctoral fellow will receive consistent and ongoing mentorship from a
team of scholars with established research records in the area of the fellow's
work. The goals of the project are for the postdoctoral fellow to advance an
excellent research agenda, to publish articles on law and health in peer
reviewed journals, to hone grant writing skills, to establish relationships
nationally with scholars in the field, and to envision and execute a long-term
vision of the fellow's research trajectory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
