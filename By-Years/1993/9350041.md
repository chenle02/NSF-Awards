9350041 Johnson The Colorado Statewide Systemic Initiatives, "Pursuing Equity,
Achievement and Knowledge for Students in Mathematics and Science Education"
(PEAKS) employs three strategies: (1) linking the development of high
mathematics and science standards with changes in curriculum, assessment,
instructional models, teacher preparation, and professional development; (2)
providing leadership and sustained support for a consistent policy environment
at all levels of school governance; and (3) engaging the public as partners in
reforming mathematics and science education. Based in the State's existing
standards-based reform efforts and in strong connections to the State's major
science- and mathematics-focused businesses, PEAKS will support local school
districts as they first develop curriculum and assessment standards based on
those adopted by the State and then prepare and implement a plan for staff
development, uses of technology, community involvement, assurance of educational
equity, assessment, policy review, documentation of student achievement, and
establishing a professional development school for teacher development. The
program will develop a centralized enabling structure for bottom-up changes,
making extensive use of existing efforts that have proven successful in the
State. Local Catalyst Partnerships between schools and institutions of higher
education, parents, business and industry, state and federal agencies will
develop and implement a standards-based education system that has high
expectations for all students. Regional Collaboratives will provide technical
assistance, professional development, and linkages to national, state, and local
resources to the Local Catalyst Partnerships. A State infrastructure of
leadership, policies, and mechanisms to support system alignment and local
innovation completes the set of networks that will organize the program. ***
