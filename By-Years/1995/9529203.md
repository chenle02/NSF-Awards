Abstract Driscoll 9529203 The objective of the proposed research is to quantify
and model the complex chemistry and stretch effects that occur within a premixed
flame as it undergoes a turbulent wrinkling process. This proposal is a
continuation of a previously NSF funded program. The PI plans to make use of a
variety of laser diagnostic techniques to investigate two model problems
relevant to premixed turbulent combustion. These unique flame experiments
include: (1) the interaction of a flame front with an isolated vortex, and (2)
the flame propagation in an isotropic homogeneous turbulent flow in a long
channel, generated by a set of fans. The PI plans to measure profiles of
important radical species, including CH, OH, O and H, and the stretch rates and
vorticity along a premixed flame as it undergoes an unsteady wrinkling process.
He also plans to obtain advanced Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) with complex
chemistry and compare results to both the flame-vortex and the homogeneous
turbulence experiments, and to use the results to measure quantities that are
required by other types of models.
