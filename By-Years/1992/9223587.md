This award supports a symposium on scientific issues in the flow and fracture
of ceramic and geological systems. As the issues have attracted the efforts of
both the materials science and experimental and theoretical geophysics
communities, this symposium will specifically emphasize topics of mutual
interest and activity, seeking primarily to foster communication and continued
interaction amongst the communities. Topics to be addressed at the symposium are
many, but include (1) the nature of brittle fracture, including mechanisms of
toughening and of slow crack growth, (2) the mechanical properties of granular
(porous and non-porous) aggregates, (3) polyphase rheology, including factors
affecting engineered polyphase structures (e.g., fiber composites). A group of
eminent scientists in both communities will contribute to the symposium;
further, the symposium itself is being organized by a small committee that
additionally represents the interface between the two communities.
