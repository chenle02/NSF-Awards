Full Center Proposal for a Center for Fuel Cells
(CFC)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0856055 University of South Carolina (USC); John Van

&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to renew and expand the Center for
Fuel Cells (CFC) as an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center. This
proposal is based upon USC?s successful completion of five years of operation of
the CFC, as a single university site; and the commitment by five companies to
join a research site at the University of Connecticut. USC will be the lead
research site for CFC. The proposed Center will promote collaboration between
universities and their industry partners and solve problems related to
commercial implementation of fuel cells. The PIs list five focus areas to help
advance the technology and commercialization of Fuel Cells. The addition of
UCONN expertise in solid fuel cells would add to the expertise at USC in Proton
Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells. The renewed and expanded Center will be successful
because it builds on existing strengths developed during the first five years of
operation. The Center will also educate and train researchers for industry and
government. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed center
includes the importance of finding alternative fuel cell sources to fossil
fuels. The proposed Center will encourage collaboration, and the research will
expose students and faculty to state-of-the-art research projects of value to
the industry. Students will have opportunities for industrial internships with
members. The educational activities and the research participation in the Center
activities will provide a diverse workforce for an innovative technology that
will be part of a new economy. Over 30% of the student participants will be
women or under-represented minorities. Faculty in the CFC will work with REU
students to present their work at national meetings with the goal of obtaining
recognition for these students. &lt;br/&gt;
