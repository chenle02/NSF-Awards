Abstract

Award: DMS-0541917 Principal Investigator: David Fisher

The proposed research lies between dynamical systems and geometry. Work of
Furstenberg, Mostow, Margulis and others shows that certain dynamical systems
are an important tool for studying geometric properties of important geometric
spaces, particularly symmetric and locally symmetric spaces. . One important
property of symmetric spaces is that they have non-positive curvature. The
investigator plans to extend this work in several inter-related directions. The
study of symmetric spaces will be generalized to include more general spaces of
non-positive curvature as well as more general maps between spaces with an
emphasis on infinite dimensional spaces. The investigator will attempt to
exploit these relationships to prove long-standing conjectures of Zimmer. The
group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold acts on the space of square-
integrable Riemannian metrics, which is naturally an infinite-dimensional space
of non-positive curvature. In previous work the PI has extensively studied
dynamics of certain groups acting on ``flat" infinite dimensional spaces, and
some present work can be viewed as generalizing those result to spaces that have
curvature. Typically if one is a perturbing a dynamical system one already
understands, the study of nearby dynamical systems can be reduced to properties
of a flat infinite dimensional space. However, if one wants to classify
dynamical systems which one does not assume are perturbations of ones that are
well-understood, one is forced in a space that has curvature.

Dynamical systems is a young and important field of mathematics that
investigates the evolution of physical or mathematical systems over time (e.g.
fluid flow) while differential geometry is a more classical field that tends to
study static configurations of curves and shapes in space. New ideas from
dynamical systems theory such as chaos and fractals have had a profound impact
on our perception of the world. One of the deepest and most influential
mathematical applications of dynamical systems has been to the study of
geometric properties of spaces with "many symmetries". The PI's research can be
viewed as part of a general development in modern mathematics in which ideas
from dynamics and differential geometry interact to lead to both proofs of old
conjectures and exciting new discoveries. A key idea that appears repeatedly is
that spaces that possess many symmetries must actually be homogeneous, i.e. any
space with enough symmetry actually looks the same at every point. The PI's work
on these topics has relationships with diverse areas of research including
computer science (expander graphs and property (T) of Kazhdan) and celestial
mechanics (KAM theory and stability of the solar system).
