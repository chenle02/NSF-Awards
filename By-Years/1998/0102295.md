Howard University seeks funding for a three-year Teacher Retention and Renewal
project for 180 middle school and high school teachers in Washington, DC, public
schools. The project will develop teacher leaders with advanced skills and
understanding in Science, Mathematics and Technology (SMT) education content and
pedagogy who will help strengthen ongoing professional development in schools
through the mentoring of other training courses for teachers in life science,
earth science, biology, chemistry and physics. Scientists and science educators
will teach the courses. The courses will be grounded in constructivist learning
theory and the activities will be interdisciplinary and inquiry-based. The
teachers will receive graduate credit.
