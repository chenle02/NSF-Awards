This research project is focused on tissue engineering of in vitro grown
calcified tissues. It will investigate the synthesis of bioactive ceramic
templates for optimum formation of bone and bone- like tissue. This study is
aimed at explaining the effect of ceramic substrates on the activity of
osteoprogenitor cells and cells of osteoblastic phenotype. The relationship
among the following time dependent parameters will be established: 1) the
morphological and compositional characteristics of the extracellular tissue
formation and the expression of osteoblastic phenotype; 2) the microscopical and
ultramicroscopical composition and structure of the bioactive glass surface
using FTIR, AES, ESCA and AFM; 3) the time dependent variation of extracellular
fluid composition and fluid flow close to the glass surface; and 4) the zeta
potential of the bioactive glass surface. This research is important since it
could promote the new field of in vitro tissue engineering. The research could
lead to improvements in the quality of materials to replace or repair bone.
