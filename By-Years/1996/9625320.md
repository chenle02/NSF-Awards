9625320 Shaw This research develops a new methodology, known as columnwise
formulation and column generation, for solving combinatorial optimization
problems. Combinatorial optimization problems are a very important problem
class, and include such problems as the traveling salesman problem, the general
assignment problem, and the capacitated minimum spanning tree problem. Problems
in this class are among the most difficult combinatorial problems to solve
efficiently. The researcher has identified potential industrial partners,
including two large telecommunications firms, interested in capacity expansion
problems in the design of both local access and broad-band networks. Further,
the investigator will undertake two innovative educational projects. One is to
integrate modern communication tools, such as the World Wide Web, into classroom
teaching; the other is to enhance the teaching and research program in
optimization and to develop a computer laboratory for modeling and optimization.
The methodology is innovative and has potential for significant theoretical
advances in efficiently solving difficult combinatorial problems. At the same
time, it has promising real-world applications in the design of
telecommunications networks.
