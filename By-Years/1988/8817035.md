Supported by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program, Prof. George Olah is
examining how molecules holding positive or negative charges react. Olah, of the
University of Southern California, is a world authority on this topic, and has
developed many methods for generating, stabilizing and examining these charged
molecules. Olah examines the unstable intermediates by using nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy, a method that measures the unique magnetic properties of
individual atoms in a molecule. The work has impact in a number of ways,
including gaining fundamental knowledge about the shapes, stabilities and
reactivities of charged molecules. This information finds application in both
academic and industrial laboratory settings. The work related to positively
charged intermediates will examine some new chemistry on the preparation and
properties of onium ions, oxonium ylides, halonium ions, and diazonium ions.
Additional studies of carbanions and dianions will also be carried out. New
studies of the preparation and properties of organomagnesium compounds will be
initiated.
