9530532 Padovani This grant is for partial support of publication costs for the
Subcommittee on Natural Disaster Reduction (SNDR) strategic and implementation
plan document entitled, "Natural Disaster Reduction: A Plan for the Nation". The
SNDR is a multi-agency working group that is part of the Committee on
Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) of the National Science and Technology
Council, which was established by the President on November 23, 1993. The SNDR
coordinates U.S. federal agency participation in the International Decade for
Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). The SNDR is made up of 19 member agencies
and departments, cooperating to increase the overall effectiveness and
productivity of U.S. Federal agency programs for reducing deaths, injuries, and
economic and social disruptions resulting from natural disasters, such as the
devastating Northridge earthquake which struck the Los Angeles region on January
17, 1994. Lessons learned in the Northridge earthquake are an important part of
this document. This grant is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program. ***
