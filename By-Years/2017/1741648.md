This grant provides participant support for attendance at the International
Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) and the International
Symposium on Model Checking of Software (SPIN), which will be held in Santa
Barbara, California, USA, on July 10-14, 2017. ISSTA and SPIN together cover
verification, validation, testing, and analysis of software systems, a topic
whose criticality increases with the growing complexity and distribution of
software-intensive systems. This symposium is one of the top venues for
researchers in this area. The funds are to encourage mainly US-based students to
attend ISSTA/SPIN. Priority will be given to students in groups typically
underrepresented in ISSTA/SPIN communities, such as women, African-Americans,
Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, and students from non-PhD-granting US
universities. The Symposium provides education, training and professional
development of the supported participants, the building of the research
community in this important area, and the exposure to senior people in the field
and the international research community.
