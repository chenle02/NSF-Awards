This award provides support for student travel to and participation in the 2008
Gaseous Electronics Conference. The meeting focuses on combining aspects of
atomic, molecular, and optical physics with electric gas discharge physics,
chemistry and engineering. The Gaseous Electronics Conference brings together
members of the atomic, molecular, and optical physics communities with
researchers interested in applications of gas discharges and plasmas. The
conference is being held in Dallas, TX from 13-17 October, 2008. Support is
limited to students enrolled in a Ph.D program in the United States who are
presenting a paper at the conference. Support is competitive and will be based
on the anticipated contribution by the individual to the success of conference.
Support is provided by both the Plasma Physics Program in the Physics Division
and the Combustion and Plasma Systems Program in the Divison of Chemical,
Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.
