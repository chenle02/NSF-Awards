With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry at Rutgers University New Brunswick will acquire an X-ray
diffractometer with CCD detector. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including studies on new multifunctional Lewis acids for
applications in catalysis and materials chemistry, new electronically
interesting oligomers and polymers, rigid organic linkers for electron injection
in dye-sensitized solar cells, and enzymes as catalysts for the synthesis of
chiral intermediates for pharmaceuticals. The new diffractometer will allow
training a highly diverse student population in crystallographic methods at both
the graduate (Ph.D.) and undergraduate levels. Efforts include development of a
new module for an advanced undergraduate "Synthesis and Characterization"
laboratory course to give students hands-on experience in structure
determination. The X-ray diffractometer will also be used in established
outreach programs at Rutgers-Newark (ACS SEED program and outreach to local high
schools).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
Such structural studies have a large impact in a number of areas, especially in
the synthesis of important organic and inorganic chemicals and in understanding
chemical interactions in polymers and biomolecules.&lt;br/&gt;
