9604612 Hannah Regulation of starch synthesis in maize kernels is the interest
of Dr. Hannah for many years. The analysis of mutants in starch synthesis
resulted in the detection of a likely rate-limiting step in the action and
activity of the enzyme, ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP). The proposed work
originates from the results of prior support in which regions (and amino acids)
in the enzyme have been identified which determine its allosteric properties. In
the continuation, Dr. Hannah will use a bacterial expression system for the
production of enzymes generated by directed mutagenesis to obtain detailed
knowledge about allosteric and catalytic domains of the enzyme, about the
interaction of the two subunits of the enzyme, and screen for second-site
suppressor mutants. He will then return to whole plant analysis by corn
transformation of mutant enzymes into a background which contains a deletion of
the gene. Dr. Hannah's work has been paradigmatic for the analysis of maize
starch mutants and the extension of genetic analysis into biochemistry and plant
physiology.
