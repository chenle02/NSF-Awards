An operating system kernel provides a foundation for isolation and security in
every computer system used today. Operating system kernels are trusted to
provide the first line of defense for numerous mission critical systems in the
face of targeted security attacks. Unfortunately, despite decades of evolution
modern operating systems are faulty and vulnerable. Inheriting their core
engineering technology from the first time-sharing machines, modern operating
system kernels are still developed with a legacy software engineering techniques
---a combination of an unsafe programming language, rudimentary concurrency
primitives, and virtually no testing or verification tools. Today these systems
are faulty and vulnerable. Lacking verification support, industry standard
kernels make nearly every computer system on the planet vulnerable.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop RedLeaf, a new operating system,
and associated formal verification tools for implementing provably secure and
reliable systems in the Rust programming language. RedLeaf brings together
state-of-the-art results from verification, programming-language, and systems
research communities in order to enable unprecedented security and reliability
guarantees in low-level systems software. To achieve complete verification of
the entire software stack, i.e., operating system and applications, the RedLeaf
team will develop a set of new tools, a collection of techniques and engineering
disciplines, and a methodology focused on rapid development of verified systems
software. The RedLeaf OS will run on an embedded CPU of a medical sensor,
implement a network function virtualization framework aimed at line-rate network
processing, and provide a general platform for a broad range of verifiably
secure systems. The operating system and associated tools will be open source,
directly benefiting the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
