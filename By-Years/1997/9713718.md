This grant provides funding to address two problem areas in the application of
information technology to engineering. The first area to be addressed is the
development of techniques for automatic classification and retrieval of designs
using detailed product design attributes that are more meaningful and accurate
than Group Technology codes and can be computed automatically from the designs
stored in the database. The second area to be addressed is the development of a
hybrid variant/generative approach to process planning that will combine the
best characteristics of both variant and generative process planning, while
avoiding the worst limitations of each. When a process plan is needed for a new
design, the hybrid approach will use the above classification scheme to retrieve
portions or `slices` of several plans that are relevant for corresponding
portions of the design, and then will combine these slices and modify them to
produce a plan for the new design. If successful, this work will have the
following benefits. First, it will combine, in an innovative way, the strengths
of both variant and generative process planning. Like traditional variant
process planning, the proposed approach to process planning will construct
process plans that the process engineer may need to improve. However, by
automatically adapting the retrieved plans to the new design requirements, it
will minimize the need for such improvements, thus producing more successful
implementations and applications than previous methods. Second, the proposed
work will develop techniques that help design and manufacturing engineers
effectively use legacy data and adapt it to new problems. Since it is estimated
that practicing engineers spend more than 80 percent of their time searching
through legacy data, catalogs, and earlier engineering projects, this should
have significant positive impact on engineering practice.
