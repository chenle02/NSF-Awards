Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The Oceanography Society will convene a forum on
environmental outreach to the public on March 5th, 2008 during the biennial
Ocean Science Meeting in Orlando, FL. The audience will be members of various
organizations who are attending the larger conference and the media. The Ocean
Science conference will probably draw about 3500 participants primarily from
academic institutions, non-profit research institutions, federal research labs,
state and federal agencies, and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of
the forum is to promote discussion on how the marine and aquatic science
community can more effectively provide information to the public and to
communicators. Six to ten panelists will be available to provide examples of
effective outreach/education efforts. Two discussion topics proposed are 1)
Making communication of environmental issues more effective, 2) Reducing
barriers to scientists to communicate with the public or to work with
professional communicators. Funds will support travel for the panelists.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal presents a novel method of encouraging
scientists to develop outreach and education programs. Program notes that this
type of forum is new for the Ocean Sciences meeting and is part of a growing
level of attention focused on education and outreach at oceanographic
conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed education and outreach effort is
strongly focused on supporting broader impacts of NSF-funded oceanographic
research awards. The intended result is to get the oceanographic community to
focus more attention on outreach and to conduct more effective outreach and
education programs at a time when environmental issues, particularly global
change issues, are of increasing importance.
