The Principal Investigator will investigate the density and energy distribution
of interface states in different semiconductor-insulator systems by studying the
tunneling spectroscopies of both super- conductor-insulator-semiconductor
(SISc), and metal-insulator- semiconductor (MISc) tunnel junctions. This will be
the first time that the funneling spectroscopy of SISc junctions is used to
characterize the interface states.
