The investigators will study magnetosheath-ionosphere interaction by probing
electron density, electron temperature and oxygen emission structures in the
dayside high-latitude ionosphere. Long-term, ground-based studies of the cusp
boundary and dayside auroral arcs can greatly advance our understanding of
magnetic merging by measuring the morphological response of the cusp to solar
wind forcing, and by examining the relationship of the cusp boundary to the
location and motion of soft arcs. This study will also provide an opportunity to
study the energetics of dayside auroral arcs. By merging measurements of plasma
density and 630 nm emissions with a solar ultraviolet photochemical model, the
investigators will extend studies of daylit aurora to a low energy regime
heretofore undetectable with conventional radar and optical tools. This study
will help to understand how the morphology of the cusp responds to solar
forcing, the relationship between daylit arcs and the cusp boundary, and the way
in which the motion of dayside arcs is controlled by the interplanetary magnetic
field. The observations will be made with a spectrograph and an incoherent
scatter radar located at Sondrestrom, Greenland. A web-based real-time archive
of daytime auroral measurements, linked to the existing repository of nightside
images from the Sondrestrom all-sky imager, will be provided as a resource for
future collaborators. This web archive will also contain a descriptive narrative
and links to satellite images aimed at the general public, so as to increase
awareness of auroral light emission as a round-the-clock phenomena.
