This is a two-year collaborative research project between Dr. Chii Dong Lin,
Kansas State University and Professors Bao Cheng-Guang, Zhongshan University and
Liu Xian-Hui, Institute of High Energy Physics, Academia Sinica, to study atomic
fusion. The atomic fusion processes are important in the study of high energy
physics. The data derived from this study can be useful in energy development.
The U. S. P.I. is an expert in the field of hyperspherical coordinates research,
while the Chinese collaborators have developed methods for dealing with
hyperspherical harmonic functions. Both techniques are needed for understanding
atomic fusion. The research is mutually beneficial and can advance this field of
research.
