The goal of the award is to devise efficient computational methods for
performing risk and safety analyses of nuclear power plants. A recent
international effort of the Nuclear Energy Agency formulated a new framework,
known as risk-informed safety-margin characterization, to address several
critical issues facing the nuclear industry today. The impacts of these
developments, which include extending licenses for aging facilities and
operating them at higher power levels, can profoundly affect safety margins, and
there is an urgent need to better understand the risks in the changes. Indeed,
the catastrophic 2011 accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan clearly
shows the utmost importance of accurately measuring risk. In addition to
performing efficient nuclear safety analyses, the techniques may also be applied
to attack problems in civil and mechanical engineering, catastrophe modeling,
and finance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research combines theoretical and
practical components, including designing new Monte Carlo algorithms, formally
establishing their validity, and implementing them to analyze risks of existing
nuclear plants. The core of the work will focus on variance-reduction techniques
for efficient simulation for performing risk and safety analyses of nuclear
facilities. Because current simulations can require enormous computational
effort, applying variance reduction is essential for performing safety analyses.
If successful, the new methods will profoundly reduce computation time, perhaps
by orders of magnitude. To further account for the statistical error of the
resulting estimators, the investigator also plans to produce asymptotically
valid confidence intervals.
