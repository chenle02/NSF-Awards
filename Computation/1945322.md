9th Workshop on Parallel-in-Time Integration Michigan Technological University
Houghton, Michigan June 8-12,2020. http://conferences.math.mtu.edu

Computer models and simulations play a central role in the study of complex
systems in engineering, life sciences, medicine, chemistry, and physics.
Utilizing modern supercomputers to run models and simulations allows for
experimentation in virtual laboratories, thus saving both time and resources.
Although the next generation of supercomputers will contain an unprecedented
number of processors, this will not automatically increase the speed of running
simulations. New mathematical algorithms are needed that can fully harness the
processing potential of these new systems. Parallel-in-time methods, the subject
of this workshop, are timely and necessary, as they extend existing computer
models to these next generation machines by adding a new dimension of
scalability. Thus, the use of parallel-in-time methods will provide dramatically
faster simulations in many important areas, such as biomedical applications
(e.g., heart modeling), computational fluid dynamics (e.g., aerodynamics and
weather prediction), and machine learning. Computational and applied mathematics
plays a foundational role in this projected advancement.

The primary focus of the parallel-in-time workshop is to disseminate cutting-
edge research and facilitate scientific discussions on the field of parallel
time integration methods. This workshop aligns with the National Strategic
Computing Initiative (NCSI) objective: 'increase coherence between technology
for modeling/simulation and data analytics'. The need for parallel time
integration is being driven by microprocessor trends, where future speedups for
computational simulations will come through using increasing numbers of cores
and not through faster clock speeds. Thus as spatial parallelism techniques
saturate, parallelization in the time direction offers the best avenue for
leveraging next generation supercomputers with billions of processors. Regarding
the mathematical treatment of parallel time integrators, one must use advanced
methodologies from the theory of partial differential equations in a functional
analytic setting, numerical discretization and integration, convergence analyses
of iterative methods, and the development and implementation of new parallel
algorithms. Thus, the workshop will bring together an interdisciplinary group of
experts spanning these areas. NSF support for this conference will be used to
engage junior researchers in this important research topic.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
