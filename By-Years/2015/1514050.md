This project investigates the risks instigated by malicious hardware
modifications (hardware Trojans) in the nodes of a wireless network and aims to
develop remedies, thereby enabling secure deployment and fostering technology
trustworthiness. Due to the lack of assurance mechanisms in the globalized
integrated circuit (IC) supply chain, hardware Trojans have recently become the
topic of intensified concern. At the same time, wireless networks constitute an
indispensable part of modern electronic systems and their ability to communicate
data that is typically encrypted over public channels makes them a prime attack
target. Accordingly, this project provides a synergistic approach that combines
information theory with IC design and test practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on (1) modeling the risk induced by hardware Trojans in wireless
networks, (2) elucidating this risk by designing realistic hardware Trojan-based
attacks on both the baseband processor and the RF front-end, (3) developing
countermeasures for preventing insertion and facilitating detection of hardware
Trojans in wireless networks, and (4) demonstrating attack feasibility and
countermeasure effectiveness using popular experimentation platforms enhanced
with custom-designed Trojan-free and Trojan-infested Radio Frequency ICs. The
investigators participate in outreach activities organized by Cybersecurity
Research and Education Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas.
