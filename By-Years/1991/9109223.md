The objective of this research is to formulate strategies for resource
allocation, control and pricing in communication networks that offer multiple
services using shared resources. It is expected that these problems will become
significant as networks continue to integrate diversified services. The
Principal Investigator is modeling such a multiple service, multiple resource
system, analyzing strategies for managing the system through control of service
requests and pricing of services, and designing a set of algorithms to specify
these strategies. The initial part of the research uses existing theories of
Markov chains; the latter part draws from a richer domain of stochastic
processes. The effort exposes issues and strategies for managing communication
networks in particular, and contributes to modeling and analysis of any multiple
service, multiple resource system in general. The research will be evaluated by
the information content of the resulting control and pricing rules and by the
complexity of the resulting algorithms.
