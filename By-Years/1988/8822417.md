Under this Expedited Award for Novel Research the research competence of two
different groups will be combined in a study of the melt processing of
thallium.based and rare earth.based high Tc superconducting compounds. The
processing research capabilities at Colorado School of Mines will be utilized as
will the materials science experience with thallium.based superconductors at the
University of Arkansas. Precursor compounds will be deposited on the surface of
thin wires which will then be dipped in melts of Ba.Cu.O compounds to form the
required compositions. The final structure will be formed during subsequent
annealing. Process parameters will be determined for this relatively simple
processing technique and correlated with physical and superconducting
properties.
