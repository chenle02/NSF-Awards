9401559 Hogg The analysis and interpretation of the current meter and float data
collected during the Deep basin Experiment (DBE) will be completed in
conjunction with other DBE investigators. The main emphasis of this component is
to quantify the deep circulation, especially the flow of Antarctic Intermediate
Water within an abyssal basin, the Brazil basin, to understand how passages
affect that flow of water and to distinguish between boundary and internal
mixing processes in channel like the Vema Channel. Finally, a synthesis of all
the observations will be made with an inverse model.
