The experimental program will provide fundamental chemical and optical data
concerning atomic and excimer species, which are difficult to access
experimentally. In particular, it will consider Krypton and Xenon compounds and
acquire new knowledge on their strongly bound electronically-excited states, on
the photo- absorption and photo-ionization of their highly excited states, and
on the process of photoassociation in general. The goal of these studies is the
improvement in the performance of rare gas containing devices (e.g. lasers and
lamps) and processes (semi-conductor growth and etching) through a detailed
understanding of their interaction with background species.
