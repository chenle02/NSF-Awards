9724919 DiTullio The Subantarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean plays a critical
role in both past and present global climate change, and is therefore of
considerable interest to the international science community. This proposal
seeks funds to support a unique collaboration with Australian marine scientists
to investigate biogeochemical cycling in this oceanic region. The prinicipal
investigator, Professor Giacomo Di Tullio, of the Department of Geology,
University of Charleston, and his counterpart, Dr. Peter N. Sedwick, of the
Cooperative Research Center for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment,
University of Tasmania, will conduct and interdisciplinary study of the
physiological status and response of the whole microbial community to growth
limitation by iron and major nutrients. Experiments will examine the possibility
that iron may control Si:N utilization ratios by the biotas (including
implications for species dominance), heterotrophic/autotrophic competition for
iron, and iron and major nutrient effects on production of the radiatively
important gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) and its precursor DMSP. The field program
and research cruise on the Australian vessel RSV Aurora Australis will involve
Australian, New Zealand, and French researchers as well as the American
researchers supported under this project. Results will contribute to our
understanding of factors affecting global carbon cycling, and will further the
exchange of ideas and encourage cooperation between the marine science
communities of the United States, New Zealand, France, and Australia.
