Abstract:

The grant will provide partial funding for a USA delegation consisting of young
Ph.D's and graduate students to participate in the mathematics conference
entitled "Computational Methods and Function Theory '01, which will take place
during the period June 25-29, 2001 in Aveiro Portugal and will focus on the
interactions between certain areas of pure and applied mathematics. The grant
will also provide travel funding for several outstanding researchers from
eastern Europe.

The grant will provide funding for a USA delegation of of young Ph.D's as well
as graduate students to participate in a conference that will emphasize various
aspects of the interaction between scientific computations and the area of
mathematics known as function theory. The conference will also foster contacts
between scientists from diverse cultures. For this purpose, the funding provided
will also help support some eastern European participants.
