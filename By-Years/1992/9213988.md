This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is
designed to investigate the molecular aspects of friction and wear. The approach
to molecular tribology to be used in this project includes friction measurements
on well characterized surfaces using pin and v-block apparatus, as well as
microbalance studies of lubricant film growth kinetics. The extreme pressure
lubrication behavior of possible lubricant compounds will be used to develop a
model of the mechanism of lubricant action. The results will then be related to
ultra high vacuum studies of the molecular surface chemistry of these model
lubricant compounds on well characterized surfaces. %%% A detailed molecular
level understanding of the processes of friction and wear would be very useful
in designing improved lubricants and wear reducing additives in a variety of
important technological applications. This research project will approach this
question from a very fundamental point of view, coupling engineering
measurements of friction properties with detailed analysis of the surface
chemistry of the solid/lubricant system. The goal of the work is to develop the
understanding which will enable the rational design of lubricant compounds.
