This proposal presents an experimental plan to investigate biological mechanisms
to defend against activated forms of oxygen in soybean root nodules. This
defense is centered on the 4 enzymes of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway in
wich H2O2 is scavenged. Biochemical studies will concentrate on glutathione
reductase. This enzyme will be purified and characterized with regard to amino
acid sequence, kinetic properties, pH optimum, inhibitor effects, cofactor
requirements, substrate specificity, pI values, and possible isozymes.
Polyclonal antibodies will be used to immunologically characterize the enzyme
and to determine the subcellular location with electron microscopy. A major
component of the proposed work consists of molecular studies to 1) identify the
biochemical mechanisms that regulate the genes encoding glutathione reductase
and ascorbate peroxidase and 2) describe environomental and developmental
factors that affect regulation. The genes for glutathione reductase and
ascorbate peroxidase will be cloned in order to identify regulatory sites and
study cis- and trans-acting factors involved in express. The regulatory role of
various environmental factors (water stress, heat and chilling shock, pO2) and
of potential biochemical effectors (GSH, H2O2, paraquat, rhizobiol signals) will
be examined. These studies will involved analysis of transcript and protein
levels in whole nodules and in soybean protoplasts bearing electroporated
reporter genes fused to promoter regions. A long term goal is to assess the
criticality of oxygen defense through use of transgenic plants bearing antisense
genes.
