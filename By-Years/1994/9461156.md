A method is proposed to enable full-energy injection in an x-ray lithography
machine used for etching future high-density computer chips and
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). A high-gradient accelerator, which
utilizes a high-power microwave source to drive electrons through a linear
accelerating structure, can be used as a full-energy injector to an x-ray
superconducting synchrotron radiation ring (SSRR), or to a granular e-beam
driven x-ray source. Examples of microwave sources capable of producing the high
power needed to drive the HGA are a relativistic klystron, a high-power X-band
klystron combined with an rf pulse compression system, a sheet-beam klystron or
a cluster klystron. Full-energy injection increases the stored current in the
SSRR by eliminating energy ramp-up of electrons in the SSRR, a main source of
current loss during injection. Higher stored current generates more intense
x-rays, which in turn reduces the exposure time and increases the throughput,
thus saving the unit cost of production. Development of the method and apparatus
of an integrated system combining a full-energy HGA injector and the SSRR
technologies is the main thrust of the present NSF SBIR project. Technical
issues to be addressed in Phase I include continued R&D on the rf power source,
feasibility of gridded gun modulation at the rf frequency of the ring, design of
the septum and kicker magnets for high-energy injection, and optimization of the
injection beamline layout in relation to the x-ray beamlines to minimize
interference in a compact space.
