University Repetitive Contact Modeling, Analysis and Visualization The 3D motion
and position measurement system coupled to a high performance graphics
workstation is used to model, analyze and visualize the effects of repetitive
contact on human joints. It is part of a high performance computational
environment for research on human joints and problems caused by repetitive
strain. The motion and position measuring system measures and tracks the
movement of light emitting diodes mounted on a body with an RMS accuracy of 0.1
mm and a resolution of 0.01 mm. This system enables the measurement of the
kinematics of knees and for determining the kinematics in the hand during typing
and piano playing activities. The system also has a probe with light emitting
diodes that enable the establishment of landmarks and coordinate reference
points on bones as well as mapping surface geometries of the joint surfaces. The
high performance graphics permit real-time, interactive visualization and
querying of geometric models and stress/strain analyses. The potential payoffs
of the research are in clinical diagnostics, surgical techniques and
preparation, prosthesis design.
