9501111 Maroudas This is a CAREER program with emphasis on both research and
teaching in the area concerned with the reliability of metallic thin films used
in device interconnections in integrated circuits. The research aspects of the
program address the effects of thin-film chemical composition on the evolution
of the microstructure and the propagation of damage in the metallic conductor
under electric thermal and stress fields involved during thin-film processing
and circuit operation. The program involves atomic-scale modeling to predict
surface and interfacial thin-film properties and analysis of compositional
effects on grain-structure evolution, the dynamics of precipitate formation and
void propagation. The educational aspect of the program relies on computational
materials science to offer the necessary tools to model the experimental
observations and to introduce the results of these studies into graduate-level
courses. ***
