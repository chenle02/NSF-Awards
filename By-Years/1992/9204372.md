Professor Galloway will continue his work on rigidity phenomena in space-time
geometry. A fundamental tool will be the Lorentzian analogue of the Cheeger-
Gromoll splitting theorem. Ramifications of this work are applicable to the
Hawking-Penrose theory of blackholes and space-time topology.Further problems
concern questions of certain (Cauchy) surfaces in Lorentzian manifolds.
