This grant provides support for a workshop that will introduce decision theory
to engineering design faculty. The goals of the workshop are to acquaint
engineering faculty with the mathematics of decision theory, to ground them in
the mathematics necessary to correctly apply decision theory to engineering
design and other decision making processes in engineering, and to provide an
exportable version of the workshop that will enable the workshop to have a
broader impact than just for the faculty who can attend. The workshop will be
conducted in a tutorial fashion, with invited experts representing mathematics,
economics and the decision sciences, and will provide ample time for interaction
between the attending faculty and the experts. Topics that will be covered
include decision making under uncertainty, decision procedures, game theory,
probability theory and elements of engineering microeconomics appropriate to
engineering design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the outcome of this
workshop will be a heightened awareness of the principles of decision theory and
its applications to engineering. This will likely affect the entirety of
engineering education and practice, and will ultimately result in improved
decision making across all engineering fields.
