In a collaboration of minority-serving institutions with diverse faculty, the
University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras, California State University Stanislaus,
University of the District of Columbia and Northern Michigan University will
address the dearth of Ancestral Computing for Sustainability (ACS) in computer
science education (CSE). The primary goal of this project is to research the
incorporation of ancestral knowledge systems and CSE as disciplines that co-
create positive learning ecologies for marginalized communities, especially
women of color, towards sustainable computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
