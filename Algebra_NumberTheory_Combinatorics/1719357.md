The study of Lie groups and Lie algebras has a long and distinguished history
going back to the mid-nineteenth century. It had its roots in the idea that the
geometry of space is determined by its group of symmetries. As our understanding
of space has evolved, the study of Lie groups and Lie algebras (Lie theory) has
become a central part of modern mathematics. The subject has also always
benefited by interactions with physics and these led to two of the major
developments in the last century; the definition and study of Kac-Moody algebras
and quantum groups. These objects turned out to have many connections to
physics, combinatorics and number theory. One of the early successes of their
study was the fact that many classical identities established by the famous
Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) could be recovered and
interpreted in the language of the representation theory of Kac-Moody algebras.
Quantum groups are deformations of Kac-Moody algebras and their study has led to
important connections with knot theory and mathematical physics. One of the
goals of this project it to exploit the synergy between the study of Kac-Moody
algebras and their quantum analogs to study questions in representation theory
and to relate them to various series of functions which appear in the work of
Ramanujan.

This project focuses on the study of the connections between Demazure modules in
an affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra and the theory of hypergeometric series, quantum
affine algebras, generalized Q-systems and cluster algebras. In the simplest
cases, Demazure modules are indexed by a pair of positive integers one of which
is called the level of the module. It can be shown that a module of a fixed
level admits a flag where the successive quotients are all higher level Demazure
modules. This information can be encoded in the form of a generating series and
a goal of the project is to relate them to q-hypergeometric series and to study
their modularity properties. The study of Demazure modules is also important in
the theory of quantum affine Kac-Moody algebras. Another goal of this project is
to establish character formulae for prime representations of quantum affine
algebras. The latter are known to be related to cluster algebras and the
proposal will study the combinatorial problems arising from these many
connections.
