Strings 2014, the major annual international meeting on string theory, will be
held at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study on June 23-27,
2014. Funds are requested from the National Science Foundation for local support
for graduate students and postdocs attending Strings 2014, and also for partial
support of speakers.

Since the 1980's, meetings in the Strings series have been focal points of the
field, with experts from around the world presenting new work and reviewing
recent developments. These meetings have a very broad focus, including string
theory, its relations to quantum field theory and other areas of physics, the
associated mathematics and mathematical physics, and potential applications to
particle physics and cosmology. Strings 2014 will follow in this tradition,
aiming for a unified presentation of the many strands of modern string theory.

In addition to plenary talks, this year the program will include parallel
sessions, a poster session, a gong show, and vision talks. The Strings 2014
meeting will also be tied in to a summer school, Prospects in Theoretical
Physics (PiTP) that will be held the previous week at the Institute for Advanced
Study. The PiTP meeting will help prepare graduate students for the Strings 2014
meeting and it is expected that many students will come for both events.
