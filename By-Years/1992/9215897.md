This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Tennessee in the purchase of a
Laser Raman spectrometer. Several faculty members whose research is dependent
upon laser Raman spectroscopy will greatly benefit from the acquisition of this
instrument. Research projects to be carried out with this instrument include:
(1) the chemistry of molten chloroaluminate salts, (2) study of molten salt
electrochemical cells, (3) the chemical vapor deposition of diamond, (4) the
characterization of fullerenes and their derivatives, (5) the determination of
chemical composition for process control with energy reduction, and (6) laser
fluorescence of species in the diffusion layer of modified electrodes. %%% A
laser Raman spectrometer provides important spectroscopic data which can be used
to obtain information about molecular structure, molecular symmetry and
molecular dynamics.
