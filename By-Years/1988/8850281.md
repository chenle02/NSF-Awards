The College of Arts and Sciences, Oklahoma State University, will implement a
three week Young Scholars Program. The program is designed for thirty-six high
achieving, high-potential students, grades 9-12. Those who attend will better
understand the ways that scientists think and work, will recognize the many
opportunities for them in science, and will experience the excitement of
interacting with scholar-mentors and other outstanding students in an enriched
academic environment. All students will attend morning presentations, workshops,
and tours. The schedule is arranged so that the first week of morning sessions
deals with information and research, focusing on statistics and mathematics for
the scientist. The second week will be devoted to the social implications of
scientific study and advancement -- specifically ethical issues. The last week
of morning sessions will cover career options, from a variety of perspectives --
discussions with counselors and advisors, completing a career evaluation
examination, hearing educators and professionals describe their work, and
exploring the sites where scientists go about their jobs. In the afternoons, the
students will learn to use the laboratory safely and effectively to complete
assignments under the close direction of university faculty. In groups of twelve
they will work for one week in the field of chemistry, life sciences, and
physics -- rotating each week so that every student visits all laboratories. The
academic work in the afternoon sessions will be rigorous, informative, and
productive.
