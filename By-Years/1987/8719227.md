This action will provide funds for the continued development and operation of
an experiment to study very rare kaon decays at Brookhaven National Laboratory
(E791). The experiment was approved about three and one half years ago with very
high priority by Brookhaven. The experiment will test the limitations of our
present understanding of the currently accepted "standard model" of the electro-
weak interaction. The standard model has recently had great quantitative success
but is known to be incomplete. The proposed search for the decay of kaons into
pairs of charged leptons would provide guidance about the many proposed
extensions of the "standard model". If these decay modes were observed, it would
constitute a major discovery.
