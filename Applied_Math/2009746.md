This project has two main thrusts. The first is a topic at the interface between
mathematics and materials science, involving a class of artificial materials
known as "Maxwell lattices." This work will study how the macroscopic mechanical
properties of a Maxwell lattice are determined by its microscopic structure. An
improved understanding of the relationship between microstructure and
macroscopic behavior is expected to facilitate the design of better artificial
materials. The project's second thrust lies at the interface between mathematics
and data science, and is thus aligned with one of NSF's ten Big Ideas
("Harnessing the Data Revolution"). This work will focus on a problem of
sequential decision making, in which data that arrive incrementally must be
assembled into a coherent whole despite inconsistencies; the specific focus will
be a recently-introduced approach to low-rank matrix completion. In both areas,
the project will involve PhD students. The junior scientists involved in this
research will gain experience and breadth in both mathematics and a key
application area.

The project's first thrust will explore the nonlinear mechanics of two-
dimensional "Maxwell lattices." These are, by definition, periodic lattice
structures in which the average number of edges meeting a node is four; the
well-known Kagome lattice is a favorite example. Maxwell lattices are
interesting because they are, in most cases, elastically degenerate. A large
literature has developed concerning their linearly elastic behavior; however the
nonlinear mechanics of these structures is still poorly understood, even for
deformations with little or no strain. The project's first thrust will use
methods from nonlinear homogenization and the calculus of variations to explore
the nonlinear mechanics of Maxwell lattices. The project's second thrust will
explore a recently introduced approach to low-rank matrix completion. This
approach relies on a two-person, zero-sum, sequential game analogous to the
model of online machine learning known as "prediction with expert advice." The
principal investigator recently used methods from optimal control to achieve
fresh insight concerning prediction with expert advice; it is expected that
control-based methods will also be useful for matrix completion.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
