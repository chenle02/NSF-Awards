Abstract

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

Efficient numerical methods, albeit classical, which were developed for atoms,
to describe multi-electron systems which can not be treated by quantum methods,
will be extended to molecules. Here the different electron and nuclear
timescales add another level of complexity. This study will probe attosecond
dynamics in these larger systems, offering a new perspective on the dynamics of
electrons in intense fields. Hence this work will contribute new knowledge for
the development of Attosecond Science, a new direction in applications of
ultrafast laser science, with applications to biology, chemistry, physics,
plasma science, and nuclear physics.
