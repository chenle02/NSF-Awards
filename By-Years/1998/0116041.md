With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Akron will acquire a X-ray
diffractometer with CCD detector for single crystal diffractometry. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: a)
cyclyne and heterocyclyne chemistry; b) metal-silyl complexes; c) synthesis and
characterization of electron deficient, organometallic compounds; d)
coordination polymers as zeolite analogs; and e) the preparation, understanding
and utilization of dendritic macromolecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray
diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a
number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient catalysts and
materials chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
