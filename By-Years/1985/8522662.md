Ohio State University will establish and Engineering Research Center for Net
Shape Manufacturing to focus on improving the engineering knowledge base for net
shape manufacturing of parts. The goal of the Center is to enhance the
competitive position of U.S. industry through improvement of the engineering
knowledge base and training of engineers in net shape manufacturing processes.
The Center's research program will seek to integrate part design, material
selection, and process selection, design, and control. Specific projects will be
selected, pursued, and monitored in collaboration with industry. Undergraduate
education will be included in the Center through honors research and seminars,
cooperative education, and summer internships. Graduate education will focus
upon master's and doctorate programs, with corporate-named fellowships to
improve the participation of U.S. citizens in the programs. Students will also
spend some time on location in the research facilities of participating
companies. The Center will also extend its educational influence through a
consortium of Ohio colleges and universities with manufacturing programs.
