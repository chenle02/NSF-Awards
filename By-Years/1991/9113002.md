The proposed research may be nominally divided into two parts. The first area
is concerned with the synthesis and study of layered phosphonates. The chemistry
outlined is a mixture of synthetic chemistry and solid-state NMR. The second
area is concerned with synthesis and study of layered systems for light induced
charge separation or electron transfer. The proposed studies have important
relevance in many fields of science and engineering.
