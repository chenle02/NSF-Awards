This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I Project will
further develop a nanostructure technology for use as the active material of a
fiber optic laser. Prior research has demonstrated that self-organized III-V
semiconductor nanostructures grown on GaAs (gallium arsenide) substrate can
operate as the gain region of a 1.3 micron wavelength laser, and that these
structures are effective in realizing vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers
(VCSELs). 1.3 micron VCSELs are a key device for high speed fiber optic links
for use in Ethernet and other metro access and metro applications. This project
will have access to a high quality epitaxial growth facility with the capability
to grow the III-V nanostructures and VCSEL mirrors and to develop a broad range
of electronic and optoelectronic device materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial application of this project is in the fiber optics communications
market. It is estimated that the market for a 1.3 micron VCSEL could reach close
to $1 billion within the next 10 years.
