Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) has proved useful in
isolating proteins present in trace amounts from complex mixtures. The objective
of this award is to characterize and map several IMA-adsorbents and to use the
results of these studies to formulate and test protocols for the isolation of
proteins from crude mixtures using cascade mode multi-affinity chromatography
(CASMAC). The first goal is to characterize new gels with regard to chelating
agents, metal ions and chromatography conditions. Among other methods,
adsorption isotherms and NMR will be used. Secondly, these gels will be mapped
using retention studies of amino acids, and model peptides and proteins.
Thirdly, the investigators plan to develop and test protocols that allow
fractionation of complex protein mixtures using CASMAC. It is anticipated that
this work will result in making adsorbents available to the scientific community
for both IMAC and CASMAC that offer incremental affinities for proteins and
peptides, and that are specifically targeted for interaction with different
amino acid side groups. Further the investigators plan to develop a rational
approach using a series of affinity techniques to separate complex protein
mixtures effectively.
