This award supplements support provided for Vogtmann's research under
DMS-8702070 with K. S. Brown as principal investigator. It will enable her to
take part in the special year in combinatorial group theory at the Mathematical
Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley, California, during the spring of 1989.
The general area of research is in topological and geometric methods in group
theory. The specific problems concern various subgroups of the group of outer
automorphisms of a finitely generated free group, and related groups. The idea
is to adapt the very beautiful and powerful techniques used in the study of
arithmetic groups to the study of these groups. One basic tool is the action of
the group of outer automorphisms of a free group on a contractible space
developed by the principal investigator and Marc Culler.
