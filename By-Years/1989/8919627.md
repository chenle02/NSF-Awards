Several fish species, besides the famous electric eel, are now known to have
electric organs, and use weak electric organ discharges (EOD) for three main
functions. Electrolocation is used both "actively" and "passively" much as a
dolphin can use hearing for both echolocation and for passive listening, and
variations in EOD are used for communication between individuals. The continual
discharge produces an electric field of a particular shape around the fish, and
the "mormyromast" class of receptors for "active" electrolocation detect
deformations in this field. These signals are sent by afferent nerves to the
mormyromast region of the electrosensory lateral-line lobe (ELL), in the
midbrain. This project concentrates on characterizing the physiology and
morphology of the different cell classes in this important area, where very
little is now known. The ease of using external artificial electric stimuli
means that many generalizable aspects of neural timing relations can be studied
in this brain circuitry. Precise morphology in this region will be needed to
understand how the anatomical local circuits contribute to the processing. The
ELL has some similarity to the cerebellum, and may well reveal equally
interesting mechanisms of timing and plasticity control. Results will be
fundamental for understanding electrosensory mechanisms, and also will have
important implications for general understanding of sensorimotor integration and
neuronal processing.
