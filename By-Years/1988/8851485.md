Equipment and instrumentation necessary to implement experiments in
fermentation, centrifugation, distillation, and control into a senior-level
chemical engineering laboratory are provided. The equipment will mimic the major
unit operations in the regionally important industry of fermentation of
agricultural products to produce ethanol as a gasoline additive. The four major
pieces of equipment are: a bench scale stirred-tank bioreactor (fermenter), a
bench scale continuous centrifuge, an eight-tray bubble-cap distillation column,
and the data acquisition instrumentation and microcomputers used to monitor and
control the distillation column. Currently, there is significant industrial
interest in the application of chemical engineering principles to
biotechnological processes. Also, with the advent of the microcomputer, new
supervisory control algorithms and data acquisition systems are being developed
and used by industry. The equipment will allow the students to gain important
hands-on experience in both of these significant areas of chemical engineering.
