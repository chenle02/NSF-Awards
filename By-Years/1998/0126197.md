In recent years, researchers have developed and studied a variety of
instructional materials that can support students learning how to conduct
investigations in project-based science classrooms, but few classroom assessment
materials and tools have been developed to support these materials. Ideally,
such assessments would give teachers a better understanding of what students
know at any point in a project in order to adjust and improve instruction. This
project will develop, test, and evaluate classroom assessments for extended
science projects that are supported by handheld computers. To develop the
assessments, the investigators will create on teams of teachers, assessment
specialists, software developers, and researchers to develop these tools. The
project will rely on a small group of teachers in the Beaufort County Public
Schools to try out the assessments. SRI researchers will evaluate factors
associated with adoption of the handheld tools in a variety of classrooms and
measure its effectiveness in improving teaching and learning. &lt;br/&gt;
