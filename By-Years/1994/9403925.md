9403925 Zhdanov The PIs will develop algorithms for better imaging, delineation
and characterization of underground structures by using electromagnetic
geophysical data. The EM migration algorithm is a stable procedure that
accurately restores the phase of the upgoing field inside the Earth. It is also
computationally efficient compared to previous techniques. The PIs will expand
the utility of their present 2D migration method and extend their method to 3D
for borehole as well as surface EM data. ****
