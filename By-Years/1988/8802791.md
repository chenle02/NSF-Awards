There is a lack of data on the performance of tilt-up wall systems during
earthquakes. This type of construction is becoming increasingly popular for
commercial and industrial buildings. This 12-week study provides for research of
tilt-up-wall buildings affected by the Whittier Narrows earthquake of October 1,
1987 and the following large aftershock of October 4, 1987. The research
provides a broad data base for follow- on efforts to evaluate the performance of
tilt-up wall systems during earthquakes. The project focuses on conducting a
field survey of tilt- up-wall buildings shaken by the earthquake and acquiring
available data on records and surveys done by others immediately after the
earthquake.
