9403359 Lau This is an award to support conduct of a conference on the quality
of models used to characterize the movement of contaminants in groundwater. This
conference is being jointly supported by the Environmental Protection Agency and
involves participation by other Federal agencies, Principal Investigators of
projects supported by the National Science Foundation and a consortium of six
water research institutes in the Pacific Northwest and Oceania (Hawaii, Alaska,
Guam/Micronesia, Idaho, Oregon and Washington). Results of this conference are
expected to provide guidance in providing support for research needed to improve
the efficacy and utility of groundwater models now used in engineering design of
systems for remediation of contaminated groundwater. ***
