9415318 Ergas This is an award to support preliminary work on the potential use
of hydrophobic membranes in a biofiltration process for removing volatile
organic potential air pollutants from gaseous byproducts of chemical and process
industries. The investigator plans on designing a laboratory scale membrane
biofiltration system that will utilize either microporous or dense polymer
hollow-fiber membranes to transfer the target volatile organic substances to a
liquid medium. Biodegradation of the compounds is expected to occur on the
membrane as well as in the liquid phase. The proposal leading to this award was
submitted in response to NSF 93-130, Research Planning Grants for Women. Results
are expected to provide information that can be used in determining the
feasibility of the process and the basis for a more comprehensive research
project that would determine conditions and engineering design parameters for
this process to remove potential air pollutants from gaseous byproducts of
industrial processes. ***
