Abstract: Two competing Extreme Digital computing XD proposals for the design of
the next generation of Teragrid cyberinfrastructure are being developed for
consideration as the preferred approach. This work is being influenced by
international factors such as the Engineering Grids for e-Science (EGEE) and the
European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) high performance communities as well as the
Teragrid and Open Science Grid programs within the United States. It is
therefore extremely important to accurately capture and coherently translate a
comprehensive set of requirements that will be used to benchmark the key
performance parameters, interface trade-offs and the associated modularity of
XD?s long-term evolution to support an open architecture for applied distributed
computing.
