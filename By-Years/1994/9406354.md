9406354 Stark The cuticle of higher plants functions primarily as a protective
barrier for the leaves and fruit, controlling bacterial and fungal attack as
well as the diffusion of water and chemicals. Its major chemical constituents
are waxes that provide waterproofing and either of two insoluble structural
polymers, cutin and suberin. Our objectives are to understand how the monomer
units of cutin and suberin are linked together, how the polymers are embedded
within wax or cell-wall matrices, and how their supramolecular architecture is
related to cuticular function. Several new spectroscopic and biochemical
initiatives are proposed: (1) the effects of temperature stress on tomato
cuticle function and flexibility will be monitored by measuring its permeability
and conducting solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments; (2)
the effects of swelling on the cuticular netting will be assessed with 13C and
2H NMR measurements on the cutin and water, respectively; (3) oligomeric
fragments of fruit cutin and potato suberin will be produced enzymatically and
identified using high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and
solution-state NMR; (4) the development and molecular structure of suberin
within wound-healing potato tissue will be examined using both uniform and
selective 13C and 2H labelling, in conjunction with advanced 13C and double-
resonance NMR experiments. %%% Our overall goal is to understand the chemical
structures that make the outer cuticular skin of fruits resilient and resistant
to pathogenic attack, especially under conditions of environmental stress. By
studying the biosynthesis and structural development of suberin that forms on
the surface of wounded plant tissue, we also hope to design methods to enhance
this protective process. Since polymeric mixtures are involved in both of these
cuticular membranes, our research may have future applications in the design of
synthetic coating (waterproofing) and composites (adhesives). ***
