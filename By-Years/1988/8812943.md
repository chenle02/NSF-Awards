The ability of membranes to separate proteins on the basis of molecular weight
is much less than would be expected from the properties of the membranes alone.
Generally proteins must differ by at least an order of magnitude to be
efficiently separated by ultrafiltration. Various phenomena have been suggested
in the literature to explain this, including such things as gel-layer formation,
adsorption of the protein on the membrane, too broad a pore size distribution,
formation of protein complexes, etc. This project will focus on a systematic
experimental variation of the most important parameters affecting the membrane
separation of two proteins with the goal of identifying the actual phenomena of
most importance. If successful, this project should lead to the design of
improved membranes and improved operating procedures for more efficient membrane
separation of proteins. This accomplishment would help remove a major
engineering roadblock to the commercialization of biotechnology advances of the
last decade.
