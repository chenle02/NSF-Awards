The possibility of using a scanning tunneling microscope configuration as a
high-speed, ultra-microscopic, pattern generator exists because of (i) the
unusual physics involved in forming the beam, (ii) recent advances in novel
resist materials and processes, and (iii) the possibility of engineering an
array of beams. The advantages of such a system are that the normal limits
imposed by space-charge and lens aberrations are absent and that proximity
effects are eliminated. Some very preliminary experiments have already resulted
in some primitive patterns with sub-0.1 um lines. The proposed research is to
investigate:
