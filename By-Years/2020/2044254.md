The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation
â€“Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is the availability of a new wheelchair
system which automatically cycles users through different postures, preventing
the formation of soft tissue pressure injuries by systematically off-loading
pressure on high-risk body regions. Pressure injuries are deep, penetrating
wounds found under the buttocks, on the sacrum, and shoulder blades. This unique
wheelchair design creates movement profiles that are not currently possible in
existing, commercial wheelchairs. These movements can be linked to sensor
feedback and can be tuned to provide personalized care. This new device, with
its automatic movements, will be beneficial to those with brain injury, stroke,
or spinal cord injury as well as the geriatric population, particularly those
with cognitive impairments and the health care facilities who care for them.
Pressure injuries severely compromise the health of individuals, result in
lengthy recovery times, and lead to enormous healthcare costs. Prevention of
pressure injuries positively impacts the health and well-being of the user and
will reduce the healthcare burden to society. This system also has the potential
to facilitate new rehabilitation and therapeutic
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will yield an innovative new
wheelchair system that will prevent pressure injuries by automatically shifting
the body position and pressures based on sensor feedback located at high risk
regions for wound formation. The shifting of body positions and off-loading of
pressure will be achieved through a novel, multi-segmented actuator-driven
wheelchair system that is capable of new motions not possible with commercially
available wheelchairs. Adaptation to a mobile wheelchair with a footprint
equivalent to existing wheelchairs will occur as part of this project.
Additional work will include automation and an appropriate user interface
developed with in-depth user testing. The integration of multi-sensor feedback
with an articulating algorithm will enable automatic adjustment of the positions
based on sensor output, thus creating an optimal personalized protocol for the
user. Off-loading pressure on high risk areas facilitates increased blood
perfusion and decreased tissue stresses, directly addressing risk factors
associated with pressure injury formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
