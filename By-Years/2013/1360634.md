In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Barry Trost of Stanford University is developing catalytic
reactions for the synthesis of complex molecules. The research is addressing
limitations of raw materials and environmental concerns that require attention
by focusing on an important but frequently overlooked issue - atom economy, i.e.
the development of reactions in which, to the greatest extent possible, any
stoichiometric by-products are minimized and, in the ideal case, eliminated so
that the product is the sum of the reactants with any additional reagent being
required only catalytically. This proposal explores inventing new paradigms of
reactivity. For example, drug discovery programs at pharmaceutical companies
have emerged as a result of Professor Trost's invention of new synthetic
methods.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposal outlines a broad study to create new
paradigms of reactivity. Two general areas of transition metal catalysis will be
explored, that of palladium and ruthenium. The goal is the generation of atom
economical methods. The program involving palladium explores for the first time
novel substrate types for C-C bond formation. It focuses on an unexpected ligand
effect and the impact of substrate selection, especially using substrates
bearing nitrogen heteroatoms which, at first glance, would be expected to fail.
The program involving ruthenium explores the design of the structure of the
catalyst to enable reactivity and selectivity which previously did not exist. It
envisions novel ways to carbo- and nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles. It proposes
the generation of carbenoids, important reactive intermediates, by simple
isomerization of readily available propargyl derivatives thereby avoiding the
almost universal use of hazardous diazo compounds.
