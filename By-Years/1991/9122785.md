Solid waste disposal is becoming increasingly expensive in terms of landfill and
labor costs as well as environmental costs. Yet, most residents pay no
additional cost per unit of trash put out for collection, and thus view disposal
as free. An alternative approach would rely instead on prices as an incentive to
recycle waste. The purpose of this project is to develop both an analytical
model and empirical analysis for analyzing the joint problem of charging a
direct fee for garbage collection to encourage recycling and at the same time
avoiding improper disposal methods such as illegal burning and dumping. This
research is important because it will shed light on the issues related to
pricing incentives for the recycling of solid wastes. Expressions will be
derived for the optimal price per unit of garbage collection as a function of
the city's cost of landfill disposal, additional environmental costs, the value
of recycling, and the extent to which residents respond with illegal dumping.
The empirical approach involves collecting data directly from 160 cities, over
half of which have recently instituted per unit trash collection fees. These new
data will be combined with census data to estimate the demand for trash
collection services as a function of its price, household income and other
characteristics, the availability of curbside recycling collection, and other
variables.
