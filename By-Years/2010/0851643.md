This REU site is a renewal of Georgia Institute of Technology's Summer
Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) program. Ten undergraduate students
over a ten-week period will be involved in hands-on research in electrical and
computer engineering areas (including optoelectronics, integrated circuits and
devices, and digital signal processing). To assist in the growth of the
undergraduate students, each participant will be paired with both a faculty
advisor and graduate student research mentor. In addition, every SURE student
will also be paired with a graduate student "social" mentor.

The REU program will be comprised of four main components: 1) in-depth
laboratory experiences; 2) local industrial site visits and social trips; 3)
synergistic workshops and seminars; and 4) oral and written research summaries
prepared by the student participants. A broad range of social and cultural
activities will be critical to fostering a sense of community within the
undergraduate student group. A set of workshops and seminars will assist in
their development as researchers, improve their technical writing and
presentation skills, and expose them to technical research projects across the
ECE field, and expand their knowledge of graduate programs and the process of
applying to graduate school.

Recruitment efforts will be focused on attracting women and underrepresented
minority participants to the program. The overall goal of the SURE program is to
encourage and motivate participants to enroll in a graduate school of study
after receiving their Bachelor?s degrees.
