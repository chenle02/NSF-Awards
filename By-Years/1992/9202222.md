Recent advances in the synthesis of artificially structured solids will be
applied to the fabrication of one-dimensional structures, granular solids, and
nanocomposite materials, all of which have been found to exhibit new and
excitingly physical properties. Unique and enhanced properties are expected to
result from the extremely small size and structures, the prominent roles of
surfaces and interfaces, the extra degrees of freedom, and the nanocomposite
nature of the solids. The unique perpendicular magnetic and conducting
properties of the one-dimensional structures, and the magnetic, mechanical, and
other nanostructure-induced properties of materials consisting of ultrafine
particles are emphasized. The methods of synthesis and processing in this work
include nuclear particle track technology in conjunction with electrodeposition
for the one-dimensional structures, high-rate sputtering of granular metal
films, and electrodeposition of particulate composites. Some of these materials
have already demonstrated promising properties for applications such as
interconnects in a electronic packaging, perpendicular magnetic and magneto-
optical storage media, and environment resistant surfaces and coatings.
