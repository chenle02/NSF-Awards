The primary objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a scalable strained
silicon technology that is integrated with advanced front-end processes. The
scalability of the proposed approach is due to its applicability not only in
planar bulk devices but also in a) strained silicon directly on oxide (SSOI) and
in b) a novel double gate strained MOSFET (SSDG) that will be described in the
proposal. The research will focus on strained Si layers since mobility
enhancement can be obtained in both p-channel and n-channel devices. The program
will consist of three research thrusts: a) Epitaxy of Strained Silicon layers,
b) Advanced Gate stacks on Strained Silicon Layers and c) Device Demonstration.
Since ITRS predicts the need for enhanced channel mobility by 2010, we believe
initiation of this research effort in a timely manner is especially critical.
The program is expected to stimulate innovation in development of alternative
gate stack and junction processes suitable for strained layers. The program will
take advantage of the diverse backgrounds of its investigators who have been
working on advanced materials and processes for gate stacks, ultra-shallow
junctions and low temperature epitaxy of Si and Si1-xGex
alloys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the education and outreach
activities, we plan to provide an enriching research experience for graduate
students with emphasis on nanoscale materials and devices and establish a
collaborative and interdisciplinary group research environment. We will also
create a course on beyond planar devices for the graduate curriculum.
Opportunities will also be provided for undergraduate students to get involved
in the research through existing REU programs.&lt;br/&gt;
