This project is to study dispersive estimates for Schroedinger's equation.
These estimates are basic to recent developments in the mathematical analysis of
Schroedinger's equation and its nonlinear variants. The aim of this project is
to obtain minimal regularity and spatial decay conditions on potentials that
imply dispersive estimates in each dimension n and to use these results to study
related issues including results for nonlinear Schroedinger-type equations.

Schroedinger equations govern the evolution of wave functions in quantum
mechanics. Nonlinear analogues are of importance in chemistry and the
transmission of information in fiber optic cables. This research will provide
mathematical information about the processes involved in quantum mechanics and
the applications of quantum physics.
