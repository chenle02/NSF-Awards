This proposal is for partial funding for the Fourth International Conference on
Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Populations in Biological Systems that
will be held at the campus of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, on
October 4-6, 2013. The conference will provide a venue that will foster new
collaborations that stimulate novel ideas, advancing the field of mathematical
modeling in the analysis of populations across several biological levels.
Specific topics to be addressed include: cell signaling, chemotaxis,
epidemiology, species range shifts, and macroecology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinary collaborations are crucial in developing
applications pertaining to human health and biodiversity conservation in our
rapidly changing world. This conference will bring together researchers and
students at all levels from multiple disciplines to foster such collaborations
and to identify areas of common ground linking otherwise relatively disparate
research areas. Special efforts have been taken to include members of
underrepresented groups at all levels. The results of the conference will be
disseminated via a conference website and a special issue in the Journal of
Biological Dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;
