Bryn Mawr College and Purdue University are creating a set of upper level
undergraduate course materials in the emerging multidisciplinary area of science
of information. Materials and course modules developed during this project lead
students to an understanding of the concept of "information" that transcends
boundaries between disciplines, especially between physical and life sciences,
communication, and knowledge extraction from massive datasets. The course
materials ground the study of information in concrete computational models.

The past six decades have brought information theory to the crossroads of
several traditional disciplines: mathematics, statistics, computer science,
physics, biology, and electrical engineering. A repository of tangible, hands-on
course modules is helping students, faculty, and researchers draw upon the
latest discoveries from multiple disciplines, replicate recent research, and
learn to apply the techniques and tools of information-based inquiry in their
lives.

The resources and infrastructure of the NSF STC Center for Science of
Information (CSoI) are being used to maximize the educational impact of this
project, including a focus on increasing diversity, gender and ethnic balance,
and broadening of participation. Workshops are being conducted to train faculty
in the use of the course materials.
