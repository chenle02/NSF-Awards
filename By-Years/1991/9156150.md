This project is developing a curriculum and laboratory manual for a CCD-based
imaging astronomy laboratory for first and second year undergraduate science
majors. Students are learning how to plan observations, acquire and correct CCD
images, and perform sophisticated image analysis. The goal of the laboratory is
to allow students to share in the excitement and challenge of scientific
discovery using modern instruments and procedures, and to avoid the tedium and
observational limitations of traditional techniques. The use of modern low- cost
instruments allows students to concentrate on the astronomical significance of
the observations rather than mastery of detailed telescope operations and
photographic techniques. Although most of the equipment for the laboratory was
already available, the project provided modest funds for computer equipment to
allow enhanced image analysis and a CD- ROM system for laboratories using the
HST guide star catalog and Voyager planetary images. The laboratory manual is
being written to accommodate for a variety of CCD/telescope systems and will be
made available for wide distribution when completed.
