This program will study the mechanics and implications of black hole accretion
in passively evolving spiral galaxies using a unique sample of disk galaxies
hosting water megamasers in their nuclei. Feeding of the black hole will be
assessed by measuring the kinematics of the masers from scales of tens of
parsecs down to tenths of parsecs. Dr. Greene will compare the stellar and
gaseous kinematics on 20 parsec scales from adaptive-optics plus integral-field
spectroscopy, to the orientation of the megamaser disk on sub-parsec scales, to
learn how the gas accretes onto the disk. She will determine whether secular
(long-term) evolution leads to tight correlations between black hole mass and
galaxy properties, including bulge kinematics, galaxy mass, and dark halo
mass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergraduate and graduate students, outreach via public lectures, and teaching
math to inmates through the Prison Teaching Initiative.
