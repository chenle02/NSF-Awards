In this CAREER award, co-funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division and the Condensed Matter Physics Program of the
Division of Materials Research, Prof. Thomas G. Mason of the University of
California, Los Angeles and his graduate and undergraduate research students
produce macroscopic quantities of microscopic, colloidal particles of defined
geometry, using lithographic methods. The behavior of these assemblies of
particles will be studied, using a variety of techniques, with an eye towards
answering important outstanding questions about the phase behavior, non-
equilibrium glassy behavior, and assembly of systems of interacting nonspherical
particles.

In addition to his research activities, Prof. Mason will develop a new,
interdisciplinary, undergraduate laboratory course in colloidal dynamics. This
laboratory course will use a significant number of instruments donated by
ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. Prof. Mason will also participate
in programs sponsored by UCLA's Center X to do outreach to disadvantaged K-12
students in the Los Angeles area, many of these students coming from groups
traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.
