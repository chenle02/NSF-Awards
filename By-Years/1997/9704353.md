9704353 Yang This project deals with research at the interface between geometric
topology and number theory. More specifically, the investigator is to study the
functional equations of the classical polylogarithms and to relate this to the
grassman polylogarithms; and to investigate the close relationship between
hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the Bloch group in algebraic K-theory. One important
question to be addressed is the realization of elements in Bloch group by
hyperbolic manifolds - a solution to this question has a direct bearing on the
K3 rigidity conjecture. Hyperbolic 3-manifolds are important building blocks of
three-dimensional manifolds or curved spaces in general. These are negatively
curved spaces generalizing the non-Euclidean plane geometries. Many hyperbolic
3-manifolds can be given as quotients of the standard 'flat' hyperbolic three
space by certain discrete symmetry groups, and this observation allows
researchers to use algebraic techniques to study hyperbolic manifolds.
