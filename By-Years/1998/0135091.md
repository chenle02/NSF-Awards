Professor Jennifer Shepherd, of the Department of Chemistry at Gonzaga
University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
her research that involves the elucidation of rhodoquinone (RQ) biosynthesis in
the purple non-sulfur bacteria, Rhodospirillum rubrum and later in the nematode,
Caenorhabditis elegans. RQ is an essential electron carrier in the anaerobic
energy metabolism of both of these species as well as in the helminth parasites.
Parasitic infections pose a serious health threat to both humans and domestic
animals. There are few effective anthelminthic agents available due to the
emergence resistant parasite strains. The Pl plans to develop new anthelminthic
agents that selectively target RQ biosynthesis in parasites.

The teaching portion of this proposal focuses utilizing undergraduates and
postdoctoral students in teaching and research. Therefore, with the support of
the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Jennifer Shepherd,
of the Department of Chemistry at Gonzaga will use small projects within the
specific aims of the research project to train undergraduates and larger scope
projects for post doctoral associates.
