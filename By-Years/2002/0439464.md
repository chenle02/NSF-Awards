0439464&lt;br/&gt;Saggere&lt;br/&gt;In this novel design, a retinal prosthesis
is comprised of an array of microfluidic dispensers. The two principal
components of each dispenser unit are: a light driven micro-actuator and a tiny
fluid chamber connected to micronozzles that open up to the top surface of the
device on one side. The light-driven microactuator serves as the prime mover for
each fluid dispenser. When irradiated by light, the microactuator bends in the
direction away from the incident light resulting in increased pressure in the
chamber and ultimately ejection of fluid stored in the chamber through the
micronozzles. The amount of fluid ejected and the rate of ejection will be
regulated by the intensity and energy available in the incident light. The
ultimate goal of this concept would be to relate the light information reaching
the retina to the chemical signals communicated to the retinal neurons.
