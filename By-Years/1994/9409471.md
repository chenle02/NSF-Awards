9409471 Cheng The objectives of this project are to improve existing
hydrodynamic transport models, to develop efficient approaches to
nonequilibrium/hot-electron energy/momentum distribution functions in single-and
multi-valley bandstructures, to study the fundamental transport phenomena and
limitations of device operation at small scales, to explore new device
structures, and to improve device performance. The approach is based on the
concept of a "hydro-kinetic" distribution which is interpolated between the
Boltzmann (kinetic) transport equation and hydro-dynamic equations. The
developed models can properly account for effects, which have never been
successfully included in modeling high-speed semiconductor devices. In addition,
the efficient hydro-kinetic approach is useful of analysis of FET gate current,
electron injection between heterojunctions, and device reliability, associated
with hot-electron phenomena. Success of this proposed project will result in a
new understanding of these effects and will bring in new concepts and structures
to improve device performance and reliability. ***
