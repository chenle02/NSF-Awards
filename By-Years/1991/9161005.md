A method of beverage (wine, fruit juice) deoxygenation has been developed using
electrochemically regenerated metal chelates to remove the oxygen from a
recycling gas stream. The gas stream which is used to deoxygenate the beverage
is fed to the electrochemically regenerated metal chelate solution where the
oxygen is selectively removed. The gas is then returned to the beverage to
further deoxygenate the fluid. The system has the advantage that flavor
components are not removed. The reaction of the metal chelates with the oxygen
is not completely effficient, resulting in the production of off-flavors. This
project addresses this chemistry which must be improved before the system can be
practical. Metal chelate chemistry in the presence of oxygen and beverage flavor
components is to be studied.
