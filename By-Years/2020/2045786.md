This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant establishes an integrated
research and education plan to re-design existing artificial intelligence (AI)
algorithms to facilitate multi-task learning on holistic transportation
problems, while removing bottlenecks to model interpretability. The research
plan will result in an open-source platform that hosts models that are fast,
scalable and able to multi-task on different transportation problems. The
platform developed has the potential to create fundamentally new sources of data
to speed up the safe introduction of autonomous and connective vehicle
technologies across different transportation modes. In addition, educational
strategies such as inquiry-based learning are used to address gaps in workforce
development and systemic imbalances that continue to perpetuate long-held
deficit views of communities of color. Unique opportunities for outreach and
education will also be created through open-source software development,
interactive workshops, and curriculum development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
main thrusts of the project include the following: i) investigate novel edge and
distributed cloud computing methods to develop a massive, parallel data platform
purposefully built for deploying AI algorithms on big data; ii) investigate new
architectures for deploying multipurpose machine learning algorithms, which will
enable the development of a decision support system that is interactive and
collaborative - with abilities to respond to questions via voice, text, or web
interactions and continuously learn from a human expert to enable it to improve
its performance over time; and iii) develop a framework for infusing
explainability at every stage of the AI lifecycle (training, testing,
deployment) by integrating rule-based learning into the building blocks of the
multipurpose model â€“ this will provide insight and visibility into black-box AI
algorithms, allowing humans to play an active part of the AI process and course-
correct when needed. In pursuing these objectives, this CAREER project draws
inspiration from theories of deep learning and adaptive computing to design and
deploy an end-to-end transportation systems management
solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
