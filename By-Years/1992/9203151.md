The Fellow will study cycling of high-field-strength elements in the mantle by
inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. An important component to the
theory of plate tectonics is the cycling of material from the mantle to the
crust at ocean ridges, and back into the mantle at subduction zones. High-field
strength elements (HFSE) will be used to study basalts erupted at volcanic arcs,
where they tend to be low in HFSE, and basalts erupted on oceanic islands that
tend to be enriched in HFSE. This study should evaluate the hypothesis that
major basaltic volcanism on Earth is part of a cycle, formed at ocean ridges,
subducted at ocean trenches, undergoes reactions that lead to arc volcanism, and
eventually resurfaces as plumes feeding ocean islands. The Fellow will spend her
fellowship tenure at Cornell University.
