The filamentous fungi are organisms of unusual importance. They are the major
cause of plant diseases. As producers of mycotoxins in infected plant products,
they cause significant losses of agricultural products and are a grave health
concern for man and animals. Fungi are the primary organisms responsible for the
decomposition of woody plant tissues and hold the potential for bioconversion of
plant waste into valuable products. Fungi form associations with plants that
enhance plant productivity and fungi are important producers of both foods and
medicines. Thus, increase fungal research efforts are warranted, both to
decrease the damage that fungi cause to plants and to increase their potential
to enhance the value of plant products. Recently, Texas A&amp;M University has
made a concerted effort to attract scientists with common interests in fungal
biology. We recognize the potential for future scientific breakthroughs in the
manipulation of fungi for the benefit of society. Our goal is for Texas A&amp;M
to become a leader in fungal biology research as it relates to plant biology. To
this end, we have established interactions between research groups investigating
diverse problems in fungal biology. Scientists graduating from this program will
have an immediate impact in areas of critical importance for agricultural,
industrial, environmental, and governmental needs.
