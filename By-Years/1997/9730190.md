A problem inherent in all peace treaties and other types of multi-party
agreements is the uncertainty of whether the participants have negotiated in
good faith and remain committed to the contract. We use advances in
macroeconomic theory to show that the unobservable intentions of treaty
participants may be accurately reflected in the behavior of economic variables
during the time of the treaty. In particular, the warring governments' budget
constraints imply that any information concerning the probability of war will be
quickly translated into asset prices, exchange rates, and the overall price
level. Using this theoretical information with recent advances in time-series
econometrics, the authors provide an easily implementable strategy that they
argue can be used to monitor the validity of agreements made by warring parties.
This information is less costly and less dangerous to obtain than the common
strategy of searching for troop movement and armaments, and may be a leading
indicator of such activities. The authors assert that the knowledge could
prevent monitoring agencies from committing troops to support a cease-fire that
the combatants do not intend to uphold. The project itself uses this approach in
a systematic analysis of a series of treaties over the past 300 years to produce
a deeper understanding of the complex interaction of unobservable political
intentions, expectations, and economic variables. The goal of the research is to
determine the extent to which one can accurately impute participants' intentions
from an analysis of data available during the time of the treaty.
