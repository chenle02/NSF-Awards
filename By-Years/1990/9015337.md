In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
calculations will be performed to help increase the understanding of electron
interactions within atoms and molecules. As a result of this work it will be
possible to calculate certain physical properties of atoms and molecules, such
as bond dissociation energies or electronic spectra. Quantum Monte Carlo
techniques will be used to compute the ground state energies of molecules and
heavy atoms and to study the reaction between molecular hydrogen and fluorine
atom. The proposed techniques include both the Green's function and variational
Monte Carlo approaches and are expected to yield highly accurate treatments of
the electron correlation effects in these systems. Of particular interest is the
inclusion of backflow correlations which enables local current conservation
conditions to be satisfied.
