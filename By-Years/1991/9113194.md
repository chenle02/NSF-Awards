This award provides funds that will aid in the acquisition of computer equipment
and software by an outstanding group of biochemists and organic chemists at
Brandeis University. The instrumentation will be used to aid in the research
training of graduate students working in the emerging area of bioorganic
chemistry. Increasingly, organic chemists and biochemists have come to realize
that their disciplines have much to learn from and offer to each other. At
Brandeis, such cross fertilization occurs in the context of research programs in
areas as diverse as the study of enzyme mechanisms, synthesis of natural
products and pharmaceuticals, molecular recognition, and the role of solvent
molecules in chemical reactions. Work in these areas depends heavily of the use
of computers for analysis and interpretation of experimental data, and, as well,
the formulation of new lines of inquiry. The equipment acquired through this
award will insure that the training of a new generation of investigators will
proceed in an environment with adequate state of the art computational
facilities.
