This award will support a conference on the Numerical Solution of Volterra
Equations. It is to be held on May 25-28, 1990 on the campus of Arizona State
University in Tempe, AZ. Volterra equations include functional differential
equations, Volterra integral equation, and Volterra integro-differential
equations. The conference will have three main themes: convergences and order
properties, stability analysis, and implementation problems. There will be a
panel discussion tentatively titled "Applications of Volterra Equations in
Biology and Medicine." Applied Numerical Mathematics has agreed to publish a
special issue devoted to this conference. The broad area of this conference is
applied mathematics; the specific area is numerical analysis. Volterra equations
have many applications including biomathematics, medical science, control
theory, electrodynamics, oscillation throry, and viscoelasticity.
