David Mazziotti of the University of Chicago is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to compute two-particle reduced density matrices
using recent advances in many-body theory and first-order positive definite
programming. With this new ability to treat medium- to large-sized molecules,
this methodology will provide geometries, bond polarities, excited-state
transitions, transition state structures, and potential energy surface
topologies both accurately and efficiently. Applications include molecular
dissociation, singlet-triplet splitting in carbene chemistry, and quantum phase
transitions in high-temperature metal-oxide
superconductors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will lead to new, accurate
methods for predicting chemical properties, and some aspects of the programming
may be applicable to global economic models. In addition, high school students
will be encouraged in the mathematical sciences through a new annual journal of
their own publications.
