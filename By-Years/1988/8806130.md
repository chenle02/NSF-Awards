8806130 An experimental investigation is to be carried out on jets and mixing
layers in a fluid of shallow depth. Here the usually observed organized vortex
structures have a horizontal length scale very much larger than the shallow
depth of the flow in the vertical direction. This vertical constraint on mixing
has not been explored previously, yet this constraint is one very frequently
encountered in various geophysical and environmental mixing situations. Hot film
and laser anemometry will be used to supply velocity and concentration fields.
