Dissimilation of sinking organic aggregates is a central issue in the
regulation of carbon fluxes from the ocean's surface into its depths. The role
of attached bacteria in particle decomposition has been unclear. High
concentrations (108-109 ml-1) of slowly growing bacteria commonly found on
aggregates create intense ectohydrolase activities which rapidly solubilize
(0.2-2.1 d turnover time) particulate combined amino acids but allow most
hydrolysate to be released into seawater. This "uncoupled solubilization",
particularly if it applies generally to aggregate's carbon pool, could have
profound implications for downward flux of carbon. Using SCUBA collected marine
snow and laboratory-made 14C labeled phytodetritus aggregates studies will 1)
quantify DOC release (measured by high temperature catalytic oxidation) and POC
turnover rates and how they vary with variation in colonization and enzyme
activities on aggregates. 2) characterize the released DOC in terms of molecular
size distribution (with molecular sieves), whether it contains colloids and sub-
micron particles (by transmission electron microscopy), and whether some of it
is refractory to bacterial utilization (or has long turnover time); 3) test
whether enzyme action on aggregates causes differential solubilization of C, N
and P. This work will be done on aggregates collected in waters off La Jolla,
Santa Barbara, and at several offshore stations in Southern California Bight
during 4 cruises. The proposed study will contribute to an understanding of the
role of attached bacteria in POC DOC transition and hence in carbon cycling in
the ocean.
