This award supports the research of Professor Boris G. Moishezon at Columbia
University. It is a three year continuing grant made jointly by the Algebra and
Number Theory and Geometric Analysis Programs in the Division of Mathematical
Sciences. Although he is not old, Professor Moishezon is considered one of the
"old masters" in transcendental algebraic geometry. This is the area where the
sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations are studied from the point of
view of their geometric and topological properties. He continues to obtain very
original and insightful results about them. The research during this grant will
undoubtably carry on this fine tradition.
