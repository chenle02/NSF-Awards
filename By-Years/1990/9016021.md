Mathematical objects of the same category often come in two varieties: regular
ones, which are easy to describe or classify, or have some "nice" properties;
and the irregular, more elusive ones. A good example are homomorphisms on C(?0,
1!) into some Banach algebra: one would think of the continuous ones as regular,
the discontinuous ones as irregular. It happens (as in the above example) that
the existence of irregular objects in a given category can neither be proved nor
disproved, at least with the help of only universally accepted mathematical
tools (as formalized in axiomatic set theory). The research of this project
focuses on three methods to extend the toolkit of mathematics in a way that
allows elimination of certain irregular objects: - the Axiom of Determinacy,
which says that there are no irregular (i.e., undetermined) games of sorts, -
the Open Coloring Axiom, which says that certain irregular partitions do not
exist, - assumptions that mathematics takes place in certain "harmless forcing
extensions" of the constructible universe. The relative strength of these
methods is to be determined and possible improvements and new applications of
them sought.
