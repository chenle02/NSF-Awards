While scanning electron micrographs are common in science textbooks, most
students are limited to using light microscopes in laboratory exercises. This
makes these text references abstract and prevents students from understanding
them fully. Hands-on experience with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) can
make this information more concrete. In order to provide this experience, the
college is buying an SEM and supporting equipment for use in the science
curriculum. This project enables science instructors to offer effective,
innovative laboratory experiences to freshman and sophomore science students.
Science students can use this technology in the existing curriculum, and
instructors can produce instruction materials for use in their classes. The SEM
is also be used to offer workshops for local secondary science teachers who need
in-service training or who desire professional growth.
