This CAREER award deals with research that aims to explore time-dependent
carrier dynamics and nonlinear optical effects in semiconductor quantum wells
(QWs) in the THz frequency range with novel techniques for generating and
shaping intense multi-cycle THz pulses. Exploiting syntheses of arbitrary THz
pulses, the proposed experimental schemes focus on precise and coherent control
of quantum wavepacket dynamics representing internal transitions of confined
excitons and intersubband transitions in semiconductor QWs. Quantum coherences
and nonlinear responses of the fundamental excitations will be investigated by
manipulating and monitoring temporal evolution of the wavepackets via THz time-
domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) with intense multi-cycle THz pulses. THz-TDS
permits precise measurements of phase as well as amplitude of the wavepackets,
thus complete quantum information of the system can be obtained. The educational
program will use interactive Java programs to demonstrate the basic concepts and
results of the research program based on time-domain analysis of light-matter
interaction, wave propagation, and quantum wavepacket dynamics. This will be
used to contribute to course revision and development of upper-division physics
courses including courses in the Paradigms in Physics Project which will be
disseminated nationally. Funding for this award is provided by the AMOP Program
in the Physics Division in conjunction with the Condensed Matter Physics Program
in the Division of Materials Research.
