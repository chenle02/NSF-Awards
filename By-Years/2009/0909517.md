high-latitude ecosystems poses a variety of challenges to arctic peoples. In
Alaska and elsewhere in the Arctic, climate change have been linked to reduced
subsistence opportunities and increased difficulties of predicting environmental
conditions that are critical for the livelihood of residents of these regions.
In particular, changes in snow cover and ice distribution has generally had a
negative impact on travel and subsistence activities. This research team seeks
to build a partnership among scientific disciplines (social and natural science)
and indigenous peoples with a long tradition of environmental observations. A
multi- disciplinary project is planned to examine human perspectives on river
ice conditions during the winter season from freeze-up through break-up in
interior Alaska. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to
document dangerous ice conditions throughout the winter and to produce
videography and oral records of observations made by long-term local river
travelers and physical scientists. The documentation consists of oral
descriptions and video recordings of conditions. These serve as a reference for
analyzing both the physical conditions and the way participants call upon
experience and training to frame their descriptions and evaluate conditions. A
second objective is to record the observations on an existing on-line data base
to extend the longitudinal record of locations with dangerous ice that affect
the safety of winter travelers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fostering a partnership
between academic disciplines (social and natural science) the investigators seek
to obtain a broader framework for interpreting both natural phenomena and human
interpretations of these phenomena. The researchers hope that the information
gathered here and the collaborations between researchers and local people will
influence other observation efforts across the Arctic.
