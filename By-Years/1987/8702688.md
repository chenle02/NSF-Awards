Petrologic Transects Through the Western Alps: This award recommendation is made
under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the Exchange of Scientists
and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is designed to enable U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research institutions
in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia
and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected on the
basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of science, the
propsective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as well as
criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in science and
engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and engineers
who are embarking on their research careers. This research project will address
problems of high-pressure metamorphism occurring in the Western Alps, where
crustal rocks have been subjected to a wide range of pressures. It is proposed
to take advantage of that range of pressures by undertaking sampling traverses
across the structural grain of the Western Alps from the Brionconais zone to the
Dora Maira massif on the French-Italian border. The project is under the
direction of Dr. Brian E. Patrick, Department of Geological Sciences, University
of Washington, Seattle, WA 98115, U.S.A., and Professor Christian Chopin, Ecole
Normale Superieure, Laboratoire de Geologie, 46, rue d'Ulm, 75230, Paris,
France. This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,
international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if
applicable, language training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance
of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
