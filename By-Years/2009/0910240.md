This study to be conducted under the auspices of the Mathematical Association of
America (MAA) undertakes a national investigation of Calculus I to identify the
factors that contribute to student success, to understand how these factors are
leveraged within successful programs and to use the publications, committees,
and public fora of the MAA to disseminate the information and help mathematics
departments build on its insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study uses both
quantitative and qualitative methods. During the study's first phase, a large-
scale national survey of Calculus I instruction will be conducted through
mathematics departments. The study builds on the Conference Board on the
Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) studies to link the survey data with student
success. Using the epidemiological model developed by Sadler and Tai, the PIs
will examine factors such as instructor attributes, departmental focus,
classroom variables, and out of class expectations as likely explanatory
factors. A web-based student survey will also be conducted. Data will be studied
through HLM analyses and institutions, course-level characteristics, and student
characteristics will all be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase II of the
project will develop a preliminary theoretical framework for institutional
models that produce successful calculus students. This informs the selection of
eight cases to be conducted in different kinds of institutions. The cases will
be analyzed using the approaches of pattern matching, explanation building, and
cross-case syntheses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is significant because the
number of calculus students has been steadily decreasing in spite of the fact
that more high school students are taking higher level mathematics courses. The
PIs state that many students leave STEM fields as undergraduates because of poor
calculus instruction. Identifying what works in college calculus instruction and
why it works and widely disseminating the information will improve student
success in calculus courses.
