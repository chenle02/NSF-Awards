Physicists' understanding of quantum mechanical phenomena has surpassed the
stage of simple observation and measurement. Advances in atomic, molecular, and
optical physics (AMO) and condensed matter physics (CM) have enabled
explorations into the control over quantum systems with a goal of achieving
quantum engineering. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers award the Physics
Frontiers Center at the Joint Quantum Institute (PFC@JQI) will build on research
conducted during the previous award to study many-body physics by the
controlling and monitoring of quantum complexity in a systematic way. This will
be done by both the intricate building and examination of materials using a wide
range of platforms spanning both AMO and CM. The PFC@JQI will continue to reach
out to underrepresented groups through programs such as the Summer Girls Program
which is a two-week intensive, hands-on physics program for high school
students. The Center will also participate in other outreach and education
programs geared to a range of audiences from the general public to K-12 students
to graduate education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PFC@JQI will investigate
experimental and theoretical areas related to quantum many-body physics at the
interface of AMO and CM. Research areas will include: studies of topological
matter (where energy bands determine the nature and behavior of the matter) such
as Majorana fermion physics and new platforms for programmable topological
matter; the use of quantum optical systems to explore many-body physics through
coupling between, or mediated by, photons in atomic or photonic media; and the
study of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of many-body interacting systems using
atomic and condensed matter systems through a close collaboration of
experimentalists and theorists.
