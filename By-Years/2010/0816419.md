The aquatic research community is rapidly equipping ecological sites with a
broad range of sensors and instruments. However, the development of aquatic
sensing networks is significantly lagging terrestrial counterparts. It is widely
recognized that an aquatic counterpart to low cost, low power, wireless radios
is needed to advance the state-of-the-art in underwater sensor networks.
Unfortunately, there are few open-architecture, low power and low cost
underwater acoustic modems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project looks at an
alternative hardware platform for wireless underwater communication.
Reconfigurable devices will be used to create a software defined acoustic modem
(SDAM) ? the underwater counterpart to software defined radios being proposed
for future generations of terrestrial communications. The SDAM can be remotely
programmed, which enables adaptive sensing capabilities and changes to the
network without physically retrieving the device. Since the communication
protocol is programmed into the modem, the same SDAM board can be used for a
variety of different underwater environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate
goal is to develop a prototype SDAM that uses a reconfigurable device for
physical layer processing. This requires careful design of a system architecture
that can communicate with the sensors, interface with acoustic transducer(s),
efficiently compute physical layer algorithms, and provide services to the rest
of the network stack. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project
center around the incorporation of embedded and reconfigurable computing systems
into course material, and the use of the SDAM for ecological research, which
enables long-term understanding of many ecological processes, including the
effects of environmental degradation and climate change on coastal and lake
ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;
