This two-year project will assist 80 early childhood (K-2) teachers in four
predominantly minority school districts in New York City. Teachers will learn
how to use computer technology to support the understanding of mathematical
concepts through inquiry-based problem solving models. Workshops will focus on
fractions, graphing, problem solving, geometry, variables, and software.
Computer emphasis will be primarily on the use of Logo to introduce mathematical
ideas. Teachers will develop a set of modules on topics which are "difficult to
learn and teach" in grades K through 2. In the first year of the project, a
series of academic year workshops will be followed by a 2-week summer institute.
In the second year, extensive in-class followup is planned, as well as a repeat
of the workshop series and the formation of a second cadre of teachers. Cost
sharing is provided at the rate of 35% of the NSF award.
