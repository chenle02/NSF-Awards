WestEd&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
addresses the suitability of available assessments for measuring what students
should know and be able to do in science using a technology-based science tests.
The investigators will design new assessments to gather evidence of complex
science learning that incorporate recent changes in the practice of science and
mathematics. They will conduct research on how to apply a new generation of
dynamic science assessments, their construct validity and compare student
performance on tasks and items in static, active, and interactive modes. The
project will provide new information on the construct validity of technology-
enhanced assessment tasks and items designed to measure complex science
learning. The investigators compare the construct validity of dynamic (both
active and interactive) assessment tasks to those of static formats intended to
measure the same complex learning. They hope to be able to identify principles
for types of science assessment task design structures that incorporate
technology to elicit knowledge of science systems and inquiry abilities. The
investigation is in collaboration with the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS). &lt;br/&gt;
