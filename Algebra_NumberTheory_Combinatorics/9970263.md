The main goal of this project is to study the following problems in commutative
algebra: 1) The Canonical Element Conjecture of Hochster, 2) Serr's Conjecture
on Intersection Multiplicity and the Chow group problem, 3) the study of
asymptotic behavior of homologies in positive characteristic and 4) the Strong
Intersection Conjecture due to Peskine and Szpiro. Each of these is a
longstanding open problem and occupies a central position in the areas of
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry may be thought of as studying
solutions of many equations in many unknowns when, typically, the solution is
not unique. The set of solutions can then be viewed geometrically, but one can
use instead encode all the pertinent information about the equations in abstract
algebraic objects called commutative rings. The two points of view interact in
beautiful and productive ways. A breakthrough method in commutative algebra that
has had explosive development in this decade is the theory of tight closure.
Part of the underlying idea is to consider the system of equations, after
sutiable modification, or the ring, modulo many different prime integers. This
is a powerful technique that has solved many problems, while opening up vast new
areas for research.
