This is a study of manufacturing enterprises in Bulgaria, 500 of them state
owned and 100 new private companies, that will examine factors associated with
success and failure over a four-year time span. Data from the first wave of this
longitudinal survey have already been collected, and subsequent waves will add
data from surveys and official sources. This study will test sociological
theories of organization ecology that predict success of enterprises is shaped
by the age of the enterprise, its size, structural inertia, dynamics of
population density, environmental imprinting, niche width, and r-versus-K
strategies. The study will also apply theories from neoclassical economics and
from several competing economic approaches. This study capitalizes upon a unique
opportunity to examine a society that is struggling to escape from totalitarian
government and a demand economy to develop the institutions of a free market.
The chief scientific goal is to test general theories of the success and failure
of enterprises in an environment of rapid social change, but the study will also
generate a substantial data base that will be of great use to many economists
and sociologists in research projects of many kinds.
