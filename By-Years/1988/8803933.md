Part I of the study will extend the application of a mathematical model that has
successfully described the structure and equation of state of quartz to the
other SiO2 minerals, cristabolite, keatite, coesite, and melanophlogite, and to
the zeolites. Part II will develop a transition state model for the
hydrolyzation of SiOSi to examine its kinetics and activation energy. Part III
will be a mathematical description of the most probable structures of
polysulfides and polythionates. These studies have strong application to the
behavior of common silicates, the production of new specific molecular sieves,
the role played by sulfur species in ore transport and in ore processing, and
the role played by polythionates in acid rain formation and stream pollution.
