9507260 Hedin A group of faculty and students at Northern Illinois University
are engaged in research with the DO collaboration who operate at the Tevatron
proton-antiproton collider at Fermilab (FNAL) and do simulation on backgrounds
to be expected in detectors at higher-energy, higher-luminosity colliders. The
model for that latter is the ATLAS detector planned for the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The group has a
particular expertise in muon detection systems including data acquisition,
calibration, trigger software and track reconstruction. As such it has important
responsibilities in the currently active upgrade of the DO detector and focuses
on analysis of related phenomena, events with muon signatures. support is prided
to three senior faculty, a junior faculty member, a postdoctoral research
associate and, in part, a senior research associate as well as two graduate
students and, as an REU supplement, two undergraduate students. ***
