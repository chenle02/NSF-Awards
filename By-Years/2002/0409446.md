Title: Collaborative Research - Small Grant for Exploratory Research: An
Interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt; Approach to Coastal Vulnerability and Community
Sustainability &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative research project offers
a unique, exploratory methodology for hazards research for a small coastal
community, Grand Bayou, Louisiana. This intercultural Native American (Atakapa,
Houma) and Cajun community of 125 represents a natural research laboratory well-
suited to the study of community sustainability in an area of high coastal
vulnerability. The Grand Bayou community is struggling to balance the threat of
natural hazards, economic development and community sustainability. It is
perched on the edge of survival due to repeated natural disasters, coastal
erosion, and economic losses, as well as threats to cultural heritage and social
networks. It is only accessible by water, is located in coastal wetlands south
of New Orleans, and lies one mile west outside the protection of the Mississippi
levee. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participatory action research (PAR) represents a
viable and culturally appropriate research strategy that will: (1) observe and
record their efforts; (2) document and understand their heritage orally and
visually; (3) assess human, built and natural systems; (4) apply a methodology
unique to hazards research that uses a broad based interdisciplinary team. Rapid
data collection is imperative due to the precariousness of this community from
natural disaster, anticipated deaths among the elders, and migration for
economic and physical survival. Small unincorporated and rural communities such
as Grand Bayou often lack adequate attention, advocacy and resources in facing,
responding to, or recovering from disasters. Grand Bayou represents an
appropriate location for inquiry designed to generate knowledge on communities
most vulnerable to loss but with a culturally based potential to survive.
