This MRI award supports the acquisition of a cold-room equipped micro CT unit
for the study of structures in ice, frozen soil and snow/firn. The intellectual
merit of the work is that it will provide important insights on a number of
environmental questions, such as the effects of climate change on the Polar
Regions. The unit will enable non-destructive reconstruction of three
dimensional micro-structure based on x-ray absorption. Examples of studies for
which the cold-adapted micro-CT instrument will be used include understanding
snow metamorphism in order to model the effects of snow-pack, characterizing the
microstructure, particularly the porosity, permeability and micro-chemistry of
firn, which can yield critical information on climate change, and examining the
3-D character of brittle compressive failure in ice to provide new knowledge
about not only the fracture of the ice cover on the Arctic Ocean but also new
insights into rupture of the Earth?s crust. The broader impacts of the proposed
activity relate to both understanding issues to do with climate change and the
training of students. It is expected that many graduate students will use the
instrument in their research and undergraduate students will be encouraged to
engage in research and learn about instrumentation of this kind. The instrument
will be incorporated into the laboratory component of a course taught by the PI
every year entitled Methods of Materials Characterization. It is expected that
the lifetime of this instrument will be on the order of 10 years and the
instrument will be made available to both Dartmouth and outside users for their
research. Results of the research will be widely disseminated.
