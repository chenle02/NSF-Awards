This project will develop innovative instructional materials for an activity
centered mathematics curriculum for grades K-6. In this curriculum, the textbook
is replaced by direct and active student experiences with manipulative
materials, accompanied by verbally presented problems and situations. Learning
is reinforced through the use of worksheets. Children work individually on some
tasks and in small groups on others. The sequence of concept development in this
curriculum differs significantly from the standard sequence. For example, the
concept of fraction is introduced in kindergarten, as is geometry. Place value
development begins in grade one. Logic is introduced in grade two, and the
concept of function is introduced in grade four. In general, more time than
usual is spent on concept development. Preliminary materials for grades K-4 have
already been developed with support from the Minnesota Council on Quality
Education. Associated workshops for teachers have been funded by both NSF and
the Department of Education. The preliminary materials have been used
successfully in a variety of locations. It appears that they are particularly
successful when used with Native American children. This grant will support the
revision of the materials for grades K-4, in preparation for wider
dissemination, and it will support the development of similar materials for use
in grades five and six.
