This research investigates the inter-relationships between dual careers and
long distance family migration from 1970 to 2000. The increase in families with
two careers both encourages family migration (because two people are exposed to
career opportunities) and discourages migration (because of the constraints on
the spouse when one partner has an opportunity). Research with the Current
Population Survey will investigate to what extent changes in overall family
mobility can be explained by the growth in dual career families. Other analyses
with the Panel Study of Income Dynamics will estimate how characteristics of the
spouses' occupations and of the local labor market influence family migration
decisions. Those analyses will be extended to investigate gender differences in
the consequences of family migration (or lack of migration). It is generally
believed that women's careers benefit least from family migration, but that may
be changing as couples make migration decisions to accommodate both careers.
