The purpose of this research is to develop a fully three- dimensional,
physically based constitutive relation for amorphous polymers. This will be used
to perform numerical simulations of cold and warm deformation processes, the
results of which will then be compared to experiments performed in the
laboratory of the PI. Additionally, the fundamental mechanisms of deformation-
induced heating and the recovery behavior of polymers will also be examined
through the use of mechanical testing and differential scanning calorimetry as
well as deformation calorimetry.//
