Educational Web Adventures LLP, representing a collaboration of two educational
Web developers and two museum researchers, will conduct research to explore the
role of learning style in online informal learning experiences. The study will
develop ways of measuring learning style among children ages 10 to 12 and test
hypotheses about learning style, activity preferences, engagement and
satisfaction. The researchers hypothesize that, when the shape of the learning
experience fits an individual's preferred learning style, the experience will be
more engaging and more satisfying.

The study will examine the following questions through laboratory and online
testing:

How can children's learning styles be identified? How do children's learning
styles affect their preferences for online activities? Do activities that match
the individual's preferred learning style result in greater engagement and
satisfaction?

How can the research findings be applied to the development and design of more
successful online learning activities?
