&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators conduct research in the following areas:
&lt;br/&gt;global geometric Langlands correspondence, local Langlands
&lt;br/&gt;correspondence in the de Rham setting, conformal field theories
&lt;br/&gt;related to Hecke chiral algebras, families of Tate spaces and
&lt;br/&gt;related infinite-dimensional algebraic varieties. They explore
&lt;br/&gt;analogs of the local Langlands correspondence in the de
Rham&lt;br/&gt;setting relating representations of Kac-Moody affine algebras
&lt;br/&gt;with de Rham local systems for the Langlands dual group on the
&lt;br/&gt;formal punctured disc. They study the representation theory of
&lt;br/&gt;chiral Hecke algebras and related global non-rational conformal
&lt;br/&gt;field theories in which the correlator D-modules form Hecke
&lt;br/&gt;eigensheaves in order to understand the global geometric Langlands
&lt;br/&gt;correspondence in the de Rham setting. They construct and study the
&lt;br/&gt;universal family of Langalnds transforms of GL(2) local systems.
&lt;br/&gt;They study the algebraic geometry of infinite-dimensional algebraic
&lt;br/&gt;varieties similar to the space of maps from the punctured formal
&lt;br/&gt;disk to a smooth algebraic variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject
of the research lies on the intersection of several &lt;br/&gt;domains of modern
mathematics and mathematical physics - the &lt;br/&gt;Langlands program,
geometric representation theory, infinite-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional algebraic
geometry, and conformal field theory. The &lt;br/&gt;blend of complementary
ideas and methods is very fruitful - in &lt;br/&gt;particular, it leads to
construction of a geometric version of &lt;br/&gt;Hecke eigenforms by means of
an appropriate quantum field theory.&lt;br/&gt;
