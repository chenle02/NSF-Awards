Recursive methods are now in wide use in macroeconomics and capital theory
because they permit researchers to rigorously derive useful and in some cases
profound insights into economic dynamics. Most such applications depend
critically on the assumption that all agents can be represented by the same
representative agent. The representative agent assumption precludes the use of
these models to study issues involving distribution, private information or
both. The present project develops a new, recursive method for constructing
efficient allocations in an interesting class of heterogeneous agent models. The
models will be extended to aggregate uncertainty and to decentralized planning.
This project develops a theory of the dynamics of the income distribution in a
market economy. Its central technical idea is a new Bellman equation for
constructing and characterizing efficient allocations in economies with
differently situated households and private information. This equation is used
to study income distribution, asset pricing and optimal taxation.
