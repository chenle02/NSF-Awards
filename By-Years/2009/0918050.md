Dr. Tong Qiu of Clarkson University submitted a planning visit proposal to
request a visit to the State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Preventation and
Geoenvironment Protection, Chengdu University of Technology. The purpose of the
visit is to discuss collaborative research ideas, to formulate research plans,
to assess laboratory conditions and to discuss a student exchange. He plans to
develop a joint research proposal with his Chinese counterparts to study
earthquake-induced landslide hazards. Seismic slope stability is an important
issue after major earthquakes. This visit can provide useful information for him
to develop a joint proposal.
