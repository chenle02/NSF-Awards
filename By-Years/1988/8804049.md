Texas A&M University is being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
For the summer of 1988, the program will support 9 students recuited from Texas
A&M and other institutions. Research activities will include studies in the
following areas: o Applications of polymers in catalysis o Reactivity of sulfur-
ligated nickel(II) hydrides o Heterobimetallic systems bridged by difunctional
ylides o Theoretical studies of inorganic and organometallic systems o Solid
state NMR studies o Proton inventory investigations of bioorganic systems o
Model reactions for the biological methylation of arsenic compounds o Rapid
screening using mass spectrometry o Plastics the conduct electricity o Enzyme
reaction mechanisms o SEM study of magnetite from carbonaceous meteorites o
Novel cycloadditions and annulations o Thin-layer electrochemical study of noble
metal catalysts o Adsorption isotherms of small molecules on polymer-based
reversed-phase chromatographic packings
