Various important industrial processes involve flow of polymers in regions of
spatially varying dimensions. In such flows the fluid elements experience a
deformation history with large and time- dependent extensional and shear
components. Non-Newtonian effects are important and need to be understood. Local
information on stress and velocity cannot be obtained directly in most
applications, at least by current methods, nor can the behavior be predicted
with confidence because available constitutive equations are untested for
relevant flow histories. Work under this grant will use a wavy wall channel and
state-of-the-art noninvasive measurement techniques to explore such flows.
Results are expected to form a necessary base for quantitative understanding of
polymer flows in these important regions. Among the most common examples of
flows of this type are the flow of polymer solutions in porous media,
encountered in enhanced oil recovery, and the flow of the polymer modified oils
in lubrication. However, a technology of growing importance, the formation of
composite materials by the injection of polymer melts or of reactive polymeric
liquids into open-structure matrices, provides an additional strong incentive
for this research.
