In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Professor Fenske will study the factors affecting
nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts in organometallic complexes. The
results will assist in the interpretation of the spectra with regard to
assignment of structure and identification of reaction pathways. A chemical
shift expression will be developed which shows correlation with paramagnetic
contributions. Boron studies range over a series of compounds from simple
borohydrides to large metallaboranes. The phosphorus studies will include the 3d
orbitals and consider the strong sigma donor ability of phosphorus containing
ligands. Orbital contributions to the paramagnetic term are to be correlated
with low lying virtual orbitals localized on the magnetic center.
