Professor Andrew Bocarsly and Steven Bernasek of Princeton University are
supported by the Organic Dynamics Program for studies with the goal of obtaining
a molecular-level understanding of chemical reaction processes on solid
surfaces, with a major theme being organic moieties on inorganic surfaces. The
first project uses scanning tunneling microscopy to examine chiral structures
resulting from two-dimensional self-assembly. Ultimately this research aims at
developing chiral templates to achieve asymmetric synthesis on solids, but
first, better characterization and control of the structures is sought. Ion-
hydrocarbon interactions will be probed by scattering small organic probe ions
such as pyridine or pyrrole on well-controlled self-assembled surfaces.
Functional groups and chain length effects will be explored for clarifying
chemical interactions in adlayers with mixed hydro- and fluoro-carbons. The
effects of internal energy on the course of dissociative adsorption on metals
producing carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water and formaldehyde will be
further examined using diode laser absorption spectroscopy to determine the
internal state distribution of the products of catalytic oxidation reactions.
Laser pumping of species to overcome barriers to surface reactions continues to
be a goal with work here focused on methane dissociation reactions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functionalized silicon and metal surfaces are of growing
importance for micro- and molecular-electronics applications. The fundamental
information from these studies will have many end uses including the development
of sensors, separations, catalysis, electronics, mass spectrometry as well as
electrochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
