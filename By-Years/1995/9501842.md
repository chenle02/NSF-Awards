CTS-9501842 Joseph McGuire Oregon State University ABSTRACT The project is an
extension of current research in which site-directed mutants of bacteriophage T4
lysozyme are used to probe adsorption behavior. Experimental techniques employed
include in situ ellipsometry, radiolabeling and circular dichroism. Simple
kinetic models previously used to analyze single protein adsorption data will e
extended to sequential and competitive adsorption of proteins. The models allow
two distinct protein states on the surface: one exchangeable and one non-
exchangeable. The project is an attempt to model multi-state mechanisms of
protein interfacial behavior in real systems. Understanding the structure and
role of proteins at interfaces is important in the development of bioseparations
technology, fouling-resistant membranes, biocompatible materials, biosensors and
related applications.
