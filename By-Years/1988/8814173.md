Over the last two decades, there has been an outpouring of research by scholars
on the causes and determinants of violence. While this work has expanded our
knowledge, it has often dealt with symptoms rather than causes, interventions
and penalties rather than prevention, and criminal violence rather than violence
more generally. Furthermore, studies have usually been concerned with limited
domains--for example, violence by strangers or family members of by adults or
youth. Finally, research has tended to emphasize particular kinds of
explanations of the level of violence (e.g., individual characteristics,
situational attributes, cultural conditions, risks of penalties) or has focused
on the social control functions of different institutions. While some studies
have withstood reanalysis and replication, others have not. A need remains for
theoretical and empirical integration and for the development of a cogent agenda
for future research. With these goals at the fore, the National Academy of
Sciences' Committee on Research on Law Enforcement and the Administration of
Justice is convening a Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violence. Over
the next two years, with funding primarily from the National Science Foundation
and the National Institute of Justice, an interdisciplinary Panel of
distinguished scholars from a range of academic perspectives will review and
synthesize knowledge about violent behavior and recommend directions for
research that can advance knowledge and inform policy. The Panel will assemble
data on patterns and trends, review theoretical and empirical research on causes
and correlates, synthesize and critique research on violence, compare and
contrast findings across disciplines, and offer guidance on core conceptual and
methodological problems. This effort should lay the groundwork for more robust
theory and empirical study that integrates biological, psychological,
situational, and social factors. It is anticipated that this Panel will address
theoretical, measurement, and methodological questions that lie at the frontiers
of our understanding of violent behavior; identify critical gaps in knowledge;
and orient, if not reorient, basic science on violence for the decade ahead.
