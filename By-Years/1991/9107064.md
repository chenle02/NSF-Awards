A user mode research program will be carried out in nuclear structure using
charge exchange reactions, in electromagnetic structure of the nucleon, and in
heavy ion reactions aimed at determination of the equation of state of nuclear
matter. These activities will be carried out at the Indiana University Cyclotron
Facility, at the MIT/Bates and CEBAF electron accelerators, and at the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory Bevalac. A common theme of the Kent State group activities
is application of neutron detection techniques to nucleon and nuclear structure
studies of significant current interest. New types of neutron detectors and
polarimeters will be developed.
