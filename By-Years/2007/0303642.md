This research uses optical techniques to study electron and lattice dynamics in
solids that undergo semiconductor-to-metal transitions after excitation with
intense femtosecond laser pulses. In addition to investigating the dynamics of
highly excited materials, the proposed work will determine the degree to which
their phase can be controlled with multiple-pulse excitations by studying the
interplay between free carrier dynamics and ionic motion during a semiconductor-
to-metal transition. A novel aspect of the work is the measurement of the
dynamics of the spectral dielectric function with femtosecond time resolution,
which fully characterizes the linear optical response of the material and from
which one can infer changes in band structure and electronic configuration.
Through quality research-based education of undergraduate and graduate students,
this research also contributes to science and engineering education and the
training of future scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advent of
femtosecond-pulse laser sources offers the opportunity to manipulate solid
materials both by novel means and on unprecedented time scales. This research is
aimed at studying the response of semiconductors to intense femtosecond pulse
excitations that drive the material from a semiconductor to a metal. The goals
of this work are to determine the mechanisms by which the transition occurs and
the degree to which the phase of the material (semiconductor vs. insulator) can
be controlled on a femtosecond time scale. A novel experimental technique that
measures the optical properties with femtosecond time resolution will be applied
to these materials, which enables one to distinguish between the effects of
electronic excitation and changes in crystal structure. Through quality
research-based education of undergraduate and graduate students, this research
also contributes to science and engineering education and the training of future
scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;
