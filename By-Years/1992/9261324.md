This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
computer software and a companion textbook to teach modeling of biological
problems using a simulation language that is expressed in biological terms. The
thrust of the project is to incorporate pedagogical and electronic devices to
promote critical thinking skills, thus rising above the drill and practice and
tutorial software that comprises the existing market. The open architecture of
the software will permit students to challenge assumptions in models, to propose
their own hypotheses, and to test these hypotheses by developing their own
biological models.
