The singularity theorems tell us that singularities form in a large class of
spacetimes, including the physically relevant cases of the big bang and of the
gravitational collapse of a star to form a black hole. However, these theorems
tell us very little about the nature of the singularities. For example, we would
like to know the entire class of incomplete observers, how the curvature behaves
along their world lines and whether they can see the singularity before they hit
it. Since we do not have the general solution of Einstein's equation in closed
form, Prof. Garfinkle intends to use all the methods available for the study of
singularities: (i) to find exact solutions and study their singularities; (ii)
to prove theorems about the behavior of singular spacetimes or (iii) to perform
a numerical study of spacetimes with singularities to address these issues.
Numerical evolution of generic initial data for axisymmetric cosmologies will be
used to study the approach to the singularity of spatially inhomogeneous models.
He will examine nonsingular, stationary electrovac solutions in general
relativity and in string theory. He will also explore Choptuik's numerical
discovery of scaling behavior in the formation of a zero mass singularity from
the collapse of a spherically scalar field using a gauge invariant null initial
value formulation. Perhaps the most important problem in the study of
singularities is cosmic censorship: the issue of whether singularities are
hidden behind event horizons. Work by Shapiro and Teukolsky suggests that highly
prolate objects can form naked singularities during gravitational collapse. As
an alternative, he will start a numerical investigation of the collapse of
highly prolate gravity waves to see whether a naked singularity forms.
