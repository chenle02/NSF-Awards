This proposal requests funding for partial support of the travel and
registration expenses of U.S. participants at the Vth Rencontre Conference to be
held in Hanoi, Vietnam from August 5-8, 2004. Two conferences, one on
Astrophysics/Cosmology and one on Particle Physics, will be held in parallel,
with substantial interdisciplinary overlap and intercommunication. The funds
will be used to support untenured U.S. astrophysicists and particle physicists.
Special attention will be paid to supporting women and minorities. Substantial
outreach programs in secondary and elementary science education accompany these
conferences.
