This project plans to combine two capabilities, the tunable atom-like electronic
quantum states of nanostructured materials and ultrashort-pulsed laser sources
based on fiber-optics, to provide a route to making nanostructure materials
economically and efficiently. The versatility of this approach is a major driver
of the project: condensation of nanoparticles from a femtosecond laser-generated
plasma can produce nanoparticles of essentially any material deposited as a thin
film, including semiconductors and different kinds of metals that are useful for
energy-critical applications. This versatility is the key to developing a wide
range of applications for a variety of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
may provide a new route to achieving the goal of inexpensively fabricating
nanopartical films in sufficient density and quantity or industrial-scale
applications. Sustainable, environmentally friendly, affordable, energy supply
is challenge facing today's society. New materials development can be essential
to this task; for example, efficient solar energy harvesting, by catalytic
splitting of water molecules or by photovoltaic power generation could benefit
greatly from cost-effective materials for utilizing renewable energy. Research
conducted through this project may serve as the basis for a scalable
technological solution to the need for energy-critical materials.
