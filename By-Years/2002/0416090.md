Professors Jeffry Madura and Jeffrey Evanseck of Duquesne University are
supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research
involving the development of hybrid and multi-level methods to study cadmium
sulfide nanoclusters bound to peptides. A QM/MM approach and the ONIOM method
are used in this research which has implications in materials science and
nanotechnology. The broader impacts of this work are, thus, mostly on the
materials science field but will also have wide applications in other areas of
science. The project also includes an outreach component to the State University
of New York at New Paltz and undergraduate students from that campus are
participating in the research at Duquesne.
