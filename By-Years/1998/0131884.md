EIA-0131884&lt;br/&gt;Alan Karr&lt;br/&gt;National Institute of Statistical
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government: Data Confidentiality, Data
Quality, and Data Integration for Federal Databases: Foundations to Software
Prototypes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support research in data
confidentiality, data quality, and data integration. Prototypes will be built
which can scale to operate on large sets of Federally held data. Researchers
will partner with several large Federal Government statistical agencies. This
topic is of particular importance given the balance of these agencies must
strive for, in terms of their dual missions to collect and keep private
confidential data, while at the same time making that data accessible for
research and policy issues. This grant will support a multi-disciplinary multi-
institution team, with participants from five universities, one non-profit, and
one national laboratory. The disciplines represented include computer science,
statistical science, and systems engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
