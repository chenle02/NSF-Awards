This project is about the role of language and social interaction with peers and
teachers in shaping the development of preschoolers with and without autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). The researchers will use an innovative set of sensor
systems to measure children's and teachers' locations and speech in real-time on
the playground and preschool classroom to investigate how social interaction and
development differ for children with and without ASD. This project will indicate
the relative impact of children’s conversations with peers and teachers on their
language development. A better understanding of these interactions may lead to
clear and simple strategies which educators can use to support classroom
interactions and children’s social and language
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Children’s social and language development is
shaped by real-time interactions with peers and adults that are structured by
their physical and social contexts. Understanding of the granular interactive
processes through which language and social development occur is currently
limited. Likewise, it is not clear how variation in children’s social
interaction and language abilities-—such as the deficits associated with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD)--affect these interactions. The current research asks
how preschoolers with and without ASD interact and share language with their
peers and teachers in the classroom and playground and how social contact,
speech, and language abilities change over development. The researchers will use
real-time data from objective measurements of movement and speech to predict
children’s social and language development. The researchers will use emerging
technologies to study children’s real-time interactions with peers and teachers
to illustrate the development of social networks and their role in shaping
children’s language abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
