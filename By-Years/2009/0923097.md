With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the
Chemistry Department at Duke University will acquire a LC-TOF high resolution
mass spectrometer for use in teaching and research. A variety of research
projects will be investigated including: Chemical Tools to Manipulate Metal-
Catalyzed Oxidative Stress, Catalytic Hydrofunctionalization, Modular
Recombinant Transporter-Assisted Nuclear Delivery for AGT Imaging, Self-healing
Polymers, Energy Transduction Mechanisms, Design of New Imaging Agents, Chemical
Approaches to the Elucidation of Cell Signaling Pathways, the Cellulosome,
Catalytic Nanolithography, Biologically-Inspired Small Molecule Synthesis, and
Bioorganic Mechanisms of Peptide Antibiotics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass
spectrometry (MS) is used to identify the chemical composition of a sample and
determine its purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the
sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer.
Chromatography is an isolation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry
analysis. It separates a mixture into its several constituent chemicals which
are then analyzed by the mass spectrometer. These are widely used analytical
techniques to identify and quantify the chemical composition of a sample. The
acquisition will benefit undergraduate chemistry students through existing,
intensive research outreach programs in the Department and through utilization
of the mass spectrometer in the undergraduate chemistry laboratories.
