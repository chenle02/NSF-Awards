This grant is to support travel to the International Union of Geodesy and
Geophysics meeting in Vienna, Austria, in August, 1991. The IUGG meets every
four years. By means of this block travel grant, the American Geophysical Union
administers an effective and equitable distribution of funds for partial travel
support without scientists having to apply individually to the NSF. Screening
committees, operated by the U.S. National Committee for the IUGG, are instructed
to consider conscientiously minority applicants and to obtain a balance
geographically and institutionally, according to career level, and according to
discipline in order to maximize the impact of U.S. scientists on the meeting and
the ultimate impact on U.S. science of the information gained by the
participants.
