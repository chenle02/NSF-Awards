This collaborative award provides support for participants in two applied
mathematics meetings at Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma
during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 academic years, respectively: (1) a workshop
on recent progress in partial differential equations of fluid mechanics, with
emphasis on modeling of geophysical fluids, to be held at Oklahoma State
University on November 12-13, 2011; (2) a workshop on applied mathematics, to be
held at the University of Oklahoma in October, 2012.

Each meeting features invited lectures by leading researchers on topics of
current research interest in applied partial differential equations and applied
mathematics in general. The events bring together scholars currently making
important contributions, early career mathematicians, and students working in
the field. The conference encourages and financially supports participation by
students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in
mathematics.
