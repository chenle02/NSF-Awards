In this Small Grant Exploratory Research proposal, a new and &lt;br/&gt;novel
direction in finite element methodology is pursued. &lt;br/&gt;Polygonal finite
elements provide greater flexibility in mesh &lt;br/&gt;generation and are
better-suited for applications in solid &lt;br/&gt;mechanics which involve a
significant change in the topology of &lt;br/&gt;the material domain. In this
proposal, &lt;br/&gt;recent advances in meshfree approximations, computational
&lt;br/&gt;geometry, and computer graphics will be used to construct
&lt;br/&gt;conforming trial and test approximations on&lt;br/&gt;polygonal
finite elements. Computational algorithms (optimization &lt;br/&gt;scheme) for
mesh generation with polygonal elements will be &lt;br/&gt;developed, and
numerical studies on the accuracy and convergence&lt;br/&gt;of the finite
element technique will be conducted for&lt;br/&gt;elliptic boundary-value
problems. The results of this study &lt;br/&gt;can potentially open-up new
pathways in finite element research, lead to the &lt;br/&gt;wider usage of
polygonal finite element methods in solid mechanics&lt;br/&gt;and computational
materials science, and also &lt;br/&gt;provide impetus for the construction of
cubature rules on polytopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
