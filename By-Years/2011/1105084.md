This project will investigate the possibility that a new approach to deriving a
linear theory of the tearing mode instability in space plasmas can be
successfully developed. Such a linear theory would then form the basis of a full
non-linear theory of magnetic reconnection in a collisonless plasma. Previous
analytical work on the linear tearing mode relied on using an asymptotic
approach to make the equations tractable. However, fullly kinetic, particle
simulations have indicated that the asymptotic approach breakes down in most
realistic geometries. The purpose of this exploratory resarch is threefold: 1)
Determine why the asymptotic appoach breaks down and develop a new approach
using an exact linear Vlasov solver to determine the conditions where a direct
transition from linear theory to non-linear turbulence occurs; 2) Determine
whether or not the formation of secondary tearing island formation is due to a
linear instability; 3) Examine the controversial question of whether linear mode
properties have a significant influence on the resulting reconnection rate in
large systems.

This is a project that has the potential to transform the way magnetic
reconnection is treated in plasma theory and simulations. It could affect our
understanding of phenomena on the sun, in the solar wind, in planetary
magnetospheres and in astrophysical plasmas.
