The goal of this project is to enable the creation of new human-centered
computing tools that will help people effectively analyze large collections of
textual documents by providing powerful statistical analysis functionality in a
usable and intuitive form. To accomplish that, this project investigates
"semantic interaction" in visual analytics as a method to combine the large-data
computationally-intensive foraging abilities of formal statistical mining
algorithms with the intuitive cognitively-intensive sensemaking abilities of
human analysts. Semantic interaction enables users to inject their domain
expertise into the algorithms by interacting directly with the data. For
example, analysts synthesize hypotheses about a set of documents by simply re-
organizing them within a spatial visualization, highlighting important
sentences, or annotating in the margins. Meanwhile, the underlying statistical
models learn from these actions and interactively respond to help spatially
organize additional relevant information according to the user's feedback.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Semantic interaction offers a new
approach to interactive visual analytics that emphasizes usability. This
research will (1) contribute new user interaction and visual feedback techniques
for naturally controlling algorithms via the interactive sensemaking process;
(2) contribute a flexible visual analytics framework that seamlessly integrates
mathematical models with interactive visualization; and (3) evaluate the
effectiveness of semantic interaction, which provides a quantitative mechanism
to investigate the complex interplay between human intuition and formal
statistical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This research will
support a broad range of applications in visual text analytics, including
intelligence analysis, funding portfolio management, and literature research.
Participating agencies will test the software in ecologically valid settings.
The software framework will be distributed to enable others to integrate
additional models and to provide a usable platform for analysts. The project
also proposes an educational and outreach agenda called "CS for CSI" that
exploits the popularity of crime investigation stories to attract young students
to technology research.
