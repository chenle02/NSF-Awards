This project concentrates on the development of time-resolved Auger spectroscopy
of single crystal faces and the use of this technique in conjunction with time-
resolved infrared emission spectroscopy to study mechanisms of surface processes
including important catalytic reactions. This project involves pressing the time
resolution and signal-to-noise capabilities of Auger surface analysis to
unprecedented limits. If successfulit would reveal certain surface processes
with a clarity not now possible. This approach could have a revolutionary impact
in catalysis, electrochemistry, corrosion, materials deposition, and other
processes.
