Dr. Carroll is investigating the genes controlling embryonic cell fates in
Drosophila. In particular, he has chosen the genes that control the formation of
body segments and the differentiation of these segments. He will analysize the
regulatory circuit controlling these pattern forming genes. %%% Drosophila is an
excellent model system is which to study how the adult form of an animal arises
from the fertilized egg. This is so due to the availability of powerful
classical and molecular genetic techniques for this system.
