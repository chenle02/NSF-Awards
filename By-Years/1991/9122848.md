This doctoral dissertation research examines organizational culture from the
property rights perspective and aims to develop and empirically test a framework
that predicts the relationship between contextual constraints and the emergent
control systems in the organization on the one hand, and the influence of these
constraints and controls on group norms within the organization, on the other.
The scope of this study is limited to the verification of (a) the relationship
between contextual constraints and property rights at the individual level, (b)
the relationship between constraints, rights and ``within group'' norms.
