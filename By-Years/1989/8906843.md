This proposal addresses the interactions of moose with the dynamics of plant
populations, their feedbacks with carbon and nitrogen cycles, and subsequent
changes in boreal landscapes. The main hypothesis is that moose promote
patchiness of vegetation in boreal forests. This patchiness results from
alternation of species composition by selective, non-random foraging patterns
across the landscape; different responses of species to browsing; differential
establishment of plants in browsed patches; and changes in nutrient cycles
caused by these changes in vegetation. The project will quantify moose
interactions at soil, feeding station, habitat, and landscape scales in several
valleys on Isle Royale National Park, Michigan. These valleys have different
disturbance regimes and different assemblages of plant species. Field studies
will determine spatial correspondences of foraging, the distribution of food and
cover, browse quality, plant seed and litter dispersal, plant establishment, and
soil nitrogen availability. These data will be assembled in a geographic
information system that will be coupled with a forest simulation model. Computer
studies will address how foraging strategies cause development of different
spatial patterns of vegetation and soils, and how spatial variability in habitat
influences moose population dynamics. The Investigators are well qualified to do
the type of research and the University facilities are more than adequate.
