A research project on the processing and characterization of cement-based
composites containing high volume fraction of fibers is to be performed. The
study concentrates on the manufacturing techniques and the constitutive laws
based on the relationship among the fiber, matrix, interface, and the processing
technique employed. The mechanical properties of these composites as a function
of fiber lengths, interfacial properties, matrix properties, and the processing
technique will be measured. Responses such as complete stress-strain curves,
experimental R-curve, and post-peak stress-crack width relationship will be
measured using digitally controlled closed loop tests. The in quantitative
optical microscopy using image analysis techniques will be developed to measure
stress induced microcracking. An R-Curve approach will be developed for the
pull-out response of fibers. This approach will be implemented in a composite
fracture model to predict the optimum material properties.
