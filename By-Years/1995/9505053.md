9505053 Casson Casson will study the Geometrization Conjecture for 3-
dimensional manifolds, proposed by Thurston in 1982. A proof of this conjecture
would complete the topological classification of closed 3-manifolds, provide
insight into topological properties of 3-manifolds, and lead to efficient
methods to determine whether two given 3-manifolds are topologically equivalent.
Casson will explore a very direct approach to Thurston's conjecture; given a
topological description of a 3-manifold M, he will attempt to find
triangulations of M that are closely related to a geometric structure on M.
Kirby will continue his work (often with Paul Melvin) in Topological Quantum
Field Theory. He will try to explain the Kontsevich and Vassiliev invariants,
using intersections of certain codimension-two manifolds in a compactification
of products of the given 3-manifold with diagonals deleted. He will also
continue to study the formulae for the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants,
looking for topological interpretations and applications. Since the space that
we live in is three-dimensional, and all our lives we perfect our three-
dimensional geometric intuition simply by going about our everyday business, it
is always surprising to the layman to learn that mathematicians' are frequently
more capable of answering questions about higher dimensional geometric objects
than about the analogous objects in dimension three. This is, however, very much
the case. The most famous outstanding conjecture in topology is the three-
dimensional Poincare conjecture, made at the turn of the century. On the other
hand, its higher dimensional analogues have all been settled. The research of
this project is directly addressed to these notoriously recalcitrant problems.
