This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
program, explores an emerging issue in the relationship between law and
bureaucratic institutions, namely, the shift from public to private arrangements
for the production of welfare law. The private domain has assumed new
significance in the aftermath of welfare reform, which has produced a virtual
explosion in private contracting of public welfare functions relating to
welfare's work provisions. This exploratory project investigates the private
construction of law within "contract bureaucracies," agencies that perform
essentially public welfare functions but do so outside the organizational
boundaries of government. It extends research on the informal institutional
practices through which law acquires specific meaning beyond the public sector.
As a study of the construction of practical legal meaning, this inquiry is
concerned, not with legal ideals or intent, but with the creation of legal
realities. Case study research will be conducted in two private organizations
contracted to provide welfare-to-work services. The cases will be purposefully
selected to permit comparison with the researcher's public agency studies and to
allow comparison with each other. This inquiry will utilize the methodology of
street-level analysis, combining in-depth interview techniques often used by
organization researchers with direct observation more commonly used in
ethnography. The objective of this form of analysis is to reconstruct agency
practice in terms of its own internal logic and to explain the particular form
that law takes in specific settings.
