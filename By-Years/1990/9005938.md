The proposal describes the continuing development of solid state NMR techniques
to determine high resolution protein and polypeptide structure and dynamics in
anisotropic environments. Examples of the analytical determination of backbone
torsion angles and a detailed description of a spatial model of backbone motions
are described. Further refinement of our knowledge of the magnitudes and
orientations of nuclear spin interactions is described herein. The utilization
of new spin interactions and methods for taking optimal advantage of
orientational constraints are discussed. A new approach for achieving a detailed
spatial model for local motions and an analysis of relaxation data in light of
the spatial model are described. Finally, a unified approach for resolving the
structural and dynamic information from all of the spectroscopic data is
detailed.***
