The proposed project encompasses an experimental and theoretical study of full-
size and small-scale reinforced concrete flexural members subjected to high rate
loads representative of real-life events affecting buildings and infrastructure.
Loads will be applied by direct impact (open-loop) and at constant displacement
rate (closed-loop), such that the strain rate ranges generated by the two
methods will overlap. The primary objectives of the project are: 1) to improve
the fundamental understanding of reinforced concrete response at varying load
rates; 2) to analyze and predict behavior and failure modes of full-size
structural members as affected by selected design variables; and 3) to establish
a performance relationship between models and full-size members.
