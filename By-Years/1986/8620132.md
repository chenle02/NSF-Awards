Ergodic theory is an active, central area of Modern Analysis. Its origins lie
in the theoretical formulation for classical statistical mechanics at the end of
the nineteenth century. The modern point of view derives from the profound
mathematical theory of recurrence and ergodicity, as developed by Poincare,
Birkhoff, von Neumann and other giants earlier in this century. As the subject
has evolved and sophistication continually increased, ergodic theory has
acquired close relationships with other branches of mathematics, such as
dynamical systems, probability theory, functional analysis, number theory,
differential topology, and differential geometry, and with applications as far
ranging as mathematical physics, information theory, and computer design.
Professor Petersen has worked on several aspects of ergodic theory, especially
those connected with harmonic anlaysis, probability, and more recently
information theory. A major part of his work has concerned maximal functions and
almost everywhere convergence; for example, the refinement of the maximal
ergodic theorem to an equality, speed of convergence in the ergodic theorem, the
ergodic Hilbert transform, and the relationship with spectral theory and
harmonic analysis. He has also conducted research in the applications of ergodic
theory, specifically symbolic dynamics, to efficient coding of information
across noisy channels. Here, Professor Petersen proposes to continue his
research into both symbolic dynamics and almost everywhere convergence. In the
former subject, he will consider general properties of symbolic dynamical
systems on an infinite alphabet as well as a class of examples that relate to
the control of signals for magnetic recording. In the latter area, his research
will emphasize connections between the ergodic Hilbert transform and the
spectral measure of a measure-preserving transformation.
