Psychology - Cognitive (73)&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating and disseminating
a set of empirically-validated materials for teaching psychological research
methods using formal instruction supplemented by examples. The psychology major
continues to be popular among undergraduate students in liberal arts and pre-
professional programs. The psychological research methods course is important
for teaching critical, scientific thinking skills that are applicable to real-
world problem solving. Investigators of cognition and instruction know that
formal instruction must be supplemented by many varied concrete examples in
order for transfer of skills outside the classroom to occur. However, a review
of educational materials indicates that a validated collection of such examples
is not available for research methods instruction. Thus, the specific objectives
of this project are to (1) implement a set of instructional modules for learning
by examples, (2) use the technology of the world wide web to provide students
with unrestricted, asynchronous access, and (3) gather experimental evidence
supporting the application of learning by examples in the research methods
course. This proof-of-concept is creating three modules (on confounding and
control of variables, statistical inference, and interactions among variables).
Each module contains several examples culled from various psychological research
literatures and presented to students as lengthy abstracts containing
methodological flaws that need to be discovered and repaired. The effect of
training on the examples is being assessed in a pretest-posttest nonequivalent
groups design that allows generalization across classes and instructors and the
assessment of modes of delivery (web vs. face-to-face, and individual work vs.
group activity).
