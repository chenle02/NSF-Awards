By probing plant cDNA libraries sequentially with two partially degenerate
oligonucleotides corresponding to highly conserved domains of mammalian serine
protein kinases, a clone (PVPK-1) that encodes a putative plant protein kinase
has recently been identifed. This clone has striking homology to mammalian cAMP-
dependent protein kinases. This development now provides the basis for
examination of the structure, organization and regulation of plant protein
kinase gene families and dissection of the function of individual protein
kinases in specific signal transduction pathways that regulate development,
mediate environmental responses and integrate metabolism. Specific objectives
are: (a) use of these and existing cloned sequences to determine the
organization of families and sub- families of protein kinase genes; (b)
isolation, characterization and nucleotide sequence analysis of genomic
sequences corresponding to cloned PVPK-1 cDNA; (c) generation of specific
antibodies against PVPK-1 protein kinase; (d) immunoaffinity purification of the
biochemical properties of PVPK-1 protein kinase; and (e) analysis of function by
expression of wild-type and mutant PVPK-1 genes in protoplasts and in stable
transgenic plants. Relatively little is known at the molecular level about
signal transduction and response-coupling mechanisms that control plant growth
and development. Protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of specific proteins is
a major strategy for regulation of protein and enzyme activity in the
transduction of environmental, developmental and metabolic signals in animals
and simple eukaryotes. In higher plants, while protein phosphorylation has been
observed in vivo and protein kinase activity in vitro, little information is
available on the molecular properties of plant protein kinases, their number and
diversity with respect to regulatory inputs and protein substrate outputs, or
the function of protein kinases in specific signal transduction pathways. This
research begins to fill this information gap.
