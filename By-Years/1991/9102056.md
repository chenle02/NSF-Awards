This applicant will study the efforts of site-directed mutagenesis within the
reactive center of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor on its global conformation.
Specifically, he plans to use Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Spectrometry to study the protein conformation following selective methionine
residue modification and limited proteolysis within the reactive center. This
work is planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Peter Gettings at
Vanderbilt University.
