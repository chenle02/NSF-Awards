The modification of cloud processes to influence quantity and types of
precipitation remains a scientific and technical challenge. Although many
modification theories have been advanced, the complexity and variability of
natural precipitation production has limited predictable application. It is
unlikely that advances in weather modification can be made by field
experimentation alone. Numerical models of precipitation processes are now of
sufficient sophistication that they can contribute much to our understanding.
The primary objective of the research is to gain further understanding of the
effects of ice-phase seeding on the formation of rain and hail. Results from
advanced, time dependent models in two and three spatial dimensions will be used
in comparison with actual observations of seeded and unseeded convective clouds
to ascertain important physical processes in cloud modification. Secondary
objectives are to study the transport of seeding materials and to conduct tests
using two-dimensional models as a forecast aid. The Principal Investigators will
undertake this research as part of a joint NSF/NOAA experiment on the
modification of convective clouds known as the North Dakota Thunderstorm
Project.//
