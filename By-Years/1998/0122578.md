This is a theoretical investigation of the excitation and scattering of acoustic
waves by turbulent flames. Specifically, it examines the acoustic radiation
characteristics of moving, convoluted flame fronts of various scales of
roughness. It also looks at how the spatial and temporal characteristics of the
scattered and excited waves can be used as a diagnostic of turbulent flame
fronts. The study uses a coupled integral equation approach to analyze the
acoustic field. The complete solution requires the solution of two such
equations, describing the field upstream and downstream of the flame, that are
coupled by mass, momentum, and energy conservation conditions. Analytical
solutions are obtained in certain limiting cases, while a numerical boundary-
element approach is used for analytically intractable cases. This effort
complements an experimental study of the same phenomena supported by a CAREER
award to the principal investigator.
