This project will promote the progress of science and advance the national
prosperity and welfare, by investigating novel methodologies leading to
efficient road information discovery, as well as safe and efficient
transportation systems. Real-time and crowd-sourced road information, such as
black ice, pothole, and road roughness, can improve vehicle performance.
Existing road information discovery approaches are not always practically
viable, due to limitations in road coverage and lack of robustness. This award
supports development of a novel collaborative road information crowdsourcing
methodology using connected vehicles. The new methodology will enable efficient,
robust, and broad-coverage road information discovery by utilizing connected
vehicles as mobile sensors while preserving privacy of the participating
vehicles. The crowd-sourced information can be incorporated in vehicle controls
to improve safety, efficiency, and comfort. In addition, the new up-to-date road
condition information will help address the nationâ€™s urgent need to rebuild and
modernize road infrastructure, by informing the road maintenance and repair
plans. This research involves several disciplines including vehicle dynamics,
optimal estimation, iterative learning control, and privacy. The multi-
disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups
in research and positively impact engineering
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The privacy-preserved collaborative estimation
using connected vehicles is expected to make vehicle-based road information
discovery practically and economically viable. This project will support work to
overcome several scientific challenges that need to be overcome to realize full
application potential of such connected systems. The research team will develop
jump-diffusion process-based estimation to enhance road information discovery
performance when dealing with abrupt input/disturbance changes in a single
vehicle setting. The team will also develop iterative learning-based
collaborative estimation across heterogeneous vehicles to enable the
exploitation of local estimation from a network of heterogeneous agents to
iteratively improve the performance of road information discovery. Finally, the
research group will design dynamics-enabled privacy preservation schemes to
protect vehicle privacy without affecting computation fidelity or incurring
large computation/communication overhead, and evaluate the methodology in the
application of collaborative road profile estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
