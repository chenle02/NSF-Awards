The purpose of this RIA award is to develop an integrated program of mechanical
testing and analytical modeling to better predict the behavior of textile
composites. This scheme will be used to establish a method for designing three-
dimensional fiber architectures analogous to those currently used to design play
orientations and stacking sequences in laminar composites.
