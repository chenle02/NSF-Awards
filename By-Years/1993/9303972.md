This project will extend ongoing research on the thermodynamic properties of
cummingtonite solid solutions to include quadrilateral amphiboles. The study
will utilize previously published thermodynamic and Mossbauer data and results
of new x-ray crystal structure refinements. The resultant data will provide
insight into modelling the thermodynamics of complex clinoamphiboles. Ultimately
it will find application in the construction of phase diagrams for use in the
interpretation of metamorphic systems.
