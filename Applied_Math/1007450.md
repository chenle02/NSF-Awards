When modeling physical or biological processes, one main goal is to use the
model to predict the behaviors of the system that will be observed in the real
world. Stable states of the system will attract all nearby configurations, and
thus they can play an important role in determining the behavior. On the other
hand, if the time-scale on which the system evolves toward that state is very
long, one may never be able to wait long enough to see the stable behavior
emerge. It is therefore important to also understand the transient behaviors
that persist for long times. This proposal is concerned with developing
mathematical techniques for both determining if a given state is stable and also
for investigating such transient behaviors. In addition, certain bifurcations
that capture when a state loses stability are analyzed. This is accomplished
through the analysis of three main problems: determining the nonlinear stability
of sources, a certain type of time-periodic pattern in reaction-diffusion
equations; characterizing transient, yet persistent, dynamics in the two-
dimensional Navier-Stokes equation; and analyzing the loss of stability of
spatially periodic waves in a cardiac model and its connection with irregular
heartbeats.

One primary goal of the mathematical modeling of physical and biological
processes, in general, is to predict the way the system will behave in time. One
way to do this is to look for so-called stable states. Stable states attract all
nearby configurations, and thus provide great insight into the types of
behaviors that will be observed. For example, when studying a model of cardiac
dynamics, a periodic solution could correspond to regular heartbeats. If this
solution is stable, then, even when subject to disruptions in its natural
rhythm, the heart will relax back to regular beating. However, if a bifurcation
occurs in which the periodic solution loses stability, this could correspond to
a scenario in which arrhythmia, or irregular beating, will occur. Since this
behavior is undesirable, one would like to determine, via mathematical modeling,
how to adjust certain parameters in the system so that the periodic solution
does not lose stability. This proposal concerns the development of mathematical
techniques that allow one to determine if a given solution is stable, ways in
which the solution could lose stability, and what types of transient behaviors
one could observe as the system relaxes to a stable solution. The analysis is
carried out in three main mathematical settings, each of which is related to
applications in biology, such as the cardiac dynamics mentioned above, or
physics, such as fluid dynamics.
