This project is the inaugural workshop meeting of a new STEM Education research
network calling itself the Accelerating Systemic Change Network (ASCN). At the
workshop the main agenda Item is to strategically plan the growth of the network
to bring it to the point where it can support fledgling efforts in departments
and institutions to transform their teaching and learning practices. At this
meeting, working groups will be established and working group members will share
their own work with one another, establish an agenda for their group, and
articulate their vision and goals for the larger network.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit and the broader impacts of
supporting the start-up of the ASCN is that this will expand the knowledge base
about how to effectively bring about systemic organizational change within
higher education so that using evidence-based practices to support effective
student learning becomes the new normal.
