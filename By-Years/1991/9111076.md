Research to be carried out under a Research Initiation Award is focused on mean
flow and wave motion in the coastal surf zone. The study will be mostly
experimental, utilizing a laboratory wave flume. Experimental results will be
integrated into an already developed model for the prediction of sediment
transport. Video imaging of dyed flow tracers and fluorescent dyed sand grains
will yield qualitative and quantitative details of flow and sediment dynamics
with wave shoaling and breaking included. The research will advance the ability
to predict beach response to storms, and evaluate protective system.
