There has been tremendous success in studying Dehn surgery on knots through the
use of taut foliations and essential laminations. For example, the property R
conjecture, and the property P conjecture for satellite knots, have been proved
using the methods of taut foliations. The principal investigator plans to study
Dehn surgery on knots and links in 3-manifolds using laminations and branched
surfaces. The success of the project will advance the understanding of the
topology of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds and contribute to the ultimate
solutions of some central problems in this area. The investigator also plans to
study tight laminations in 3-manifolds. A tight lamination is an essential
lamination with a very nice transverse structure and many remarkable properties.
One goal of the proposed research is to prove that if a 3-manifold contains an
essential lamination then it contains a tight lamination. The investigator will
also continue his work on the classification of essential laminations in
hyperbolic punctured-torus bundles, and on the topological rigidity of laminar
3-manifolds.

Three-manifolds are objects modeled on the 3-dimensional space that we are
living in. For instance, the universe is a 3-manifold and recent study shows
that the universe may have an interesting topological structure. A natural
geometric way of studying 3-manifolds, which has been proved extremely fruitful,
is to view a globally complicated 3-manifold as a collection of simple
3-dimensional pieces glued together along a 2-dimensional object. The tools used
in the proposed research, including laminations and branched surfaces, provide
such useful 2-dimensional objects. The proposed research is related to some
central questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which impact not
only mathematics, but also physics and other scientific research. A better
understanding of 3-manifolds may help us understand the shape of the universe,
and knot theory is used to study the structure of DNA and its biological effect.
