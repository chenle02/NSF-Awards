The Networks for European, American, and African Research (NEAAR) collaboration
is a powerful, cross organizational project that will provide services and
bandwidth connecting researchers in the US with their counterparts in Europe and
Africa. This project will have an immediate impact on the research environment
and also supports future application and technology advances.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University (IU) jointly leads the NEAAR
collaboration with GÃ‰ANT, the European research and education network (REN), in
a cooperative partnership with the African regional RENs: the UbuntuNet
Alliance, the Arab States Research and Education Network (ASREN), the West and
Central African Research and Education Network (WACREN), as well as the South
African National Research Network (SANReN) and the Tertiary Education and
Research Network of South Africa (TENET). IU also coordinates domestically with
Internet2 and the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet). Through its extensive
regional partnerships, NEAAR has the potential to reach research and education
(R&amp;E) communities in over 80 countries across three
continents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEAAR has the potential to be transformational
to NSF-funded science by providing not only the network but also the human
expertise to make the most of international collaborations and data sharing,
thereby increasing research and educational opportunities. Through additional
capacity to Europe and targeted support of data and networking support services
in Africa, NEAAR will be able to support the majority of the NSF-funded research
sharing between Africa and the US. IU has identified over 60 preliminary groups
to work directly with to increase their data capacity and ability to
collaborate. Advanced data sharing fundamentally changes and extends the
research that is feasible between partners, and NEAAR has the potential to have
an unprecedented impact on US-Africa collaboration.
