The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to change the
fundamental economics of the recycling process. Although it is estimated that up
to 95% of the waste stream could be recycled, only a third of the 250 million
tons of municipal solid waste that are generated each year in the United States
is currently diverted. Greater diversion would provide immense savings in
landfill and processing costs, and benefit the environment as well. Tens of
millions of pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from virgin material mining may
be eliminated, and pollution from landfill waste reduced. The existing sorting
process is expensive and unprofitable, requiring human workers to manually sort
debris, an extremely dull, dirty, and dangerous profession. This innovation has
the potential to eliminate these trade-offs between cost and environmental
damage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase 2 project will create a scalable, integrated robotic system that
autonomously sorts material for recycling. This advance in autonomous systems is
made possible by a series of innovations in robotics: (1) tremendous
improvements in both computer vision and robotic manipulation, allowing for the
system to be deployed with virtually zero retrofitting in existing facilities;
(2) new motion planning techniques that allow for trajectories to be generated
in real time, customized for the characteristics of the waste, safety, and any
uncertainty in individual objects? position;&amp;#8232; and (3) modern machine
learning techniques that allow the system to classify waste at levels
approaching human performance, with a continual training signal obtained via
human supervision. These innovations pave the way for a new era in recycling,
where waste is sorted cheaply, safely, and reliably on a universal scale.
