This project will address the physical nature of irregularities in the
bottomside F-region equatorial ionosphere. These processes are a significant
contributor to equatorial ionosphere weather, and can affect the performance of
HF communication and over-the-horizon radar systems. The investigators will
conduct a low-cost experimental campaign using the dual coherent and incoherent
radar capabilities at Jicamarca to study the genre of irregularities known as
bottomside spread-F. They will use numerical simulation modeling of the F-layer
in conjunction with the observational data to formulate a theoretical basis for
observations and provide predictive capability for the occurrence of bottomside
spread-F and full scale equatorial spread-F.
