This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation-
Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition of an integrated
set of instruments to enable medium to high-throughput analysis of DNA, RNA, and
protein at the University of North Dakota (UND). A high capacity PCR unit,
tissue homogenizer, and associated liquid handling robot greatly enhance the UND
infrastructure to support biological research. The instrumentation enables
cutting-edge research training and classroom education in engineering and life
sciences at the interface of disciplines, i.e., ecological genomics, systems
biology, and the human-robot interface. The research is unified by an emphasis
on the genetic, epigenetic, and genomic bases of biological responses to
environmental stressors, including abiotic factors like temperature, atmospheric
gases, humidity, and heavy metals and biotic factors like herbivores and
nutrition. The influence of high-throughput technologies reaches beyond pure
research to provide significant new educational opportunities for undergraduate
and graduate students. Such training opportunities are especially important for
students who are demographically underrepresented in the life sciences and
engineering. The nature of modern research is epitomized by the newly acquired
instruments, stemming from interdisciplinary interactions among engineers,
computer scientists, physicists, chemists, and biologists. The instrumentation
allows students to gain valuable experiences, and may allow for the attraction
or formation of new companies and higher paying jobs to the area, which in turn
helps retain the state's talent and brainpower. Results from the studies enabled
by the new equipment will be disseminated by student and faculty presentations
at regional and national meetings, and through publication in peer-reviewed
journals.
