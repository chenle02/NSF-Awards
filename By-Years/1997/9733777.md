Shultz 9733777 The arthropods (arachnids, crustaceans, insects, centipedes,
etc.) are a very ancient and diverse group of animals that use many different
methods of locomotion. In all cases, locomotion depends on the efficient
interaction of two systems, namely, a skeletomuscular system that provides the
mechanical structures used in propulsion and a neuromuscular system that
controls the timing of movements. Recent research on a wide range of animals
suggests that evolution in the skeletomuscular system is relatively fast and
evolution of the neuromuscular system is relatively slow. The PI will test this
idea by examining relative rates of evolution in skeletomuscular and
neuromuscular features of the locomotor mechanisms of two arthropod groups, the
chelicerates (spiders, scorpions, etc.) and the centipedes. This will be
accomplished by mapping skeletomuscular and neuromuscular features on
phylogenetic trees and determining the relative placement of the two types of
characters in evolutionary history. Fast-evolving characters are expected to
appear near the ends of the branches in the tree, while the slowevolving
features are expected to appear near the base. The results of the project may
show that there are general patterns in the evolution of form and function.
