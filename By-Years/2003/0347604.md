CAREER: Advanced Nanostructured Damping Materials Proposal Number: CMS- 0347604
Principal Investigator: Nikhil A. Koratkar Department of Mechanical, Aerospace
and Nuclear Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street, Troy,
NY- 12180.

The goal of this project is to develop a new class of nanostructured damping
materials to overcome the limitations of traditional viscoelastic polymers. More
specifically, the technical objectives are: a) synthesize novel carbon nanotube
architectures to study the fundamental mechanisms for interfacial friction
damping in nanotube systems, b) characterize the effect of nanotube film
morphology on the damping and stiffness response, c) study sensitivity of
damping to environmental and operating conditions, and d) develop and
experimentally validate the design tools needed to predict system level damping
behavior as a function of nanotube film morphology and operating conditions.
Structural damping is required to ensure stability and low vibratory loads in a
variety of dynamic components. The outcome of this research will benefit the
performance, cost, safety and reliability of a range of structural systems. This
project will also have a strong educational impact since it demonstrates the
exciting possibilities that exist for directed assembly of nanoscale building
blocks to create new functional materials that have vastly superior properties
compared with traditional systems.
