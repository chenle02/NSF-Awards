In the development of our current understanding of condensed phases of matter
(e.g., solids, fluids, superfluids, liquid crystals, magnetism, etc.), the
concepts of symmetry and dimensionality have played vital roles. This is
especially true in the study of transitions from one phase to another where it
is currently believed that a knowledge of the dimensionality and of the change
in symmetry of the two phases is often sufficient for the determination of
singularities in the structural and thermal response functions of the system
very near the transition. This unifying concept is currently being widely tested
and exploited to systematize condensed matter phases according to their
sometimes subtle properties. Proposed here is a program of thermal and optical
studies of certain monomer and polymer liquid crystal phases and phase
transitions designed to reveal the place held by these interesting phases within
the broader scheme of condensed matter phases, wherein it appears they may fill
previously unknown but now conspicuous gaps.
