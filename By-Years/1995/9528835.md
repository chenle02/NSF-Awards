The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. J. D. McDonald of the
University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana in his investigations on reaction
dynamics. Specifically, Prof. McDonald will use a pump-probe technique to study
the dynamics of bimolecular chemical reactions on a picosecond timescale.
Reactants are van der Waals adducts formed in a cooled molecular beam, and
intermediates and/or products will be detected using either time-of-flight mass
spectrometry or laser-induced fluorescence. In addition, reaction processes will
be modeled by classical trajectory calculations or statistical theories. Typical
reactions to be investigated include rearrangements or decomposition of adducts
formed by addition of chlorine or oxygen atoms to unsaturated hydrocarbon
molecules. The results of this work are of great value to the understanding and
modeling of reactions which are important in combustion processes and in the
chemistry of the atmosphere. Oxygen atom reactions are very important in both
these complex systems, and chlorine atoms are important in the upper atmosphere.
