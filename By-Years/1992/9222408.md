Liu The research is on algorithms for high level synthesis and layout of VLSI
CAD designs. Algorithms for complex, large industrial type design problems are
being developed. Research topics include: 1. high level synthesis with
testability as an important goodness measure, 2. timing driven placement
algorithms for EPGAs, and 3. channel and switchbox routing in which the effect
of cross talk is to be taken into consideration. For the first problem, the
effect of register allocation and functional unit binding on the testability of
the circuit is being examined. Then the scheduling step is being examined.
Research on the second problem is based on the notion of a "neighborhood graph"
which is used in guiding an iterative improvement algorithm that produces
placements which satisfy given timing constraints. An integer programming
approach is being used for the third problem, because this avoids parallel long
wires that are close together in the routing solution.
