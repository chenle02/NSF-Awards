Project Shine (Shaping High-quality Integrated Nebraska Education) focuses on
Problem-Based Learning (PBL) professional development activities for secondary
and college faculty in collaboration with business and industry professionals.
Over a three-year period, 72 STEM faculty members participate in nineteen days
of professional development activities in applied science and mathematics
skills, PBL, and student recruitment. Cohort teams of educators work with
designated business mentors for at least one complete year as they develop/adapt
replicable PBL teaching resources as a result of their experiences. Faculty from
Central Community College and its project partners assist the educators with
integrating the PBL resources into their curricula. Additionally, up to 200
seventh to twelfth grade students of the Project SHINE instructors are
participating in gender-specific STEM Camps by providing support for young
females and minority males in studying math and science. Almost 5,000 Nebraska
middle and high school students are benefiting from Project Shine's professional
development program, increasing participation and success for these students in
entering high demand technical careers throughout Nebraska. One of the
dissemination paths for this project is the electronic library of nearly 200 PBL
resource materials. This e-library is housed at Mechatronics Education Center
(MEC) website (www.mechatronics-mec.org).
