This action fulds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. These
studies examine the role of opioid receptors in the induction of late genes
during long-term potentiation (LTP) at the hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapse.
LTP is a relatively long-lasting increase in synaptic efficiency resulting from
brief, high frequency stimulation of afferent fibers and is widely accepted as a
candidate mechanism for learning and memory in mammals. LTP at the mossy fiber-
CA 3 synapse of the hippocampus depends on the activation of opioid receptors,
requiring protein synthesis and gene expression. It is hypothesized that late
acting genes play important roles in maintenance of LTP and in learning and
memory. This research directly tests this hypothesis by determining the effects
of opioid antagonists and peptide agonists, by disrupting translation of
hippocampal late genes, by examining animals with disrupted late genes, and
determining changes in performance in learning and memory tasks. The role of new
gene expression in synaptic plasticity and in higher physiological processes
will be determined.
