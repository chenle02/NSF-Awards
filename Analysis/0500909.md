ABSTRACT

This project studies the complex and Kohn Laplacians in several complex
variables, the d-bar-problem on complex manifolds, as well as their applications
to and interplays with problems in algebraic geometry and quantum physics. One
of the main thrusts of the proposed research is systematical study of the d-bar-
Neumann and Kohn Laplacians along the lines of the classical spectral theory for
the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians. The investigator will continue his work on
the interplays between spectral behavior of these Laplacians and the underline
geometric structures. A problem of particular interest is to characterize
geometric structures on which these Laplacians have purely discrete spectrum.
The investigator will also study the spectral theory of related Schrodinger
operators with magnetic fields.

Complex analysis and differential equations arise naturally in physics,
engineering, chemistry, economics, and other sciences. Spectral analysis of
differential operators plays an important role in quantum mechanics. The
proposed research will further explore the intimate connections between the
seemingly unrelated problems in several complex variables and quantum mechanics.
It could lead to new understanding and discoveries in both fields. Ideas, tools,
and techniques developed in this project will also have repercussions in other
fields. This project will have direct impact on the development of human
resources; it will support development of new courses and texts that attract
students into mathematics and sciences. It will facilitate interdisciplinary
research activities with biologists and computer scientists.
