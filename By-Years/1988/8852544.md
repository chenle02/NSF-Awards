The number of available Spectronic 20 spectrophotometers in general chemistry is
being increased from two to twelve units. This is allowing all students in a
full laboratory section to perform experiments requiring extensive measurements
from these instruments. The new instruments are allowing the curriculum to
include experiments which establish the formula of complex ions, rates of
dissociation of complexes, kinetic rate laws for the bromination of acetone, and
other appropriate quantitative experiments. A second infrared spectrophotometer
is also being added. This is allowing the organic laboratory students to
increase their routine analysis of starting materials and synthesis products. It
is also facilitating the introduction of infrared analysis into the general
chemistry laboratory sections which are currently too large to be served by a
single instruments. An example of a new experiment, which has been added is a
study of the bonding in ligands of a cobalt (III) complex. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
