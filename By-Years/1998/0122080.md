ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Island Institute Islesboro GIS Technology
Collaboration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes a three-year pilot
project designed to study and then implement a community-integrated Geographic
Information system with an island community in the Penobscot Bay region of
Maine. The project will be developed and implemented in conjunction with
community members in the school, in the local land trust and on municipal
committees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project implements community integrated GIS
as it transfers skills from GIS professionals to ordinary citizens to empower
the community of Islesboro. A Major goal is to integrate GIS technology into the
existing community through the school and the land trust and the islands'
municipal committees. GIS skills and abilities will be transferred to the larger
community by introducing GIS technology in practical day-to-day decision-making
at the community level. The objective is to give Isleboro the tools, skills and
resources necessary to access and utilize scientific data and information for
the benefit of sustaining their community in the future. The efficacy of this
approach will lead to replication of the project in other
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
