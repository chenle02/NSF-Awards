This Cold Spring Harbor Symposium entitled "The Brain", is designed to focus on
brain biology and behavior and to encourage a way of thinking in neurobiology
that bridges from molecules to mental function. By bringing together molecular
neurobiology with systems neurobiology and model building, we hope to illustrate
that these approaches reinforce each other in an attempt to understand the brain
and its various functions.
