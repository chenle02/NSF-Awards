This project investigates algorithms and models for reliable processing in
distributed databases. The focus is on problems created by multiple site
failures coupled with lost messages, congestion in communication software (that
may cause network partition), and consistent recovery of partially replicated
database systems. The research will integrate several concepts that are being
developed in the context of transaction processing and in particular the
commit/termination protocols, and concurrency control theory.
