Despite numerous theoretical studies on evolution in heterogeneous environments
and empirical studies of genotype- environment interactions, patterns of
variation in the selective environment have been largely ignored by evolutionary
biologists. Theoretical studies have shown that the results of natural selection
in heterogeneous environments depend critically on the spatial and temporal
scale of heterogeneity in the selective environment. The selective environment
is define by changes rank order of fitness among genotypes (genotype-environment
interactions). The investigators will examine spatial and temporal heterogeneity
of selection in an oldfield population of Erigeron annuus, using three
replicated asexual genotypes as "photometers" to measure environmental
heterogeneity. Seedlings of the three genotypes will be planted in a sample grid
and monitored for survivorship and fecundity. Areas of positive spatial
autocorrelation of relative fitness will define the selective patch, and this
will be compared to variation in the physical environment. This research will
result in the first map of the selective landscape and will show temporal
changes in the selective surface during succession.
