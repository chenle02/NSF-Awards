Research will be conducted to provide reliable methods of analysis of composite
materials containing either spherical or elongated spheroidal inhomogeneities at
arbitrarily high volume fractions. A given ensemble of inhomogeneities will be
analyzed directly. This will allow for an accurate prediction of the overall
response of these materials, and also for an examination of how their properties
depend upon the internal distribution of inhomogeneities and the local stress
concentrations.
