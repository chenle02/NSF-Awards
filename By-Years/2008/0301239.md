This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will investigate business-
to-consumer (B2C) online auction mechanisms that are being engineered by online
merchants. Auctions were traditionally used for selling single items with a wide
dispersion in valuations among buyers. However, electronic markets have enabled
a new economic environment where commodities are now bought and sold using a
wide array of mercantile processes that include a variety of auction mechanisms.
The goal of this research is to study this new market environment from both
consumers' and sellers' perspectives. Typically, on-line auctions require
sellers to choose from various parameters. Given the characteristics of the
product and the consumer population that will be attracted to these auctions,
each auction can be designed to maximize the revenue generated from that
auction. On the other hand, consumers can choose certain strategies to maximize
the chances that they purchase products at the lowest possible prices. The study
will develop analytical models of various types of online auctions, both for
sellers and consumers. The analytical results will be validated by experimental
studies. The results of the study will be used in undergraduate and graduate
management classes to enhance students' understanding of incentives of various
agents in the economic environment. The results will also be made available to
scientific community through publications in refereed journals and conferences.
