University of Colorado, IUCRC- CSTF EEC-9632722 Abstract This award constitutes
a five year renewal of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC) for Separations Using Thin Films (CSTF) at the University of Colorado.
The objectives of the CSTF include: (1) to conduct basic research and related
developmental activities for the use of thin film technology in separation
processes, (2) to provide rapid technology transfer between Center reset
projects and industrial participants, and (3) to provide a graduate student
education focus in this technology area. The Center research program is based
on: (1) reversible chemical complexation, (2) membrane structure and
performance, (3) catalytic membrane reactions, and (4) membrane fouling. The
Center collaborates I/UCRCs at University of Tennessee and University of
Washington through two tie projects. Presently 12 companies and national
laboratories participate in the Center as sponsors. They pay an annual fee of
$40,000, participate in the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) which reviews the
research progress, recommends termination and initiation of projects, provides
industrial mentors to individual projects, and facilitates technology transfer.
