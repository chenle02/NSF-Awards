Most objects in the universe radiate electromagnetic energy that we call
blackbody radiation. The objects are in equilibrium with their surroundings and
therefore continually emit and absorb this type of energy. By studying the
energy, we can learn about the properties of the objects. When nuclear
scientists use the so-called atom smashers to force atomic nuclei together at
impressively high energies, highly excited subatomic furnaces are briefly
created. The furnaces do not live long enough to leisurely emit blackbody
radiation. Instead they emit bursts of thermal and non-thermal electromagnetic
radiation, similar to visible light, but at much higher energy. Safe and careful
study of the properties of the radiation provides precious clues to help
scientists understand how nature works within atomic nuclei, within even protons
and neutrons, even down to the very quarks that rattle around inside the
nucleons. The goal of this project is to support experimental endeavors which
seek to produce and study these subatomic furnaces. Advances in material science
and computer technology allow nuclear scientists to basically take pictures of
the particle dynamics using these bursts of electromagnetic radiation. Studying
theoretical models for these tiny nuclear systems provides education and
research training through meaningful mentoring of beginning students. Public
presentations and technical presentations will be offered discussing the results
of the research to stimulate more young people toward science, especially
presentations to high-school students in the region through a local (senior-to-
sophomore) program which encourages interaction between university faculty and
high-school teachers and students.
