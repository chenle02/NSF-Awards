This project aims to develop two new techniques for purifying biological
macromolecules such as enzymes and antibodies from complex media while attaining
high selectivity, yield, and activity. The techniques belong to the class of
affinity separation techniques but are distinguished by using affinity
surfactants. It is proposed that the use of affinity surfactants increases
effectiveness by limiting nonspecific hydrophobic interactions between different
proteins that plague other protein precipitation techniques. The target proteins
for the study are the oligomeric dehydrogenase enzymes and the class of IgG
antibodies. Affinity surfactants will be synthesized and purified as part of the
project. The surfactants will be used either directly dissolved in the aqueous
protein solution or by incorporation into unilamellar vesicles. Precipitation is
an important purification process in many chemical processes. It has had limited
utility in biotechnology because of the nonspecific nature of hydrophobic
interactions between proteins. Affinity surfactant precipitation of proteins is
a promising technique to improve the usefulness of precipitation technology in
downstream processing in biotechnology.
