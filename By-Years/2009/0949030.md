A three-day workshop is being held to address challenges specific to projects in
the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program
(STEP) that are partnerships between two-year and four-year institutions. The
five challenges that are being addressed include choosing and tracking
appropriate impact measures that span the different academic environments;
creating undergraduate research opportunities for more community college
students; fostering inter-institutional collaborations, even among distant
institutions; ensuring success of STEM transfer students; and sustaining,
disseminating, and institutionalizing a project. A total of 42 participants are
expected to attend the workshop to be held in October, 2009. The product of the
workshop will be a statement of goals and recommendations regarding the
challenges most in need of addressing.
