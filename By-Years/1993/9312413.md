9312413 Schrock This renewal award is made in the Advanced Materials and
Processing Program in support of the collaborative research of Professors
Schrock, Cohen and Silbey at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Support
is provided by The Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research. The focus of
the research is the synthesis of semiconductor clusters of lead and cadmium
sulfides of unusual shape, size and distribution. The approach will be to
synthesize metal carboxylate-containing block copolymers of a particular
morphology and convert them into metal sulfide clusters by treatment with
hydrogen sulfide. New metal-containing monomers and catalysts will be
synthesized for the development of new semiconductor-precursor polymers. More
general approaches to semiconductor cluster synthesis including aqueous methods
will be explored. In concert with experiments, the application of theoretical
methods to study the optical absorption, fluoresence and photoelectron spectra
of semiconductor crystallites as a function of their size, shape and surface,
will be developed. %%% Careful control of the size and shape of semiconductor
clusters will permit the synthesis of advanced materials with predictable and
controllable electronic and optical properties. ***
