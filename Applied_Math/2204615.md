Diverse phenomena such as the spread of an invasive species, turbulent
combustion, and the evolution of a cloud of particles in a gas can be modeled
using partial differential equations. These examples necessarily involve
nonlinearity, which is when the rate of change of a quantity depends on the
quantity itself. A simple illustration of nonlinearity is the so-called Allee
effect, where the reproduction rate of certain species is negative below a
minimum population size, perhaps due to factors such as cooperative defense or
mate limitation. Typically, nonlinearities present serious difficulties in the
analysis of the model. In the context of various scientifically relevant classes
of partial differential equations, this project aims to develop an understanding
of when a model can be approximated by a (simpler) linear one and, more
generally, which essential features are required by a minimal model to
faithfully represent the essential behavior of the original phenomenon. The
intent is to aid scientists to identify and implement the most tractable model
for their investigations. The project will provide training opportunities for
undergraduate students.

A focus of the project is to develop technical tools for understanding the
fundamental nature of the long-time behavior of several reaction-diffusion
equations. These model systems exhibiting growth (reaction) and spreading
(diffusion) in which an interface (front) forms and propagates with a constant
speed. Classically, these systems are divided into two categories based on the
underlying mechanism driving the movement of the front: linear behavior far
beyond the front ('pulled' fronts) or nonlinear behavior at the front ('pushed'
fronts). Often, the shape and speed of these fronts can depend strongly on
intrinsic properties of the system, generally represented by a parameter. As the
parameter changes, the character of the fronts may change from 'pulled' to
'pushed' or vice versa. New advances stemming from the recent introduction of
ideas such as relative entropy and quantitative steepness as well as a careful
understanding of the regularity of equations have opened the door to a high
level of precision in characterizing this pulled-pushed transition. A second
focus of the project is the development of the well-posedness theory of various
collisional kinetic equations.
