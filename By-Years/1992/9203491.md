The ideal goal of feedback control theory, "to employ imperfect models and
design perfect systems," critically depends on the characterizations of model
imperfections and on the design methodology. If the uncertain nonlinearities can
be characterized by a nonlinear bound or by a parametrization for which an
adaptive design is a available, then, as some of our results show, the designed
system may be "perfect" in the sense that the ideal tracking performance is
achieved globally. In this research we introduce structural and parametric
characterizations of model uncertainties and use them to develop adaptive and
robust nonlinear feedback designs which reduce the effects of uncertainties on
system performance. We plan to employ tuning functions to develop new adaptive
output-feedback schemes with minimal parametrizations and reduced complexity.
Our new partial-state-feedback schemes will exploit structural information to
assess tradeoffs between additional measurements and stability augmentation. We
will analyze robustness not only with respect to unmodeled dynamics and bound
disturbance, but also with respect to unmodeled nonlinearities. The dead-zone
and hysteresis characteristics are the representatives of the applications-
motivated uncertain nonlinearities to be addressed in the second part of this
research.
