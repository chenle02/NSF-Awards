In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor T. C. Steimle of Arizona State University will investigate (a) early
transition metal containing transient species associated with laser-induced
plasma dehydrogenation reactions that produce metallo-carbonhedrenes and
microclusters of titanium nitride, and (b) late second row (rhodium, palladium
and silver) and third row (iridium, platinum and gold) transition metal
dihydrides, carbenes, amides, imides, and metal-methyl, metal-ammonia and metal-
water insertion products. The species will be prepared by a combined laser
ablation and supersonic expansion technique, and will be probed by methods of
high resolution spectroscopy. Among these are the laser induced fluorescence in
the presence of a variable d.c. electric field and pump-probe microwave -optical
double resonance techniques. The research will provide data for the fundamental
understanding of the reaction chemistry of metals with organic and inorganic
molecules. This research has high relevance for the development of sophisticated
technologies, such as wear resistant coatings, and for developments in
catalysis.
