This DDEP proposal is to support PhD candidate Brad Ruhfel working under PI Dr.
Charles Davis to conduct research in Brazil. Mr. Ruhfel will collaborate with
two Brazilian mentors conducting field work, Professors Maria Amaral and Claudia
Bove from the Campinas State University and the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro respectively. Mr. Ruhfel?s proposed research will study the evolutionary
relatedness among various groups of plants including four families representing
87 genera and approximately 2,000 species, among them such economically
important plants as St. John Wort and tropical fruits such as the Mammey apples.
These families have an ancient fossil record, and are especially diverse in
Brazil. The research will provide an excellent opportunity to understand better
the assembly of modern tropical plants through molecular and bio-geographical
studies.
