The evolution of the San Andreas Fault System is controlled by thermal-
mechanical processes associated with development and evolution of a "slabless
window" formed beneath the western edge of North America. As a consequence of
the slabless window, the plate boundary separating the North American and
Pacific plates has a complex 3-D geometry which varies through time, with
important consequences for tectonic processes associated with the San Andreas
Fault System. In conjunction with a research effort at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, modeling and data interpretation activities will be
conducted to address the following: 1) Evaluation of the thermal, seismic, and
stress/strength evolution of the southern edge of the Gorda Plate as it
interacts with the slabless window beneath Northern California; 2) Investigation
of the thermal/petrologic evolution of the North American crust in association
with perturbations from mantle upwelling, magmatic underplating, and crust-
mantle mixing; 3) Detailed analyses of the evolution of the lower crustal -
upper mantle shear zones which serve as components of the plate boundary, the
development of crustal faults, and the displacement and deformation behavior of
crustal blocks associated with the San Andreas Fault System.
