This award provides partial travel support and local expenses for 10 graduate
students and/or new researchers to attend the conference and tutorial session on
Nonlinear Statistical Models on November 4-6, 1999 at the University of
Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky. The conference will focus on the development and
implementation of nonlinear stochastic models and particularly, the application
to problems in the biological sciences and industry. Four major sessions are
proposed: General Linear Models, Pharmacokinetic Models and Generalized
Compartment Models, Mixture Models, and Applications of Models and Industry.
Each session will feature a keynote address and approximately three half-hour
talks by leading experts in the field. The conference begins Friday morning,
November 5, and runs through Saturday afternoon November 6, 1999. In addition, a
special one-day workshop consisting of two tutorials will be held on Thursday
November 4, prior to the conference. The topics are: An Overview of
Compartmental models, taught by Professor David Allen, and Algorithms for
Nonlinear Models, by the conference organizers. Graduate students and new
researchers are encouraged to attend the tutorials, and also present their
research in a special poster session.
