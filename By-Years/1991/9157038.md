Dr. Terndrup will use this Presidential Young Investigator Award to support his
research on the inner bulge, halo, and disk of our Galaxy. Stellar abundances
and kinematics will be measured to determine the mass distribution of the inner
Galaxy and to constrain models of the formation of our Galaxy. The structure and
stellar population of the nuclear bulge of our Galaxy have been subjects of
great interest in the last ten years. Many basic questions, however, are yet
unanswered: How do the bulge and the disk of the Galaxy interact? Do the bulge
and halo have a separate history, or can they be understood as different
manifestations of the same old stellar population? What was the order of
formation of the bulge, disk, and halo, and what were the large-scale processes
that led to the current structure of the Milky Way? What is the relative
importance of thermal versus rotational support in the bulge, and are there
signs of bars or other bulk motions? Dr. Terndrup's research will address these
questions with an extensive observational survey of the kinematics and
abundances of stars in the Galactic bulge.
