The purpose of this project is to develop and enhance the quality of the Natural
Sciences courses through realistic and engaging field labs which provide
students a more comprehensive and in-depth experience. It uses the Payne's
Prairie State Preserve as a field site for gathering a variety of data in the
four related disciplines (biology, ecology, chemistry and geology) and uses the
interdisciplinary data base to generate realistic and engaging lab exercises in
15 courses with an annual enrollment of 5,930. The Payne's Prairie State
Preserve is a 12,000 acre, natural, protected site, ten miles from the College
which is a sanctuary for thousands of species of flora and fauna unique to north
central Florida. The College has been given access to remote areas of this
protected land.The major equipment request falls into three groups: 1. Computers
and peripherals to establish and maintain a data base to be shared by the four
discipline groups. 2. Equipment necessary to establish permanent meteorological
sites. 3. Video equipment with a display board to link images with computers.NSF
grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
