The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Colston Chandler of the University of Mexico and Dr. Gyula Bencze of the
Central Research Institute for Physics, Budapest, is to determine how various
approximate methods for N-body systems can be understood in the context of
general quantum scattering theory. Work will build upon analyses of equations
for systems of two and three charged particles in an effort to provide formulas
for numerical expressions in few-body physics. Results of the joint research
should yield reliable methods for quantitatively describing a larger class of
multichannel scattering processes. This project in theoretical physics fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
