A workshop will be held to assess technical information needs surrounding
development of regulatory guidelines associated with approval for field testing
of genetically engineered higher plants. The workshop will focus on a limited
number of specific genetic alterations which are the most advanced in leading to
practical plant products. U.S. and international experts will identify key
technical considerations surrounding proposed regulatory considerations, the
ecological relations of plant genotypes and the environmental setting and
necessary technical information necessary to assess consequences of deliberate
misuse of genetic alterations.
