Evolution involves change in the biochemical information that helps specify the
heritable phenotype of an organism. Mitotically heritable epigenetic
information, in the form of cellular levels of transcription factors, has been
proposed to specify differentiated cell phenotypes in multicellular organisms.
Similar epigenetic information may help specify heritable phenotypes of
asexually reproductive organisms. Furthermore, if such epigenetic information is
inherited in meiosis as well as mitosis, then it could also play a role
specifying heritable phenotypes of sexually reproductive organisms. The
Principal Investigator will design a DNA construct consisting of the gene
encoding the yeast activator, GAL4, driven off a promoter containing two GAL4
binding sites. This construct will be introduced into the yeast, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. The GAL4 encoded by this construct will have alternative steady
state cellular levels, each specifying a phenotypically distinguishable
epigenetic state. The inheritance of the alternative epigenetic states through
mitosis and meiosis will then be determined.
