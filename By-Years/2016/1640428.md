While recent approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) based
on&lt;br/&gt;machine learning from large quantities of data have delivered
valuable&lt;br/&gt;technology, this success has obscured earlier, more visionary
goals of&lt;br/&gt;getting computers to understand stories, to engage in
natural,&lt;br/&gt;cooperative dialogues with people, and to translate text and
speech&lt;br/&gt;fluently and accurately from one human language to another. As
such,&lt;br/&gt;this workshop highlights the value of bringing these early
visionary&lt;br/&gt;goals back into view. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
features established researchers who carried&lt;br/&gt;out early work in a major
sub-field of speech and language processing&lt;br/&gt;engaging in a moderated
public dialogue with younger researchers&lt;br/&gt;involved with significant new
ideas and/or methods. The workshop is&lt;br/&gt;organized into four sessions,
each with a moderator and invited&lt;br/&gt;speakers, on the topics of Dialogue
and Speech, Natural Language&lt;br/&gt;Generation, Text Understanding, and
Grounded Language. Dialogue in&lt;br/&gt;each session is enriched through
questions solicited beforehand from&lt;br/&gt;prospective attendees, as well as
impromptu questions from the&lt;br/&gt;audience. The workshop includes graduate
student scribes who&lt;br/&gt;collaborate to deliver a summary of each session,
and a poster session&lt;br/&gt;highlights the students' research. In addition to
the workshop&lt;br/&gt;proceedings, the workshop's outcome is a public report
based on notes&lt;br/&gt;contributed by the speakers and the session summaries
produced by the&lt;br/&gt;team of student scribes.
