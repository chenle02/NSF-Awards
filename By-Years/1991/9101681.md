Research directed at structural characterization of tubulin isotypes (gene
products) and isoforms (post-translational variants) will be continued. The
specific objectives will be to: (1), complete the structural characterization of
the neuron-specific class III isotype, with particular attention to the
determination of the connectivity of the side chain glutamylation; (2), use
tandem mass spectrometry in conjunction with enzymatic digestion and specific
chemical modifications to sequence and characterize post-translational
modification, especially polyglutamylation and phosphorylation, of other beta-
tubulin isotypes; and (3), synthesize and determine the applicability of
photoaffinity labels of the colchicine class for localization of the binding
site on tubulin heterodimer, followed by tandem mass spectrometry sequencing of
the modified tubulin. Microtubules are an extremely important class of cellular
structural proteins (cytoskeleton) which contribute to the morphological and
functional characteristics of the cell: they comprise the basis for structure
and function of flagella and cilia; they are the key cytoskeletal elements
associated with chromosomal movement and polarity of cellular divisions; they
provide an intracellular scaffolding to maintain cell shape; and since certain
intracellular transport phenomena in eukaryotic cells utilize microtubules as
the structural track along which transport takes place, they contribute to
directional or spatial organizational aspects of cellular function and
subcellular dynamics. The long term goal of these studies is to understand the
functional significance of the structural variations which are present in
tubulin isoforms and isotypes.
