The Constructive Functions 2014 Conference and School will be a five day event
dedicated to constructive function theory and related fields; it will occur May
26-30, 2014, at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. The conference
will focus on orthogonal polynomials, potential theory, discrete and continuous
energy problems, special functions, Pad√© approximation, polynomial inequalities,
and various problems related to optimization and efficiency. The plenary
speakers will deliver research level talks on topics such as the connection
between orthogonal polynomials, operator theory, and random matrices; polynomial
approximation and applications to numerical analysis and quadrature; and Riemann
Hilbert problems. Parallel sessions of non-plenary speakers will include many
more topics. Furthermore, the event will include four lectures (the school)
aimed at young researchers and designed to provide an introduction to important
research topics in constructive function theory. Topics to be covered are
Riemann Hilbert problems for orthogonal and multiple orthogonal polynomials,
discrete minimum energy problems, orthogonal polynomials on finite gap sets, and
numerical computing with functions and approximation.

This conference and school presents an exceptional opportunity for many
researchers in constructive function theory. While a special emphasis will be
placed on young researchers during the school portion of this event, the new
research presented at the conference will help progress the discipline and
foster communication and collaboration between researchers from around the
world. An active field of research for more than a hundred years, constructive
function theory has found new applications in many areas of science including
the modeling of physical processes with random matrices, the modeling of
geological phenomena using potential theory, and machine assisted numerical
analysis. The applicability of results in this field is intimately linked to the
wide variety of subjects that it includes. This conference and school aims to be
an inclusive event that brings together researchers from all aspects of
constructive function theory to share the results of their past research and
explore the possibilities for future discovery.
