A major problem in stellar astrophysics has been reconciling the discovery that
at least one half of the mature (main sequence) stars one sees in the skies are
actually close double stars, or "binary" stars, whereas stars that are still
forming, T Tauri stars, seem overwhelmingly to be single stars. Thanks largely
to previous NSF-supported work by this Principal Investigator (PI) this
discreprancy now seems clearly due to the difficulty of discovering binarity
among very young stars from conventional spectroscopic techniques. Working at
infrared wavelengths, the PI has used the moon as a "knife edge" to occult
(eclipse) pre-main sequence stars in the Taurus region of the sky to determine
whether they are single or double stars. In the last few years he has found that
13/28 of occulted T Tauri stars are members of double or triple star systems.
The PI proposes to extend this work to T Tauri stars in the Ophiuchus region of
the sky as the Moon's orbit progresses southward over the next few years. In
addition to adding to the statistics of young binary stars, the PI plans to
observe some of the occultation events from two locations simultaneously, Hawaii
and Kitt Peak. This work is expected to clarify the conditions under which
solar-type stars form binary stars as opposed to single stars with planetary
systems.
