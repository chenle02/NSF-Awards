The proposal focuses on the effect of math and science skills learned in high
school on the later earnings, employment, and education of non-college-bound
youth. While analyst have given considerable attention to the effect of taking
math and science on getting into the pipeline to college, little attention has
been given to the effects of math and science for non-college-bound youth. At
the same time, the employment and earnings of non- college-bound youth have both
fall substantially, causing serious concern among policy makers. The proposed
study will be based on the High School and Beyond Survey which covers a complete
decade after high school allows for detailed analysis of types of importantly,
the survey data cover recent years when the drop in the earnings of non-college-
educated people has been quite severe. This work should provide valuable
insights into the impact of math and science skills learned in high school on
outcomes later in life for the large portion of youth who are non-college- bound
and are after overlooked in other work.
