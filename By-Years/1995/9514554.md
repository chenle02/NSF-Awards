The visual cortex of the brain is a major site of activity involved in visual
perception. This large network of interacting nerve cells, or neurons, analyzes
the activity of neural information coming from the eyes, and generates activity
patterns itself. The precise mechanisms of how this analysis is achieved have
not yet been fully detailed at the level of neurons and connections between
neurons. There are a variety of categories of interacting nerve cell classes,
based on their morphology, connections, electrophysiological characteristics,
and areas of the visual field to which they respond. This project uses
electrophysiological, anatomical and computational tools to see how function and
structure are correlated in this complex structure. Recent results from several
laboratories have revealed a pattern of synchronization in a subset of cortical
neurons, showing oscillatory electrophysiological activity at frequencies in the
range of 30-60 Hz. This project is designed to reveal some of the cellular
mechanisms which may underlie how these synchronized oscillations depend on the
configuration of visual stimuli, and which may play a role in sensory
processing. Results from this work will be important in testing a currently
controversial issue of visual processing, and will be important beyond visual
physiology, to help understand cortical and complex brain organization in
general, and to understand mechanisms of perception of the external environment.
