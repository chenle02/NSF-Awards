This award provides support for the participation of eight US scientists in a
joint US-Japan seminar on "the Biophysical Chemistry of Retinal Proteins". The
chemistry of retinal proteins is a rapidly emerging area of biophysics. Retinal-
containing pigments are a class of intrinsic membrane proteins the mediate
energy and information transduction. Much research in this area concentrates
upon the molecular mechanisms of the transduction processes and recent progress
on site-specific mutagenesis, sequence and structure determination and
spectroscopic studies of intermediate structure and dynamics now present the
real possibility of determining the molecular mechanism of these processes. Most
of the main contributions to this area have been made by American and Japanese
scientists, many of whom it is intended should participate in this seminar. For
this reason the seminar should provide an excellent forum for formulating a more
complete picture or retinal transduction. The seminar is to be held on January
12-18, 1992 at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu. The co-organizers are
Professor Richard Mathies, Department of Chemistry, University of California,
Berkeley and Associate Professor Toshiaki Kakitani, Department of Physics,
Nagoya University, Japan. Specific topics to be discussed at the seminar include
(1) retinal protein structure and genetics; (2) chromophore structure and the
environment; (3) photoactivation of retinal-proteins; (4) analysis of structure
and transduction mechanisms; and (5) pigment regeneration and signal transduc-
tion. These topics represent the right combination of biochemistry,
spectrochemistry and genetic engineering to make a real contribution to this
subject area. The seminar will permit representatives from several research
groups in the two countries to meet and exchange information which could lead to
more extensive research collaboration.
