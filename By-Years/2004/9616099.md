9616099 Parker This is an award to provide renewed support for the operation of
the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, National
Research Council's Water Science Technology Board. This Board provides a focal
point for studies related to environmental engineering and hydrology. The
Board's objective is to improve the scientific and technological basis for
resolving important questions and issues relating to management of water
resources. This award is jointly supported by the Environmental Engineering
segment of the Environmental Systems Program in the Engineering Directorate and
by the Hydrologic Sciences Program in the Directorate for Geosciences. An
important function of the Water Science Technology Board is to conduct studies
and to sponsor workshops and conferences that can be utilized for program
planning purposes. The Board also functions as an appropriate means for
coordination of research plans with other Federal agencies including FEMA, USGS,
EPA, DOE, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. ***
