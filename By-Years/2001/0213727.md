EUGene is a software program that scholars use to build quantitative data sets
in order to analyze international conflict. The software routinizes a set of
data preparation tasks that are cumbersome and difficult, merging data from
input data sets with differing formats into output data sets according to easily
specified user choices. EUGene also generates data for variables concerned with
an important expected utility theory of conflict initiation and escalation.
EUGene was initially developed under a prior National Science Foundation grant
and released publicly in 1998. It was expanded, with other additions made
without NSF funding. EUGene is available for free download to the research
community from http://www.eugenesoftware.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current
project further develops the EUGene software. To this point, key analyses have
been accomplished using the expected utility data generated by EUGene; continued
program development will remain focused on expanding the program's data
management aspects. In this next phase, the Principal Investigator adds
additional user data sets to the program and deals with problematic user data,
adds another unit of analysis to create datasets to better analyze processes of
dispute escalation and conflict joining behavior, adds additional conflict data,
tracks data sets for easier replication, makes additional alliance data
available, and implements various other small improvements. Other expansion
items may be added over the next two years in response to user requests.
Continued development of EUGene provides the community of quantitative
international relations researchers with a tool that facilitates new research
and expands ongoing research
agendas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
