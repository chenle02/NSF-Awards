Pego&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0905723&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The focus of this work is on
understanding stable dynamical&lt;br/&gt;behavior in complex nonlinear systems.
A variety of phenomena&lt;br/&gt;are investigated in models of strong physical
interest,&lt;br/&gt;especially: dynamic scaling in models of aggregation
and&lt;br/&gt;coarsening (coagulation equations with input, simplified
grain&lt;br/&gt;growth models in metallurgy, ballistic aggregation with
soft&lt;br/&gt;collisions); the robustness of coherent structures in
nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;field theories (in particular, spectral stability for
exact&lt;br/&gt;solitary water waves); and stability analysis for
incompressible&lt;br/&gt;viscous fluids in light of recent progress on boundary
conditions&lt;br/&gt;for pressure (addressing domains with corners, coupling
to&lt;br/&gt;magnetism and stress relaxation, and the zero-viscosity limit).
&lt;br/&gt;Work on dynamic scaling in particular aims to further
develop&lt;br/&gt;ideas that connect dynamical systems methods with
infinite&lt;br/&gt;divisibility theory in probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Progress in this program leads to improved mathematical&lt;br/&gt;methods for
understanding how coherent behavior emerges in&lt;br/&gt;complex nonlinear
systems. The particular models to be studied&lt;br/&gt;mathematically are of
fundamental scientific interest, relevant&lt;br/&gt;to materials science at the
nanoscale, aerosol physics (models of&lt;br/&gt;smog, soot, and smoke),
population genetics, physical chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;and other fields. The work on
fluid boundaries should lead to&lt;br/&gt;improvements in the numerical modeling
of small-scale flows, with&lt;br/&gt;consequences for studying small flying and
swimming objects,&lt;br/&gt;blood flow, and engineered microfluidic systems, for
example.&lt;br/&gt;
