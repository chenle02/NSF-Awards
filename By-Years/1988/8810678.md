The history of women's entrance into male-dominated professions such as law and
medicine provides a unique and powerful framework for understanding the dynamics
of professionalization and gender in society. While the profession of medicine
has attracted much attention from historians and has resulted in several
scholarly works, the history of women in the American legal profession has not
been scientifically explored. This project will provide the first quantitative,
historical analysis of women lawyers in modern American society. A profile of
several generations of women lawyers will be compiled with the analysis focusing
on long-term social, demographic, educational, family, and professional
characteristics. In addition to aggregate census data, the primary data sets for
the study include (1) a survey of approximately 300 women lawyers undertaken in
1920 by the Bureau of Vocational Information; (2) professional digests published
in 1939 and 1949; and (3) the Martindale-Hubbell Law Directories of practicing
women laywers. These sources will yield invaluable statistical information on
the socio-economic characteristics, attitudes, and career patterns of these
women. The emphasis in the analysis of the three data sets will be on
generational and cohort effects. By utilizing data bases that examine individual
women lawyers, the study is able to reconstruct generational cohorts of women
lawyers, and analyze long-term social change in the legal profession. This study
will contribute significantly to the growing body of scholarly knowledge of the
history of the legal profession and the professionalization of women in America.
It will move the history of women lawyers beyond the traditional focus on women
lawyers and the obstacles imposed by legal doctrine to focus on women lawyers in
society at large. In doing so, the study will expand the parameters of
scientific work on legal history and the legal profession.
