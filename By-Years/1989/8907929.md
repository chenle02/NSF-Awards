The objective of this research is the analysis and interpretation of radiation
observations made during the FIRE conducted near San Nicolas Island, California.
The results should help to describe the role of strato-form clouds in modifying
both solar and terrestrial radiation in the atmosphere. A second objective,
using cloud microphysical observations from Hawaii, is devoted to the
determination of the fraction of water entering a convective cloud which
eventually falls as rain.//
