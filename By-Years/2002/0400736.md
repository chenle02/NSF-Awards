This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Mechanisms of Transcriptional
Activation and Repression in a methanoarchaeon." The first step of protein
synthesis in all organisms is transcription but it differs among the three
domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. It is the interaction of
several proteins required for transcription that is being investigated in an
environmentally abundant but heretofore understudied group of microorganisms.
