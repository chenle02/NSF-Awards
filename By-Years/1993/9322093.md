9322093 BOWERS This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental
Sciences at the University of Virginia to continue a successful REU program for
the next two years. A10-week research program for undergraduates will be
conducted where basic principles of ecology are taught, and the methods by which
scientists increase our understanding of the natural world detailed. The program
will be comprised of three phases: I -- Two weeks of formal lectures detailing
the scientific method, hypothesis testing and experimental design; II -- 6 1/2
weeks of data collection and experimentation; and III -- 1-1/2 weeks of data
analysis, interpretation and communication of results. The goal is show students
how to "do" science and then give them an opportunity to conduct original and
independent field research. Students are sought from a diversity of backgrounds,
interests and home institutions. The focus of the program will be on testing
hypotheses related to plant-animal interactions, population dynamics, and
conservation biology--topics that have considerable basic/applied interest, and
high heuristic value. Students will conduct research in a field-station setting
at the Blandy Experimental Farm, a biological field station of the University of
Virginia, and will be immersed in a community of 15 -20 graduate/post-doctoral
researchers. Field trips will focus on issues related to conservation; a weekly
seminar series at the Farm will also add to the research experience. A bio-
ethics component is included in the program consisting of weekly
lectures/discussions lead by Mr. David Bosco, Instructor of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at James Madison University. Faculty wages, 1/2 the cost of a
small truck, and fees for laboratory space/dorm rooms are being contributed as
cost share items. ***
