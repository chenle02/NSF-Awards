Informal learning in math, science, and technology is an increasingly important
vehicle for educating the public. Throughout their lifetime, the average citizen
will spend a much greater amount of time in informal learning environments than
in school. For these efforts to continue without benefit of understanding, the
dynamics of what makes informal learning experiences work, is a waste of
valuable funding resources. Research Communications Ltd. (RCL) proposes an
effort to investigate what has been learned about informal learning in math,
science, and technology and to develop some directions for future research in
this important area. The first step in the process would be to review the
existing literature in the three primary areas of informal education for math,
science, and technology: television/radio, community projects, and science
museums and technology centers with a focus on evaluation studies that have
shown what strategies have worked and those that have not. The outcome of this
effort would be a comprehensive publication of what is currently known about
informal learning research in math, science and technology.
