9725248 Bodnar The objective of the proposed research is to develop the
hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC) for use as a pressurized fluid inclusion
stage. The HDAC will then be used in conjunction with the synthetic fluid
inclusion technique to obtain PVTX data for geologically-important system
H2O-CO2 NaCl at temperatures and pressures beyond the range accessible with
conventional experimental techniques normally used to determine PVTX properties
of fluids. Results of a pilot study document the feasibility of using the HDAC
as a pressurized fluid inclusion stage to prevent non-elastic volume changes for
such inclusion by heating the gas salt-bearing inclusions under a high
hydrostatic confining pressure in the HDAC. In this study, the HDAC will be used
as a pressurized fluid inclusion stage to determine the P-T location of the
H2O-CO2solvus and the slopes of isochores at pressures up to approximately 7-9
kbar. The research will also result in the development of a protocol for the
most efficient use of the HDAC as a pressurized fluid inclusion stage for the
study of natural fluid inclusions that currently cannot be studied in the
conventional one-atmosphere heating stage.
