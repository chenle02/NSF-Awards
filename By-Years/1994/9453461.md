The focus of this research is the synthesis and study of epoxy ketones.
Specifically, the synthesis of the natural product manumycin will be carried out
and the mechanism of action of the compound will be studied. Research experience
is used as a focal point for the teaching of both undergraduate and graduate
students. Dr. Peter Wipf is being funded by the Synthetic Organic Program as a
Presidential Faculty Fellow. He will focus his research efforts on the design of
new sunthetic methodology and its application to natural products chemistry. Dr.
Wipf will be involved in the teaching of both undergraduate and graduate
students.
