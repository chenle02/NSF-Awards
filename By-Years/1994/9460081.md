This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a new approach
to the growth of large-area, low-cost, high-quality beta silicon carbide ((-SiC)
epitaxial layers grown on silicon wafers. The proposed process is based on a
vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth technique. In VLS growth, a solvent layer is
supplied with carbon by reaction with vapor-phase hydrocarbons, while epitaxial
growth occurs from the liquid phase. Thus, the process may be viewed as a hybrid
CVD/LPE technique. To overcome the 20% lattice mismatch, a thin (10 to 100 nm)
(-SiC buffer layer is formed on a silicon substrate using a chemical conversion
process. This approach has many potential advantages that stem from the hybrid
nature of the technique. It combines many of the advantages of liquid-phase
epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition. An important feature of this technique is
the flexibility with which doped epitaxial layers can be grown. Beta silicon
carbide is widely recognized as the most promising semiconductor material for
high-temperature electronics and high-power microwave electronic devices.
