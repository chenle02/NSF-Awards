9302865 Biscaye Funds are provided so that the LDEO nephelometer data set
collected over two decades from the worlds ocean can be complied into a usable
form using current computers. The data will be plotted, interpreted and
published. The PI has already amply proven the extreme value of this type of
data in a completed study of the Atlantic in various oceanographic disciplines.
