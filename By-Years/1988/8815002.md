Intensification of agricultural production is a common outcome of development
in third world countries. There is a commonly held notion that agricultural
intensification in traditional societies leads to a decrease in the types and
varieties of plants grown and a concomitant loss of knowledge about those
previously grown. However, almost no research has been conducted to determine
under which set of circumstances this assumption is valid. During this project,
the researcher will test the assumption that intensification leads to
simplification and loss of knowledge by peasant farmers. He will study peasant
maize farmers in Chiapas, Mexico to see if modern intensive agricultural methods
are used to maintain diversity in resource poor areas in the highlands and
lowlands. Special attention will be given to identifying crucial variables in
the decision making process of individual farmers. This project will contribute
to our understanding of the way resource poor farmers adapt their agricultural
production to their environment as they intensify. In addition, the data from
this project will help policy makers understand the potential and limitations of
efforts aimed at increasing agricultural productivity in Mexico.
