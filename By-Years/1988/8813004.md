The Highlands Biological Station is a year-round facility for research on the
ecology, systematics and biogeography of plants and animals of the southern
Appalachian Mountains. The location of the Station near the crest of the Blue
Ridge, in a region of high biological diversity, provides exceptional
opportunities for field-oriented research which addresses basic scientific
questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. This project will allow the
Station to renovate the main laboratory for more efficient winter use, develop
part of another building as a freshwater stream laboratory, and expand and
automate the collection of climatic data. These enhancements will substantially
improve the research capabilities of the site.
