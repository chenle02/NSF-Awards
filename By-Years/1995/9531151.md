The focus of this research is the rational development of chiral nonracemic
sulfer-nitrogen reagents including N-sulfinylaziridines, primary sulfonamides
and N-fluorosulfonimides. New N-sulfinylaziridines will be used in the
enantioselective preparation of 2H-azirines and 2H-azirine 2-carboxylic acids,
both useful intermediates for the preparation of bioactive nitrogen-containing
compounds. Other research will focus on the use of achiral N-fluorosulfonimides
as agents for site-specific fluorination. With this renewal award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Franklin A. Davis of the
Department of Chemistry at Temple University. Professor Davis will focus his
work on the use of sulfur-nitrogen reagents for the preparation of
enantiomerically pure compounds. The synthesis of enantiomerically pure
compounds is an important objective since biological activity often depends
critically on the molecular shape and absolute stereochemistry of molecules.
