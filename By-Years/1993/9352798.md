9352798 Hazelewood This proposal is for the acquisition of a parallel computing
unit to support laboratory assignments for undergraduates in the Departments of
Computer Science and Mathematics. Modules including lab assignments will be
developed for inclusion in eight existing courses together with the development
of a new undergraduate course in parallel computing. Software usable in closed
lab sessions will be generated as a product of undergraduate research projects.
Where appropriate, a portable interface will be used to facilitate the use of
laboratory software in other computing environments. The proposed parallel
configuration will interface with equipment on hand to support open and closed
laboratory sessions, timings on a dedicated machine, and undergraduate research.
