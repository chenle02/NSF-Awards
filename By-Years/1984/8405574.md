The parameters affecting foam-enhanced devolatilization of polymer melts is
investigated. A model is developed to describe this process. This model could be
used subsequently for the design and selection of devolatilization equipment.
The elementary processes occurring in devolatilization equipment (rotating melt
pools, melt films with surface renewal) are studied experimentally in a
specially designed laboratory apparatus. The parameters being studied include
exposure time, agitation time, surface to volume ratio, melt viscosity, vapor
pressure of the volatile contaminant, vacuum level, and concentration level of
the contaminant.
