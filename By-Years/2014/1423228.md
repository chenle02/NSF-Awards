All exact numerical algorithms must implicitly solve some "Zero Problem", namely
decide if various well-defined numbers arising in the course of its computation
are actually zero. The inability to decide zero is the root cause of pervasive
numerical nonrobustness in many applications. The PI side-steps the Zero Problem
by introducing "resolution-exact" algorithms. Intuitively, they solve the
problem up to any given epsilon parameter. Recent successes of this approach are
seen in the PI's work in motion planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more technical
detail, this award studies resolution-exactness to three classes of
problems:&lt;br/&gt;(A) Computing the Voronoi diagrams of polyhedral sets in 3D,
or of k-ellipses in 2D where no current "explicit" exact algorithms are
known.&lt;br/&gt;(B) Analytic and harmonic root isolation, in which exact
methods fail because of the implicit Zero Problem. &lt;br/&gt;(C)
Explicitization Problems such as computing the Morse-Smale complex of a nice
scalar function, and isotopic approximation of algebraic varieties of co-
dimension 2 (e.g., spatial curves).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to treat
analytic problems is new for Theoretical Computer Science. Many problems of
Computational Science and Engineering are defined on the continua, and have no
exact solutions; resolution-exact algorithms provide practical yet
theoretically-sound algorithms for them. More broadly, this work contributes to
the emerging area of symbolic-numeric computation. The PI's research trains a
new generation of Computer Science students using new tools for attacking
continua problems.
