Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that
investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform
information-processing tasks. This research project establishes and provides the
core funding for a new center, the Center for Quantum Information and Control
(CQuIC), based at the University of New Mexico (UNM), with a major component of
experimental research at the University of Arizona (UA). CQuIC brings a quantum-
information perspective to physics-based research. In particular, research
within CQuIC applies the new ideas and techniques of QIS to the state-of-the-art
laboratory tasks of controlling the behavior of quantum systems, so these
systems can be made to do what scientists want them to do, instead of doing just
what comes naturally, and of making high-precision measurements.

CQuIC specializes in the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows
for research careers in QIS. Students at UNM and UA are exposed to a full range
of courses and other activities, which provide an interdisciplinary integration
of information-theoretic and physics perspectives. CQuIC partners with four
external institutions, the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of
Maryland, the quantum information and quantum nanoscience groups at the
University of Queensland, Sandia National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National
Laboratory. These partnerships focus on a two-way flow of ideas and people, thus
expanding the theoretical and experimental capabilities available to CQuIC and
the partnering institutions. CQuIC is the administrative home for the Southwest
Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) Network, which promotes QIS research
at about 20 institutions located mainly in the US Southwest.
