This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) Phase II project aims to accelerate the commercialization of an enabling
nanomaterial for joining semiconductor chips. The unique features of this
innovative material would reduce the manufacturing cost for making lead-free
electronics that are required to work in harsh environments and to possess
significantly improved performance and reliability over the state-of-the-art
technologies. This project focuses on obtaining and sharing extensive scientific
knowledge that will lower the risk and barrier for electronic manufacturers
worldwide to rapidly implement this nanomaterial in mass
production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of a successful project
will be to electronics manufacturers in the United States. The U.S. has fallen
behind their European and Asian competitors in the move to lead-free products.
This enabling nanomaterial will reduce manufacturing complexity and cost, and
will help U.S. manufacturers in capturing a significant share of nearly $500
million-dollar market for chip-attach materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
