9451948 Williams A new advanced undergraduate laboratory in plasma physics will
be created for training students who will specialize in high technology areas
which rely on a working knowledge of plasma phenomena, such as plasma processing
of materials, fusion energy and gaseous electronics. Two experimental stations
will be built, on which students will learn basic vacuum techniques, plasma
production techniques, basic plasma diagnostics. Students will be introduced to
basic plasma physics by studying particle motions, fluid phenomena, waves,
beams, diffusion, resistivity, equilibrium, stability, kinetic theory and
nonlinear effects. Lecture notes and a laboratory manual will be generated.
