It is proposed to develop a laser cooling theory for multi- state atoms in
fully three dimensional light fields. Operator algebra is employed to express
the theory in terms of Matrix operations suitable for implementation on a
computer. One will obtain the force and diffusion coefficients characterizing
the mechanical effects of light and finally simulate numerically the motion of
an atom. Numerical experiments will be made for quantitative aspects such as the
temperature of the atoms and qualitative features such as possible trapping of
atoms in the structures of a standing wave field.
