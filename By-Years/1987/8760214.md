Prediction of catastrophic and costly failures in structural components has been
hampered by the inability to measure stress levels in critical components with
accuracy. The steps needed to develop a stress measurement system that relies on
ultrasonic (acoustoelastic) wave measurements are considered. The recent
advancements made in the use of critically refracted longitudinal waves (CRLW),
coupled with the expansion of computer-assisted ultrasonic detection systems,
have given impetus to this research. This study involves the analysis of the
CRLW phenomena, identification of state-of-the-art support apparatus,
experimental verification of fundamental premises, and the development of a
design specification for a stress analysis system.
