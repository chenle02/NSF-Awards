This proposal requests support for a group at Bucknell University for a program
of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics based on
the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab. The experiment involves an investigation
of the KARMEN timing anomaly and a search for neutral heavy leptons, sterile
neutrinos and neutral supersymmetric and axion-like particles. The KARMEN
anomaly is an excess of neutrino events detected in the KARMEN experiment at the
ISIS spallation neutron facility at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and may be
due to a rare non-Standard Model p+ decay mode: m+Q0 where Q0 denotes a massive,
neutral, weakly interacting unstable particle. The study of the anomaly requires
a comprehensive investigation of possible background contributions, the main
component of the proposed work of the Bucknell group. The work will be performed
in collaboration with a group of undergraduates.
