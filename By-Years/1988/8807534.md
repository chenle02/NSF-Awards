This research involves the design of randomized algorithms that are especially
economical in their use of random bits, and the study of the use of pseudorandom
numbers in randomized algorithms. Under developmentive parallel algorithms for
graph-theoretic problems and for testing relative primality. Geometric
structures, such as the two-and three-dimensional Delaunay triangulation, will
also be investigated.
