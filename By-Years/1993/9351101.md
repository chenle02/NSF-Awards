This project enhances an existing instrumentation and control curriculum to
enhance laboratory activities in Electronics Technology, an engineering related
program within the College of Technology at Bowling Green State University.
Specifically, students will gain the ability to construct models of a physical
system based on theoretical calculations. These models will be exercised and
performance data collected. The students will then reconcile the discrepancies
between the model and the physical system. In addition to serving the
Electronics Technology students, Computer Science students who minor in
microcomputer specialization are required to take courses that will use the
laboratory workstations.
