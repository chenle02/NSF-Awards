This award will support a detailed study of sedimentation in the maldive
Archipelago in the western Indian Ocean. Analysis of the history of
sedimentation in the region will be used to examine the history of sea level for
this carbonate-dominated sedimentary regime. Study of a global array of such
sites is needed to separate local tectonic affects from globally synchronous
changes in sea-level. Additionally, the data and analysis will be used to
evaluate the potential for future drilling in the region by the Ocean Drilling
Program. ***
