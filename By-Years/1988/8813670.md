Dielectric particles in an applied electric field tend to form chains aligned
parallel to the field. This research will measure the force between chained
dielectric particles and the effective dipole moment of the chain as functions
of the particle type, particle size, and chain length. These measurements will
be made in an improved dielectrophoretic levitation apparatus. A theory for the
interparticle force will be developed paying special attention to non- linear
electrical effects arising from the high field in the small gap between adjacent
particles. The dielectric force and particle chaining play essential roles in
electrorheology for the control of properties of particle suspensions and in
xerographic printing with toner particles. The current research should aid the
engineering of these processes which until now have remained largely based on
empiricism.
