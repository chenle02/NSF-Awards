This project is concerned with face seal performance under conditions where a
phase change may take place. The program is primarily theoretical, but extensive
use is made of existing data, industrial experience and ongoing experiments at
NASA Lewis, This project will develop more complete and accurate analytical
models for steady and transient behavior of face seals and for their stability
analyses under a wide variety of practical operating conditions. Current
industrial design of high pressure pumps and rotating machinery is moving in a
direction where two-phase conditions are definitely occurring in the seal gap as
examples, high pressure water pumps and cryogenic liquid pumps. Moreover, in
very simple common operating seals the two-phase condition is often present and
may dominate the behavior and performance of the seal. A thorough understanding
is essential for proper design under such conditions.
