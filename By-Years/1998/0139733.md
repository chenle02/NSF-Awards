Prop #: 0139733 PI: Timothy Askew

This award will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research
vessels Seward Johnson I and Seward Johnson II operated by the Harbor Branch
Oceanographic Institution and dedicated to use in support of marine research.
The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship
equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science
research. The Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Timothy Askew is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to acquire Markey
Winch Control System and a Hydro Van Replacement (through UDEL group purchase).
