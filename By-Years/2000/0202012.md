This project focuses on the study of cold season, subtropical surface cyclones,
known as the Kona lows, that occur in the northern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean
basins. The Kona lows are responsible for much destructive weather in the
Hawaiian Islands. These cyclone systems originate from extratropical upper level
shortwaves and then develop and propagate to the lower troposphere in sub-
tropical regions. The research will include: 1) building the climatology of the
Kona lows and the evolution of their associated large-scale environment, and
constructing the composite structure of the Kona lows using the ECMWF
reanalysis; 2) studying single cases selected either as a trapped occluded
cyclone or an example of cyclogenesis in the tradewind easterlies beneath a
strengthening upper tropospheric disturbance. The diagnostics for these cases
will employ output from simulations using a mesoscale model; and 3)
investigating the energetics of both the composite and the single cases.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide insight into the dynamics and
thermodynamics of cyclones that bear both extra-tropical and subtropical
characteristics. The research will provide good opportunities for graduate
studies and thesis topics.
