9303959 Kraus PI will study Eocene and Oligocene alluvial paleosols to test the
avulsion model (a new concept of floodplain reconstruction) and to clarify
ancient soil/landscape relationships, which are critical for resolving the
depositional, climatic and structural histories of alluvial basins. Because
soils are an integral part of the alluvial landscape, the avulsion model also
opens new lines of inquiry into the relationship between floodplain
reconstruction and the lateral and vertical distributions of alluvial paleosols.
PI will compare paleosols from two different basinal settings, and also from two
different climatic settings, in order to elucidate the influences of tectonics,
sedimentation rate, and climate on paleosol formation. ***
