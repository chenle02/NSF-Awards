Abstract

A sampling protocol for fungi (Discomycetes) found in Puerto Rico and the
Dominican Republic will be developed. Many of these fungi are inconspicuous and
poorly studied, and it is not clear what survey methods should be used to
discover the most species. The research is exploratory in that it will
investigate methods for surveying fungi and lead to more effective and
innovative research on a very poorly known group of organisms. Ultimately, the
methods will be incorporated into the "Greater Antilles Project," an ongoing
inventory of the fungi of the Greater Antilles. A webpage and database for the
Discomycetes component of the Greater Antilles Project will be developed and
include photographs, locality data, and ecological data. Two students, one from
Puerto Rico and one from the Dominican Republic, will be trained in sampling
methods and taxonomy of Discomycetes.
