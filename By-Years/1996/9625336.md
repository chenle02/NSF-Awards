9625336 Lipsman Professors Lipsman and Rosenberg plan to continue their
respective work in group representation theory, analysis on homogeneous spaces,
and C*-algebraic index theory. Professor Lipsman will study the Fourier analysis
of homogeneous spaces, its relation to invariant differential operators and
various orbital constructs, and the notion of distributional Frobenius
reciprocity. Professor Rosenberg will study manifolds of positive scalar
curvature, index theory on manifold-like spaces, and K-theory and L-theory of
operator algebras. Professors Lipsman and Rosenberg will jointly study Paley-
Wiener Theorems and uncertainty principles on Lie groups. The emphasis of this
project will be on the interplay between analysis (for example, study of the
solutions of partial differential equations) and geometrical structure, broadly
interpreted. The relationship between analysis and geometry is one of the most
important themes in modern mathematics and physics. Professors Lipsman and
Rosenberg will also jointly work to help convey this theme to undergraduates by
enhancing the usual multivariable calculus course with computer projects
emphasizing the underlying geometrical and physical principles. ***
