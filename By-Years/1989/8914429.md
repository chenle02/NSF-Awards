Solvent-induced crystallization is a novel method for separating an inorganic
solute from a concentrated aqueous solution which can provide an attractive low-
energy alternative to conventional crystallization methods. Precipitation is
initiated when an aqueous phase is extracted into the organic phase or the
solvent dissolves in the aqueous phase. The resultant mother liquor, containing
the solvent, water, and, residual solute, is then regenerated by temperature
adjustment into two phase, a water phase for recycle, and a solvent phase. The
latter is further dried by re-equilibrating with a saturated aqueous phase
thereby completing the regeneration cycle. In addition, some solutes separate by
virtue of their differing solubilities into immiscible phases which can be
exploited to drive certain metathesis chemistries when one of the products is
removed by extraction via the crystallization step. This work proposes to
exploit these techniques by obtaining new experimental data for a variety of
representative salt/solvent/water systems and to develop a molecular-
thermodynamic model to correlate the data both new and previously published. The
results of this work will provide the framework for a family of economically
attractive, industrial-scale separation processes.
