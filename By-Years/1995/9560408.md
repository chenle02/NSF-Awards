9560408 Sullivan An alarming increase in fungal infections has focused attention
on the need to identify new compounds with antifungal activity. This Small
Business Phase I research project focuses on developing a rapid method for
screening compounds for antifungal activity using gel microdrops and fluorescent
activated cell sorting. This technique provides a quantitative approach for
evaluating growth and antifungal sensitivity. Conventional drug screening, which
is based on dilution and plating methods, is costly, time consuming and
difficult to automate. An additional benefit of the proposed method is the
ability to recover microorganisms of interest for further analysis, such as gene
sequence determination. This project offers an innovative approach to drug
screening. The market potential for developing rapid automated susceptibility
assays for screening drug candidates against infectious disease targets is
significant. In addition to screening cells on a fee for service basis, the
company is also leasing CellSyTM microdrop makers for encapsulation and
screening in individual research laboratories.
