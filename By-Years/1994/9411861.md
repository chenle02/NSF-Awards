This project develops and evaluates a feedback compiler. Most of the
traditional compilers provide feedback to the user only from the front-end of
the compiler. The feedback compiler provides feedback both from the front-end
and back-end of the compiler. The feedback compiler assists both students and
practicing programmers. The student programmers gain a clear understanding about
the role of a programmer and the role of a compiler. The practicing programmer
benefits from the feedback on the machine specific optimizations performed by
the compiler. The feedback also aids in the debugging of complex programs. The
feedback compiler helps the programmers learn to write efficient programs on a
new computer system.
