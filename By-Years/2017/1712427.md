Stochastic processes such as Brownian motion appear in many fields of science
and applications. They are used to model complex systems in biology, financial
markets, and social networks. In many cases the system has natural constraints
which can be described as an underlying geometric structure. This project is
devoted to a study of such stochastic processes, and how their properties
reflect their geometric or structural environment. Sometimes the space on which
the stochastic processes live is assumed to be not just curved, but infinite-
dimensional, which is a natural setting for many physical or large data
environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes several
directions combining probability, geometry, analysis and representation theory.
One of the directions of research is to study Cameron-Martin type quasi-
invariance in elliptic and subelliptic settings, and its applications to
functional inequalities, smoothness of probability laws for subelliptic and
singular diffusions, and unitary representations of infinite-dimensional groups
such as path groups. Another direction is applying coupling techniques to
hypoelliptic stochastic processes, including gradient estimates and connections
with geometric and analytic techniques for hypoelliptic diffusions. Some of the
proposed research is motivated by physics, especially the quantum field theory
(QFT), as infinite-dimensional spaces such as loop groups and path spaces appear
in the QFT.
