9727014 Werner Most ecological studies are conducted on small spatial scales for
short periods of time, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that we have
little appreciation of the processes that influence ecological communities as we
"scale-up." This project is an attempt to provide an understanding of such
phenomena using amphibians as a model system. The research will continue a long-
term data series on the distribution of 14 species of amphibians across 37 ponds
on the University of Michigan's E.S. George Reserve. The data series is unique
in the time span involved, the number of ponds, and the number of species to be
sampled. Specifically, this study will: 1) continue collection of the
presence/absence data on 37 ponds for the next 5 years, 2) collect quantitative
data on population densities of all amphibian species and their predators in
these ponds, and 3) quantify habitat characteristics of the ponds surveyed. The
data will be carefully archived and made available over the world wide web.
These data will enable the investigators to address questions at the landscape
scale and will be available for long-term assessments of environmental change.
This is particularly important in light of the possible global decline of
amphibians and the widespread teratologies reported in eastern and mid-western
North American anuran populations.
