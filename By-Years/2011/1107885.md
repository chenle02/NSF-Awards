The goal of this collaborative project to reconstruct late Quaternary climate
and glacier change in Arctic Alaska, one of few regions in the Arctic where
mountain glaciers have left physical records of their former extent, making it
valuable for comparing the timing and extent of mountain glacier variability
between the lower latitudes and the Arctic. Several features of the climate and
glacier history of the Brooks Range contrast with those from the North Atlantic
region (which is often taken to represent the entire Northern Hemisphere in
records of climate change) and currently available evidence indicates that the
history of the Brooks Range more closely resembles glacier records from the
southern Hemisphere. The investigators propose to develop records of climate
change from lake sediments and records of glacier fluctuations using proglacial
lake sediments and beryllium-10 dating of glacial features to address questions
centered around four intervals of pronounced global change: (1) Last Glacial
Maximum: Did glaciers retreat and temperatures increase in Arctic Alaska during
the global LGM, as has been simulated by climate models? (2) Deglaciation: To
what extent did climate change in Arctic Alaska coincide with North Atlantic
climate fluctuations during deglaciation? (3) Holocene Glaciation: What was the
extent of glaciers during (a) the Holocene thermal maximum, and (b)
Neoglaciation? (4) Little Ice Age: Was it wetter or drier in the Brooks Range?
The research will take place in suitable valleys (floatplane accessible valley
with extant glaciers) in the northÂ­central Brooks Range. The project has several
educational components, including support four graduate students and several
undergraduate students and visits to the community of Anaktuvuk Pass to deliver
presentations on climate research and the Brooks Range. The proposed research
aims to produce well-dated and quantitative records of glacier and climate
variability in the northernmost glaciated region of the U.S. Documenting the
past behavior of arctic glaciers when subject to extreme climate events during
the late glacial period and warm intervals like the Holocene can provide
valuable insight to help better predict responses to future change.
