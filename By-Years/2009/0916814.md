This workshop will discuss the linkages between science, technology and the
economy. These meetings will engage physical scientists, economists, science
policy experts and other interested groups on these critical issues. Some of the
questions to be addressed include: What have been the distinguishing
characteristics of science and technology influences on economic growth? How can
these lessons be applied to current structural issues facing the U.S. economy
and future economic growth? What are the key science and technology challenges
that must be addressed to achieve energy and environmental sustainability? How
would the policy framework maximize the effectiveness of science and technology
investments in supporting sustainable economic growth? The Summit will complete
its objectives with a series of events, including plenary Summit meetings in
Spring 2010 and 2011 and more focused workshops in the interim.
