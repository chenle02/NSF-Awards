This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfields of spectroscopy
and numerical analysis. During the tenure of this five-year award, Professor
Lodder and his students will utilize near infrared spectrometry, acoustic
resonance spectrometry, and supercomputer-based numerical methods in carrying
out nondestructive analyses across a broad front of disciplines. Included among
these are imaging of subsurface paint layers for the restoration of art objects,
rapid identification of consumer product tampering, development of nonparametric
algorithms for near infrared three-dimensional imaging, and development of
optical multicomponent reagent-free methods of analysis for biological fluids.
%%% The successful attainment of the goals of this project should advance non-
instrumentation intensive methods of analysis and add significantly to our
arsenal of broadly applicable analytical protocols. Additionally, this NSF Young
Investigator Award should significantly assist Professor Lodder in his
establishing a vital and productive program of research and research training.
