IP addresses can be stolen or hijacked. It can happen instantly, and may result
in a loss of Internet connectivity and/or diversion of traffic to a malicious
entity. Until recently, an organization was unable to prove ownership of its
Internet address. A global Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a
framework designed to secure the Internet's routing infrastructure by enabling
Third parties to cryptographically validate claims of ownership of Internet
address blocks and permit such resource holders to declare routing
relationships. However, adoption of RPKI remains at an impasse largely due to
legal factors. This project supports an independent assessment of the proper
allocation of liability for uses of RPKI by related parties, such as network
operators, that can serve as the basis for the parties to discuss resolving the
impasse over the indemnification clauses in the Relaying Party Agreement (RPA).
If those discussions are successful, the research will ultimately promote more
widespread use of RPKI in North America and enable a more secure Internet.

BGP is a live distributed protocol which spans the globe, operating on millions
of routers, interconnecting 60,000 distinct administrative domains, called
Autonomous Systems (AS), and providing routing information to 700,000
destination networks. BGP was originally designed in an era in which security
was not a significant concern, and major BGP route changes were communicated by
operators via email or community mailing lists. However, the Internet has grown
exponentially and the systemic vulnerabilities of the global BGP routing system
have been the subject of concern for network operators for the last decade. RPKI
provides one solution to the problem. One of the largest obstacles to the
adoption of RPKI to secure BGP routing, however, is the fact that most
organizations will not or cannot sign ARIN's RPKI Relying Agreement. By
conducting a legal analysis and enabling a new form of agreement and compromise,
progress forward can be made on this important underlying component of the
Internet infrastructure.
