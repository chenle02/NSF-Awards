The Computer Network Laboratory is providing experimental exposure to
undergraduate students in computer networking in classes involving microcomputer
architecture, systems programming and computer networks. The hands-on laboratory
complements the theoretical concepts of data communications and data/message
transfer in networked environments. The laboratory provides opportunities for
hardware implementation of state-of-the-art protocols, systems and techniques of
data communications. Class projects include implementations of carrier- sense
(Ethernet) and point to point transmission protocols, electronic mail systems
and error handling in networks. This award is being matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
