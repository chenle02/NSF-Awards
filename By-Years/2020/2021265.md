With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry
Division is funding Professor Juan Del Valle from the University of South
Florida. The project is an investigation of a new class of modified peptides
that mimic protein structure. Proteins are the workhorses of the cell, and
interactions between proteins govern many biological processes. The ability to
modify these interactions with designed molecules (peptides) has been a long-
standing challenge in chemistry. Professor Del Valle's work focuses on the
mimicry of beta-sheets. This is a protein structure that is notoriously
difficult to study due its tendency to clump together (aggregate). This research
provides a toolkit for generating stable and aggregation-resistant mimics of the
protein beta sheets. The project is also providing graduate and undergraduate
students with rigorous training in laboratory research and scientific
communication. The project is linked to the Tampa Preparatory School in an
outreach effort providing internships to high school students.

This research project integrates molecular design, chemical synthesis,
conformational analysis, and biological studies to fully characterize the
properties of backbone-aminated peptides. The Del Valle laboratory recently
established methods to prepare C-alpha-substituted N-amino peptides (NAPs)
through conventional solid-phase peptide synthesis. This project develops
optimal synthetic protocols toward cyclic, macrocyclic, and polyaminated NAP
variants for bi-facial beta-strand mimicry. The motifs are evaluated in model
systems for their specific effects on beta-sheet stability and self-association
using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, circular
dichroism, and X-ray diffraction. The discrete impact of NAP constraints on
protease/serum stability and passive membrane permeability relative to control
peptides are being examined.
