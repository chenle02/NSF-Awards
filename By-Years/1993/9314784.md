9314784 Tressler This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in materials science between Richard E. Tressler of Pennsylvania State
University and Roger Naslain of the University of Bordeaux. The objectives of
the research are to develop superior high-temperature fibers (silicon carbide
matrix composites) using polymer processing and to relate the chemical
composition/thermal stability to microstructure and creep properties of these
fibers. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
microstructure and creep properties. This complemented by recent French work in
fiber processing. Silicon carbide matrix composites are leading candidates for
aerospace and industrial process machinery applications. However, current
candidates are limited in size and in thermal resistance. This project will
advance understanding of their structure and properties and lead to the
development of high temperature fibers that are not currently available. ***
