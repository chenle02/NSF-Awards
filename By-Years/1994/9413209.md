9413209 Lipscultz, F. Improvements in the field-work infrastructure of the
Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Inc (BBSR) will be achieved through the
construction of a new facility. BBSR has sponsored marine research from the
special perspective of a mid-Atlantic Island since 1903. The institution has
grown dramatically in the past decade, during which it has have maintained its
commitment to visiting scientists in both marine biology and oceanography. BBSR
has expanded that commitment by creating a new molecular biology facility. This
growth has led to overcrowding and inefficiencies in support of all types of
field activities. This project will support the upgrade some of the basic
station infrastructure that directly supports the entire suite of marine
activities. BBSR will build a new 30' by 95' scientific support and maintenance
building dedicated to the storage of scientific equipment behind the present
workshop and oceanographic storage facility (Pew Building).
