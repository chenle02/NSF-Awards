9317895 Dauwe This award is for the renewal of an RUI grant covering two years
to allow Professor Dauwe and two undergraduate assistants to participate in the
analysis of the data from Fermilab experiment E672. The experiment is a fixed
target investigation of the production mechanisms of charm by pions and protons
from H, Be and Cu targets. The data taking phase was completed in 1991 and no
further running is contemplated. In addition to the physics goals, the
experience in high speed computing and the association with the multi-university
team at Fermilab will enhance the education of the students in a way not
normally available at an undergraduate institution. *** v s t , ; ' , $ $ ( F /
