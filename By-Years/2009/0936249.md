This project supports a program to develop computer materials for math education
in conjunction with the Math Emporium at Virginia Tech. The Math Emporium is the
centerpiece of Virginia Tech's transformation of its introductory math
curriculum through the use of technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
component of the project is an evaluation of a task-oriented course that is
offered in conjunction with the Math Emporium. The course has enrolled nearly
9,000 students over the past five years; roughly half these students were
enrolled in traditional sections of the course, while the other half were
enrolled in computer-tested sections using task-oriented courseware. The
evaluation will study compare the performance of the two groups in later
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second component of the project is for the
development of components for a next-generation test system for which the
content is not tied to the particular test engine or distribution system. These
two projects are a vital step toward providing a more productive learning
environment that fully leverages the advantages of available technology.
