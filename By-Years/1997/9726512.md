9726512 Moore Recent advances in molecular biology made it possible to study in
much greater detail not only the history of biological diversity but the
genetic, ecological and geological processes that produce biological diversity.
The number of species of birds is higher in South America than in other regions
of the world. This research by William Moore focuses on two groups of
woodpeckers that serve as paradigms for studying the origin of avian diversity
in South America. The groups are the genus Colaptes (flickers) and the closely
related genus Piculus. Preliminary evidence suggests that the ancetors of these
groups entered South America from North America when the Isthmus of Panama was
formed approximately 3 - 3.5 million years ago. The subsequent proliferation of
species appears to be closely associated with the formation of the Andes
Mountains approximately 2 million years ago. Speciation was associated with
dramatic changes in the ecological adaptations of new species; for example,
forest dwelling species giving rise to grassland species. Dr. Moore will
reconstruct a phylogeny for these groups based on DNA sequences from
mitochondrial genes and introns from nuclear genes. These sequences mutate at
rates that are useful for reconstructing the genetic history of groups of
organisms that are up to 20 million years old. The phylogeny will be used as a
framework upon which a better understanding of how and when species formed in
these groups and obtained their morphological, ecological and behavioral
characteristics.
