The Triennial Symposium on Transportation Analysis (TRISTAN) symposium is
designed to bring together leading researchers from around the world working on
mathematical and algorithmic aspects of transportation systems analysis, with an
emphasis on logistics, vehicle routing, common carrier operations, and traffic
operations. In addition to promoting outstanding research, TRISTAN brings
together a group of researchers with a relatively common focus, thereby
encouraging the exchange of ideas and collaborative research efforts. TRISTAN is
planned as a triennial symposium, with the first meeting scheduled to be held at
the University of Montreal in June, 1991.
