The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division
has provided support to Professor Zhang to use a novel computational method to
conduct two studies in the general area of chemical dynamics: (1) a study of
dissociative adsorption and associative desorption of hydrogen on transition
metals, and (2) an investigation of the rotational state distribution in the
vibrational predissociation of the HF dimer. The work involves massive
computations made possible by a combination of recent advances in computer
technology and a new time-dependent quantum wave packet method that has been
developed by Professor Zhang. %%% The breaking apart of molecules as they are
adsorbed on a surface or their recombination as they leave the surface are two
of the fundamental steps in catalytic processes. In this research, Professor
Zhang applies a new technique he has developed to make possible a more realistic
study of such individual chemical steps than has previously been possible. The
present work is limited to hydrogen as the adsorbing gas, but it will serve as a
test of the new theoretical advances which may be applied to larger systems
later as computer technology advances. The same theoretical approach is also
being used and further tested in a study of the energy distribution in the
products when the hydrogen bond in the HF dimer is broken.
