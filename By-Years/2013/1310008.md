****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This award aims to explicate the process by
which electrons that are initially localized on the f-orbitals of rare earth
based heavy fermion compounds can be induced to join the itinerant states
comprising the Fermi surface(FS), and the critical fluctuations of the
electronic structure that accompany this electronic de-confinement transition.
The role of frustration in suppressing magnetic order in heavy fermions that
form on the geometrically frustrated Shastry-Sutherland lattice will be
investigated. Two distinct ground states are envisaged: a spin liquid where the
conduction electrons are decoupled from the fluctuating moments, whose electrons
are consequently excluded from the FS, and a Fermi liquid, where a strong Kondo
effect delocalizes the f-electrons, which are now incorporated in an expanded
FS. These two non-ordered states are separated at T=0 by a purely electronic
transition, driven by fluctuations between the large and small FS states. The
synthesis of new materials to support both the measurement program of the PI and
those of her collaborators is a central theme of this project. Participating
undergraduate and graduate students will gain practical and portable experience
in a variety of different synthesis and experimental techniques. This research
makes extensive use of national research facilities, including neutron
scattering centers at NIST and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;While all
materials are disordered at high temperatures, with no discernible patterns or
correlations in their configurations, the onset of an ordered phase such as
superconductivity or magnetism is overwhelmingly favored as the temperature is
reduced. This project seeks to explicate the properties of systems with the most
extreme form of order, which occurs exactly at a temperature of absolute zero.
The quantum mechanical nature of such a phase transition is paramount, with the
result that normal behaviors like the conduction of heat or electricity are
drastically modified- even at nonzero temperatures. Here, geometrical
constraints associate with a lattice of magnetic moments will be used to realize
such T=0 transitions, and their properties will be studied using neutron
scattering experiments carried out at NIST and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
