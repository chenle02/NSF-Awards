The investigators will combine magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling with test
particle simulations to study adiabatic transport and energization in the
radiation belts. The MHD model provides the global configuration of the
magnetosphere in response to solar wind forcing, while the test particle code
tracks the motion of energetic particles within the ambient electric and
magnetic fields. The computer simulations will be used to examine the stormtime
evolution of energetic particles in the near-Earth plasma sheet and radiation
belts, and, through comparison with observations, the adiabatic transport and
acceleration of a plasma sheet source population. The models will be run for
actual geomagnetic storm events and the results compared with available
observations. The investigators will study plasma sheet particle acceleration
and trapping to quantify the importance of plasma sheet particles in radiation
belt dynamics. Energetic particles in the radiation belts represent a threat to
satellites, so it is important to understand the various factors that influence
radiation flux levels in near-Earth space.
