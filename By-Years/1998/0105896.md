Sandwell &lt;br/&gt;0105896 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic aperture radar
interferometry (InSAR) is a relatively new tool for monitoring deformations of
the surface of the earth associated with earthquakes, volcanoes, and groundwater
subsidence. Sparse networks of GPS receivers provide accurate ground motions
over a limited number of points while the space-based InSAR technique provides
higher spatial resolution (~100 m) and global access but poor temporal
resolution. Suitable civilian SAR satellites have been flown by the European
Space Agency (ERS-1 and ERS-2) as well as by the Japanese Space agency (JERS-1
and ALOS - 2003 launch date). These data are largely unexplored and are of
enormous value for assessing the earthquake risk in Southern California. The
investigators will use these data to monitor co-seismic, post-seismic, and
inter-seismic crustal deformation. Published models of the earthquake cycle
predict that much of the diagnostic crustal strain occurs within 10 km of the
fault zone and thus it will not be observed by the relatively coarse
distribution of GPS monuments (&gt; 10 km spacing). The proposed tasks include:
&lt;br/&gt;development of high-resolution topographic models for accurate
removal of topographic phase from change interferograms; &lt;br/&gt;estimation
of the depth distribution of slip on the 1999 Hector Mine rupture;
&lt;br/&gt;examination of post-seismic slip at the Landers and Hector Mine
ruptures in relation to the earthquake cycle models; &lt;br/&gt;monitoring creep
rate and creep depth along major faults in Southern California;
&lt;br/&gt;development of a boundary-element model of the Southern California
fault system; &lt;br/&gt;and preparation for L-band SAR data to be collected by
the Japanese ALOS mission. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
