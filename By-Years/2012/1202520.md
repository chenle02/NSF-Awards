Now in its twentieth year (2011-2012), the NYC LSAMP involves 17 of CUNY?s 18
academic campuses, including the Graduate School and University Center. The
Collaborative Infrastructure at CUNY allows for adaption and adoption of best
practices in educational pedagogy, and cutting edge STEM research. Alliance
activity in Phases I, and II (1992-2002) centered on adoption and adaption of
the Collaborative Learning Approaches, Workshop and Peer Led Team Learning
Models, and the TINTO models to increase the number of students who would
successfully complete the STEM gatekeeper courses. Phases III and IV led to
institutionalization of Phase I and II practices, and an increased focus on the
Research and Training of LSAMP Scholars and access to Graduate
Education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Activities 2012-2017 will build on the
institutionalized activities across CUNY to increase the annual BA/BS degree
production in STEM to 1000 degrees per year from 700 per annum. Continued focus
at the Community College will result in 1) early intervention, 2) greater
transfer rates, and 3) degree completion/retention in the STEM disciplines.
LSAMP Research and Training activities will 1) expand the diversity and
multidisciplinary nature of the 21st Century STEM training, 2) increase the
number of opportunities to LSAMP participants, and 3) offer early introduction
to research resulting in an increased number of students attracted to the STEM
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following are program activities for NYC
