Gopal Prasad will work on several problems of arithmetic and geometric interest.
In a recent work with Brian Conrad and Ofer Gabber, he has classified pseudo-
reductive group over arbitrary fields of odd characteristics, and also over
arithmetically important local and global function fields of characteristic 2.
Prasad proposes to work with Conrad to determine the classification of pseudo-
reductive groups over an arbitrary field of characteristic 2. Study and
classification of pseudo-reductive groups is very important for the theory of
linear algebraic groups. Together with Andrei Rapinchuk, Prasad has introduced
the notation of "weak commensurability of arithmetic groups". They have
developed techniques to study the relationship between weakly commensurable
arithmetic group which have yielded useful and surprisingly powerful results.
These results have helped them to decide when two locally symmetric space for
which the sets of length of closed geodesics are equal must be "commensurable"
to each other, and also solve the classical problem "can one hear the shape of a
drum?" in geometry. Prasad and Rapinchuk will continue to further explore their
techniques and apply them for solution of other problems in the area.

Algebraic geometry, differential geometry and representation theory are
important and active areas of modern mathematics. Prasad has made fundamental
contributions to these areas in the past. His future work, and the new
techniques he is likely to develop, should be useful for researchers in these
areas. Prasad will devote considerable time in the next three years to write a
graduate level text-book giving a rapid, but comprehensive, introduction to the
theory of Lie groups, to write a book on the Bruhat-Tits theory for the users,
and to write a reference-book on the celebrated "congruence subgroup problem".
These books will help in education of graduate students and young researchers in
mathematics. At present, there are no text-books on the Bruhat-Tits theory and
on the congruence subgroup problem.
