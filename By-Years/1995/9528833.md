This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
program addresses the synthesis and reactivity of organometallic compounds of
alkaline-earth elements (calcium, strontium, and barium) with metal-carbon
bonds. Bulky cyclopentadienyl groups are used to prevent decomposition of these
highly reactive compounds, which allows for the study of their structures and
reactivities with gaseous oxides and sulfides, including carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, and carbon disulfide. These studies, in a relatively neglected area,
will provide a fundamental understanding of the basis for the structures and
reactivities of these compounds as well as a foundation for the development of
applications in organic, polymer, and materials chemistry. Compounds of
alkaline-earth elements (calcium, strontium, and barium) with metal-carbon bonds
will be synthesized. The organic substituents are designed to prevent the
decomposition of these otherwise highly reactive species, thus providing the
opportunity to study their reactivity toward oxygen and oxygen-containing
molecules such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and carbon disulfide. These
compounds have potential for use in organic, polymer, and materials chemistry
