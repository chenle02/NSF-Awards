The object of a previous collaborative grant with Scripps Institution was to
determine the production rates of 10Be and 26Al made by cosmic-ray interactions
with quartz. We now plan to make use of this in situ production of cosmogenic
radionuclides to study rates of erosion, extents of glaciation, rates of uplift,
and in general, to determine histories of surface morphology. In addition to
continuing measurements of 10Be and 26Al produced in quartz, we plan to study
the 14C produced in the same samples-thus providing better control over the most
recent exposure history (last -20 ka). We also plan to test the feasibility of
measuring 41Ca in feldspars and soil samples. 41Ca's lifetime of -100 ka makes
it appear ideal for studying surface development subsequent to the most recent
period of glaciation, but complications arising from the fact that it is made
from neutron capture, may make it too sensitive to water content and matrix
effects to be useful as a chronometer. Finally, we would like to further improve
our measurements capabilities for 26Al and 10Be, specifically by improving
precision and by introducing automation into our measurement procedures.
