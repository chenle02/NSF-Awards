Because of high population of minority students in the southwestern United
States and the low percentage that pursue higher education, it is important that
educational tools be developed to encourage these students to pursue and succeed
in engineering and science fields. In addition to the minority students, many
students in this region graduate from small, rural schools with poor training
for college. The combination of these students (non-conventional students) have
different problems from traditional students. A solution to this problem is the
proposed model environment, which involves both students at Texas Tech
University and area Community Colleges in meaningful research. This research
interaction and mentoring by faculty members will provide an immediate feedback
for the value of math and science, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of
higher education. The faculty mentoring to students have established records of
research, such as the Texas Tech Granular Flow Model and the Texas Tech Wind
Erosion Model. A goal for each student researcher is a published technical
paper. This work will develop pride and self- worth for the student. The Student
would be exposed to engineering research principles in the areas of soil and
water conservation, processing of agricultural, food and industrial products,
and development of renewable resources.
