Research under this grant furthers our understanding of curves, surfaces,
3-dimensional spaces, and 4-dimensional spaces, by focusing on the interplay
between these different dimensions. Relationships between different dimensions
arise in two ways. One way to study complicated 3- or 4-dimensional spaces is to
decompose them into simpler pieces; the decomposition happens along lower-
dimensional spaces, like surfaces. These are complicated versions of the
principle that you cut a 3-dimensional watermelon by using a flat, 2-dimensional
knife. Trying to do this leads one to ask in which ways low-dimensional spaces
can sit inside high-dimensional ones. For example, 1-dimensional shoelaces can
be knotted or unknotted; it was recently discovered that a 3-dimensional
watermelon sitting in 4-space can also be knotted. This involves developing
aspects of differential equations and abstract algebra. One long-term goal of
the research project is to have a computer program that can compute certain
subtle invariants of 4-dimensional spaces coming from counting solutions to
differential equations from theoretical physics, the Seiberg-Witten equations.
The grant will also support training graduate students in these topics, writing
a book introducing some of them to graduate students and advanced
undergraduates, outreach activities to share the excitement of geometry and
topology with K-12 students, and a website to help other researchers use non-
photorealistic raytracing to draw useful figures in their own papers.

The research involves a number of specific projects. One is to further develop
an extension of bordered Heegaard Floer homology to the "minus" version of
Heegaard Floer homology. Bordered Heegaard Floer homology is a version of
Heegaard Floer homology for 3-manifolds with boundary; many aspects of the
theory are currently only defined for the simpler "hat" version of Heegaard
Floer homology. Another is to develop new invariants of embedded non-orientable
surfaces in 4-space, using variants on Khovanov homology. A third is to apply
Floer homotopy theory to questions in equivariant 3-dimensional topology, and a
fourth is to study relationships between Floer homology and the mapping class
groups of surfaces.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
