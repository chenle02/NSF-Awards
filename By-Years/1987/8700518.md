Electron microscopy has allowed biologists to image ultrastructural elements of
the cell. This standard technology is limited by the requirement that sample
thickness be very fine. Since many of the cellular elements are asymmetric,
these slice images provide only limited information. Electron Microscope
Tomography (EMT) will allow the 3-dimensional reconstruction of electron
microscope images of cellular ultrastructure objects. The sample thickness will
extend up to 1 micrometer and resolution will be on the order of 50 Angstroms.
Computer processing of image information similar to that employed in CAT scan
technology will be used to reconstruct tilted projections. The 3-D
reconstructions should provide greater understanding of the structure, and
therefore the function, of cellular ultrastructural objects.
