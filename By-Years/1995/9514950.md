9514950 Reucroft This grant provides support for research in elementary particle
physics by 5 Northeastern University faculty, 3 postdoctoral associates and 4
graduate students. They engage in 3 activities: 1) study of collisions of
antiprotons with protons at 2 TeV in the Tevatron collider at Fermilab, with the
DO collaboration, and participation in the current DO detector upgrade; 2) study
of electron- positron collisions at the LEP collider at CERN in Geneva,
Switzerland, with the L3 collaboration, and 3) instrumentation R&D directed
toward design of the CMS detector to be operated in the next decade at the LHC
collider at CERN. ***
