The 2004 Gordon Conference on Catalysis will be held on June 27-July 2, 2004 at
Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire. The conference will focus on
several areas that are key to the fundamental understanding of catalytic
chemistry and engineering. The development of more efficient selective oxidation
catalysts and the role of catalysis in the production and utilization of
hydrogen as a source of transportable energy will also be emphasized. Leading
researchers will discuss: advances in molecular level characterization of
catalysts under in situ conditions, quantitative descriptions of reaction
pathways, catalytic selectivity (especially for oxidation), advanced fuel cell
catalysis, and model or novel catalytic processes. The themes and speakers are
of interest to both academic and industrial communities. Current and future
trends in heterogeneous catalysis will be the general theme. This grant will
provide partial support for speakers, graduate students, post-doctoral students,
and younger faculty. This support will permit a more comprehensive discussion
and dissemination of the material.
