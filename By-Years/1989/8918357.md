The Chemistry Division Office of Special Projects is renewing support for the
"Undergraduate Research Program in Chemistry (URPC)" at Atlanta University
Center, Inc. The project will be conducted by Professor John H. Hall, Jr. and
two other faculty members of the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department.
Eight undergraduate students will actively participate in research projects
during the period 1990-92. The research will extend throughout the academic year
and during an eight week summer period each year. The research projects are in
atmospheric chemistry and include molecular orbital modeling of important
gaseous species and trapping and identification of free-radicals and transient
molecules by matrix-isolation- spectroscopic techniques. Minority students from
Atlanta Center and other regional institutions will participate.
