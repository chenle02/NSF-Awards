Heating of the ionosphere with intense radio waves has been pursued vigorously
over the last thirty years, primarily in the United States and the Soviet Union.
New, large facilities have been constructed in the United States and in Europe.
During the 1970's, the branches of plasma physics known as weak turbulence
theory and the theory of parametric instabilities were used to explain some of
the unusual and unexpected results of the heating efforts. The PIs' recent work,
inspired by Petviashvili and followed by that of DuBois, Rose, and others, has
demonstrated the importance of modulational instability followed by Langmuir
soliton formation and collapse. The PI proposes to continue his study of these
effects using analytical and numerical techniques.
