An award is made to St. Mary's University in San Antonio TX to purchase a
fluorometer for the use of at least eight faculty members in the School of
Science, Engineering, and Technology. Fluorometry, the measurement of light
emission from fluorescent chemicals, is versatile and very sensitive, so it can
be used in multiple fields. The eight faculty members will use the instrument in
research that varies from chemosensor design, to detection of genetic
transcription control elements, to the design of quantum dots for use in LEDs,
to water-quality studies in natural aquifers. It will also be used to describe
protein-protein interactions and protein dynamics in studies of enzymes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The faculty members using the fluorometer in their
research engage exclusively with undergraduate students in their projects, and
since St. Mary's University is a Hispanic Serving Institution, the instrument
will be used by undergraduate students from an underserved minority. The
exposure of students to this high-quality instrument will expand their
experimental, verbal and analytical skills, and enable them to perform
meaningful research. Students will make discoveries that will be disseminated
through publications in reviewed journals, and they will attend research
conferences to discuss their findings. Since the projects to be performed are so
varied, the instrument will impact students in various majors, from biophysics
to organic chemistry to cell biology. The water quality studies have the
potential to benefit users of the Edwards Aquifer, which serves San Antonio and
surrounding communities. The instrument will be shared with students at
neighboring universities.
