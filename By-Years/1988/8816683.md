This award provides one-half of the funding required to acquire the necessary
equipment and to assemble a high-pressure- temperature system for the
experimental study of rock metamorphism under controlled laboratory conditions.
The laboratory will be operated in the Department of Geosciences at the
Pennsylvania State University. The University is committed to providing the
remaining half of the funds necessary for the project. The equipment will be
utilized in research projects investigating the rates of chemical reactions in
rock systems undergoing metamorphism and the solubilities of minerals under
conditions of high water pressure.
