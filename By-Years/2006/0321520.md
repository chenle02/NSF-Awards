This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will complete
the development of biosensors for detection of heavy metals and acyl-CoA using
sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. The presence of the target molecule will
be reported by the biosensor as a change in fluorescence signal that could be
read using a hand-held battery-operated reader. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial application of this project is in the area of biosensors for markets
that include basic and applied research, clinical diagnosis, environmental
monitoring, drug screening, and process control in manufacturing operations.
