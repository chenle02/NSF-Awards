This project involves problems in noncommutative geometry. The idea of
noncommutative geometry is to study geometry using noncommutative algebras,
which are mathematical objects that have addition and multiplication, however
the multiplication is not commutative: xy does not have to equal yx. The purpose
of the project, which is centered around higher structures and noncommutative
geometry, is to investigate mathematical problems in these fields motivated by
physics. More specifically, it is motivated by a combination of ideas from
quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, string theory, deformation
quantization, differential geometry, noncommutative geometry, and operator
algebras. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed project promotes further
interaction between these fields. The PI continues to disseminate his research
by speaking at conferences and seminars and organizing workshops. Some parts of
the project are joint work with collaborators from China and Europe. The project
thus provides an excellent opportunity for the PI to work with young scientists
and to exchange ideas with colleagues from other countries and to promote
collaborations.

The idea of noncommutative geometry is to study geometry via algebras of
functions on noncommutative manifolds. On such a noncommutative manifold, the
relevant objects are no longer points in a space, but rather a noncommutative
associative algebra, or a differential graded commutative algebra. Many
noncommutative spaces can be obtained from groupoids. The PI proposes to
continue the study of deformation quantization, differential graded manifolds
(DG manifolds), Chern--Connes character, and delocalized twisted equivariant
cohomology. The problems include exploring the homotopy Lie algebra structures
appearing in connection with a generalization of the Atiyah class to various
contexts, and developing a de Rham model of equivariant twisted K-theory using
the theory of Lie groupoids and differentiable stacks.
