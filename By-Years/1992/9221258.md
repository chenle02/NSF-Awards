New laboratory methods developed by the Principal Investigator to characterize
the components of surface charge will be applied to benchmark soils from the
tropical Americas in order to test their sensitivity and ability to provide
reproducible variable-charge measurements that are accurate for highly
heterogeneous, structurally fragile mineral mixtures. The project objectives
are: (1) to apply a cesium-adsorption method to measure structural surface
charge, and (2) to apply new titration and ion adsorption methods to measure
variable-charge behavior in highly weathered soils. If these applications prove
to be successful, they will provide the basis for a systematic approach to
chemical modeling of tropical soils related to their role in continental-scale
weathering and the global-scale cycling of chemical elements.
