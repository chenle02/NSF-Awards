This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh in the purchase of a
high resolution Mass Spectrometer. Six faculty members whose research is
dependent upon high resolution mass spectroscopy will greatly benefit from the
acquisition of this instrument. Research projects to be carried out with this
instrument include: (1) The mechanism of action of vitamin K, (2) New synthetic
methods for an industrial environment, (3) Total organic synthesis of natural
products, (4) Gas phase ion chemistry, (5) Molecular recognition: Novel
artifical receptors for complexation and catalysis and (6) Research on Molecular
recognition. %%% A high resolution mass spectrometer is an instrument used to
measure the precise molecular weight of a molecular ion. This information is an
important piece of data used to help determine the atomic composition and,
sometimes, the molecular geometry of a molecule. It is one of the essential
tools needed to learn the detailed structure of newly synthesized molecules.
