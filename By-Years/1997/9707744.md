9707744 GILLESPIE Spiders are among the most diverse groups of organisms on
earth, and are exceptional for their web-spinning abilities and diverse feeding
strategies. Although a number of studies have examined relationships among
spiders, one of the seven largest families, the comb-footed spiders
(Theridiidae), remains an assemblage of poorly defined species. Besides being a
large and abundant group, the Theridiidae exhibit a wide spectrum of unique
ecological and behavioral attributes that make them unusually interesting. For
example, some groups have developed the behavior of feeding exclusively on the
webs of other species; others have elaborate web architectures; still others are
social, living in large communal webs and sharing in the activities of capturing
insects and tending the eggs and young. The family includes some well known and
striking forms, such as the Hawaiian happy face spider and the notorious Black
Widow. In this research, Rosemary Gillespie and Jonathan Coddington will make
use of several different types of morphological and molecular characters to
determine the phylogenetic relationships among comb-footed spiders, a previously
difficult problem made more tractable by advances in phylogenetic analysis. The
analysis will help the investigators determine how, and how often, the many
shapes, sizes, colors, behaviors, ecological associations and venoms have
appeared during the history of this spider family on Earth.
