The nature of deformation hear the base of accretionary wedges likely involves
extensive transport by fluids of silica and other components, brittle crack-seal
veining and rock fabrics such as cleavage. However, estimates of the magnitude
of fluid interactions and the scale over which they are operative is highly
controversial. This project will examine the distribution, orientation,
geometry, texture and geochemistry of quartz veins in a well-exposed and well-
understood forearc complex on Afognak Island, Alaska. Coupled with measurements
of volume change in wall rocks and oxygen isotopic analyses the plumbing system
in rocks buried to depths of 8-12km will be reconstructed and used to infer the
mechanisms of silica transport and the extent and nature of fluid flow near the
base on an accretionary wedge. Results will be relevant to the study of
accretionary, wedge development and to the study of the origins of rock
deformation fabrics.
