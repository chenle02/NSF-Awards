Under this award, the PIs will continue an experimental study investigating the
physical properties of partially molten peridotite under drained and undrained
conditions. The goals of this work are to constrain the relation between
deformation and melt migration in partially molten mafic rocks and to understand
the physical mechanisms of the migration of melt in those rocks under varying
conditions of temperature, stress, lithostatic pressure, magma pressure, strain
rate and time. Initial experiments by the PIs indicate that the solid matrix and
melt form a system whose mechanical properties strongly depend on the drainage
conditions and external loading, and a rich variety of mechanical behavior is
possible. A combination of experimental techniques will be used, including
extraction of melt during isostatic loading, conventional triaxial mechanical
experiments under drained and undrained conditions, and permeability
measurements using the pulse decay and oscillating pore pressure techniques. The
experiments will have two solid phases: pyroxene and olivine and melt contents
down to <5%. Observations will be made with optical microscopes, SEM, and TEM.
The study entailes graduate student involvement, and the results will be widely
applicable in many sub fields of geoscience.
