The University of Texas at Austin requests funds from the Academic Research
Infrastructure Program of the National Science Foundation for the purchase of a
500 MHz triple resonance NMR spectrometer. The proposed instrument will be
dedicated to biophysical research with state-of-the-art NMR data collection
requirements, and will greatly enhance the research of eight major users. The
proposed instrument will significantly enhance the following areas of research:
1. RNA and protein structure 2. Effects of antibiotics that covalently modify
DNA, and DNA-drug interactions 3. Structure of biologically active
polysaccharides and peptides 4. Analysis of metabolic pathways 5. Structure of
myofibrillar proteins 6. Structure of RNA and DNA cleavage agents 7. Enzymatic
degradation of hydrocarbons 8. Studies of genetically engineered peptides
