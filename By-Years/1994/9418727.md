9418727 Chen The compositional effect and the simultaneous pressure and
temperature effects on the elasticity of pyrope-almandine-grossular solution
series will be studied experimentally, at pressures to ~500 Mpa and temperatures
to 1000K, i.e. to above the Debye temperature of garnet. Garnets are considered
to be among the most abundant minerals in the upper mantle. Measurements will
made by using the Coherent Gigahertz Ultrasonic (CGU) interferometer recently
developed. Both P- and S-wave travel times will be measured. ***
