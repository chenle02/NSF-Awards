PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project is exploring the design and manufacturing of
guitars to better engage students that otherwise may not be connected to STEM
oriented subject matter. It uses the context of building a guitar to explore
difficult theoretical concepts (e.g., relationship of the time/frequency
domains) and advance STEM learning by: 1) quantifying the student learning gains
that result from the implementation of the new STEM guitar curriculum, 2)
improving and expanding a variety of faculty professional development
activities, and 3) focusing additional curriculum development activities to
incorporate national standards and address gaps in skills that are identified by
industry participants. Comprehensive ten-day faculty professional development
institutes are being conducted to engage faculty teams in the discovery of new
STEM learning tools/techniques and build a diverse community of regional
partners.

BROADER SIGNIFICANCE More than 19,000 students are being impacted during the
course of the three-year effort, as a result of faculty members adopting or
adapting the curriculum developed through the project. Working with their peers
and professional development institute facilitators, educators are studying the
STEM principles associated with building guitars and developing applied STEM
learning activities that are aligned with core curriculum national standards.
Faculty are being recruited from underserved populations and are preparing a
website to enable high school students to experiment with the physics,
mathematics, and engineering design/manufacturing concepts that are associated
with the project. The project's website offers educators widespread access to an
exciting STEM learning community, allowing them to keep in contact with other
professionals who are engaged in the curriculum implementation and professional
development activities.
