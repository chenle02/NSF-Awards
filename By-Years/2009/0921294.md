The ability of cells stick to one another using proteins called cadherins is
crucial in all animals. When cadherin-based stickiness fails, birth defects can
occur, and such loss of stickiness occurs in cancer cells. In the future, our
ability to make "designer tissues" via tissue engineering will require us to
manipulate cadherin-based cell stickiness. This project will study how a protein
implicated in muscular dystrophy, tropomodulin, acts to make cadherin-based
stickiness stronger. The nematode worm, C. elegans, will be used as a test bed
for understanding how tropomodulin regulates cell stickiness through cadherins,
using genetics, powerful microscopes to watch the movements of proteins in
living embryos, and biochemistry. The result of these studies should be a better
understanding of how cadherin-based stickiness is regulated, and how a protein
found from worms to humans regulates this stickiness. Through this project
graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the process of science,
new educational materials will be produced that will be freely available to
anyone in the world through a project called WormClassroom, and elementary-age
students will be exposed to exciting developments in biology through a long-term
community outreach program.
