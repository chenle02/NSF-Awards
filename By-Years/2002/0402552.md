Responding to critical shortage areas documented by the Virginia Department of
Education, the overall goal of the Pathways to Teaching project hosted by the
Center for Teacher Education at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC)
in Richmond, Virginia, is to increase the number, quality, and diversity of
teachers in the College's service area, especially in mathematics, science, and
technology. The project is providing pathways to teaching careers for students,
particularly prospective technology teachers, who will be recruited from among
middle and high school students, including those from technical centers, and
JSRCC students in AS math and science and AAS programs. JSRCC graduates will
seek baccalaureate degrees and teacher licensure at three nearby universities.
Project activities include the development of the JSRCC Career Education
(Teaching) course as a dual enrollment course and for online delivery targeting
high school students, particularly those in technical centers. During two
summers, Middle School Summer Camps will recruit students into the teaching
field and provide opportunities for JSRCC pre-service teachers to be immersed in
teaching. A Math/Science Practicum will engage JSRCC students in seminars and in
math and science tutoring in Richmond City Public Schools. Two manuals and three
videos will provide students with essential education information. AAS students
at JSRCC will be encouraged to become teachers in their technology area and to
transfer and seek teacher licensure. Other features of the project include on-
site advising in the high schools, campus visits and mentorships, all designed
to provide a smooth transition and articulation for high school students coming
to the JSRCC. Six new courses will be developed for pre-service teachers.
Scholarships will be offered to high school students and to JSRCC graduates.
Collaborations between JSRCC and three area universities will enable the
development of pathways for AAS graduates to receive the baccalaureate degree.
