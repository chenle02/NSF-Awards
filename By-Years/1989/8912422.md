A combined theoretical/numerical modeling and experimental research program on
two-phase flow is to be carried out. The modeling portion is based on an
extension and generalization of single-phase non-isotropic turbulence closures.
Turbulence and phase distribution measurements will be made with a 3D Laser
Doppler Anemometer system. The dispersed phase will consist of particles with
neutral, negative, and positive buoyancy, and the flow configuration will be
with gravity both aligned as well as perpendicular to the flow. Thus, the study
is relevant to such applications as vertical bubbly flow as well as horizontal
slurry flows.
