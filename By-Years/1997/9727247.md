9727247 Gershenson This research seeks to identify and incorporate retirement
modularization into mechanical design. The research uses an expanded definition
of modularity, which incorporates the potential of modularity based not only on
disassembly but also on grouped retirement methods. This definition, coupled
with several important design tools will lead to an implementable design
methodology for incorporating retirement modules into products. Modularization,
due to the functional independence it creates, has been called the goal of good
design. Industry has made an effort to modularize products to easily meet the
needs of end users and marketing. This effort has led to the creation of product
families. Occasionally, modules are created with some aspects of product
retirement in mind. However, this modularization is done without fully
understanding the financial implications of the design changes. In addition,
modularization is done without a structured methodology making the process
difficult to repeat if it is successful and difficult to avoid if it is
unsuccessful. This research will develop a methodology of creating products that
are modular with respect to product retirement. Doing so will decrease
environmental loads, decrease retirement processing costs, and decrease product
development time. This research will yield a practical, applicable methodology
for identifying product retirement modules as well as combining functional and
retirement modularity into a design methodology and modularity measure. The
adoption of modular product design in product development practices will have a
tremendous impact on product value, environmental loads, and life-cycle cost.
Modular products will greatly reduce development time and help us move towards
global sustainability. The design theory research community will be impacted by
the introduction of a new direction in the effort to better incorporate life-
cycle values into product design. This r esearch will progress in practical
steps punctuated by validation studies. The result of the research in this
proposal will be a validated design methodology and measure. The work will also
be disseminated in publications at each critical juncture and ultimately
incorporated in a computer tool. The work will be accomplished through the work
of the faculty and graduate students of the University of Alabama Life-cycle
Engineering Laboratory with collaboration from undergraduate researchers and
students. ***
