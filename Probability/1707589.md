Randomness plays a role in many aspects of science and human activities. A
familiar yet complex and mathematically interesting example is card shuffling,
which serves as a model for many important phenomena involving the idea of
mixing. More generally, randomness is used in modeling a wide range of systems,
from polymers and DNA to image restoration and recognition, communication and
social networks, and the behavior of financial markets. Random processes are
also used as important tools for efficient computations and simulation. In all
these applications, strong structural constraints associated with the complex
combinatorial or geometric structure underlying the problem determine the
behavior of the process. This research project is concerned with the fundamental
properties of such stochastic processes and their relationship to global
structures.

The project focusses on Markov processes that are defined in terms of a related
geometric or algebraic structure. The long-term and global properties of these
processes are determined by and often reflect the global structure of the
underlying space. The project involves questions at the interface between
analysis, geometry, and probability with a major role played by groups and their
actions. Partial differential equations and potential theory, i.e., the study of
harmonic functions and, more generally, of solutions of the heat equation, are
also at the center of many of these considerations. Brownian motion on a
Riemannian manifold and random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated
groups provide key examples.
