Professor Marlin D. Harmony and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Kansas are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the priod 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Example projects involve investigation of proteins
using laser spectroscopy, organic synthesis, and stereochemically controlled
polymerization catalysis. Activities include weekly seminars and the
presentation of interim and final reports, orally, in a poster session, and in
writing.
