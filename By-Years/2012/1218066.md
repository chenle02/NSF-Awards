Network routing is the ensemble of technologies for determining optimal paths
for data delivery. These paths are selected as a result of complex policy-driven
interactions between multiple networks and protocols. It is hard to understand
the consequences of adopting particular policy configurations, especially since
each individual operator's view of the global network is incomplete. Some
combinations of policy can lead to loss of connectivity, the adoption of sub-
optimal paths, or protocol convergence failure.

This research project aims to provide theoretical and practical methods by which
operators can manage the interaction of policy in the absence of complete
information. The central formalism is a protocol-agnostic model of partial
policy specifications. This model supports a variety of tasks, such as the
synthesis of unspecified parts of local policy according to high-level
objectives, configuration repair, and planned migration from one policy to
another. Each of these applications is to be given a rigorous algorithmic basis
in terms of the policy model, and implemented on simulated and real routing
platforms. Additional research goals include the development of higher-level
policy representations on top of the basic model, and providing tools for
assessing policy privacy using the incomplete information framework.

The broader impacts of this research include the development of practical tools
for policy analysis and synthesis, on standard network platforms. This will
allow important routing policy management tasks to be carried out with
confidence. Student projects connected to the development and validation of
these tools will be of direct importance to their education.
