This is a grant to provided travel support for graduate students travelling to
the MEMS'92, 5th Workshop on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, in Travemunde,
Germany. This is the major MEMS workshop, and it has been supported and seeded
by the Foundation, and more recently by the IEEE, ASME and JEEE (Japan IEEE).
About 250 researchers will attend the international workshop, and the attendance
of U.S. graduate students will enable them to remain highly productive in the
field.
