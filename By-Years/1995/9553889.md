This project was originally submitted to the Research and Learning program and
has been transferred to the Studies and Indicators program. It has been
evaluated as a study of the reform of mathematics. The purpose of this project
is to document the impact of a particular effort to reform mathematics
curriculum (Mathematics in Context) for grades 5 to 8 on the mathematical
performance of students. The project will examine changes in student performance
over time and compare their results with similar students in different programs.
A four-year longitudinal study with comparative features will be conducted in
four schools in three urban school districts and three districts. The sites will
be chosen site will use the Mathematics in Context curriculum and two will use a
traditional curriculum. Indicator of the variables that will yield information
about the teaching of the curriculum and its impact on student performance. the
study will produce technical reports, and articles to inform educators, policy
makers, and parents.
