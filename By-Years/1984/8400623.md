Mathematical models of chemical processes and for the prediction of chemical and
physical properties of interest to chemical engineers increasingly must involve
nonlinear partial differential and integral equations in several space variables
and in complicated geometries. The development of these models is motivated by
the desire to get the physics right, not to make the equations simple or the
mathematics elegant. The solution to these complex models requires the
techniques of modern computational mathematics and the computing power of
current and future large-scale scientific computers. This 2-day workshop to be
held on the Minneapolis Campus of the University of Minnesota in the summer of
1985 is devoted to stimulating interaction between the chemical engineering and
computational mathematics research communities and will benefit the future
research directions of both disciplines.
