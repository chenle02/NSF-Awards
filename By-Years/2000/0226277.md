This Services project is developing a web-based, searchable and browsable
database tool to capture information about the goals, ongoing activities,
deliverables, schedules, development stages and discipline areas covered by NSDL
projects. It is cooperatively populated by the NSDL community and organized by
its shared vision. To implement the Collaboration Finder the project is working
with the NSDL Community Services Standing Committee to facilitate its use by the
existing collections, services, and targeted research track projects. Close
coordination with the Core Integration team is being maintained so as to inform
the development of this key component of NSDL. Evaluation of the benefits of
this service includes outcome measures such as frequency and type of usage of
the Collaboration Finder by different groups of NSDL participants and
constituents, the number and type of new activities generated through use of the
Collaboration Finder, and the effectiveness and efficiencies in developing
successful collaborations among current and prospective NSDL projects.
