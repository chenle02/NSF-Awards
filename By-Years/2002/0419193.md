This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the
technology for manufacturing nano-structured polymer coatings that will prevent
aquatic biofouling of submerged man-made surfaces in an environmentally safe
way. The unique cellular structure of the nano-domained coatings proposed will
not only combine all the most desirable properties of the existing anti-
biofouling coatings but will also provide for complete or at least significantly
reduced pollution by effective binding (through a combination of strong chemical
complexation forces and physical steric hindrance) of selected repellants for
the fouling nuisance organisms. This program will focus on the coatings for
ship/boat hulls used in both marine and fresh water environments. These unique
nano-structured coatings are also expected to have a very broad impact and large
commercial effects in a variety of other water-based industries, ranging from
shipping, fishing, tourism and defense, to production of energy in hydroelectric
plants, protection of shorelines, production of potable water by desalination of
sea water or from biofoulant-infested fresh-water sources, etc.
