0116487&lt;br/&gt;Andersen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award made through the
Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, provides support for the
acquisition of a suite of instruments to be used in biogeochemical research on
surface waters from anthropogenically impacted and pristine rivers in the
Piedmont of the southeastern U.S. Researchers and students at Furman University
in Greenville, SC in addition to students and faculty from other liberal arts
institutions that are a part of the Associated Colleges of the South, will have
access to the following: an autoanalyzer for measurement of nutrient
concentrations (i.e. NO3-, PO43-); a coulometer system for the determination of
the organic carbon load in natural waters; and a fluorometer for the measurement
of chlorophyll a. This instrumentation will complement existing analytical
instruments at Furman and will advance teaching and training of undergraduate
students in the southeastern U.S. with modern analytical methods in aqueous
geochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
