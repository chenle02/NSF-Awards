9626154 Yan The investigator studies incompressible flows governed by the
Navier-Stokes equations or Burgers' equation. Some special issues are studied in
depth. Various types of control objectives (minimizing velocity tracking, drag,
vorticity) and control parameters (distributed control and boundary control) are
studied. Long-time dynamics of controlled flows is the main subject of this
project. The long-time behavior of global-in-time and piecewise-in-time optimal
controls are studied in different settings. Numerical schemes for computing the
control problems are designed and their performance is analyzed. Effectiveness
of control is analyzed for both continuous and discrete systems; the latter is
particularly close to the design of practical control. Numerical schemes are
implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of the control problems. The numerical
results both reinforce the theoretical results and reveal more quantitative
information of the controlled dynamics. Improving the design and control of
modern aircraft can be achieved through optimal design of wings, engines, etc,
or through the active control of air flowing over wings and into engines. The
project studies issues basic to active control. The investigator develops new
mathematical and computational tools that provide good engineering insight and
practical design criteria for controlling fluid motions in aerodynamic and
hydrodynamic systems. This requires high performance computational resources an
order of magnitude greater than typical modeling for uncontrolled flows. Direct
applications can also be found in the design of submarine body shape and
propelling systems.
