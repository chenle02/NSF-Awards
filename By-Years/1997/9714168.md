9714168 Putatunda The focus of this SGER project is research on a new series of
high carbon, austempered steels. The steel is synthesized using concepts from
austempered ductile cast iron (ADI) technology. The steel composition is
controlled to achieve a high carbon austenite and lower bainite structure after
heat treatment. Silicon or aluminum additions act to suppress the formation of
carbides, thereby increasing the toughness in these steels. The experimental
plan includes melting and casting the steels, hot rolling, austenitizing, and
austempering between 260 and 400 C. Microstructure in the steels is
characterized by microscopy, and the carbon content and volume fractions of
austenite and ferrite determined by x-ray diffraction. Mechanical properties are
measured with emphasis on strength and toughness. The research should show the
feasibility of processing these steels to the properties of interest. Ford Motor
Company and Wagner Casting Company are contributing support to the effort. %%%
The austempering process offers a low cost, high toughness steel with a good
combination of strength and ductility applicable to the automotive and energy
fields. ***
