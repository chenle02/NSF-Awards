Engineering Other - (59) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a means to enhance
technological literacy, attract more young people to careers in engineering and
contribute to the sustainment of the national capacity for technological
innovation, the Center for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering
Education (CASEE) of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) has designed this
project effort to increase public awareness of the role of engineering. This
project builds upon initial project efforts and progress made by: (a) developing
a two-hour movie script for a television series pilot; (b) soliciting network
interest in broadcasting the pilot and optioning the on-going production of a
television series; (c) identifying a professional management firm to represent
the interests of NAE as a proxy for the engineering community as the series is
developed; (d) determining broadcast network interest in the production of a
series based upon the pilot; (e) building a coalition of funders to support
production; and (f) building a coalition of supporters in the engineering
community.&lt;br/&gt;
