This is a study of the ways in which careers and wages are affected by the
mobility of workers within labor markets. Most jobs are located within an
occupation and within an organization or firm. The wages paid in a job may
depend both on characteristics of the occupation and the firm, depending on the
resources characteristic for the occupation and firm. This study will examine
how such labor market resources affect wages independently of individual
characteristics of the individual holding the job (education, age, effort, for
example). The study will be based on data from the Current Population Surveys
and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. This research will contribute to
our understanding of how labor market structures (occupations and firms) may
influence the wages paid to workers and in particular how the effects of an
individual's skill, education, and effort may be modified by the occupational
labor market or firm labor market he or she is working in.
