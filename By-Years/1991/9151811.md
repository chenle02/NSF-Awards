The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a GC-MS for use both lower and upper
division courses. The equipment is enhancing the curriculum in the areas of
spectroscopy and separations by application to the identification of complex
environmental samples, such as those found in oil field brine wells. In addition
to the use of the instrument in formal course laboratories, students are using
in an an active program of undergraduate research on environmental problems
associated with toxic wastes.
