9723426 Chrispeels Based on cloned genes for insect alpha-amylase and bean
alpha-amylase inhibitors, the work will use crystallography, biochemical
analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis for obtaining a structure model, and an
understanding of active site requirements for a productive interaction between
the two proteins. Considering the economical importance of crop protection, in
this case insect predation of harvested biomass, the work must be rated highly
significant from a biotechnological perspective.
