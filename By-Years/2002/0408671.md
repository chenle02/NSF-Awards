This experimental condensed matter physics project will investigate the newly
discovered phenomena of (i) radiation-induced resistance oscillations, and (ii)
zero-resistance/zero-conductance states, in a two-dimensional electron gas
exposed to millimeter wavelength radiation. The experiments will focus on three
major thrusts: (1) Novel effects in dc electronic transport induced by microwave
excitation in a small magnetic field; (2) Nonlinear optical effects in the
millimeter wave regime and their influence on dc electronic transport; and (3)
The prospect for imaging the electrical currents and flux states in a microwave-
pumped quantum structure. The proposed work will continue to explore interesting
physics, in particular the current pattern formations in the semi-classical and
quantum regimes, and possible flux states in a microwave-pumped electronic
system. Education of graduate students familiar with semiconductor physics,
microwave technology, and imaging technique serves them well for employment in
the national research infrastructure and high-technology industry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrical transport in a semiconductor device can exhibit
vanishing resistance when it is exposed to microwave radiation, a new effect
which was discovered by the PI during the previous grant period. This proposal
seeks funding to continue this investigation, with experiments focused on three
major aspects: (1) Novel effects in electronic transport induced by microwave
excitation in a small magnetic field; (2) Nonlinear optical effects in the
millimeter wave regime and their influence on electronic transport; and (3) The
prospect for imaging the electrical current distribution in a microwave-pumped
quantum device. Understanding of fundamental properties of a semiconductor
device driven by microwaves is also directly relevant to emerging issues in
spintronics and quantum information science. Education of graduate students
familiar with semiconductor physics, microwave technology, and imaging technique
serves them well for employment in the national research infrastructure and
high-technology industry.&lt;br/&gt;
