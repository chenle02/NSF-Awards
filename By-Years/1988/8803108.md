Raman scattering will be studied from folded acoustic phonons, confined optical
phonons, and interface optical phonons in Gallium Arsenide/Aluminum Arsenide and
Gallium Arsenide/Aluminum Gallium Arsenide superlattices under conditions where
the excited laser light is in resonance with various transitions from valence
subbands to conduction subbands. These measurements will be supplemented by
photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation, photoreflectance, and
spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. Goals include understanding details of
electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling resulting from valence-band
mixing, electron-hole exchange interaction, and three-dimensional behavior of
superlattice wave functions. Equipment will be assembled for real-time
spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on a sample growing inside a molecular
beam epitaxy machine. Real time comparisons will be made between ellipsometry
results and reflection high energy electron diffraction measurements. Goals
include improved understanding of epitaxial growth processes, incorporation of
ellipsometric results into feedback control of the growth, and achievement of
higher quality samples.
