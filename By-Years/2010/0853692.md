0853692&lt;br/&gt;Petty &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigate how small silver
clusters interact with DNA. The overall goal is to control the fluorescence
spectra of these strongly emitting metal species by altering the DNA sequence.
These chromophores are innovative in several respects. First, chromophores with
different emission spectra are straightforward and inexpensive to prepare
because the nucleobases control cluster formation. Second, the DNA-clusters
complexes are biocompatible due to their encapsulation by DNA and due to their
small size. Third, the clusters have favorable spectroscopic properties for
imaging in biological environments. The expertise of Professor Dickson in the
areas of high-sensitivity spectroscopy and DNA arrays will be critical for
identifying the optimal sequences via high-throughput parallel screening of a
comprehensive range of sequences. Professor Petty's background in DNA
thermodynamics and structure will be the basis of the further scrutiny of the
effect of reaction conditions on the formation and spectra of the clusters. The
fluorescence photophysical parameters of the silver-DNA conjugates will show how
both the base sequence and the solution environment influence the DNA-silver
cluster adducts. This project will develop undergraduate and graduate students
by conducting novel research related to biophotonics. The established and
productive collaboration between the undergraduate program at Furman and the
graduate program at Georgia Tech will provide multiple opportunities for
learning and teaching. The students will learn to organize and disseminate the
outcomes of their research activities through presentations at professional
meetings and through publication in the primary literature. A wider impact will
be in the classroom, as the new instruments and experiments will be integrated
into the physical chemistry and nanoscience laboratories. A postdoctoral
associate will be mentored for a future faculty career at an undergraduate-
focused institution.
