Considerable uncertainty remains in projections of future ice loss from West
Antarctica. A recent decadal style U.S. National Academy of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine report entitled: A Strategic Vision for NSF
Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research (2015) identifies changing
ice in Antarctica as one of the highest priority science problems facing
communities around the globe. The report identifies Thwaites Glacier as a target
for collaborative intense research efforts in the coming years. This project
contributes to that effort by deploying an instrument on board airborne surveys
that will help to constrain the unknown terrains beneath the Thwaites Ice Shelf
and in the region of the grounding line where the inland ice goes afloat. By
improving the accuracy and resolution of these data, which are fed into
predictive numerical models, the team will help to constrain the magnitude and
rate of increase in the contribution of ice from Thwaites Glacier to the global
ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will enhance the capabilities of the
already planned British Antarctic Survey aerogeophysics survey of Thwaites
Glacier during the 2018/19 field season. Their Inertial Measurement Unit will be
paired with a state-of-the-art commercial gravity meter to acquire high-quality
and significantly enhanced resolution data both over the ice shelf and at the
grounding line. Data will be processed immediately following collection and raw
and observed data will be released six months after
collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
