A subject of central importance to astronomers is the chemical evolution of our
and other galaxies. What were the elements, besides hydrogen and helium-4, out
of which galaxies formed? How did the primordial abundances change during the
intervening eons, due to stellar nucleosynthesis? Which types of stars
contributed principally to this change? The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes
to address these questions with regard to our Galaxy by continuing with his
current NSF- supported research. He intends to use high-resolution stellar
spectroscopy to obtain abundance data of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen in young,
metal-rich stars (i.e., non-variable supergiants, Cepheid stars, B-type stars on
the main sequence, and red giants) and in metal-deficient stars. Metal-deficient
stars specify the conditions at the time of the formation of the Galaxy, while
the young stars specify current conditions. The observations for this project
have been or are being carried out in collabo- ration with Lambert (Uni. of
Texas), Bond (Space Telescope Science Inst.), and Rich (Columbia).
