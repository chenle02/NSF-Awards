Mathematicians use invariants to study and classify highly abstract objects. The
key properties of a useful invariant are that it is computable and that it
distinguishes many different objects. For dynamical systems, an important class
of mathematical objects, the construction of invariants is very difficult. This
project studies invariants of dynamical systems using abstract operator algebras
(in particular C*-algebras). The specific invariant is the K-theory of the
relevant operator algebra, which in turn is an invariant of the relevant
dynamical system. The project will involve significant contributions from early-
career researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students, who will
benefit from training through research involvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
principal investigator will study the range of the Elliott invariant, which
consists of K-theory and tracial information, for C*-algebras constructed from
minimal and hyperbolic dynamical systems. This research represents a
continuation of the investigatorâ€™s previous work. However, in addition to the
study of K-theory as an abstract graded group, the investigator will also study
the order structure on K-theory and the traces of the relevant C*-algebras.
Furthermore, this research goes beyond the study of uniformly hyperbolic
dynamical systems (e.g., Smale spaces) to study general expansive systems.
Specific projects include the study of minimal homeomorphisms on odd dimensional
spheres, the order structure on K-theory for minimal crossed products, the finer
structure of Smale space C*-algebras, and the HK-conjecture for C*-algebras
associated to dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
