This dissertation project will support a PhD student from the University of
Pennsylvania to conduct ethnographic research in a Chinese secondary school for
18 months. The study will investigate the Chinese conceptions of reciprocity
between generations as they are acted out between teachers and students in the
school. This project is valuable because of the key importance of education in
Chinese culture. Understanding how values are molded in the Chinese classroom
may help us better understand, through comparison, the learning that goes on in
our own classrooms.
