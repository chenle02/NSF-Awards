9633276 Jenkins In this project, the PI will analyze a series of water samples
obtained in March-April, 1995 in the Seas of Japan and Okhotsk by Dr. S. Riser,
of the University of Washington, aboard a Russian research vessel. Specific
attention would be paid to analysis for Helium-3 and Tritium. Results would be
used as circulation model constraints, to estimate oxygen consumption rates, and
to infer rates of export production within the basins. These seas are thought to
be the principal sources of ventilation of North Pacific Intermediate Waters
(NPIW), and hence important for a variety of oceanographic and climatic reasons.
Results would be useful in providing boundary conditions for tracer models of
the entire North Pacific, adding value to the Pacific tracer program of the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment.
