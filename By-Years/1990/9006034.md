This project supports the procurement of equipment needed to enhance research
on mechanics and motion control problems of computerized electromechanical
systems. This instrumentation is an integral part of an experimental and
theoretical research effort to study optimal control strategies to eliminate
residual vibrations during point to point position control of motor driven
flexible structures. The instrumentation comprises a control analyzer, a
digitizing oscilloscope, a waveform synthesizer, a power amplifier, a mini
shaker, a DC supply/amplifier, a microcomputer, a data acquisition adaptor, and
a plug in board. The impact of the research is expected to be on the control of
micro actuators in computer peripherals, robotic manipulators, space structures,
and the active vibration damping of flexible structures.
