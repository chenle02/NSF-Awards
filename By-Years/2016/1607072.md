Atoms and molecules in the gas phase are currently used in many applications:
the world's most accurate clocks, sensors, and prototype quantum computers. Many
of these applications would greatly benefit from higher numbers and densities of
the atoms and molecules used. This can be achieved by implanting the atoms or
molecules of interest within a solid. Unfortunately, most solids alter the
properties of implanted atoms or molecules to such an extent that they are no
longer experimentally useful. One promising exception to this rule is solid
parahydrogen: a cryogenic crystal of hydrogen molecules prepared in a purified
nuclear spin state. This "quantum solid" preserves many of the important
properties of implanted atoms and molecules. This project will investigate the
properties of parahydrogen relevant for atomic physics applications, and combine
the powerful tools of atomic and molecular physics with the high numbers and
densities that can only be achieved in the solid phase. This has the potential
to advance applications such as magnetometry, molecular structure imaging, and
fundamental physics tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experimental physics
research program will measure the optical pumping properties of atoms implanted
in solid parahydrogen, and measure spin relaxation and coherence times. These
are crucial parameters for magnetometry applications. A survey of atomic dopants
and crystal parameters will be conducted to find favorable conditions and help
to understand the underlying physics. The behavior of implanted polar molecules,
specifically the ability to use external fields to orient the molecules, will be
studied. This is not only of interest for understanding the interaction of
molecules with their parahydrogen host, but also a crucial first step for
proposals to search for an electric dipole moment using heavy polar molecules in
the solid phase.
