This proposal seeks funds for partial support of on international conference to
assess the efficiency of taxon-based conservation, restoration, and management
programs using chelonians (turtles and tortoises) as model systems. The workshop
will examine conservation problems and develop remedial strategies. A task force
will be established to oversee the field testing of these strategies after the
conference. The approaches, methodologies and solutions discussed at the
conference will have important applications pertaining to a wide range of
organisms. The conference will contain a blend of participants including
ecologists, conservationists, planners, and governmental representatives. The
proceedings of the conference will be published. %%% This conference is an
important, timely, creative, and cost-effective forum for the discussion and
dissemination of information regarding the conservation, restoration, and
management of chelonian species. The results of the conference will also yield
important implications for conservation biology, in general.
