Microbes, such as bacteria and fungi, are the most diverse and abundant living
organisms on the planet. Recent advances in evolutionary theory and microbiology
have revealed that many microbes display complex social interactions. Behaviors
such as cooperation, cheating, and communication are widespread in microbial
communities and often require the production of substances called public goods,
such as enzymes and signaling molecules. The goal of this project is to develop
theory that links evolution and ecosystem ecology via social behaviors in
microbial communities. This theory will then be used to predict how microbial
interactions and public goods will affect the cycling of carbon and nutrients
around the globe. The investigator will build computer models to simulate
production of public goods at the microbe scale and chemical processes at the
ecosystem scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary theory has rarely been used
to understand processes at the ecosystem level of biological organization. The
first broader impact of this study will be to use evolutionary theory to
understand fundamental ecosystem functions. Human societies and natural
ecosystems rely on the functioning of microbial communities. By developing
theoretical models, this research will provide new insight into processes
ranging from the emission of greenhouse gases to nutrient cycling in marine food
webs. The project will provide interdisciplinary training to one graduate and at
least one undergraduate student. Web-based computer software to illustrate
theoretical principles in microbial ecology will be developed for use in
teaching and outreach efforts. These efforts will be executed through
undergraduate courses and an existing program at UCI that targets teachers,
minority high school students, and the general public.
