The project will study both linear and non-linear filtering from the point of
view of long term dependence and high variability. Long range dependence occurs
in data on frequency fluctuations of quartz crystal oscillators, and on semi-
conductor devices. Infinite variance is a reasonable model in situations where
large values are taken with high probability such as in rain data and in
relaxation times of solid state materials. The choice of the filters is made to
get appropriate output processes that serve as good models. The statistical
estimators of the parameters of interest thus depend on the types of filters
used. The principal investigator, along with the post doctoral associate, will
investigate the robustness properties of the estimators as well as explore the
long range dependence. The behavior of the non-linear filters will be
investigated when the input has high variability.
