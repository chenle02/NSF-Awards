The goal of this project is to explore mechanisms of signaling to the
microtubule (MT)-based-cytoskeleton. Doublecortin (DCX) is a novel microtubule
associated protein (MAP) and is the major gene mutated in X-Lissencephaly and
Subcortical Band Heterotopia (X-LIS /SCLH), a severe disorder in neuronal
migration during development of the cerebral cortex. Doublecortin kinase 2
(DCK2) is a chimeric protein with a domain highly related to that of DCX fused
to a protein kinase domain related to calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. The
goal of this project is to investigate the functional effects and role of
phosphorylation in the interaction of DCK2 with the MT-cytoskeleton, and to test
the hypothesis that cellular events such as the establishment of neuronal
polarity and neuronal process extension may be dependent upon rapid modulation
of MT dynamics due to reversible signaling to and from members of the DCX/DCK
family of proteins.
