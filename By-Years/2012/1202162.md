The next generation of laser intensities, say a factor of 1000 more intense than
current laser intensities, would both open up new avenues of fundamental
research and give rise to new applications. The current technology is limited by
the material properties of gratings and amplifiers. But optical elements made
out of plasma do not suffer this limitation. Hence, the next generation of
lasers almost certainly should involve plasma technology. The research objective
of this project is thus to identify plasma-based mechanisms that compress laser
pulses, to evaluate experimental progress in this area, and to identify the
experiments that will retire the key uncertainties. This project will consider
both compression in the micron wavelength optical regime as well as the
extension of these effects to sub-micron wavelengths, where alternative
compression techniques fail at even lower intensities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this project lie beyond simply predicting new plasma effects
and in building a much more powerful laser. As an enabling technology, the
broader impact of this project lies in how various subfields of physics might
utilize the next generation of lasers. Apart from the opportunities at high
intensity in probing strong field effects, there is the derivative technology
that higher intensities invariably enable shorter durations. Thus the next
generation of intensities will usher in as well the next generation of pulse
durations, into the sub-attosecond regimes, thereby providing the time-
resolution that could enable the probing of, for example, nuclear phenomena.
