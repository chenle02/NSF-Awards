The NSF-funded project conducted by Kevin Crowston at Syracuse University will
investigate the capabilities and potential of social-computational support
systems in the context of citizen science, defined as "partnerships between
volunteers and scientists that answer real-world questions". The research will
examine nature of the computational systems currently used in a number of
citizen science projects and will use these insights to improve computational
support for different kinds of citizen science projects. The project will focus
on the following three goals: (1) developing a practical understanding of the
conditions under which social computation can enhance science and education; (2)
generating new research models of social-computational systems that support
large-scale public participation in scientific research; and (3) developing and
testing social-computational systems that incorporate explicit knowledge about
human cognitive and social abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
produce societal benefits by investigating how involving the public in
scientific research can advance scientific goals while contributing to the
science education of the volunteer participants, determining the conditions
under which citizen science can prove beneficial for large-scale data collection
and analysis, and providing guidelines for improving the design and
implementation of computational support systems for citizen science projects.
