The basic theoretical and empirical foci are the social impacts of information
and communications technologies, especially the wired and wireless Internet, on
individuals' social and work lives in four institutional contexts-households,
workplaces, governments, and schools - and on the four institutions themselves.
The analyses are integrated by an interest in the ways in which ITs create
"information networks" which enable individuals and work groups to engage in
multiple functions from a particular contextual location and possibly to link
these functions and these social institutions in novel ways. The project is
grounded in the analysis of data gathered in field studies and in longitudinal
surveys of more than 4,000 individuals in household, workplace and school
samples from 16 localities distributed across the four U.S. regions. These
systematic, empirical analyses will advance our scientific understanding of how
IT use affects individuals across multiple roles within these networked
institutions and will inform explanatory theories of IT-related change and
transformation at the individual and organizational levels of
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
