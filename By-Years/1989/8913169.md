Optimized whiskerless Schottky barrier diodes offer great potential as high
frequency mixer or varactor elements. This research is necessary to realize the
goal of producing millimeter and submillimeter wavelength receivers which are
both rugged and relatively easy to fabricate and use. Although superconductive
devices are making inroads as planar, low-noise mixer elements, Schottky diodes
will continue to be the mixer element of choice for higher frequencies and for
room temperature applications. Other important applications include harmonic
generators for LO power, varactor tuning elements, and noise sources.
