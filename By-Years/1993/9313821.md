9313821 McIntyre The goal of this study is to determine if solar forcing alters
climate at the millennial time scales with the help of calcareous planktonic and
isotopic proxies. This will be done in three steps. First, the response of
surface waters of equatorial Atlantic to climate controlled wind variations will
be documented. Second, these signals will be compared with time series from
other regions to determine if these short period signals are global. Third, a
sine wave signal of millennial response of ocean/climate will need constructed
which can be used bother for comparison with other records and as a predictive
template.
