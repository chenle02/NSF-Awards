The concept of apparent thinning of the layer 2A with age due to seismic
anisotropy is the central theme of this research. According to the P.I., the
horizontal velocity in the upper crust is a much as 40% higher than the velocity
measured in the vertical direction. This is due to subhorizontal cracks in the
uppermost oceanic crust which are most prominent near the spreading center. With
age these cracks are filled by alteration products and this reduces the extent
of the anisotropy. In other words, the apparent thinning of layer 2A as observed
in seismic reflection and refraction studies is caused by increase in seismic
velocities (measured vertically) away from the spreading axis. In this award,
the P.I. will test this concept by computer modeling of the existing data and in
the process will understand the mechanism of hydrothermal mineralization in the
crust. Any such modeling work should be completed before carrying out a field
study. The P.I. is a capable theoritical geophysicist and modeler and the study
has a very high chance of success.
