Professor Michaelson will assemble a precipitation dataset for western North
America from Mexico to Alaska. He will analyze the data using frequency domain
time series techniques to determine spatial and temporal variability in
precipitation over the region. The research will produce a more comprehensive
precipitation database than currently exists for the region, and the analysis
will lead to a better understanding of large-scale climatic variability in
western North America. The information concerning fluctuations in water
availability that will result will be useful theoretically and for hydrologists
and water-use planners.
