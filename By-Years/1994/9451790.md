9451790 Bondeson A new computational laboratory within the Department of
Chemistry is being equipped in order to allow students to perform molecular
modeling experiments, to tackle complex mathematical problems describing real
systems, and to observe protein dynamics of biomolecules. The laboratory centers
on the speed and versatility of computer workstations and powerful software for
modeling actual chemical systems. Rather than creating a new course, we are
incorporating modeling into several existing courses, beginning with
introductory chemistry for science majors. Our intent is to increase general
retention in science and particular interest in chemistry. Students are becoming
more and more familiar with the sophisticated software as they progress through
their educational careers and are developing a high degree of proficiency and
independence in the use of the laboratory. Students are using this laboratory
both in guided exercises and in self-paced and more independent projects.
Questions of "What if...?" and "How come...?" are posed and addressed once the
student appreciates the power as well as the limitations of computational
approaches. We feel strongly that these tools for investigation are allowing our
chemistry majors to develop their creativity by relieving some of the
mathematical barriers and giving them a ready environment to test their own
ideas. In this way, our students are being better prepared both for careers in
industry and also for graduate school as they look to the future.
