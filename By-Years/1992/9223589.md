The Phase II effort will address three basic topics related to the abrasive
suspension jet (ABJ) process. First, a study will be conducted on suspension
preparation and the effect of rheological characteristics on jet coherency and
cutting performance. The rheological characteristics of the suspension will be
modeled and correlated with the jet's structure and the resultant machining
performance. The second topic is related to nozzle optimization and jet flow
modeling and will also involve exploring alternative nozzle concepts and new
materials. The suspension acceleration process and the jet's structure will be
modeled. The third area of study will address the jet-material interaction
process for cutting and drilling. Previously developed abrasive water jet (AWJ)
models will be used to guide the development of an ASJ cutting prediction model.
Jet and jet- material interface visualization techniques will be used in this
program. The results of this work will be used in parallel engineering efforts
on pump development for commercialization. The technology developed under this
program will have significant direct and indirect effects in several commercial
fields. The high-velocity flow of ASJs will introduce a new cutting beam to the
machining industry. The ASJ beam is highly efficient and capable of machining
any material. Cutting, drilling, turning, milling, polishing, deburring, and
other machining operations could be performed with the same tool.
