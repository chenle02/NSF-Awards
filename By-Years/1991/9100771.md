In this program, undergraduate engineering students participate in research
projects in the laboratories of members of the Biomedical Engineering Department
of the Johns Hopkins University. Opportunities are available for basic research
on biomedical instrumentation, sensors, prosthetics, biomaterials, biomechanics,
neurophysiology, and neural modeling, cardiovascular physiology and modeling,
mathematical modeling, and membrane and cellular physiology. Students are
recruited from institutions in the Baltimore-Washington area, including Johns
Hopkins University, Morgan State University and Howard University. Special
effort is made to attract underrepresented groups to the program. Participants
work under the day-to-day supervision of faculty members on research projects
which the students have developed under the guidance of a faculty mentor.
Students discuss their research projects in a weekly seminar series which gives
students experience in presenting research plans and results and in discussing
their work with their peers. A limited number of students will present results
of their projects at national meetings,, with financial support from the School
of Engineering.
