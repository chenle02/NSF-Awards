The Research Initiation Award is for an experimental study of the temperature
rise that occurs at the tip of a crack due to the plastic deformation there. The
dynamic fracture process is very fast, so that the heat that is generated at the
tip cannot be conducted away. There are indications that temperature rises of
1000 C are developed. When the heating is measured, the possibility of having a
better energy balance is enhanced.
