9319015 CROWLEY The scientific discipline of geography plays a central role in
economic, political, and social life in the United States. It also has become a
major focus of educational reform in the nation, having been designated as one
of five core subjects for American schools in the National Education Goals
adopted by the President and state governors in 1990. Several significant
challenges now face the discipline, however. Among these challenges are: -
connecting geography as a science with grassroots interest in geographic
literacy, - strengthening the relationship between geographic scholarship and
geographic education, - meeting the demand for geographic educators, focusing
more research by geographers on national and global issues, - clarifying the
role of geography as a discipline relative to the many partly geographic
multidisciplinary activities, and - coping with the higher costs of scientific
research in geography. With support from NSF and other organizations, the
National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) will convene a
committee to conduct a comprehensive assessment of geography in the U.S. The
objectives of the assessment are (1) to identify critical issues and constraints
for the discipline, (2) to clarify priorities for teaching and research, (3) to
link developments in the discipline with national needs for geographic
education, (4) to increase the appreciation of geography within the scientific
community, and (5) to communicate with the international scientific community
about the future directions of geography in the U.S. Committee members will be
drawn from the academic, public, and private sectors. The committee will use
briefings, fact-finding exercises, and discussions to produce a report that will
summarize its findings. This report will be subject to NAS/NRC review procedures
and will be readily available to geographers and others. This project will
provide a valuable and timely examination of the prospects and problems facing
geography. Especially beneficial will be recommendations regarding research
priorities and steps that can be taken to more closely link basic and applied
research in geography. ***
