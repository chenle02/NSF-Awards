This project is designed to enlarge the support for student training in
ethnography. The Department of Anthropology at the University of Georgia has
developed a program focussed on sustainable human ecosystems (or SHEP). This
program involves rigorous training in research design, statistics, and
ethnographic method. through funding of this project, part of this program of
education will include an important field component of ethnographic training.
Students under the supervision of faculty will enter the field at a faculty
research site and apply research techniques learned in the classroom to actual
field research. The field experience will last a minimum of 10 weeks and will
greatly enhance the quality of graduate training and allow students to better
design their doctoral research.
