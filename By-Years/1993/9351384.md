9351384 Garver An automated stage system for fission-track dating is being used
by undergraduate students. Fission-track dating involves determining the density
of fossil tracks that have occurred naturally over time in either zircon or
apatite crystals. Additionally, however, one needs to determine the amount of
uranium in the crystal because track density is proportional to age and uranium
concentration. This is accomplished by placing a mica flake over the sample and
irradiating the sample to produce spontaneous tracks; the density of spontaneous
tracks on the mica flake is proportional to the uranium concentration. The
automated stage quickly and precisely moves the microscope stage with an
absolute accuracy of 10 m. Given this considerable time savings and ease of use,
we are introducing fission-track dating into our Geochemistry classes with
projects in which students date prepared samples and interpret their
significance. Additionally, the system is being used extensively in our senior
thesis program. ***y
