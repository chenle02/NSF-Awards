This project is providing need-based scholarships over four years to 18 graduate
students (5-10 MS students and 4-8 PhD students) in the Civil and Environmental
Engineering programs at the University of South Florida. The project is designed
around the theme of sustainable water and transportation infrastructure. The
project team includes teaching faculty members, each of whom has an active
research program. A full-circle mentoring plan is being implemented between
faculty and doctoral students, as well as between PhD students and MS students.
Efforts are being made to recruit and retain a diverse cohort of graduate
students (with and without first degrees in engineering) into advanced
engineering programs and to prepare students to be globally competitive by
promoting knowledge transfer between students and faculty that have different
global perspectives while integrating the most appropriate knowledge,
methodologies, techniques, and practices from both the developed and developing
worlds.
