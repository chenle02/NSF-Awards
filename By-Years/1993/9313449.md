9313449 Halperin The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern
University has exceedingly strong basic research programs and wishes to place
them into advanced research environments by renovating their laboratories. This
award allows Northwestern to modernize 11,300 square feet of research space in
order to provide a state-of-the-art environment for advanced research in
experimental condensed-matter physics and the design and construction of
advanced detectors for use in condensed-matter physics and astrophysics. This
modernization will take place in the Technological Building that has not been
renovated in 50 years. The renovated laboratories will include clean-room
environments, facilities for device fabrication, once- through air handling, and
state-of-the-art vibration isolation. These improvements will greatly improve
the department's research and graduate training programs in ultra-low-
temperature physics, NMR studies of advanced materials, mesoscopic physics,
device fabrication, Langmuir films, and the study of nonlinear optics. ***
