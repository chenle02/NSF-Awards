This action funds Colin Michael Haynes of the University of California, San
Diego to conduct a research project, entitled "Improving damage prediction
capability for composite aerospace structures," during the summer of 2012 at the
University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan. The host scientist is Professor Nobuo
Takeda.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to enable better damage
prediction for structural health monitoring of composite aerospace structures.
This objective is being accomplished through ultrasonic guided wave inspection
with fiber optic strain sensors coupled with damage prediction models.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
