Research will be conducted in a broad area of theoretical high energy physics
including supergravity unified theory and superstring theory. In supergravity
unified theory, which allows for the unification of the weak and the strong
nuclear forces in a way which is consistent with recent data, analyses will
explore the most promising avenues for the discovery of new fundamental
particles predicted by the theory. At the same time the basic issues related to
the origin of mass will be investigated. In superstring theory, work will
include analyses to understand conjectured `duality` relations which state that
seemingly very different theories are actually equivalent. The goal of this
research program is to unravel the next layer of physics that lies beyond the
Standard Model, a theory which describes very successfully the weak and the
strong nuclear forces, but which leaves a host of open questions. The program
will pursue some of the most promising approaches to going beyond the Standard
Model.
