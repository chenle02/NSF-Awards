9714807 9714807 Jakus The PIs, Karl Jakus of University of Massachusetts, and
Yet- Ming Chiang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, propose a 2 day
workshop involving 40 people to identify and prioritize research needs and
opportunities in ceramics for the coming decade. The workshop will consider
issues related to both structural and functional ceramics, focusing on
fundamental rather than "mission-oriented" research. The broad goal of the
workshop will be to identify those areas of ceramics research in which new or
continued emphasis by NSF is likely to lead to breakthroughs in scientific
understanding, discovery of new ceramics and materials systems, and./or
development of new technologies that can ultimately have a broad economic impact
upon the nation. %%% The proposed workshop is in response to the COV
recommendation (April 1996) that each program hold a workshop assessing the role
of the program in its research area. The 2 day workshop will identify and
prioritize research needs and opportunities in ceramics for the coming decade.
