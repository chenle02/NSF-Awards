9318074 MORSE Until very recently the Chinese government would not allow
specimens to leave the country for study. This project is based on careful
efforts by the Principal Investigator to foster collaboration with Chinese
scientists and to receive governmental approval/permission for such
collaboration. Extensive collecting in six provinces of the People's Republic of
China during the summer of 1990 established that approximately 70% of the caddis
fly fauna (Insecta: Trichoptera) is undescribed. These insects are extremely
important as indicators of water quality. This research project will involve
description of this understudied group of insects from China, revisionary
studies for four families, and biogeographic analyses. It is thought that the
biogeographic analyses of the Chinese faunas will be very important to
understanding the biogeography of these insect groups on a worldwide basis. Two
Chinese scientists will be trained in modern systematic methods for study of
Trichoptera at Clemson University. %%% Caddis flies are important indicators of
water quality. However, for the People's Republic of China, these and other
aquatic insects remain poorly studied. This project will describe many new
species recently collected in China and undertake studies of relationships among
species and their biogeographic distributions. Fostering collaboration with
scientists from the People's Republic of China is an important element of this
project. ***
