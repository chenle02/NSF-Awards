Bauerle This facilities modernization award will help renovate about 11,500
square feet of research space in the Department of Biology at the University of
Virginia. The project will renovate the basic electrical, mechanical, plumbing,
and fire protection systems of the two research floors of Gilmer Hall. It will
also help renovate the research labs of five faculty members and provide for
construction of common support facilities on each floor, including cold rooms,
equipment rooms and media kitchens. Research in the targeted spaces will be
multidisciplinary, addressing fundamental questions in the areas of molecular
and cellular biology, developmental biology, and population and evolutionary
biology. All of the laboratories will be training centers for postdoctoral
fellows and graduate and undergraduate students. The improvements will result in
increased efficiency in space utilization, will provide for laboratory
facilities appropriate for current research activities and will bring the
affected areas of the building into compliance with current fire safety and
handicapped access codes, thereby establishing a safer, healthier, more
productive work environment for all occupants.
