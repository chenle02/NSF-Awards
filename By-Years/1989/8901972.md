Professor Richter's project will investigate a class of operators on Hilbert
space called two-isometries, which satisfy a weaker, order two version of the
norm-preserving condition that defines isometries. An important example of a
two-isometry is the operator of multiplication by z on the space of functions
that map the disc analytically to a region with finite area, i.e. the classical
Dirichlet shift on the classical Dirichlet space. The essence of the projected
research is to use operator-theoretic results to study functions in spaces of
Dirichlet type, and conversely to use function theory to construct models for
abstract two-isometries. A central problem is that of characterizing the
invariant subspace lattice of the Dirichlet shift and its generalizations. The
mathematical research envisioned here has to do with analytic functions on the
disc. These may be described geometrically as the continuous mappings of the
disc into the plane that preserve angles, except perhaps at scattered singular
points. It is a reflection of the important role analytic functions have played
in mathematics for well over a century that they can be described in numerous
other ways as well. One method of studying analytic functions is to group them
into linear spaces, most fruitfully Hilbert spaces defined by an appropriate
finiteness condition, and consider the behavior of certain operators that arise
naturally on these spaces. One such space is the Dirichlet space consisting of
all analytic functions on the disc which map the disc to a planar region with
finite area. The operator of multiplication of functions in this space (and its
generalizations) by the independent variable will be studied and characterized
by Professor Richter.
