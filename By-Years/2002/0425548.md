Abstract CTS-0113206 R. Lucht, Texas A&M University

Components are acquired for development of a tunable, high-resolution optical
parametric oscillator (OPO) laser source. The system features a resonant,
electronically locked ring-oscillator cavity that is injection-seeded with
tunable diode laser radiation. The pump source for the OPO system is a
Q-switched injection-seeded Nd:YAG laser. In addition to serving as the pump
source for the OPO cavity, the fundamental (1064 nm) and harmonic (532 nm, 355
nm, and 266 nm) laser radiation from the YAG laser is used in sum-frequency
generation (SFG) processes to convert the near infrared output of the OPO into
visible or ultraviolet radiation. This source will greatly improve applicability
and accuracy of a wide variety of laser diagnostic techniques. Specific examples
include ultraviolet polarization spectroscopy (PS) of hydroxyl and nitric oxide,
amplified stimulated emission (ASE) of the carbon atom, and coherent anti-Stokes
Raman scattering (CARS) of the hydrogen molecule.
