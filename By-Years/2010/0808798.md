The Keweenaw Research Center (KRC) of Michigan Tech University (MTU) will host
the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Clean Snowmobile Challenge (CSC) event
for the next three years at its 500 acre test track in Houghton, Michigan. This
project seeks funds to encourage Universities to participate by reimbursing
travel expenses and other costs associated with the competition. Student teams
are judged on the design, manufacturing price, presentation, vehicle
capabilities such as range, weight, handling acceleration, cold start and noise
of their vehicles. The objectives of this competition are to train students in
technology development, to develop transportation vehicles with reduced impact
on the environment, and to educate students and the public about research in the
Office of Polar Programs.
