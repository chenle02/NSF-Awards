This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
a new type of low-cost solar power module by pairing proven photovoltaic cells
with novel concentrating optics that make use of smart "reactive" optical
materials. The reactive materials adjust automatically to solar incidence,
changing the optical properties of the concentrator in order to track the solar
position over time. By embedding this tracking function within the concentrator,
rather than using expensive and bulky mechanical trackers, this approach enables
high concentration to be achieved in modules with stationary mounting and
significantly reduces overall system costs. The objectives of the Phase I
research plan are to validate the design of the reactive optics, through both
simulation and experimentation, and to build and test functional prototypes of
the solar concentrator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this project is primarily in the field of photovoltaic power,
although other applications of the optical system are also likely. The reactive
solar concentrator to be developed under this program is predicted to result in
solar power module costs as low as $0.40 per peak watt (in direct sunlight), a
savings of approximately 50% to 75% compared to current modules. This cost
reduction can help spur rapid growth of photovoltaic power usage, which will
bring a wide range of economic, environmental, and national security benefits
and will accelerate job growth within the solar power industry. The reactive
solar concentrator technology may also provide lightweight high-power solar
modules that are uniquely suited to demanding off-grid field applications and
that can be easily transported and deployed as needed.
