This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
a novel technology that exploits micro-scale enhanced heat and mass transport
phenomena, and micro-fabrication mass production methods. The proposed device
will have no moving parts, will operate at ambient pressure, and can be used as
a micro-component or assembled into a larger architecture to perform separations
at high production rates.

Enriching the oxygen content of combustion air with a device as easy to use as
an air filter would increase the efficiency of domestic furnaces and hot water
heaters, would decrease fuel use and CO2 and NOx pollution in steel making and
aluminum production, and could even enhance the performance of ultra-high
altitude air-breathing engines. At the smaller scale, continuous adsorption
provides the simple, reliable micro-architecture needed to purify fuel cell feed
gases.
