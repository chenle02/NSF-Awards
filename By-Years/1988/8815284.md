The objectives of this research are to 1) develop a technological base for the
manufacturing of microactuators; 2) investigate laminar flow processes and
transition to turbulence in smooth and microconfigured channels; 3) establish
experimental methods for monitoring fluid flows down to the picoliters/sec
range; and 4) develop the associated pumps, valves and related elements for
eventually creating a medium scale fluidic (MSF) system. Recent interest in
microactuators with meso- scale dimensions (100 nm -100 microns) comes from the
success that has been achieved in micromachining a variety of micromechanical
structures such as gear trains, reciprocating elements, and canterlevered
vibrators. In most cases, these structures will operate in or on fluids. To take
full advantage of this new, emerging field, appropriate structures for
distributing fluids in small channels and chambers and for measuring
physiochemical and biological processes operating in the meso-scale range must
be designed and manufactured, and a knowledge base pertaining to fluid flow in
such small spaces must be generated. When the geometric size of a structure is
comparable to the characteristic dimensions of the fluid flow field, effects and
processes that are normally neglected at larger dimensions may be important,
e.g., scaling laws may have to be modified for meso- scale systems. These
experimental observations will be compared with theoretical results that are
currently being carried out.
