South Dakota Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Center. Dr. Ustad has
several years of experience and has been very effective in assisting SBIR
researchers and entrepreneurs in South Dakota with preparation of successful
Phase I SBIR proposals. He also has a an impressive track record in the
conversion of Phase I to Phsae II SBIR awards. This award will provide funds for
establishing a Phase O program of small awards to industry/university
partnerships; these awards will support research to strengthen anticipated Phase
I SBIR proposals. A series of seminars will be presented throughout South Dakota
to increase awareness of SBIR programs and the center will provide direct
assistance with Phase I and Phase II SBIR proposal preparation and submission.
Graduate students from the School of Business will be involved in helping to
solve problems relating to the commercialization process. To increase the
prospects of business successes an SBIR support network will be developed that
includes accountants, lawyers, and venture capital firms. Overall this award is
anticipated to develop a stronger entrepreneurial environment and awareness of
SBIR opportunities in South Dakota. Such strengthened awareness and capabilities
will be important in the state s transition from an economy based on extractive
industries depending on natural resources to one including high technology
industries which utilize the intellectual resources of university researchers
and SBIR entrepreneurs to foster economic growth and development in South
Dakota.
