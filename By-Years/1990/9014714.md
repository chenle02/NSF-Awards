This research studies a new control design methodology for uncertain dynamic
systems, where the uncertainty is associated with the system's nonlinearity or
time varying characteristics. The intent is to develop a controller which does
not depend on any knowledge of the uncertainty except its possible bound. The
control problem is formulated in a geometric manner where the uncertainty is
described to lie within a hyperpolyhedron domain. And since uncertainty on
system performance occurs at the corner points of the hyperpolyhedron, it is
sufficient to study the system behavior by examining the polyhedron corner
points. Computer dynamic programming techniques are used in searching for the
solution. The research comprises two components, a practical design problem, and
an analytical design problem. The analytical task examines the feasibility of
using artificial neural networks to design and implement the control concept.
The practical design task will demonstrate the practicality of the method for a
flexible beam structure with piezoelectric sensors and actuators.
