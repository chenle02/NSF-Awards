9353303 Jones This award to the Memphis City Schools is for a self-study of
science and mathematics education in the city of Memphis. It is directed by a
Strategic Planning Steering Committee that is broadly representative of the
community, educators, business, and policy makers. The self-study will begin
with an examination of goals for the city's science and mathematics programs
leading to a statement of those goals and a plan for their attainment. The
committee will be staffed by research, mathematics, and science specialists from
the Memphis City Schools, with the Coordinator of Research Services as the staff
person in charge of the self-study. Data collection will include a variety of
coordinated procedures, observations, new data collection, and analysis of
existing information among them. A broad range of participants will be involved
in goal clarification, study design, measurement, analysis, and reporting
thereby insuring ownership and "buy-in" by a broadly representative group of
Memphians. The results will be broadly disseminated using the network of
individuals and groups involved in the study itself. The committee will continue
to review the status of mathematics and science education periodically and will
issue reports on the state of mathematics and science education in the City of
Memphis. The cost-sharing for the project will be 19 percent of the NSF portion.
