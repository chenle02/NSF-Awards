Recent developments in pulsed power technologies for generating kilojoule
energy levels economically, have made electrocrushing and electrohydraulic
fragmentation of rocks and ore comminution more practical. The Phase I results
have demonstrated the effectiveness of liberating copper from copper porphyry
ores using electrocrushing and electrohydraulic fracturing techniques, as a
function of energy deposited in the ore samples, the electric field strength,
pulse width and electrode configuration. The successful proof-of-concept
demonstration of ore liberation of Phase I using electrocrushing, therefore
leads to a more exhaustive research development program for Phase II. There are
two key objectives for Phase II research program: (1) to extend the Phase I
results to include two (or three) additional ore types for which the market
price is stable and sufficiently high, and to conduct more exhaustive
electrocrushing experiments with a larger number of samples and (2) to address
specific energy consumption and mineral recovery issues by comparing the
electrocrushing and electrohydraulic fragmentation techniques to the traditional
method of compressive mechanical disintegration. The experiments will be
conducted in pulsed power facilities using the optimum electrode configurations
and discharge energy levels arrived at in Phase I. The first series of tests
will be conducted in the batch mode using both short and long pulse width
discharges, followed by slug flows stimulating laboratory scale continuous ore
processing.
