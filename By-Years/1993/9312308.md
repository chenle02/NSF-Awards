9312308 Higdon The investigator develops robust spectral boundary integral
algorithms for three-dimensional transport problems in realistic geometries. Thw
metjhods combine the high-order convergence of spectral methods with the
geometric adaptability of boundary element methods. Suitability for parallel
computers is a central aspect of the project. The methods are applied to the
study of effective transport propertiues of fibrous porous media. Boundary
integral methods convert partial differential equations, which describe a
phenomenon of interest in a region, into integral equations whose solutions are
determined by certain functions on the boundary of the region. Spectral methods
break up the boundary into smaller pieces, on which the functions are
approximated by polynomials of high degree. Higher-degree polynomials
approximate the functions more accurately. The use of polynomials allows for
fast calculation of an approximate solution. For problems involving regions of
complicated geometry, combining these ideas produces a computational method of
significant flexibility and accuracy. The method is used to calculate properties
of fluid flow and transport in fibrous porous media. Such problems arise
throughout the chemical industry and in many fundamental biological contexts --
for example, in the pulp and paper industry, and in the study of fluid
circulation in plants.
