9603340 Dores This award supports the participation of American scientists in a
U.S.-Japan seminar on the Molecular Ancestry of Vertebrate Polypeptide Hormones
and Neuropeptides, to be held in Tokyo, Japan from November 23-24, 1997. The co-
organizers are Professors Robert M. Dores of the University of Denver and
Hiroshi Kawauchi of Kitasato University in Japan. This seminar will bring
together morphological, biochemical and molecular comparative fish
endocrinologists to examine the origins of endocrine mechanisms in a variety of
fish. Presentations will focus on two major endocrine systems: the
hypothalamus/pituitary axis, and the endocrine pancreas. There are several
comparative molecular endocrine laboratories active in the United States and
Japan. This seminar will bring together experts from those laboratories at a
time when new molecular techniques and large protein and gene data sets offer
potential for significant research advances. Coordination with and engagement of
the Japanese researchers will enable U.S. scientists to advance their own
efforts to better understand the endocrine system. Information from the seminar
will be disseminated through review articles to be published in the journal,
General and Comparative Endocrinology. ***
