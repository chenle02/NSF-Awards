The University of New Mexico operates the Sevilleta Field Station in central
New Mexico at a site adjacent to the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, the
Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, the Sierra Ladrones Wilderness Study
Area, and the Magdalena Mountains Research Area in the Cibola National Forest.
Habitats in these areas range from desert to montane forests, and there are
dozens of active research projects based at the Sevilleta Field Station. Among
these are many NSF-supported projects, including a Long-Term Ecological Research
Site and a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site. Dr. Clifford Crawford,
Director of the Station, proposes to install a microwave link between the
microcomputers at the Station and the computing facilities at the main campus.
He also plans to install a remote weather station with a radio link for data
transmission, and to acquire many essential pieces of laboratory and field
research equipment. The proposed additions to the Sevilleta FIeld Station will
add significantly to the Station's capacity to host diverse research projects.
This Station offers research support in a remote but unique setting, and has
demonstrated its ability to facilitate outstanding research.
