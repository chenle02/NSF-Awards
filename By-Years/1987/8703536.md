Narrative: The proposed research program seeks to conduct a systematic study of
the hydrodynamics of lifting solid particles in air drilling; the latter being
the process of making bore holes (wells) by utilizing air as the circulating
fluid for hole cleaning. Through multiphase hydrodynamic modeling, a predictive
capability would be developed which could be utilized both in the design phase
as well as the operational phase of air drilling. Numerical solutions of the
model would serve as a basis for its validation since comparison can be made
with experimental data obtained. Not only would the result of this study foster
a better understanding of the hydrodynamics of the system, but equally important
is its impact in the optimization of air drilling which could result in
substantial savings in drilling costs. Furthermore, it would reduce the
uncertainties currently involved in the air drilling design which is based on
rules-of-thumb and trial-and-error approaches. These would serve to encourage
greater utilization of this technology which would eliminate some of the
environmental problems associated with traditional drilling methods.
