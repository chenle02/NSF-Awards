The Theoretical Biology and Biomathematics Gordon Conference is unique among
conferences in theoretical biology in both its breadth and openness of exchange.
Unlike most meetings in theoretical biology, it does not concentrate on any one
theoretical technique or biological topic. The conference brings together
experimentals and theoretician from some of the most active areas of biological
research who believe that theory and mathematical modeling can make valuable
contributions toward understanding some of the basic phenomena in their
respective areas. The biological problems stem from developmental biology,
physiology, population biology and neurobiology. The kinds of mathematical
techniques that are employed include qualitative analysis and numerical
computations on systems of ordinary and partial differential equations,
classical model identification techniques, and the development of new analytical
approaches to experimental data.
