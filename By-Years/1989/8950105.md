Twenty faculty members from two-year colleges in the Gulf Coast Consortium of
Community Colleges will have an opportunity to update their knowledge and skills
through participation in a four-week workshop. Areas of biology that will be
emphasized are biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, immunology, genetics,
and physiology. These areas were identified as areas of great importance,
through a needs assessment. They are areas which have been developing rapidly in
recent years. After the four week course, follow-up seminars will occur during
the school year at Baylor and the community colleges to establish continuing
interactions and a formalized network between Baylor faculty and the two-year
college faculty. The university has requested overhead at a reduced rate.
