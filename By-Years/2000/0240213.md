In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, the PI will investigate the supramolecular dynamics of
cyclodextrins (CDxs), and the factors that control the formation and stability
of binary and ternary (1 guest: 2 host) molecular complexes. The complexes
consist of bromonaphthalene derivatives as guests and a host, which is primarily
alpha-CDx. Among other things the research will determine the binding constants
and thermodynamic quantities for formation and dissociation for the 1:1 and 1:2
ground state complexes, as well as the rate constants for formation and
dissociation. This research will be conducted in a college and will be performed
with undergraduate students.
