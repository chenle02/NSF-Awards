This basic research project utilizes the capabilities unique to thermal atomic
beam scattering(ABS)--high sensitivity to low coverage impurities and defects,
real time measurement--to obtain detailed structural information for complex
surface ordered phases without surface damage or charging effects allowing the
study of kinetic, dynamical and structural properties of epitaxy. The research
combines the ABS technique with other advanced surface science diagnostic
methods to characterize both the growth mode, and the structural and chemical
details of epitaxial crystal growth, layer by layer. %%% This research is
expected to provide deeper fundamental understanding of epitaxial crystal growth
at the atomic level. From an application point of view, understanding the
details of crystal growth at this level is particularly helpful to advanced
semiconductor device design and fabrication. The results will be of importance
in a general way to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated
electronic circuits.
