This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a
secondary electron detector which can be co-axially mounted with a micro-focused
ion beam. Backscattered neutral atoms (and ions) and secondary electrons will be
analyzed to give a measure both of surface element location and identity.

This detector will enable unique types of secondary ion mass spectrometry. The
electrons and negative backscattered ions can be energy and time analyzed to
give a spatially resolved elemental image of the surface under examination. Beam
damage is greatly reduced compared to secondary electron microscopy allowing its
use on biological samples.
