9314701 Peyghambarian The goals of this proposed program are focused toward the
investigation of novel phenomena and their applications in demonstrating new
types of optoelectronic devices, including high speed and high contrast switches
and quantum confines lasers. Specifically, the objectives are fourfold: (1)
Femtosecond pulse propagation and soliton like pulses in semiconductor laser
amplifiers. (2) Ultrafast switching in a current injected semiconductor quantum
well nonlinear directional coupler. (3) Novel quantum dot circular rating
lasers. (4) A high contrast quantum well modulator. ***
