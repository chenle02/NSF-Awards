In this collaborative project, the research team will conduct laboratory
experiments and box model simulations to study sulfur compound formation within
aerosols. There currently exist gaps in the chemical representation of sulfate
aerosol formation in models, especially during haze episodes, due to a lack of
experimental data over a range of environmental conditions. This research team
seeks to fill this gap. The knowledge gained could be used in large-scale
atmospheric chemistry models, which has the potential to positively impact air
quality management and climate change research communities. Additionally, three
graduate students will be trained during this project, and bilingual (English
and Spanish) outreach kits and videos will be developed and shared with non-
technical audiences via new and ongoing outreach activities.

The research, which represents a change to the conceptualization of sulfur
dioxide atmospheric chemistry, aims to characterize the kinetics and chemical
mechanisms for low- to high-oxidation state sulfur conversion pathways within
multiphase and aqueous aerosols. The project includes three specific
investigations: (1) the investigation of sulfate formation in aqueous aerosols
via hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, and transition metal ion oxidation
pathways under a range of pH and ionic strength conditions using an aerosol
optical tweezer-based approach; (2) an investigation of the competition between
sulfate and organosulfur formation via sulfate radical initiated formation
pathways in aqueous aerosols under different pH, temperature, and ionic strength
conditions; and (3) an investigation of sulfur dioxide chemistry within
multiphase aqueous droplets that contain reactive metal-containing inclusions
such as minerals and coal fly ash particles.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
