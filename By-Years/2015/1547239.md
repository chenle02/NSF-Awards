As new spectrum for data communication becomes available, it is increasingly
important to develop cognitive network technologies that can opportunistically
use spectrum whenever available and speak different wireless protocols on
demand. Full duplex wireless is an exciting new technology that allows a node to
send and receive simultaneously on the same spectrum. Despite significant
progress, existing work on full duplex wireless focuses on narrowband production
wireless systems, such as Wi-Fi and ZigBee. This project aims to develop novel
systems and algorithms to embrace full duplex for cognitive networks and support
different wireless technologies. The research will be integrated into
undergraduate and graduate curriculum, and disseminated broadly to researchers,
practitioners policy makers, high school students, parents, and
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops techniques that (i) go
beyond narrowband and use novel cancellation mechanisms to enable transmit-
while-sensing on a wider band spectrum, (ii) support cross technologies that
transmit Wi-Fi while receiving LTE and vice versa, and (iii) translate physical
layer advances to end-to-end performance benefits by re-visiting upper-layer
protocol design. These three thrusts will enable a holistic full duplex
cognitive radio platform.
