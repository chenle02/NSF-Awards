ABSTRACT The research will involve one six-week trip to the Coeur d'Alene
Reservation in northern Idaho, where the student researcher will conduct
linguistic field work focusing on grammatical relations in Coeur d'Alene Salish,
a North American Indian language. Grammatical relations (subject, object) are
indicated as elements of both word formation and sentence structure; their roles
are dependent on factors of control and transitivity inherent in the root, and
transitivity and incorporation indicated in the word stem; and the relations are
often interpretable only with an understanding of discourse structure. This
investigation will contribute to the completion of the student's University of
Texas doctoral dissertation in linguistics. The study will add significantly to
the limited body of descriptive information available on Coeur d'Alene and to
the understanding of the morphology and syntax of Interior Salishan languages in
general, and will eventually serve as a basis for comparative Salish syntax
studies. Major topics will include the morphological and syntactic structures
used to indicate grammatical relations; the function of (preposition)
incorporation and lexical suffixation to alter or specify grammatical relations;
the use of clitics and adjuncts to cross- reference relations indicated by
subject and object pronouns on the stem; and the roles of these relations in
syntax and discourse.
