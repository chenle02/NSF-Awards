The 17th Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Embedded
Networked Sensor Systems (ACM SenSys 2019) is a premier symposium with a highly
selective single-track technical program dedicated to systems issues of
networked sensing and actuation, broadly defined. Systems of smart sensors and
actuators have a wide array of application areas such as cyber-physical systems,
vehicular networks, and smart grid. This award supports graduate and
undergraduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this
conference but have limited foreign travel funds. Priority will be given to
students from under-represented groups (women, minorities, and those with
disabilities), authors without other funding, and first-time attendees. The
students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art developments in the field and
will have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide,
participate in a mentoring event, meet with leading researchers, and participate
in discussions that are likely to shape their future and that of the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
