Analytical and numerical research will be undertaken on quantum coherence,
charge fluctuation and transport phenomena in mesoscopic structures. The initial
focus of this research will be on a comprehensive theory of mesoscopic
persistent currents in isolated rings, macroscopic quantum tunneling in
ultranarrow wires, and related static and dynamic mesoscopic phenomena. The goal
of this work is the elucidation of the unusual quantum coherence and statistical
mechanical effects that occur in the electronic, thermal and mechanical
properties of submicrometer-sized structures. Crossover phenomena that occur in
nanometer-scale superconducting rings and wires will also be studies. %%%
Mesoscopic physics occurs at the boundary between the classical and quantum
regimes. For instance, as the size of an electronic device decreases, a region
will be reached where the classical or semi- classical description which modeled
the behavior of the device will no longer apply. Quantum effects come into play.
Clearly, an understanding of these effects has an important impact on solid
state electronics as the size of devices continues to decrease. On the other
hand, these mesoscopic effects reveal fundamental properties of condensed matter
systems and can themselves be used as bases for devices.
