Fossil bones of primates, including the remains of several species that are
closely related to the human lineage, have been recovered from a number of sites
in South Africa. Fossils such as these, however, are very poorly known from
other areas of southern Africa (e.g., Botswana, Angola, and Namibia). Almost all
the fossils from these sites accumulated in karst caves that had formed in the
limestones that outcrop in South Africa, Botswana, Angola and Namibia. These
limestone caves have yielded only a few fossilized primate bones. However, there
are a number of very old volcanic intrusives in Namibi, and the chemical
composition of these rocks makes them equally susceptible to cave formation
through water dissolution. Eleven carbonatite intrusives have been identified
throughout Namibia. Fossils dating from about 100 thousand to some 2.5 million
years ago have been discovered in two karst cave systems that formed in one of
these intrusives. This project will explore the remaining ten carbonatites in
Namibia to determine whether they also contain fossiliferous cave sediments of
Cenozoic age. In particular, it is hoped that additional sites that may contain
fossil primate bones will be identified by this survey. Any such fossils will
add significantly to our understanding of primate evolution and paleoecology in
Africa.
