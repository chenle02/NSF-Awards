Intersubband transitions in III-nitride multiple quantum dots will be
investigated for their applications in the infrared spectral region. The
polarization effect on the intersubband transitions measured at the normal
incident, Brewster's angle, and waveguide configurations is an essential part of
the current study. This will be important for optimizing the growth conditions
and the sample design for normal incident coupling of photon-electron in
advancing the sate of the art of infrared detectors. The normal incident
coupling of photons with electrons that undergo the intersubband transition will
eliminate the need for the extra steps of fabricating metal grating at the top
of the device structure. Infrared devices based on intersubband transitions are
extrinsic, i.e. the quantum structure has to be doped to populate the wells.
Doping the quantum dots with silicon will be investigated using the local
vibrational mode spectroscopy. One of the major parts of the PIs proposed
research is directed toward solving various issues associated with the growth
optimization and doping level. Since GaN-on-AlGaN interface possesses a large
piezoelectric effect, the polarization-induced charges at the interfaces will be
investigated. From the total integrated area of the intersubband transitions in
the multiple quantum dots, he will accurately determine the carriers density,
which is the sum of the carriers contributed from the intentionally Si-doped
material and the polarization-induced charges formed at the GaN/AlGaN
interfaces. The broader impact of the proposed research is to explore the
infrared applications of III-nitride quantum structures and integrate the
infrared detectors fabricated from these structures into pre-existing GaN
ultraviolet sensors. The intersubband transitions in the multiple quantum dots
will also be investigated for the 1.3-1.5 mm spectral range. This spectral range
is technologically very important for long distance optical communication
systems.
