This research is about how to gain higher confidence and better understanding of
atomistic processes via simulation with the lack of perfect knowledge about
physical systems, and how to improve the robustness of simulation prediction.
The approach of this research will be rigorous and efficient quantification of
input uncertainty associated with simulation models and its effects. The
investigation will include new mechanisms that perform molecular dynamics
simulation with incomplete knowledge of the system's states, kinetic Monte Carlo
simulation with imprecise reaction and transition rates, first-principles
reliable kinetic Monte Carlo simulation under uncertainties, as well as model
calibration and validation with the incorporation of model errors and
measurement errors.

If successful, the benefits of this research will include an efficient
computational approach to enable rational design of clean and safe nanoscale
products and materials (e.g. drugs, catalysts, fuel cells) in an affordable way
to improve people's daily lives, enhanced computational infrastructure across
disciplines to facilitate simulation-based scientific discovery and scalable
nanomaterials production, publicly available open-source software for research
and as an education tool for engineers and scientists, as well as course modules
for teachers and 8th grade students on nanoscale engineering.
