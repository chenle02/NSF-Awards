This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will measure nutrients and chemical tracers including dissolved
oxygen, carbon dioxide, anthropogenic halocarbons (freons) and natural
radionuclides. These measurements will permit characterization of key aspects of
the physical, biological and chemical oceanography of the polynya and serve as
important collaborative input to the NEW Program.
