Narrative: This proposal targets the important problem of converting
lignocellulosic substrates to liquid fuel, namely ethanol. In addition, the
sugar solution resulting from enzyme hydrolysis can be used as a general
fermentation substrate. An attempt will be made to quantify the kinetics of the
enzymatic hydrolysis of thermo-chemically pretreated lignocellulosic material.
In particular, the work will relate the physical and chemical effects of the
"steam-explosion" pretreatment to the kinetics of the subsequent hydrolysis of
woody biomass. Area and pore volume available to enzyme action, degree of
polymerization, crystallinity index, and lignin content and morphological state
will be measured in order to characterize the substrate. These variables, as
well as the enzyme concentration and activity and product concentration, are to
be followed throughout the hydrolysis reaction. Fundamental studies of this kind
will help to lay a basis for the development of new processes for enzymatically
converting insoluble lignocellulosic substrates to more valuable products, and
to provide a better understanding of heterogeneous enzyme kinetics in general.
The resulting mathematical models will be sensitive to process behavior and
therefore be valuable in the design and development of efficient, economical
production of useful products via enzymatic hydrolysis of insoluble
lignocellulosic substrates.
