The objectives of this research are: (1) to study the fluid mechanics and
acoustical nature of gas dispersion in agitated tanks using hydrophones to
record sound spectra; and (2) to determine the relationship between the mass
transfer coefficient, kla, and the sound spectra signatures of the gas
dispersion. Further, the actual mechanism of sound production and effects of
scale, impeller geometry and distributor geometry will be investigated and
related to the gas dispersion mechanics. Standard techniques will be used in the
work to obtain the sound spectra and kla data. The research is to develop an
online measurement technique to monitor and optimize mass transfer in aerated,
agitated tanks.
