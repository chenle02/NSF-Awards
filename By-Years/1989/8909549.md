Highly mathematical analyses of questions in the physics of elementary
particles will be carried out. These will include studies pertinent to the
string theories of these particles. These theories are presently being
vigorously pursued as a promising way to unify our description of all the
forces, including gravity. However, these theories are very mathematical in
nature, and highly mathematical analyses of their underpinnings are important
for progress.
