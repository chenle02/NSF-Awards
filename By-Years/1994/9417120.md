9417120 Campos The OCHNET/NSFNET Connection project will integrate the existing
network at Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation (AOMF) with the NSFNET. This
integration will provide access to national databases for all the components of
the Divisions of Education and Research. This connection will also nourish peer
communication and data exchange with external collaborators. Immediate benefits
will include access to bibliographic databases and electronic mail for the
Division of Education, which encompasses the Medical Library, Graduate Medical
Education, Continuing Medical Education, the School of Allied Health Sciences,
Medical Editing, Audio Visual Services and Medical Editing. It will also provide
access to nucleic acid and protein sequence databases and large-scale data
exchanges with collaborators which will enhance the Division of Research's
activities.
