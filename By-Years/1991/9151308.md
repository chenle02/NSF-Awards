A laboratory course in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology offers a hands-on
experience of the current experimental techniques available for the detection,
isolation, manipulation, and analysis of proteins and nucleic acids. A
chromatography refrigerator, fraction collector, and peristaltic pump are used
for protein purification; a thermocycler is used for amplifying specific DNA
sequences via the polymerase chain reaction; and a roller apparatus is used for
bacterial culture. The laboratory is also equipped with horizontal and vertical
gel electrophoresis units and power supplies; orbital platform shakers and
rockers, gel dryer, and electroblotting apparatus for gel transfer;
microcentrifuges; and a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The equipment is also employed
in select molecular-based experiments of the genetics, cell biology,
microbiology, physiology, and developmental biology courses, and greatly expand
the opportunities currently available for undergraduate student research
projects in all areas of biology and chemistry that require analysis of proteins
or nucleic acids.
