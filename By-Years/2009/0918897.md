nongrowing "persister" state that allows them to survive antibiotics and other
treatments that normally kill them. By suspending growth, they may also free
resources for their genetically identical clonemates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most
species form only a few persisters. This makes persisters hard to study, despite
their importance in long-term infections. However, certain harmless bacteria
from plant roots can form up to 40% persisters. These will be used to determine
whether persisters benefit mainly from enhanced stress resistance or by
increasing the growth of their clonemates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful
completion of this research will provide two main benefits: First, this research
will determine the conditions that favor the spread of persister-forming
bacterial strains over nonpersister strains, and the genetic basis of
persistence. This can provide direct medical benefits by aiding the development
of novel management strategies, drug targets, and eventually treatments for
patients infected with persister-forming bacteria. Second, some conclusions may
apply to other species that are difficult to eradicate because they, too, form
dormant, stress-resistant stages. These include many agricultural weeds and some
species of mosquito. One key advantage of the proposed approach is speed:
experiments that would take decades with weeds or mosquitoes can be conducted in
months with bacteria. This research will provide training opportunities and jobs
for undergraduates, high school students, and a post doctoral
researcher.&lt;br/&gt;
