Goals of the East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS): The ECOAS
conference series has several objectives. One is to help young researchers in
the area of operator algebras broaden their acquaintance with the field. Another
is to help acquaint them with senior researchers in operator algebra theory
(among them possible future colleagues, mentors and collaborators). With these
goals in mind, the ECOAS series places a heavy emphasis on attracting young
researchers to the meetings and giving them opportunities to present their work
and otherwise interact with established figures. In the conferences in the
series so far, over half of the participants and a substantial number of the
speakers have been students or postdoctoral fellows. The ECOAS meetings give all
participants, senior and junior, the opportunity to learn first-hand the work of
others. Because of the breadth of operator algebra theory, this is an important
function. To ensure participants can acquaint themselves with work outside their
immediate areas of specialization, the meetings are organized with no parallel
sessions. To fit the meetings into a weekend format, to keep the quality of
talks high, and to allow time for discussions, at most a dozen talks are
scheduled per meeting.

The meetings give young researchers the chance to meet senior researchers. The
relatively modest scale of the meetings (compared to national or international
meetings, for example) allows them to network with senior researchers and with
one another, thereby helping foster future collaborations and providing the sort
of exposure that is often crucial to a successful job search. Thus the
conference plays an important role in helping young researchers establish
themselves in the field.
