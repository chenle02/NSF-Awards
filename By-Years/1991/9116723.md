Developments in manufacturing technology now enable specialized industries such
as shipbuilding to adopt Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) to realize
lower production costs by integrated control of the material procurement, work
flow, scheduling and assembly process. Reflecting on the small differential
presently found in the United States versus overseas labor costs, these CIM
gains could capture an international market niche for the United States
shipyards. To develop a basis for introducing CIM. This one and half day
workshop will discuss both practical problems and a research agenda for the
industry.
