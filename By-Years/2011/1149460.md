The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program award is
to provide an approach for assessing the economic, environmental, and social
sustainability and reliability of interdependent power and water systems. This
is intended to better support proactive management of public and private
infrastructure, particularly in areas susceptible to natural hazards such as
hurricanes and earthquakes. The research develops indicators for measuring
trends in the sustainability of power and water systems, providing a basis for
changing the management and funding of these systems to improve their
sustainability. The project also provides new computational frameworks for
modeling interdependent power and water systems. The impacts of natural hazards
such as hurricanes and earthquakes will be combined with the effects of aging to
develop a more holistic reliability modeling approach for infrastructure
systems. The reliability and sustainability models are brought into the
infrastructure management process to help support meaningful change in power and
water systems in hazard-prone areas.

If successful, this work will contribute to the development of improved methods
for assessing and managing aging infrastructure systems in the US. These
improved methods would allow limited public and private funds to be used more
efficiently to improve infrastructure systems before they fail rather than
relying on a reactive approach of repairing failures after they occur. This
project will also develop a series of on-line and classroom teaching materials
for middle school, high school, college, graduate school, and professional
education. These materials will help to further establish a pipeline of students
who are interested and educated in infrastructure engineering.
