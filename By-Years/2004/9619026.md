9619026 Lanza In each of three years, the Arkansas-STRIVE Teacher Enhancement
Program places fifty 7-12 grade mathematics, science, and computer teachers into
on-going research programs at universities, national laboratories, national
forests and other research institutions for 8-weeks during the summer. To
facilitate transfer to the classroom teachers are expected to develop three
Lesson Plans, to be used in the Fall semester, based on the STRIVE experience.
This is complemented by "Knowledge Transfer" meetings where they study
curriculum change for local schools and develop a STRIVE Team Curriculum Change
Report for their principal. Additional follow-up to facilitate transfer of the
research experience to the classroom is done through a 1-day STRIVE alumni
workshop and participation in 4-mini-workshops. The Arkansas-STRIVE program is a
collaboration among Arkansas business and industry, the University of Arkansas-
Little Rock, the Arkansas SSI, and the Arkansas Department of Higher Education.
