EIA- 0205111&lt;br/&gt;Eduard Hovy&lt;br/&gt; Information Sciences Institute,
USC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will explore the automated construction of
domain ontologies across governmental datasets. There are many "data silos" in
government; that is, collections of data which cannot be cross-compared or
queried. This is a major problem in presenting government information to
consumers which is tailored according to their interests, rather than according
to the organizational structure of government agencies. While such automated
tools cannot completely construct accurate ontologies, they can take much of the
labor intensiveness out of such efforts, particularly where the number of terms
or variables is so large (in the thousands) as to prevent manual efforts.
Working with the US Environmental Protection Agency, which has many datasets of
interest to the public, the research team will develop a semi-automated toolkit
to aid in the construction of ontologies.&lt;br/&gt;
