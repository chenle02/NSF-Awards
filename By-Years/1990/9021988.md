The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) has made a conscious
decision to be a major producer of minority scientists, mathematician, and
engineers. It's successful Meyerhoff Scholarship Program, initiated in 1988, is
designed to facilitate the recruitment of minority scholars into these fields.
NSF support is requested to expand and enhance current efforts. Five groups of
twenty- five outstanding African-American scholars would be financially and
academically supported, through the bachelors degree, with the understanding
that they will continue on to a graduate or professional degree. Each student
will receive strong academic enrichment and support beginning with a summer
bridge program prior entrance into the University. A UMBC faculty member will
work with the student on a significant research project and they will be
assigned a practicing scientist or engineering professional as a mentor. UMBC
has received individual and corporate support for this program and is committed
to continuing its efforts. These students will form a cadre of talented
professionals who will move into leadership roles in their chosen fields. They
will also provide an additional group of mentor/role models to succeeding
classes of Scholars.
