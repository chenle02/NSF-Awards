Chemistry is the foundation for understanding the evolution and spectral
appearance of any given astronomical object. Spectroscopic observations probe
the chemistry, and in order to interpret such observations, it is crucial to
know how the chemistry operates. In the cool atmospheres of low-mass stars and
brown dwarfs, molecular and cloud condensation chemistry is of particular
importance as it determines the major outcome of photometric and spectroscopic
observations. In this project, the investigators are determining the gas and
cloud condensation chemistry in cool dwarf star atmospheres as a function of
temperature, total pressure, and metallicity. Chemical equilibrium depends only
on pressure, temperature, and composition. Thus a grid of equilibrium abundances
can be calculated independently from any particular atmospheric model. On the
other hand, atmospheric and spectral models require reliable input chemistry.
Hence the second major objective is to provide a reliable abundance grid of
gaseous, liquid, and solid compounds derived from thermochemical equilibrium,
and, where necessary, thermochemical kinetic computations. The work is essential
to address key questions about low-mass objects, including the following: What
are the effective temperature scales of L and T dwarfs? What are their
atmospheric compositions? How common are departures from chemical equilibrium
due to vertical transport processes? How do clouds and 'weather' affect the
spectra of brown dwarfs? A natural extension is to apply the chemistry to
generate new atmospheric models and high-resolution synthetic spectra of low-
mass objects to determine spectral diagnostics of effective temperature,
gravity, and composition as functions of mass and age.

Broader Impacts. The work is complementary to observational studies of low-mass
objects and provides a guide to interpret future observations from a wide
variety of instruments from ground-based observatories. Future results will be
described in scientific papers, in talks at professional meetings, and in public
lectures. The long standing experience of the investigators with thermochemical
and kinetic atmospheric modeling in planetary science benefits the existing
interdisciplinary collaboration with other research groups working on spectral
models. Undergraduate student participation, already ongoing, is being extended
to the current work.
