This research will examine associations between communication signals and
cognitive ability in two species of songbirds. Song in these species is learned:
males memorize external models early in life, and then use these memories to
shape their own production when they begin to sing many months later. Because
song development involves learning and memory, it is logical to hypothesize an
association between song and other aspects of cognition. To test that
hypothesis, cognitive ability will be measured in a series of laboratory tasks,
for example a novel motor task, in which subjects learn to remove lids from the
wells of a foraging grid to obtain food, a color association task, in which
subjects learn to associate food with lids of a particular color, and a spatial
task, in which subjects learn that food can be found only in certain locations.
These cognitive measures will then be related to aspects of song that are the
outcome of learning, such as the accuracy with which song models are copied
during development and the frequency of sharing of song types with others in the
local population. Vocal learning in songbirds shows a series of striking
parallels with speech development in humans, and therefore results on the tie
between vocal development and cognition in songbirds will have implications for
the relationship between cognition and speech in humans. Results from the study
will be disseminated not only in scientific outlets but also in workshops for
high school biology teachers designed to demonstrate how the study of animal
behavior can be used to teach the scientific method.
