Much of modern probability research seeks to understand the behavior of large
and complex random systems (for instance, growth in disordered media, cracking,
turbulent fluids, or traffic flow) with an aim towards developing theories with
predictive and statistical value. While one can try to directly model such
systems on computers, their size and complexity often render such attempts
fruitless. Instead, one can look for models of such systems that are complex
enough to display all of the phenomena under study, yet simple enough to admit
exact mathematical computation to probe that behavior. Integrable probability is
the theory behind discovering and subsequently analyzing such models. This
project seeks to unify the area and various recent breakthroughs and in so doing
discover a host of new types of integrable probability systems, new tools for
their analysis, and new large-scale universal phenomena.

Integrable probability is an area of research at the interface between
probability, mathematical physics, and statistical physics on the one hand, and
representation theory and integrable systems on the other. Integrable
probabilistic systems are characterized by two properties: It is possible to
write down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of
interesting observables of the systems; and asymptotics of the systems,
observables, and formulas provide access to exact descriptions of new phenomena
and universality classes (containing more than just integrable examples). The
discovery and analysis of integrable probabilistic systems hinges upon
underlying algebraic structure. These integrable probabilistic systems can be
viewed as projections of powerful objects whose origins lie in representation
theory and integrable systems. There is a rich history of major breakthroughs in
the study of integrable probabilistic systems, including the six-vertex model,
Ising model, and more recently certain models in the KPZ universality class. The
basic mechanisms at the heart of many of these existing results are Schur /
Macdonald processes (built off the structure of symmetric polynomials) and
quantum integrable systems (built off solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation and
the Bethe ansatz). Each mechanism has produced breakthrough results, such as the
recent resolution of the 25-year-old physics conjecture that the KPZ stochastic
partial differential equation is in the KPZ universality class. Until recently,
these two routes to integrable probability have existed relatively separately.
The goal of the proposed project is to create a unified theory of integrable
probability, combining and generalizing the methods of Schur / Macdonald
processes and quantum integrable systems and, complementarily, extracting new
analyzable models and uncovering new probabilistic or physical phenomena.
