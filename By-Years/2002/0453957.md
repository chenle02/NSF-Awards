In previous work, the principal investigator constructed a highly nontrivial
filtration of the knot concordance group, indexed by the height of gropes
embedded in the 4-ball, and partially detected by von Neumann's continuous
dimension. The resulting graded group remains unknown, and the principal
investigator proposes various approaches to uncover the structure of this group.
Related questions about link concordance and embedding problems of 2-spheres
into 4-manifolds can also be studied by these methods. In the second part of the
project, the principal investigator is attempting to give a geometric definition
of elliptic cohomology in terms of a modification of Segal's "elliptic objects".
These are conformal field theories parametrized by a topological space X, in
particular to each circle in X they associate a Hilbert space. For more than 15
years, Segal's approach could not be turned into a cohomology theory because of
the failure of the Mayer-Vietoris principle. The new idea is to apply the fusion
of bimodules of von Neumann algebras, developed by Connes, to make the conformal
field theory "local in X". Fusion is used to decompose the Hilbert space
whenever the corresponding circle in X is decomposed. Such a local theory should
then satisfy all the axioms of a cohomology theory.

Both parts of the project relate notions from theoretical physics to
mathematics. Historically, the converse relation was more common, where a
mathematical notion (like Riemannian geometry or functional analysis) was used
to explain a physical theory (like relativity or quantum mechanics). In the last
decades, surprising mathematical predictions (provable only in very rare cases)
came out of considerations in theoretical physics (like quantum gravity or
conformal field theory). It is thus of the ultimate importance for mathematical
research to incorporate such considerations into the body of well understood
theories. In the first part of this project, the principal investigator proposes
to continue his successful study of 4-dimensional manifolds (most relevant in
relativity) via techniques originally proposed by von Neumann for the study of
quantum mechanics. In the second part, the principal investigator proposes to
refine the notion of a conformal field theory so that it leads to a geometrical
definition of "elliptic cohomology". This cohomology is an enormously successful
tool in mathematics and the proposed refinement has the potential to lead to a
topological understanding of all conformal field theories.
