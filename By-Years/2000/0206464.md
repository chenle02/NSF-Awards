DMS-0206464&lt;br/&gt;Walter Neuman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of this
project concerns a continuation of the investigator's&lt;br/&gt;successful
application of topological methods to the study of&lt;br/&gt;singularities of
complex surfaces and the topology of plane affine&lt;br/&gt;curves. One issue to
be addressed is explicit analytic description of&lt;br/&gt;singularities with
given topology. The general question is notoriously&lt;br/&gt;difficult, but the
investigator and J. Wahl have identified a&lt;br/&gt;remarkably broad class of
topologies where significant advance can be&lt;br/&gt;made. Another issue is the
study of the global topology of&lt;br/&gt;two-variable polynomials, as well as
classification issues, which are&lt;br/&gt;both of intrinsic interest and also
have potential to contribute&lt;br/&gt;to the resolution of the famous Jacobian
Conjecture. A significant&lt;br/&gt;tool in this work are the splice diagrams of
Eisenbud and the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and a recent generalization of them. In
a rather&lt;br/&gt;different direction, the investigator will study invariants
of&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional manifolds that relate to number theory and
algebra,&lt;br/&gt;namely the so-called character and eigenvalue varieties and
the Bloch&lt;br/&gt;invariant. Connections are emerging between these invariants
that will&lt;br/&gt;inform both topology and algebra/number
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Geometry, which is essentially the study
of the zero sets of&lt;br/&gt;families of polynomials, has always been an
important area of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental research, and is also important in such
diverse&lt;br/&gt;applications as control theory and communications. Such zero-
sets&lt;br/&gt;arise, for instance, as the parameter spaces of processes and
the&lt;br/&gt;control spaces of automata. The singularities (places where the
nature&lt;br/&gt;of the topology changes), are of fundamental significance.
This&lt;br/&gt;project has two thrusts: to understand better the link between
the&lt;br/&gt;analytic description and the topology of singularities, and
to&lt;br/&gt;investigate invariants of low dimensional manifolds that link
topology&lt;br/&gt;with other fields.&lt;br/&gt;
