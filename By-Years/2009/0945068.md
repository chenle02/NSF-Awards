This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
ceria nano-particle coatings on bioactive glass for bone regeneration. The
approach is to combine the two different classes of inorganic bioactive
materials to obtain a new generation of synthetic bone regenerative materials.
This new material will have the capacity, through engineered nanoparticles and
tailored kinetic release of specific ions, to stimulate early angiogenesis and
provide an ideal scaffold for cell recruitment and proliferation, thereby
accelerate the repair process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial
impact of this project will be the potential to address the growing need for
better solutions of bone regeneration, given the fact that over 10 million
Americans have osteoporosis. By developing inorganic materials with specific
ionic release and strong anti-oxidative properties, this project is expected to
address the demand for adequate bone graft materials to be used throughout the
body and achieve the bone regeneration. &lt;br/&gt;
