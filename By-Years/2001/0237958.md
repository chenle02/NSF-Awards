This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and
validate the predictive capability industry needs to dramatically improve
machined workpiece quality by controlling machining induced stresses while
simultaneously reducing distortion in aerospace and automotive parts. The
objective for Phase II will be to continue the development and verification of
analysis tools for predicting residual stress and part distortion. The goal is
to supply industry with a validated analytical tool to easily and economically
predict and prevent part distortion-reducing costs due to testing trials, part
scrap, and time-to-market, increasing product quality and competitiveness.

The commercial and broader impacts of this technology will be provide industry
with the ability to predict and prevent part distortion due to machining induced
residual stress. Current techniques, which rely upon testing, and experience are
not sufficient technically nor are they cost effective. Aerospace parts (large,
monolithic, thin-walled, and expensive) and critical automotive powertrain
applications, which demand flat surfaces to maintain fuel efficiency, component
life, and lower emissions, are typical examples. A significant impact will be to
manufacturing costs, lower scrap material, higher productivity, lower time-to-
market, and increased product quality and performance.
