The topology of simply-connected algebraic surfaces and other smooth
4-manifolds will be studied. Questions such as the following will be addressed:
How do algebraic surfaces behave under connected sum? Which 4-manifolds are sums
of algebraic surfaces? How can Donaldson's invariants be defined topologically?
Algebraic surfaces are defined by polynomial equations, the most elemetary
equations one could use. That very natural and easily formulated questions about
such surfaces still remain unanswered stands as a challenge and almost a rebuke
to the field of topology.
