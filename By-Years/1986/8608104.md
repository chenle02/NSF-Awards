Many projects currently funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) pertain
to the investigation and modeling of phenomena associated with groundwater
systems. The proposed forum of NSF grantees will give NSF officials a clearer
and more comprehensive view of on-going research which is needed for the
evaluation of proposals, and also will help the agency to be more responsive to
research needs. A consensus on future directions and priorities in scientific
and engineering research in subsurface system will be developed. Approximately
25 participants will attend the forum to be held at the University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, MI, on July 24-25, 1986.
