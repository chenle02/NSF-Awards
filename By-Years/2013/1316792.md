This award funds the research activities of Professors Kev Abazajian, Mu-Chun
Chen, Jonathan Feng, Manoj Kaplinghat, Arvind Rajaraman, Yuri Shirman, and Tim
Tait at the University of California, Irvine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the
discovery of a Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the
recent wealth of cosmological results, this is an exciting time in particle
physics and cosmology. Data from the LHC and other particle physics experiments
are deepening our understanding of the fundamental interactions and probing the
weak scale with unprecedented detail. At the same time, outstanding questions in
astrophysics and cosmology also guide theoretical work on physics beyond the so-
called "Standard Model", and the interaction of cosmology and particle physics
in recent years has been fruitful. The research plan of these researchers
exploits innovative ideas in both particle physics and cosmology in order to
address outstanding problems in a wide variety of fields, including
supersymmetry, extra dimensions, collider phenomenology, neutrino physics, grand
unified theories, dark matter, and particle cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of the group's activities are directed towards increasing public
interest in and improving public understanding of the exciting results of
particle physics. These include public talks and outreach activities, the
training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students both at UC Irvine and
around the world, and significant contributions in the area of professional
service.
