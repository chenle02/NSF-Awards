The influence that computers have on our daily lives is enabled by efficient
algorithms. A vast body of research is devoted to algorithmic design, but we
still cannot solve most of the important computational problems that arise in
science and engineering. This is captured by the famous P vs NP problem in
computational complexity, which is the most important mathematical problem of
our times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI describes a plan to
address some of the challenges of computational complexity by exploring deep
mathematical questions about algebraic and combinatorial structures and their
applications to fundamental problems in computer science. Specifically, the
focus of this proposal is on two mathematical themes: (1) low rank and
combinatorial structure in matrices and (2) structure of low-degree polynomials.
The unified view of the common mathematical framework allows us to relate
techniques, results and problems between seemingly unrelated fields in computer
science, such as: algorithm design, communication protocols, error correcting
codes, de-randomization, and computational lower bounds. This research is also
tightly related to some fundamental problems in mathematics, in particular in
combinatorics and number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to organize
interdisciplinary workshops that will bring together researchers in complexity
theory and other disciplines in order to learn and collaborate. The educational
plans are integrated with the research and include undergraduate and graduate
course development, experimentation with innovative instructional approaches, in
particular the flipped classroom, mentoring of students, and outreach to engage
pre-college students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.
