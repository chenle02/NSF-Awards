This award will provide partial support for the publication of the proceedings
of the 4th International Accelerator School; Hilton Head Island; South Carolina;
November 7-14, 1990. The school is jointly organized by the U.S. Particle
Accelerator School, office at Fermilab and the CERN Accelerator School,
headquartered at CERN; Switzerland. The school will be hosted by the
Southeastern Universities Research Association, Continuous Electron Beam
Accelerator Facility. The 4th International School in the series of "Frontiers
of Particle Beams," will be on the subject of "Beam Intensity Limitations," a
very important concept which has to be taken into account in the design of a
given particle accelerator facility. The school provides a source of current
knowledge on particle accelerators and helps build up particle accelerator
expertise as well as fosters international collaboration on accelerator
education. The school is intended for individuals with professional interests in
accelerator physics and technology, for graduate students, for post doctoral
research scientists and for those working in accelerator-based sciences.
