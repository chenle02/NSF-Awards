9602222 Sussman This award provides additional support for a multidisciplinary
training research training program focused on molecular analysis of signal
transduction in higher plants. The effort was initiated with an award through a
competition sponsored jointly by DOE, NSF, and USDA in 1992. The program
represents a joint effort of twelve faculty that use genetic,
electrophysiological, biochemical and biophysical approaches to elucidate the
mechanisms of the initial events in signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Training is provided at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels.
Creation of the program has resulted in several new courses and a new, weekly
research meeting that all trainees and faculty are expected to attend. The
program has helped its trainees take a more interdisciplinary and integrated
approach towards a research career in plant biology.
