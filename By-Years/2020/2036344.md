The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be to provide a solution for the students and schools with an
urgent need for a remote learning solution. An estimated 85% of families on
rural Native American reservations do not have high-speed internet access. The
need for a remote learning solution is especially pressing given the COVID-19
pandemic which is requiring many schools to implement online or hybrid learning
models. If students are not able to participate in these new models, it is
likely that they will have substantially lower achievement levels than their
peers who do have access to remote learning. The proposed project advances a
technology to enable online learning without access to high-speed
internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will advance a new system to support digital learning with lower
access to high-speed internet. First, this project will explore edge computing
in innovation by building a new learning management system that has intelligent
edge nodes capable of providing a complete student learning experience without
access to a central server. Second, it will improve pedagogical approaches in
this environment, supporting digital learning across limited or no access
modalities, including print-to-digital workflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
