Dinoflagellates are a common and important group of single- celled organisms.
They are both free-living and symbiotic with a diversity of other organisms. The
symbiotic forms have evolved several distinct functional relationships within
their hosts, and this has led to differences of opinion concerning their
evolutionary relationships, and their origin (or origins) from other single-
celled eucaryotic groups. Drs. Clifford Brunk and David Chapman propose to
obtain RNA sequence data from the appropriate species, providing a powerful data
set from which to infer evolutionary relationships. The evolutionary tree based
on the new sequence data will be compared with the trees based on biochemical
and morphological data. The proposed research will have wide impact beyond the
community of dinoflagellate specialists. This project focuses on some of the
earliest branches in the tree of life, and the results will provide
microbiologists, microbial ecologists, and marine biologists with a framework
for studying diverse phenomena. The results will also break new ground in the
use of molecular data from micro-organisms, and will provide new insight into
the evolution of symbiosis.
