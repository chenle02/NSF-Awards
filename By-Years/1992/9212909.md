This equipment grant will be used for acquisition of a high- speed data
acquisition and analysis system which will be used with an existing five
nanosecond pulse-width laser for combustion studies. The system will allow for
acquisition of sufficient data over the 5 nanosecond pulse width of an existing
degenerate four-wave mixing laser combustion diagnostic to determine the
temporal response of the system. In addition to acquiring the data, this system
will process the information to provide a real-time measure of the performance
of the combustion diagnostic system. In its initial application, this data
acquisition system will be integrated into an in-situ pulse laser based
diagnostic for measurement of hydroperoxy radicals generated during the
combustion of hydrocarbons. This technique utilizes degenerate four-wave mixing
of a low-lying absorption band of HO2 which is unique to that molecule, not
having the spectroscopic interference problems associated with other absorption
bands of this molecule in the fingerprint region of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Successful completion of this research program will provide a new
diagnostic tool to probe hydrocarbon oxidation and provide new insight into the
chemistry which limits efficiency and controls emissions from hydrocarbon
combustion systems.
