This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Thirteenth East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium" that will be held on October
3 and 4, 2015, on the campus of the University of Iowa.

This conference is the thirteenth installment of the East Coast Operator Algebra
Symposium (ECOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of
mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator
algebras. The main foci of the 2015 event are the following: the Elliott
classification program for C*-algebras; Popa's deformation/rigidity program;
subfactor theory; C*-algebras and dynamical systems. The conference program
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work.
