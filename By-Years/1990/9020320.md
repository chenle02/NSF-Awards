This project is an investigation of several effects on drop coalescence in
stirred liquid-liquid dispersions which may be used effectively to control drop
populations. Thus the effect of surface charge on droplets and its manipulation
by various means on coalescence phenomena is investigated experimentally and
theoretically. The manipulation of surface charge effects are accomplished by
addition of electrolytes and surfactants, and by varying the pH of the medium.
The effect of turbulence intensity on drop coalescence is investigated as a
method to control drop sizes by energy input to the dispersion. Since most
industrial liquid-liquid contacting operations involve high dispersed phase
fractions, the project investigates dense dispersions by exploiting self-similar
behavior and scaling properties. The approach presented in this work is unique
in that information will be obtained at the individual droplet level so that
coalescence rates are obtained as functions of drop sizes in addition to their
dependence on other physical parameters. The effects proposed for study in this
work are either completely unknown or are at best ambiguous as obtained from
studies insensitive to drop size distributions. It is important to understand
the foregoing effects in order to control dispersed phase systems so that
contacting operations can be performed optimally with respect to conversion and
selectivity.
