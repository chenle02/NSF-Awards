Kennedy will study itinerant fermion and quantum spin systems. The nature of
the ground state of one of the simplest itinerant fermion systems will be
studied in detail. In particular he will investigate whether there is a
3-dimensional analog of the recent 2-dimensional result that for the neutral
model in a certain range of densities the ions are always arranged in diagonal
lines. He will also study the localization problem for a system of particles
moving in a random potential. Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity,
is a product of the twentieth century. It is founded firmly in the last
century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter and to come to grips
with the concepts of action-at-a distance, electro-magnetism, and heat
radiation. The mathematical foundations for these developments, collectively
called mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of Schroedinger
operators, which governs the dynamics of particles, to unified field theory,
which attempts to unite the four known forces into a single theory.
