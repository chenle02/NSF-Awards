This is an award to support research on a concept for removing organic
contaminants from soil using microorganisms with natural ability to attack the
organic compounds adsorbed on soil particles and to determine whether biological
degradation could be enhanced by presence of surfactants. The investigator plans
on establishing a defined model system consisting of a naphthalene saturated
soil and an organism known to efficiently degrade this compound. He then plans
to evaluate the effects of synthetic surfactants on their ability to degrade
this compound and to determine whether bacteria known to produce surfactants
could be utilized in place of the synthetic surfactants to accomplish the same
end result more efficiently and effectively. This proposal was submitted in
response to Program Announcement NSF 88-99, Research Initiation Awards. Results
are expected to improve the engineering design of biologically-based
remediation, potentially coupled to chemical and/or physical systems for
removing contaminants from soil that are likely contaminants of groundwater.
