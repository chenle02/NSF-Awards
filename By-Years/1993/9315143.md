9315143 Mueller This award supports a two-year collaborative research project
between Professor Berndt Mueller, Department of Physics, Duke University, and
Professor Hisakazu Minakata, Department of Physics, Tokyo Metropolitan
University. The primary purpose of the project is to study QED (quantum
electrodynamics) of strong external fields and its ultimate goal is to resolve
the puzzle of peak structure observed in the GSI experiments. Professor Alan
Chodos of Yale University and Professor Yee Jack Ng, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, will also participate in the project. The investigators
will study several aspects of the QED vacuum in the presence of a strong
external field: (1) collective modes in the QED vacuum? (2) chiral transition in
the QED vacuum? and (3) Dyson equation approach. With the beginning of the
operation of the APEX experiment at the ATLAS facility at Argonne National
Laboratory and the resumption of experiments at GSI, interest in the physics of
QED in strong external fields is growing again. The international collaboration
will contribute to the development of these experiments, as the collaborators
bring varying and mutually supportive individual expertise to the effort. ***
