Funds from this award will enable young scholars to attend a workshop entitled,
"Exclusive Reactions at High Momentum Transfer," to be held at Jefferson
Laboratory (Newport News, VA) May 15-18, 2002. This workshop will bring together
both experimental and theoretical practitioners of this filed both to stimulate
cooperative activity and to raise community awareness of the vitality of this
field. Among the subjects covered by this workshop are: wide-angle Compton
scattering, large-t meson photo and electroproduction, baryon elastic and
transition form factors, and high-t deuteron photoproduction.
