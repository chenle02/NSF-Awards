A computer component is being introduced into the mulitvariable calculus and
differential equations courses. Students are gaining insights afforded by newly
developed graphics software, are empowered with the ability to use computer
algebra systems for numeric and symbolic computation, are experimenting with
vector fields and their associated flows, and are visually investigating
examples that illustrate the theory of vector analysis and Fourier
approximations.
