To integrate CAD and CAM systems for optical designs, a mathematical model of
the manufacturing process is required. Once this model is developed, then the
consequences of design decisions on the manufacturing process can be computed.
In addition, the programs necessary to manufacture a particular design on the
CAM system can be generated directly from the CAD system. Research is planned to
develop the mathematical models necessary so that surfaces created on a CAM
system can be described in terms of the CAD system can be translated into the
controls required to create the optical surface on the CAM system. These models
will account for both spherical and aspherical surfaces.
