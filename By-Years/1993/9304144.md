This project conducts research in the semantics of computation, with a focus on
the development and verification of semantics-based compilers. The goal of the
research is to extend semantics-based compiler technology to encompass more of
the workings of real compilers, by showing how conventional run-time language
structures are formalized as representations of the data manipulated by formal
language specifications, and by showing how compiler optimizations are justified
by flow analyses. In addition, the project explores issues in type theory,
including its relation to flow analysis and questions of complexity in type
inference.
