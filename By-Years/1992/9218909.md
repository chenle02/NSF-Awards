Three independent mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion function during development
of Dictyostelium discoideum. The early adhesion system is mediated by a small
protein, gp24, that first appears on the surface of cells several hours after
initiation of development and preferentially accumulates in prestalk cells.
There are three closely linked genes, csbA, csbB, and csbC, encoding gp24 that
appear to be functionally redundant. Transformed cell lines in which one or two
of these genes are deleted show alterations in early adhesion. Moreover, cells
lacking csbC culminate only after a considerable delay and form gnarled fruiting
bodies. Dr. Loomis will use homologous recombination to replace all three csb
loci with a transformation vector carrying the pyr5-6 gene. The phenotype of the
resulting strains will be analyzed in detail to determine the consequences to
cell-cell adhesion and subsequent development. He will genetically rescue these
triple deletion strains by transformation with a wild-type copy of one or more
of the csb genes and then explore the molecular mechanism of adhesion by
determining the functionality of variants generated by site specific
mutagenesis. Using Restriction Enzyme Mediated Integration (REMI) to tag
developmentally important genes, he will isolate and characterize other genes
essential for cell-cell adhesion during early development.
