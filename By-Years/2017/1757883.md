This award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in
physics at Oklahoma State University. Between six and eight undergraduate
students will be supported per year for ten weeks of summer research. The
primary objective is to immerse students in a stimulating multidisciplinary
research atmosphere that will allow the participants to pursue a personalized
research project in physics. This REU program will develop human resources that
enhance the nation's technology base and are critical for the well-being of
society at-large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research projects are available in
several research areas including Atomic Physics, Computational Physics,
Experimental and Theoretical High Energy Physics, Optical Physics,
Optoelectronics, and Quantum Information Sciences. Participants will also attend
seminars on a variety of topics including both professional development and
careers in physics, receive ethics and safety training, and engage in cohort
activities with the other students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
