Cross-Species Analysis of Adaptive Choice Timothy Hackenberg & Jesse Dallery

Abstract Making decisions between different courses of action is fundamental to
adaptive behavior. A starling deciding how many worms to bring back to the nest,
a squirrel deciding which picnic table to raid, and an investor deciding which
stocks to buy, all face choices with important consequences for survival and/or
economic well being. The proposed research aims to better understand adaptive
choice and decision making in humans and other animals. The work involves
detailed comparisons of pigeons and humans in experimental procedures with
contrasting short-term and longer-term consequences. In addition to providing
systematic data on a topic of theoretical and applied significance, the proposed
research is designed to shed light on the cross-species generality of decision-
making strategies. Such generality across species has been called into question
by several lines of evidence, but it is unclear at present whether species
differences on such tasks reflect differences in process or differences in
procedure. The proposed research would explore the latter possibility by
examining the choice patterns of humans and other animals under closely
analogous laboratory conditions. This will provide important information on the
continuity of choice patterns across species, and on the degree to which
principles discovered in the animal laboratory can be extended to fairly complex
human activity. In identifying factors contributing to adaptive choice, this
research may also provide a starting point for developing effective self-
management techniques in humans.
