The question of how various scales of motion in the atmosphere interact with
one another is one of the more fundamental unanswered questions in the
meteorological sciences. The transfer of energy between scales is a major factor
in organizing locally severe weather such as heavy snowfalls and thunderstorms
and our lack of understanding of these processes is a major obstacle to
fundamentally improving prediction of such phenomena. In this research, the
Principal Investigator will study the internal and external scale interaction
processes affecting the evolution of warm core convective disturbances. The
studied phenomena will include collections of thunderstorms, known as mesoscale
convective complexes, and tropical cyclones. His research objectives will be
accomplished primarily through numerical modeling and should shed light on the
important dynamical interactions that control these severe weather producing
systems.
