This project supports a joint U.S.-Japan workshop on Smart/Intelligent Materials
and Systems. The major objectives of the workshop are to provide a forum for
research scientists from both countries to discuss and clarify the fundamentals
of such materials and systems, identify approaches to develop them, and indicate
areas of research which are critical to advance this emerging technology.
