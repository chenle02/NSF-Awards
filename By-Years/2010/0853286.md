t;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will evaluate the effect of the
presence of bubbles on the turbulence structure, velocity distribution and
ultimately the water entrainment caused by surface jets, as well as the
resulting gas phase distribution. There is ample experimental evidence that a
surface jet issued horizontally, parallel to a free surface containing bubbles
entrains more surrounding water than that of a single-phase. Besides furthering
basic knowledge on two-phase surface jets, the project is designed to test the
hypothesis that the presence of bubbles will increase the water entrained by the
surface jet, and to provide a complete data set to evaluate two-phase flow
models dealing with two-phase surface jets. The experiments will replicate those
of Walker et al. (1995), but will add a Venturi-type bubble injector with gas
volume fractions ranging from 0 to 30%. Velocities and Reynolds stresses will be
measured with hot film probes using conditional averaging techniques. Gas volume
fraction, bubble velocity and size distribution will be measured with a multiple
tip glass optical phase detection probe. From the averaged velocity measurements
mass and momentum balance calculations will be performed to infer the degree of
water entrainment. The simulations are intended to test the ability of the
available two-phase flow models to capture the experimental observations, and to
identify the areas that need modeling improvements. This work will be the first
study of the effects of bubbles on surface jets. This project has been developed
for a doctoral thesis and so is a focused confluence of research and education.
If successful, the project will advance the basic knowledge of jet/free surface
interaction and the effects of bubbles on turbulence characterization and water
entrainment. This project will help understand and improve modeling of flows
downstream of spillways, where the presence of highly ventilated surface jets
causes most numerical models to grossly under predict entrainment and thus the
flow pattern. Better modeling capabilities can devise mitigation measures to
reduce the bubble entrainment and transport to high depths that ultimately
causes large total dissolved gas concentrations and bubble fish disease, which
is of great environmental concern. Bubbly surface jets also appear in many
engineering applications, notably on transom stern ships and in waterjet powered
ships, of importance to national security.
