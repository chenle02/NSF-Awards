Virtualization is rapidly becoming a key technology for
computing&lt;br/&gt;systems, promising significant benefits in security,
efficiency, and&lt;br/&gt;dependability. Fully realizing these benefits depends
upon the&lt;br/&gt;reliability of virtual machine monitors (hypervisors). This
research&lt;br/&gt;aims toward developing a very high assurance, commercial
quality&lt;br/&gt;hypervisor by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) designing practical
tools and techniques to make reasoning about&lt;br/&gt; hypervisors
feasible;&lt;br/&gt;(2) honing them through the formal verification of an
existing simple&lt;br/&gt; research hypervisor; and (3) applying them to develop
and prove a graduated series of more and&lt;br/&gt; more realistic hypervisor
models, aiming toward a fully&lt;br/&gt; functional, formally verified
hypervisor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proceeds along two tracks. In the
first, an existing&lt;br/&gt;research hypervisor is modeled and verified using
the ACL2 formal&lt;br/&gt;analysis tools. In the second track, tools and
methodologies are&lt;br/&gt;developed applicable to a wide variety of hypervisor
implementations.&lt;br/&gt;This work aims to advance the formal analysis of an
important class of&lt;br/&gt;software applications and to advance the state of
the art in formal methods,&lt;br/&gt;particularly management of large and
complex formal proofs. This&lt;br/&gt;research is a collaboration between the
formal methods and systems&lt;br/&gt;research groups at the University of Texas
at Austin.&lt;br/&gt;
