Cryofixation is emerging as the superior technique for ultrastructural
preservation of cells. As a step in our efforts to build-up a state-of-the-art
electron microscopy facility, we request support for purchase of three items of
equipment used in cryopreparation of material for electron microscopy. The
recently developed high-pressure fast-freezing device allows tissues up to 0.5
mm in thickness to be fixed without the ice crystal damage accompanying ultra-
rapid freezing of thick tissues at ambient pressure. The automatic freeze
substitution processor facilitates multiple cryofixed samples, reduces chances
of secondary ice crystal damage to tissue, allows convenient low temperature
infiltration of resins, and increases quality and reproductivity of freeze-
substitution. These instruments will support systematic, developmental, and
ecological studies of algae, fungi, plants, insects and vertebrates. The
equipment will be used in a newly organized multi-user electron microscope
facility located in a recently constructed biological sciences building. There
is a major university cost-sharing component, including funding of a second
electron microscope technician's position.
