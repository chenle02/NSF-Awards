Certain orb-weaving spiders are known to recycle their webs, some as often as
every day. They accomplish this despite the fact that some web fibers, namely
major and minor ampullate silk, are highly resistant to common proteases. Spider
proteases that degrade these solid fibers are therefore expected to have novel
properties. Using digestive fluid from the orb-weaving spider Nephila clavipes,
major ampullate silk-degrading or "silkase" activity was identified. The
objective of this research is to determine protein sequences that distinguish
peptidase isoforms with and without major ampullate silk-degrading activity. By
examining enzymatic and sequence data from several spider species, structural
and functional features will be correlated. Enzymatic activities of recombinant
and native peptidases will be compared using synthetic or soluble silk fibroins
or native silk fibers. To test the hypothesis that certain peptidase sequences
are key determinants for the presence of major ampullate silkase activity,
altered recombinant peptidases will be analyzed.

Broader Impact: Characterization of a silkase with novel enzymatic features will
advance our understanding of enzymes that degrade protease-resistant solid
fibers and could lead to new biotechnological applications. Students involved in
this research will benefit greatly from the collaboration between research
groups interested in protein structure/function relationships from the
perspectives of the silk fibers and fiber-degrading peptidases. The research
will also provide a rich environment for hosting high school students from
underrepresented groups in a summer Student Research Apprenticeship Program and
undergraduates receiving NSF-EPSCOR summer research awards.
