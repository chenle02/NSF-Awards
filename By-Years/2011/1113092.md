This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
novel approach to generate electricity without ?burning? fuel by using organic
material obtained from bio-waste as a fuel. Unlike the conventional biomass-to-
energy conversion, the current approach directly converts bio-waste, such as
waste wood and agricultural biomass into fuel. Fuel has a zero carbon footprint,
as combustion is NOT required, unlike conventional liquid bio-fuels. Moreover,
the fuel is non-volatile, non-combustible and non-toxic. The broader/commercial
impacts of this research are reduction of dependence on non-renewable petroleum-
based fuels. The proposed technology is a facile, efficient, economical and
environmentally benign process for energy generation compared to the
conventional bio-fuel approaches. Commercialization of the technology will
greatly extend the use of waste bio-mass and reduce society?s dependence on non-
renewable petroleum resources, thus providing an effective method to improve the
environment and maintain social sustainable development.
