The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX) is
one of only a handful of very large and diverse public collections of living
algae in the world. Many kinds of UTEX algae are irreplaceable. Every year
thousands of living cultures are sent at modest charge to scientists, educators,
and students throughout the U.S. and elsewhere. With the recently recognized
potential of microscopic algae as a source of transportation fuel, human food,
animal feed and many other uses, UTEX algae and services have become a major
resource for hundreds of applied research projects. UTEX maintains active
programs to cryopreserve valuable species and to characterize each distinct
strain according to its unique DNA signature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National
services of UTEX include a bi-monthly hands-on workshop on managing algal
cultures for advanced students and professionals who seek additional expertise,
an interactive web site &lt;www.utex.org&gt;, a species-identification service,
and extensive correspondence with students who conduct algal-based science
projects. Locally, UTEX personnel visit public school for presentations and
invite their visit to UTEX facilities, assist teachers and students in
conducting high-school science projects, and provide presentations on the
scientific importance of algae to hundreds of children at two major open-house
events at this institution.
