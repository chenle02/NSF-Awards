Wireless communication has advanced significantly in recent decades, resulting
in complex and heterogeneous networks in public, private, and defense sectors.
However, the growth of wireless cyberspace has also led to an increase in
security threats and actual attacks. As a result, research and development on
wireless security have become a focus across academic, government, and industry
sectors. Proactive and autonomous defenses have emerged as promising
countermeasures, but research in extremely complex wireless networks and
spectrum access security remains under-explored. The workshopâ€™s novelty is its
aim to fill the research gap by providing a vibrant forum for multi-disciplinary
leading researchers and practitioners to discuss critical cyber threats facing
complex wireless systems and spectrum security and to propose countermeasures
leveraging new concepts such as enhanced wireless situational awareness. The
workshop's broader significance and importance lie in its potential to help the
research community better understand the need for securing wireless
communications and spectrum access, and to propose proactive and autonomous
defenses in wireless networks operating in challenging environments or even
contested space for DoD applications.

The workshop's technical sessions are organized around different aspects of
leveraging software-defined radios (SDRs) for spectrum/waveform-aware wireless
security designs. The progress in SDR technology and the rise of collaborative
and opportunistic access to the limited radio frequency (RF) spectrum have
opened opportunities for both wireless system defenders and attackers. Attackers
can exploit SDR devices to devise optimal attack strategies, while defenders
will try best to identify attacked spectrum bands and adversarial waveforms to
secure subsequent transmissions. Both sides can harness recent advancements in
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to intensify the battle
in the intricate wireless cyberspace. The workshop will be attended by renowned
researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government agencies,
spanning various fields such as cybersecurity, wireless communications and
networking, information theory, IoT systems, AI and machine learning,
communication software-hardware co-design, and fog/edge computing. The workshop
discussion will focus on the defense side on being aware of future sophisticate
attacks.
