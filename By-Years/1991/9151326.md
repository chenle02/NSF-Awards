Students studying mathematics, science and mathematics education are learning by
solving problems in a supervised laboratory equipped with 25 high performance
networked Apple Macintosh micro computers and appropriate software. Designed to
increase student interest and productivity, this laboratory exercises students'
mathematical thought processes in specially created learning environments.
Particular emphasis is placed on using high level languages to extend the
"microworld" approach, pioneered by Seymour Papert, to solving problems.
