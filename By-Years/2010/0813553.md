The Division of Chemistry (Experimental Physical Chemistry Program) and the
Office of International Science and Engineering support Prof. Mohamed El-Shall
of Virginia Commonwealth University and his post-doctoral fellows in this
collaborative project with colleagues at the National Research Centre in Egypt
in an investigation of the chemical and physical properties of a series of
potential hydrogen storage materials. The materials to be studied include novel
zeolites, Mg-based alloys, and metal-doped carbon nanotubes. This project is
being supported by the U.S. - Egypt Joint Board for Science and Technology,
which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the
collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of El-Shall and his
colleagues is aimed at developing better materials for safe, high-density
storage of hydrogen for use in fuel-cell devices. Besides the potential for
broad societal and technological impact of research in hydrogen storage
materials, this international collaboration will help to build strong ties
between Egyptian and American scientists and will help to train the next
generation of globally-engaged scientists.
