What determines the contracts, mechanisms, games, and other organizational forms
that are used in an economy? What role does competition play in shaping
incentives and institutional design? How does private information enter markets,
and to what extent does competition mitigate or magnify the inefficiencies that
arise from asymmetric information? This award funds research on generalized
models of group formation in markets to provide a foundation for answering these
questions.

Classical general equilibrium theory focuses on anonymous price-taking agents,
typically ignoring any strategic effects or incentives. Modern theory of
institutions, contracts, and mechanism design focuses on incentives and private
information in isolation, typically ignoring market forces that might alter
organizational design. As a consequence, neither can explain how incentives
might influence markets or how competition might select among institutions.

This project focuses on these questions, and on asymmetric information in
competitive markets more broadly. A central contribution of the project is the
development of models that meld key aspects of contract theory, mechanism design
and game theory with general equilibrium theory. Agents interact strategically
in small groups, taking into account incentives and the effects of their actions
on group outcomes, but trade anonymously in markets, taking prices as given.
This allows the researchers to study the interplay between market forces,
private information, the provision of incentives, and the structure of
institutions, and to assess the role of markets in limiting inefficiencies that
stem from asymmetric information. Applications include asymmetric information in
financial markets, competition in matching markets, competitive foundations for
large matching markets, and dynamic matching markets. The intellectual merit of
this project is a deeper understanding of the functioning of competitive markets
in the presence of asymmetric information. The broader impacts of this project
include insights into labor markets and the dynamics of matching markets and
other settings of market design.
