Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions are ubiquitous in the realm of synthetic
chemistry, allowing the strategic construction of pharmaceuticals and materials
alike. Although many methods exist, simple, efficient, and mild conditions are
desirable for ease of preparation and economic sustainability. Metal-catalysts
are constantly being developed to satisfy these needs, and the design of new
catalysts can provide further progress towards this endeavor. The host
researcher, Dr. Tobisu Mamoru at Osaka University, has recently reported a
carbon-boron bond forming reaction to yield valuable chemical building blocks.
Under Dr. Tobisu?s guidance, the research will optimize the first generation of
catalysts for application to carbon-carbon bond formation. This work will lead
to the development of synthetic methods useful for the efficient preparation of
pharmaceutically relevant acylated aromatics.

This project aims to develop a rhodium catalyst for the mild C-O acylation of
pyridyloxy directing groups. Pyridyl directing groups have seen great success in
the regioselective C-H activation of aromatic substrates, however, their removal
is limiting to their utility in synthetic applications. Dr. Tobisu has recently
developed the corresponding C-O borylation reaction, setting the precedent for
the proposed transformation. The EAPSI project will allow for the synthesis of
acylated aromatics, which are useful intermediates for chemical synthesis and
are prevalent among natural products and pharmaceuticals. Development of such
catalysts will also further the fundamental understanding of reactivity of
rhodium complexes.
