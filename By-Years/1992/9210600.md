This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award is to support research whose
objective is to understand how individuals formulate and make decisions about
insurance as a form of financial protection against low probability but high
consequence events. Adults will be interviewed regarding three different
insurance decisions. The study is designed as a conceptual replication of the
well-known Kunreuther (1978) study of how people make hazard (flood and
earthquake) insurance decisions. This involves testing models based upon
Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) and information diffusion theories, that
latter of which has been hypothesized to be descriptively more accurate. The
research objectives are to (1) test whether the information diffusion theory
generalizes to other types of insurance, (2) determine whether SEU predicts
better when improved response elicitation methods are used, and (3) determine
whether people use consistent strategies when considering different kinds of
insurance. In addition, the project will examine whether consumers' intuitive
definitions of insurance (and its purposes), beliefs about the insurance system,
and budget constraints predict consumers' decisions.
