Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Davis, of
an Automated Testing System and interface hardware, to be dedicated to support
research in engineering. It is a computer-automated control system that can
immediately extend the capabilities and performance of many civil engineering
testing systems. When installed, it will be immediately utilized for research
projects in geotechnical earthquake engineering. ***
