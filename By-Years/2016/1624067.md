In recent years, significant focus has turned to archival data sources in the
Big Data and computational social science research communities. The scale of
archived Web data is unprecedented in terms of scope and scale, creating major
challenges for scholars. The 2016 Web Archiving workshop series provides a
premier venue for engaging with Web archives, and for learning the skills
necessary to utilize archived Web data for knowledge discovery. This award will
support travel of Ph.D. students at U.S. universities who have submitted
research proposals that have been accepted as part of the workshop series.
Participants in this workshop series will gain critical skills necessary for
developing cutting edge research agendas. Training provided to Ph.D. students
will help to prepare the next generation of Big Data scholars.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop series will consist of two events; the first
workshop will be held at the University of Toronto from March 3 - 5, 2016, and
the second workshop will be held at the Library of Congress in Washington DC
from June 15 - 17. The workshop co-chairs are Matthew Weber (Rutgers
University), Jimmy Lin (University of Waterloo) and Ian Milligan (University of
Waterloo). The workshop series builds on prior research agendas established
across disciplines for working with archived Web data. Specifically, this work
responds to ongoing calls in computational social science for improved access to
archived Web data. Workshop attendees will further be asked to engage with a
variety of topics of societal importance. The products of the workshop focus on
integrating scholarship in computer science with the social sciences and
demonstrating the potential of interdisciplinary Big Data scholarship. For
