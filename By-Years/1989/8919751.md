Olfaction is an important sense for recognition, particularly for young mammals
that often are born before the eyes or ears are fully functional. Understanding
how olfactory information is delivered to and handled by the central nervous
system requires knowing the anatomical organization of the projections from the
nose to the olfactory central targets, including olfactory cortex. The central
olfactory system is highly organized, with clear layering, distinctive cell
types, and well-studied projection areas. One approach to clarify how the system
works is to observe how the functional circuits develop. Marsupials, such as the
opossum, have a very slow early growth after birth, and so provide a
particularly useful model system. This project will use anatomical techniques to
trace the development of olfactory connections as they form, and to see how
functional manipulations affect the early interactions which specify formation
of the olfactory system. Results from this model system will be important to
developmental biology and to systems neuroscience as well as to understanding
brain organization and sensory processing.
