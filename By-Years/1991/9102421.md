This project is focussed on two basic areas in the field of nonlinear partial
differential equations. First, the principal investigator aims to study the
question of breakdown of three- dimensional incompressible and ideal fluid flow
from the numerical and theoretical point of view. Second, he plans to
investigate some regularity questions for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation:
delayed singularity formation and global existence in low dimensions and
breakdown of large amplitude solutions to three-dimensional semilinear
equations. These studies will accrue to the foundations of applied areas such as
aerodynamics, and wave propagation.
