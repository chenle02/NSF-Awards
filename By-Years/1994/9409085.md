9409085 In recent experiments a remarkable range of chemical and physical
properties has been observed in intermediate-sized clusters of carbon and
silicon atoms containing between about twenty and fifty atoms. These properties
are surprisingly sensitive to such details as cluster size and shape, reflecting
a subtle interplay between cluster electronic states and the overall cluster
structure. In this Research at Undergraduate Institution grant, first-principles
methods based on density functional theory will be used to study the electronic
states of clusters in this size range. The ultimate goals of the project are to
understand how the electronic states are influenced by such factors as cluster
size and shape, and how the nature of the cluster electronic states in turn
affects other properties of the clusters. %%% This is a Research at
Undergraduate Institution award to conduct theoretical research on the
properties of silicon and carbon clusters. These clusters have properties which
are intermediate between those of the molecule and the solid. These properties
are often unique and are highly dependent on the interplay between electron
states and cluster shape. This research will conduct calculations of these
electronic states and their effect on cluster properties. The work will be done
in collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory.
