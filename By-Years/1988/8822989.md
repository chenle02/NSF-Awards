This research is directed toward an improved, mechanistic understanding of the
factors affecting drying rates, particle morphology, and other product-quality
attributes in spray drying. Hot-wire anemometry and tracer studies are used to
define flow and mixing patterns in the region outside the spray envelope in a
laboratory dryer. In a second experiment rates of loss of a trace volatile
component are monitored during drying of a suspended drop, with simultaneous
monitoring of morphological change by video techniques. This research should
make it possible to obtain superior flavor and aroma attributes and better bulk-
density control of food products -- such as instant coffee, tea, and milk --
made by spray drying. It should, as well, enable more knowledgeable design and
selection of operating conditions in spray dryers, leading to more cost-
efficient operation, and more reliable product quality.
