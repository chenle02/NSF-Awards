This project exposes students to a laboratory environment that supports their
studies in high voltage generation and measurement techniques. In addition to
validating theoretical concepts, the high voltage laboratory allows students to
design, construct and test different types of high voltage generators, it
permits hands-on experiences where students observe reactions of particular
insulators to high voltages, and, it provides an environment where students gain
a practical intuitive understanding of some highly theoretical topics. This
award is being matched by a greater then equal sum from the grantee.
