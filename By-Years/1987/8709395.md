Processing induced defects will pose an ever increasing problem in VLSI-ULSI
because processes involving ionizing radiation will become more prevalent.
Unfortunately, scientists with an interest in defects in insulators tend to be
divided amongst those who use electrical characterization techniques, and those
who use nonelectrical methods of analysis such as EPR, ESR, and XPS. The former
group include physicists, and solid state electrical engineers, while the latter
group include material scientists and classical chemists. The two groups very
rarely have a common forum for interchange of ideas and much valuable
information is lost to each of these groups because of this. In addition, there
is another group, that concerned with RAD hard materials, who speak to neither
of the aforementioned groups. The purpose of the presently proposed workshop
entitled, "The First Workshop On Process-Related Electrically Active Defects in
Semiconductor-Insulator Systems", is to bring together this mixture of
scientists with varying backgrounds, but related interests.
