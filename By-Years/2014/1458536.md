Do peer pressures change the way we consume and save? This project plans to use
large scale administrative data for the population of Denmark, coupled with
consumption survey data, to study the importance of social influences on
household spending. Our goal is to quantify the importance of consumption
network effects, and to understand the importance of heterogeneity, the economic
mechanism underlying our estimates, and its aggregate
implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We consider three possible mechanisms for the
presence of consumption network effects: "keeping-up-with-the-Joneses",
conspicuous consumption, and risk sharing. We propose empirical tests that allow
us to distinguish between these three different mechanisms. We use our estimates
to simulate the aggregate impact of fiscal policies in the presence of
consumption social multipliers. The model is identified using the structure of
networks formed by co-workers and spouses.
