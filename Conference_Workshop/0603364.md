This proposal requests travel support for U.S. participants attending the 31st
Conference on Stochastic Processes and their Applications, an international
meeting to be held July 17-21, 2006 in Paris, France. The conference on
Stochastic Processes and their Applications have become the principal annual
international forum for researchers studying applied and theoretical problems in
stochastic processes. These conferences provide a balanced and broad overview of
current research in probability and areas of application and bring together
distinguished scholars from all over the world.
