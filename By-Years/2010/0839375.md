This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
innovative technology for conducting the diagnosis and prognosis of vibro-
acoustic characteristics of a complex machine. This technology aims to offer
substantial advantages over current technologies such as experimental modal
analysis (EMA) and operational modal analysis (OMA). EMA and OMA attempt to gain
an insight into the integrity of a vibrating structure by extracting modal
parameters. The knowledge acquired cannot be used in noise abatement, however,
because modal parameters have no direct relation to sound. The new technology
exploits the concept that sound and vibrations are two different physical
phenomena, and will enable users to obtain a clear and better understanding of
the root causes of vibration-induced noise. Also, the input data to this
technology can be collected by using non-contact, non-invasive measurement
equipment. Hence, users can use this new technology to tackle noise and
vibration issues of a complex machine running in its native and normal operating
condition.

The potential outcomes of this project should broadly impact science and
technology in sound, structures, and their interactions. Additionally, the
knowledge gained will have a profound impact on noise and vibrations, including
not only diagnosis and prognosis, but product quality control and product
testing because noise is an indicator of defects in products at various stage of
a manufacturing process. Noise is also a significant health and environmental
issue. According to the National Institute of Health, over 10 million Americans
suffer permanent noise-induced hearing loss and about 30 million Americans are
exposed to daily noise levels that eventually impair their hearing. The proposed
technology will enable users to identify and abate undesirable sound and
vibrations in the most cost-effective manner. Use of the proposed technology
will significantly enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing industries in
the United States in tackling a variety of noise and vibration issues.
