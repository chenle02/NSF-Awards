This proposal addresses the environmentally important task of removing certain
hazardous small organic molecules (e.g. aromatic amines, PCBs and polycyclic
aromatics) from water by a unique process utilizing enzyme catalysis in an
organic phase. In this process, the aqueous phase is separated from in organic
phase by a membrane. The enzyme is dissolved in the organic phase, and the
membrane is selected to have a cutoff pore size so that the hazardous small
organic molecule, but not the enzyme, can pass through the membrane. The organic
molecule diffuses into the organic compartment where the enzyme polymerizes the
organic into a high molecular weight species which can subsequently by removed
from the organic phase via settling or ultrafiltration. To demonstrate the
feasibility of this process, 2 chlorophenol (2CP) will be used as the example
organic solvent, and the polymerization will take place in perfluorodecalin with
horseradish peroxidase as the enzyme catalyst. This catalysis requires free
radicals which will be provided by hydrogen peroxide, itself generated by
alcohol oxidation catalyzed by alcohol oxidase.
