This program of research concerns combinatorial set theory, which is the study
of certain infinite mathematical structures, including graphs, trees, and linear
and partial orders. These structures are ubiquitous in mathematics and can be
studied from many points of view. This project aims to help answer fundamental
mathematical questions by extending understanding of the cardinality of these
structures. The research involves ideas from areas including logic, algebra, and
the theory of infinite games.

The main topics in the project are compactness properties, singular cardinal
combinatorics, and definability. The goals include producing models where many
consecutive cardinals simultaneously have the tree property, getting refined
information about singular cardinals through the study of their cardinal
invariants, and constructing novel extender-based forcings. The tools will
include inner model theory, forcing, and possible cofinalities (PCF) theory.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
