Professor William Klemperer is supported by a grant from the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program for structural and dynamical characterization of
molecular complexes, high temperature species, and molecules in highly excited
vibrational states. The goal of these studies is to explore the nature of the
intermolecular potential surfaces and the dynamics on these surfaces. The
dynamics of dissociation of weakly bonded species excited far above their
dissociation energy will be determined by overtone excitation, the dissociation
products being characterized with respect to polarization, angular, and
frequency distribution of fluorescence. The geometric and electronic structure
of molecules for which there appears to be a severe mixing of nuclear and
electronic motion will be studied by molecular beam methods. Rotational spectra
of high temperature species will be obtained using molecular beam electric
resonance with seeded beam sources. %%% The geometric structure, electronic
structure, and dissociation of molecules in the collisionless environment of a
molecular beam will provide information on the nature of the interactions
between molecules.
