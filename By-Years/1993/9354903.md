We propose a new initiative in environmental aspects of polymer science, and in
particular plastics recycling. The emphasis of the training will be on the
fundamental properties of polymers and their relation to environmental concerns.
A core curriculum is proposed along with a wide range of course options. Three
Ph.D. thesis topics are described as being typical of the type of research of
interest to the five faculty involved. Interactions with the American Plastics
Council and the Environmental Research Institute are described which will
provide financial support for he research, a broadened base of training, and a
national strategy for recruiting.
