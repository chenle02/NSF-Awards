This research develops knowledge based computer systems for "qualitative
physics," allowing computers to reason more effectively about the physical
world. Qualitative physics complements traditional physics by providing (1) fast
answers in simple situations and (2) a framework for more detailed analysis.
Specific qualitative models are being developed for fluid systems, thermal
systems, and motion, adequate to describe complex systems such as as mechanical
clocks and boilers. The models include methods for prediction, measurement,
interpretation, and for constructing plans and procedures. The research also
includes an investigation of how people learn physical domains, including
cognitive simulations of analogical processing. The significance of this
research is its potential to produce "robust" computer reasoning systems,
comparable to humans in their ability to reason approximately about how the
physical world around them will behave, without the detailed information and
mathematical equations required for classical models of physics. In addition,
studying the range of qualitative physics expertise in humans may provide
important insight into the nature of cognition. Practical and effective
qualitative reasoning systems will also be essential in developing many advanced
technological systems: Examples include intelligent monitors for complex systems
such as factories and power plants, and intelligent computer assistants for
mechanical and engineering design.
