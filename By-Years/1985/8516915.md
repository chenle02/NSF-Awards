Thin-shell structures are widely used for cooling towers, chimneys, storage
tanks, pressure vessels, domes and hangers. However, geometrical imperfection of
such construction can greatly influence the buckling and vibrational behaviors,
particularly during the earthquake conditions. Theoretical methods are developed
in this project to study the non-linear dynamic response behavior of thin-shell
structures in the presence of random initial imperfections which are represented
as zero-mean, Gaussian, homogeneous random processes. The resulting random
responses are geometrically non-linear depending upon the magnitude of the load
and the root-mean-square value of the initial imperfections. The effect of
imperfection parameters are studied to set the tolerance limit for these
parameters.
