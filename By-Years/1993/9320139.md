Cuenod 9320139 This award will support the 1993 activities of the Human Frontier
Science Program (HFSP), an international, non-governmental organization located
in Strasbourg, France and dedicated to supporting international collaborative
basic research and long-term (two-year) post-doctoral fellowships in the
elucidation of brain functions and molecular biology. The HFSP was originally
proposed by the Government of Japan in 1987 at the Venice Economic Summit of the
leaders of the major Western countries. The participating countries include
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the
United States, and the European Community. In 1993 the HFSP awarded 42 research
grants and 152 two-year, post-doctoral fellowships. Sixteen grants and fifteen
post-doctoral fellowships were awarded to American researchers. In addition, 95
fellowships were awarded to foreign post-docs who expressed the intention to
conduct their research in the United States. The U.S. contribution of $3.5
million includes funds provided by the National Science Foundation, the National
Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, and the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
