The goal of this workshop is to develop course descriptors (C-IDs) for lower-
division engineering courses based on Transfer Model Curricula for Engineering
and promote their wide adoption across the three main segments of the California
engineering education system: California Community Colleges (CCC), California
State University (CSU), and University of California (UC). Results of efforts
from this workshop will improve the articulation of lower-division engineering
courses and aid engineering students in California in transferring to four-year
institutions. The workshop will convene approximately 100 participants (52 from
the community colleges, 30 from the CSUs, and 18 from the UCs), including
engineering faculty, administrators, and transfer staff to focus on the
curriculum and development of the C-IDs. This workshop builds upon previous
workshops with administrators and articulation officers on the articulation
process using C-IDs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop activities aim to 1)
develop a set of lower-division engineering course descriptors (C-IDs) that are
widely accepted and implemented in the California engineering education system
(CCC, CSU, and UC); 2) identify significant barriers to the successful transfer
of thousands of engineering students in the state's community colleges; 3)
create a community of engineering educators who work collaboratively to address
challenges and opportunities facing the future of engineering education in the
state; and 4) identify opportunities to further understand and contribute to the
growing body of research on the importance of community colleges in building a
strong and diverse STEM workforce. Pre- and post-workshop surveys will be used
to collect data in order to fine tune the workshop and follow-up activities. A
two-hour follow-up workshop in Spring 2015 is planned to share the results of
the surveys and to further the activities fostering awareness and acceptance of
the C-IDs.
