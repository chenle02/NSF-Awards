9301964 Wagner Deflection routing is an important routing paradigm in opto-
electronic interconnection networks. This project applies the technique of Mean
Value Analysis to the problem of analyzing such networks. Other stochastic
models of deflection routing typically restrict attention to a single switch,
which precludes consideration of non-uniform traffic patterns, or they assume
that external arrivals that cannot be admitted to the network immediately are
dropped. The MVA technique has no such limitations, and furthermore it allows
modeling of the network in its entirety, including processors and/or memories
that are attached to the network. Preliminary investigation of this approach by
the PI has shown much promise. The principal goals of this project are to (a)
improve the efficiency and accuracy of the technique, and (b) use this technique
to explore the design space of switch and network architectures for deflection-
routed networks. ***
