9322475 Goodman The investigator and Richard Pollack (Courant Institute of the
Mathematical Sciences, NYU) will continue their study of the interplay between
the geometry and the topology of Euclidean spaces by extending their recent
results (1) on a generalization to Grassmann manifolds of the standard convexity
structure of Euclidean spaces, (2) on the classification of ordered
configurations and their generalizations, and (3) on related geometric and
combinatorial problems. Building on their past work on allowable sequences and
order types of configurations, as well as on ideas coming out of their solution
of the Vincensini problem for hyperplane transversals to families of convex
bodies and their recent extension of convexity to Grassmann manifolds, Goodman
and Pollack plan to continue their work on configurations, arrangements of
flats, and geometric transversal theory. One of the most elegant things that
Goodman and Pollack have done recently is to extend convexity, as noted above,
from sets of points in Euclidean spaces to sets of higher dimensional flats, for
example lines in ordinary three-space. One obtains in this way "convex" sets of
lines such as all the lines through a particular point, or all the lines in a
particular plane, and there is nothing especially exciting about these. However,
one also obtains such sets as all the lines which are surrounded by a particular
hyperboloid of one sheet together with one set of rulings lying on the surface
of the hyperboloid. Since the suggestive formalism of convexity theory becomes
available in this new and broader context, it leads to some surprising new
geometric conjectures, proofs, and theorems. ***
