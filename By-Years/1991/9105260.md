The Arabidopsis thaliana floral homeotic gene, AGAMOUS (AG), and six additional
genes, AGL1-AGL6, have been isolated. Their sequences share striking similarity
with the DNA binding domain of transcription factors from humans (SRF) and yeast
(MCM1), which regulate the expression of the human proto-oncogene c-fos and
yeast mating type specific genes, respectively. AG and five of the AGLs are
expressed preferentially in flowers, while AGL3 is expressed both in flowers and
in vegetative tissues. Dr. Ma proposes to dissect the functional domains of AG
using mutational analysis, promoter fusions, and domain switching. Furthermore,
he proposes to characterize the structure and expression of the AGL3 gene, which
has a unique expression pattern among these seven genes, and may play a more
fundamental role in both reproductive and vegetative tissues. Finally, because
the yeast MCM1 gene has the same type of DNA binding domain, and because
powerful genetic and molecular tools are available in yeast, he proposes to
study some functional aspects of the AG protein in yeast. The combination of
these methods in both plant and yeast will lead to a better understanding of the
function of these plant genes.
