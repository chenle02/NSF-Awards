Abstract for DMS - 0104086

In his major project the investigator plans to continue his work on Riemannian
manifolds with positive sectional curvature on open dense sets of points. A
particular emphasis shall be put on the question how to distinguish this class
from the two well studied classes of manifolds that have positive respectively
nonnegative curvature everywhere. In further projects the investigator plans to
obtain rigidity results for metric foliations of Euclidean spheres and for
manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed.

The surfaces of eggs and footballs or the idealized surface of the earth are
examples of 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with positive sectional
curvature. For more than a century geometers understand that surfaces with
positive curvature must look simple. They can not develop any holes, so they
look for example fundamentally different from the surface of a doughnut. In
contrast there are two dimensional manifolds with nonnegative sectional
curvature, which essentially look like the surface of a doughnut. This
elementary observation reveals a fundamental difference between positive and
nonnegative curvature. The main aim is to understand this fundamental difference
and its implications in higher dimensions as well.
