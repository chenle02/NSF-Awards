Form perception is an important capability that is involved in everyday tasks
such as reading, driving and recognizing familiar faces. The application of
linear systems models of form perception that are based on measurements of the
infant contrast sensitivity function have led researchers to a deeper
understanding of the development of infants' ability to detect information in
their environment and the development of basic visual processes. Despite this
success, recent data suggest that linear systems models may need to be modified
to be applicable to high contrast, suprathreshold stimuli. This modification is
important because most objects in the real world are high in contrast, and hence
easily detected by infants. The main goal of Dr. Stephens' project is to
identify the modifications needed by linear systems models to extend them to
more real world situations. This project addresses three important and closely
related lines of research. The first involves the development and function of
contrast constancy in infants. The second line of research is concerned with the
development of form discrimination. The third area of investigation is designed
to test the application of contrast sensitivity based models to the development
of infant face preferences.
