9353307 Bradley Under the leadership of Rebuild Los Angeles (RLA) and the Los
Angeles School District, the self study/planning process will involve data
collection, program and policy review, and the development of a proposal that
will identify systemic approaches to improve mathematics and science achievement
for all students. Key stakeholders, forming an Advisory Committee and a Steering
Committee, will assist the project director with data collection, data analysis
and intervention design. Study teams will assess teacher quality, current status
of reform measures and adequacy of resources. Focus groups, consisting of
representatives from different socio-economic groups and ethnic backgrounds,
will be involved in the planning process. ***
