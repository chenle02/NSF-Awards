Theory of Aperiodic Solids II

Abstract of Proposed Research Jean Bellissard

This award will support the development of a general theory of solids based on
the properties of their microscopic structure. Our particular interest is to
describe the ground state of a solid. We will investigate the development of a
mathematically rigorous description of quantum dissipative transport based on
analyses of interactions between particles in an aperiodic solid. Mathematically
this research involves the use of noncommutative geometry and probability theory
on Polish spaces.

The question of how quantum properties determine the phenomenology of related
solids is a fundamental problem in mathematical physics and materials science.
The PI has worked on these issues for many years and has obtained many important
results on quantum transport in solids and the quantum Hall effect. His research
under this award, and with a number of collaborators, continues a program that
should help provide a mathematical foundation for such theories.
