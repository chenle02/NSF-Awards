0125056 Nepf Wetland systems often consist of a branching network of channels
cutting through regions of dense vegetation. While the channels provide most of
the flow conveyance, the vegetated regions provide most of the bioremediation
and particle trapping. Thus, exchange between the channel and vegetated zone may
control the overall wetland function, in particular with regard to water quality
and sediment trapping. A similar relationship exists between the channel and
vegetated bank of a river system. Laboratory experiments will be used to
quantify the exchange of momentum and mass between a channel and a zone of
emergent vegetation of equal or lesser depth (a bank), and to develop a model
that predicts this exchange from representative vegetation and flow parameters.
In the flume model, the exchange will be observed by tracking the evolution of
dye plumes released from different locations within the channel and vegetated
zone. The model vegetation will be designed using geometric and dynamic
similarity to real vegetation. A preliminary flow visualization study will be
used to assess major mechanisms, to define ranges of behavior across different
geometry, and to refine the experimental system. Subsequent detailed studies
will simultaneously measure concentration and velocity to directly quantify
turbulent fluxes of momentum and mass. The study will draw from existing models
for floodplains, including the effects of vegetation on hydraulic roughness and
floodplain geomorphology. After the completion of this project, future phases of
this research will integrate the new model for exchange between channels and
vegetated zones with existing models for channel flow and vegetated flow to
construct a comprehensive wetland model capable of predicting wetland
circulation and transport. This model will provide an important tool for
managing wetland systems by enabling stake holders to predict the changes in
wetland function that will arise with proposed development and land-use changes.
