9413787 Schwartz This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of
portable geophysical field stations to be used in research and teaching projects
in tectonics, Earth structure, and earthquake studies. The equipment of the
stations will consist of portable broad band digital seismometers and their data
acquisition systems, and receivers to be used in connection with the satellite-
based Global Positioning System. The geophysical field stations will be stored
and maintained by the Institute of Tectonics at the University of California at
Santa Cruz. The University of California at Santa Cruz is committed to providing
the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition of these field stations. ***
