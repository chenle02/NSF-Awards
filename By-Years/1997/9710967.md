This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses an
innovative method for safely removing lead-based paints from structural
materials. Removal of paint from structures is a national problem, affecting
hundreds of thousands of structures. More than half the nation's 208,505 steel
bridges carrying public roads require immediate repairs totaling more than $5
billion. This represents about 5 billion square feet of surface area from which
lead-based paint should be removed. In Phase I, a theoretical evaluation of a
process to rapidly remove thin layers of coatings through a repetitive
vaporization process with pulsed plasma was conducted and successfully
demonstrated in a single-shot mode. The Phase II research objective is to build
and test a complete engineering prototype and conduct a small-scale field
demonstration. Phase II research will determine the optimal operating parameters
of the prototype. The anticipated result is a successful field demonstration on
several girders of a bridge in Virginia. The potential commercial applications
for this technology is large, and includes paint removal from bridges,
residential and industrial structures, ships, railroad cars, tank farms, and
vehicles of all types. This technology is directly applicable to the removal of
other kinds of surface coatings (besides paints). Of special interest is the
experimentally demonstrated ability to remove top coats of paint without
damaging or removing the primer or undercoat. This will have applications for
the commercial aircraft industry. Á >Á┬¥ │Á>¥┐╝`
