The research concerns the potential use of halogens for controlling the chemical
processes vital to the conversion of natural gas into more useful olefins and
also to the elimination of dangerous toxic wastes (dioxins). Research objectives
will clarify the kinetics of hydrocarbon radical interaction with chloro-
compounds in order to identify the individual reactions which compose the
overall process (or at least not to omit the critical ones). Such detailed
kinetics data and their eventual use in super components are the only path to
combustion models, reliable in a wide range of sizes, flow rates and
temperatures.
