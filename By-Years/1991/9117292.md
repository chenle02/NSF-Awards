This award will support a U.S.-Japan Cooperative Photoconversion/Photosynthesis
Research Program project between Professor Judith Croxdale, Department of
Botany, University of Wisconsin, and Professor Kenji Omasa, Environmental Plant
Science Section, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan.
The project involves cooperative experiments to examine whether, in the
mesophyll of developing dicot leaves, new cells that arise at multiple sites are
coordinated by their position in the developing leaf or by their cell lineage.
The question is one of fundamental importance to plant developmental biology.
The function of clones in developing leaves will be studied by monitoring
photosynthesis. The development of the photochemical apparatus will be
determined by repeatedly imaging the kinetics of chlorophyll a fluorescence in
the clones. Uniform function within clones throughout their development will
indicate regulation by cell ancestry, while heterogeneity within clones will
indicate the participation of other influences in the development of cellular
function. Clones intersected by vascular tissue will be particularly useful in
assessing the contributions of other cell types on mesophyll differentiation.
Since the clones created will span the entire period of leaf development, the
investigators can determine if there are "windows" during development when
ancestry may control function, and other times when positional information may
regulate cellular development.
