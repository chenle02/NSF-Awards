AST-0407551&lt;br/&gt;PI : Shapero, Donald&lt;br/&gt;Inst: National Academy of
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the creation and
distribution of a 'research briefing' on astronomical origins of the objects and
structures in the universe. The document will present the exciting and
compelling science questions of the most recent NRC Astronomy and Astrophysics
Decadal Survey "Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium" in a format
appropriate for science education and outreach. The audience for the report will
be the interested general public, ranging from high school students and their
teachers to policy officials. The report will be produced over a 12-month period
by a small committee of astronomers working with a professional writer, and then
be reviewed by an independent NAS-appointed group before release. It will be
widely disseminated through professional organizations, existing networks of
schools and educational organizations. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
