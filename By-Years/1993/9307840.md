9307840 Priestley This project carries out studies for the development of an
innovative prestressed reinforced concrete system utilizing precast beams
connected to columns by unbonded prestressing tendons continuous over the length
of the multi bay frame. The tendons provide continuity and moment resistance to
the beams and the tendons remain elastic when flexural cracking develops during
seismic response. The major tasks are (l) testings of large scale assemblages,
(2) modeling of hysterestic characteristics, (3) time history analyses of
multistory frames, and (4) design details development. Considerable advantages
in terms of increased frame ductility, simplified joint design, etc. might be
achieved through implementation of this innovative PRESSS system concept. ***
