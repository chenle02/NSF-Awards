This study will combine stratigraphic and structural mapping and palynological
analyses to obtain the detailed movement history of individual thrusts in the
Sevier orogenic belt of central Utah. Timing of the inception of the Sevier
thrusts is presently unconstrained. Conglomeratic sediments were deformed
syndespostionally by thrusts, and these conglomeratic rocks can be traced
laterally into pollen-bearing fine-grained sedimentary rocks. Thus the timing of
thrust inception can be obtained. The results of this study will improve our
understanding of the early stages of thrust belt development in the Sevier
orogen, and also in other tectonic environments.
