Through this activity the American Physical Society (APS) will expand its
existing efforts to assist in the development of physics infrastructure and to
aid young physicists in the former Soviet Union (FSU). The APS will support
regional summer schools, seminars and workshops; supplement the APS journal
distribution program to restore library subscriptions to key FSU research
institutions; and assist in the development of peer review systems in the FSU.
The APS Task Force, which is coordinating current Society initiatives in this
area with support through donations from the APS membership and a matching Sloan
Foundation grant, will provide oversight for this program. The Task Force
obtains advice from committees it has organized in Russia and Ukraine, from a
committee of expatriate FSU scholars resident in the U.S., and from the various
Divisions of the Society. The activities will be pursued in close cooperation
with the European Physical Society.
