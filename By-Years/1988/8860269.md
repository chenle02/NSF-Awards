Diseases caused by soilborne plant pathogens in containerized growing media
cause significant economic losses annually to greenhouse industries throughout
the world. A wide range of pesticides are applied in an attempt to control these
organisms, but pathogen protection within the growth media, or recolonization by
the pathogen, results in poor or short-lived control. Species of the naturally
occurring soilborne fungus, Trichoderma, have been shown to be effective
antagonists of several fungal plant pathogens. Recent efforts have been made to
incorporate biological disease control organisms into containerized nursery
operations, however, very few attempts have been made to combine this with other
beneficial organisms such as mycorrhizal fungi. In this study, several isolates
Trichoderma and the ectomycorrhizal fungus, Laccaria laccata will be evaluated
for their ability to co-establish and cooperate in the control of root pathogens
in a containerized growing media with Douglas fir. A series of experiments are
planned to establish the methodologies necessary for the co-selection,
inoculation and establishment of effective biocontrol systems for the
containerized nursery industry. Direct benefits include a low cost, long-lasting
and less hazardous system for the control of soilborne fungal pathogens which
would continue long after the planting stock leaves the nursery. This research
would lead to development of a biocontrol agent which, when introduced into
containerized growing media during its preparation, would control soilborne
pathogens present and prevent subsequent invasion of pathogens and disease
development on seedlings growing in the media. Its use would reduce the
expensive pesticides harmful to humans and their environment.
