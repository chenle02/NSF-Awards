The International Ethological Conference (IEC) was initiated over 50 years ago
and has been attended by participants from over 65 countries. The XXXI IEC will
be held 19-24 August, 2009 in Rennes, France and hosted by the University of
Rennes in association with the two major French behavior societies. The IEC is
the primary international gathering of scientists who focus on evolutionary and
mechanistic aspects of behavior. The conference includes participants from
diverse disciplines (ethology, comparative psychology, ecology, evolution,
conservation, psychobiology, anthropology, neurobiology, endocrinology,
parasitology, primatology, animal welfare, veterinary medicine and human
evolution) and the financial assistance provided to young scientists (recently
graduated Ph. D. students) will make it possible for individuals to attend who
might not otherwise have been able to afford travel expenses. A committee of
three United States IEC representatives will evaluate applications for funds
from young scientist participants. The committee members are committed to
assuring that diversity will be enhanced at the IEC and will select a diverse
group of scientists with respect to gender, career stage, and membership in
groups underrepresented in science. Information at the IEC is exchanged in
plenary lectures, symposia, contributed oral presentations, poster sessions and
informal conversations. Attendance and participation in the meeting offer an
unparalleled opportunity for American animal behaviorists to share their
research with an international audience, meet new colleagues and to initiate
cooperative, international projects.
