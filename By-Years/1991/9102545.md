This award provides funds for continuing support for developing and operating a
first-class, imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer. The major research thrust for
this IFPI is to study the dynamics and temperatures of the midlatitude mesopause
region. A secondary research thrust is to contribute to several global programs
involving thermospheric dynamics that are supported by CEDAR and STEP and to
participate in specific local research programs. The observations will be made
at Utah State University's Bear Lake Observatory.***//
