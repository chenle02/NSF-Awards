IRI-9508191 Sycara, Katia Carnegie Mellon University $50,000 - 12 mos Task-
Based Coordination of Intelligent Agents Due to advances in technology, diverse
and voluminous information is becoming available. This presents the potential
for improved decision support, but poses challenges in terms of building tools
to support users in accessing, filtering, evaluating and fusing information from
heterogeneous information sources to support user tasks. Current explorations of
Intelligent Agent technology have considered a single agent for each task that
acts as a user's assistant. This project explores coordination among different
agents that will collectively interact with other agents on a user's behalf to
find, fuse and utilize information in problem solving in support of user task. A
key component of the proposed research will be collaboration with Dr. Lemaitre
of the LANIA Research Institute in Mexico. Because of its bi- national nature,
the research effort is expected to have additional benefits, such as promotion
of international scientific collaboration, and additional opportunities for
experimental testing of our theories and research results.
