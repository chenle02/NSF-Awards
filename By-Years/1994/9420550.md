9420550 Deluisi There is growing concern in the scientific community and the
public at large regarding reports of increasing solar ultraviolet radiation
reaching the Earth's surface. Of particular concern is the increase in
biologically damaging ultraviolet-B radiation as a consequence of stratospheric
ozone depletion. In response to these concerns, several U.S. federal agencies
are conducting ultraviolet- monitoring and research activities to better
understand trends and effects of ultraviolet radiation. These efforts are
coordinated through the development of a U.S. interagency ultraviolet radiation
monitoring plan. The establishment of a National Ultraviolet Radiation
Calibration Facility is critical to the interagency efforts. The mission of the
facility is to insure that the data archived by networks that utilize the
facility's calibration resources will not suffer from disparate and ambiguous
calibrations that could compromise the validity of scientific conclusions
derived from the use of the data. This award provides funds for equipment for
the facility, which is being supported through the efforts of the National
Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States
Department of Agriculture, the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
