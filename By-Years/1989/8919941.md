Freed is developing theories of the corrections to Flory-Huggins theory for the
thermodynamic properties of polymer blends. The proposal deals with extensions
of Freed`s past work into new areas. In particular, Freed will work in four
areas: lattice model theory of concentrated solutions, melts and blends;
polymers at interacting surfaces; polymer dynamics; and, microphase separation
in block copolymers.
