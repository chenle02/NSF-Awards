This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
William J. le Noble at the State University of New York at Stony Brook to study
the electronic origins of pi- diastereofacial selectivity by using various
substituted adamantan-2-ones and related compounds. The specific projects are:
(1) addition reactions, including dihydroxylation, Grob fragmentation, Michael
addition, and Claisen rearrangement; (2) studies directed to differentiate
between the theoretical models of Ahn, Cieplak, and Felkin; (3) changes in
skeleton and substitution patterns by expanding/reducing adamantane by one
methylene unit at C6, by studying more powerful 5-substituent effects (N-oxides
and boron and ammonium compounds), by studying the 4,9-disubstitution effect, by
studying the 5,7-disubstitution effect, and by modifying the trigonal center at
C2. %%% In this project Professor William K. le Noble will study the electronic
effects that govern pi-diastereofacial selectivities in bond making (and
breaking) to (and from) ketones, imines, and olefins. The adamantane frame is
selected to eliminate interfering steric and conformational effects. The study
concentrates on standard addition reaction, differentiating between theoretical
models, and will explore the influence of powerful substituents and structural
rigidity.
