This renewal project addresses the role of the plant cytoskeleton during plant
development, with emphasis on the reorganization of microtubule arrays during
the life of a cell. Attention will be focussed on a system found to be
advantageous in prior studies, the dividing generative cell of Tradescantia,
which features what appears to be reutilization of Mts in different arrays. The
questions to be addressed include the mechanism governing conversion of
interphase microtubule bundles into kinetochore fibers, the manner in which
kinetochore fibers and surrounding microtubules are reorganized into large
superbundles during anaphase, the role of this reorganization in chromosome
motion, the mechanism governing constriction cytokinesis, and the role of
chromosome volume and physical constraints in the architecture of the division
apparatus. Principal approaches include immunofluorescence techniques,
conventional and confocal laser scanning microscopy, electron microscopy,
analyses of proteins in isolated generative cells, and the use of related
species of different ploidy levels. The long term goal of this work is to
understand the mechanisms governing reorganization of microtubules in plant
cells. Microtubules are important and dynamic structural elements in all
eukaryotic cells, and are known to play significant roles in the development and
maintenance of cell shape, intracellular movement of subcellular particles, and
in the segregation of chromosomes during cell division.
