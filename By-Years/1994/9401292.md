9401292 Parshall This project is concerned with the modular representation
theory of algebraic and associated finite groups. The principal investigators
are interested in a solution of the famous conjecture of Lusztig for characters
of the irreducible representations in characteristic larger than the Coxeter
number. A successful solution to this problem would have many ramifications for
finite groups. The work of the principal investigators has already established
an important connection between the representation theory of algebraic groups
and the theory of finite dimensional algebras. The principal investigators will
also work on problems concerning finite groups, Lie algebras, and quantum
groups. The research supported concerns the representation theory of finite
groups. A group is an algebraic object used to study transformations. Because of
this, groups are a fundamental tool in physics, chemistry and computer science
as well as mathematics. Representation theory is an important method for
determining the structure of groups.
