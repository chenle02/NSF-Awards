9626391 Lakin The investigator combines biomathematical modeling, computation,
scaling, asymptotics and perturbation techniques to obtain a more complete
understanding of basic physical mechanisms associated with dynamic processes in
the human intracranial system. A consistent, fully time-dependent, nonlinear
lumped parameter model describing interactions between pressures, volumes, and
flows in intracranial space is refined, validated, and expanded to include
additional physiology, such as cerebrovascular autoregulation and links to the
spinal cerebrospinal fluid space. First order processes and relevant time scales
are identified using scaling and asymptotic techniques. To achieve the higher
resolution necessary to consider focal events, dynamic modeling within
compartments and consistent linkage of sub-models with the rest of the lumped
parameter system is explored. Computational methods and strategies for efficient
numerical solution of the nonlinear model equations are developed. In
particular, results obtained using hybrid asymptotic-numerical methods show
great promise in the present context where processes occur on disparate time
scales. This project seeks to develop a realistic yet tractable mathematical
model for pressures and fluid flows in the human brain. Toward this end, the
current model formulation is extended to include additional human physiology,
such as cerebrovascular autoregulation, the mechanism which maintains the blood
flow in the brain necessary for adequate oxygen transfer in the face of
fluctuating blood pressure. New hybrid solution techniques are developed to
carry out efficient and accurate computer simulations of pressures and flows
based on the model equations. The enhanced model is also validated by comparing
its mathematical predictions with physiological data. Situations involving both
normal and pathophysiology are studied. This research is part of an
interdisciplinary effort involving both applied mathema ticians and
neurosurgeons. Although the developing mathematical model appears to have
significant clinical utility in situations involving pathology, clinical aspects
are not considered in the present research. The focus is entirely on increasing
our basic understanding of pressures and flows in the brain. Once developed and
validated, the enhanced mathematical model will be useful to researchers
studying applications associated with biotechnology. For example, regulation of
the vascular system in the brain plays a crucial role in conditions such as
trauma and stroke. Currently, nitric oxide is emerging as a key factor in
adjusting brain blood flow. The enhanced mathematical model, which includes a
vascular regulation equation, can be used to study the effect of nitric oxide
synthase (NOS) inhibitors on the brain. The development of NOS inhibitors is a
subject of great current interest to U.S. biotechnology companies.
