This equipment project involves the development and construction of an automated
flow calorimeter for the study of the thermophysical properties of non-
electrolyte fluids. The calorimeter will operate at high temperatures (289-700K)
and pressures (0-30MPa) and will be automatically monitored and controlled. It
will measure isobaric heat capacities with high precision (+/- .1 percent) in
the liquid, vapor, and supercritical regions, two-phase transitions, and heats
of vaporization resulting in an accurate map of the thermodynamic surface. The
calorimeter will be constructed around an existing precision metering pump which
will alleviate problems with flow measurement. The calorimeter will use an
electrical power input to directly measure thermal properties. The flow system
will be designed so that addition of modules to measure properties such as
isothermal throttling coefficient, density, thermal conductivity, and viscosity
can be later added.
