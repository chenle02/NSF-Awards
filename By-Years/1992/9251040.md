Over the past 15 years a radiation training laboratory and program has been
established and equipped through NSF Grants, local school support and industry
donations. St. Mary's College has become a center of excellence in the training
of radiation scientists. This project fills important gaps in the program's
instrumentation so that students can be properly prepared to enter the modern
industrial and academic research laboratories. Many modern scientific
instruments are now computer based, one central processing personal computer
runs several different instruments which are purchased as plug-in boards.
Operating instruments from a computer terminal is a fact of life in the
scientific laboratory of today. This method is rapidly replacing the dedicated
instrument. The computer based Multichannel Analyzer will give students this
important experience as well as strengthen their laboratory training in many
aspects of the radiation sciences.Various radiation detectors update the
collection of detectors and allow students to do interesting new experiments.
The use of high quality, up-to-date scientific instruments has proven a great
motivational factor for students. Their sense of confidence is greatly boosted
by these experiences and their interest in pursuing graduate studies has been
enhanced. About 60% of the physics majors and minors go on for graduate studies.
