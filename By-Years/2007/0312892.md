Exposing the compiler to the hardware: Memory Subsystem Optimizations through
Compiler/Micro-architecture Cooperation using Set Membership Information and
Color

Abstract

(Onder)

This research proposes to make use of the static knowledge obtained by the
compiler in the dynamic decision making of the micro-architecture. In that
respect, the compiler exposes compile-time analysis to the micro-architecture
fully using set membership information, and the micro-architecture uses this
information to make critical scheduling and memory optimization decisions. This
approach allows the examination of solutions to the memory wall problem that are
impossible to do using a hardware-only or fully compiler-managed solution. Using
set membership as a framework, this research will pursue the following problems:

1. Cost-effective run-time memory disambiguation of load/store operations to
increase the number of parallel memory operations;

2. Scalable cache and load/store queue designs that can sustain multiple memory
accesses every cycle for wide-issue superscalar processors;

3. Novel cache designs formed in cooperation with compiler-generated working-set
information to reduce the number of conflict and capacity misses; and,

4. Working-set based prefetching techniques to reduce the number of misses and
the miss penalty.

The proposed research will significantly improve the performance of scientific
applications. These applications are at the heart of basic science research, and
their performance is crucial for the advancement of many fields of science. This
research will also strengthen the synergy between compilers and micro-
architectures, and advance the state-of-the-art in information technology.
