AST-0123516&lt;br/&gt;Brown, Michael E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced
Electro-Optical System (AEOS) on Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii of the US Air Force
with its adaptive optics system will be used to monitor the weather on Titan to
determine the location, formation rate and evolution of large scale cloud
outbursts. Measurements of the speed of the winds made in this work will provide
data for an estimate of the drift of the Huygens Titan probe on the Cassini
spacecraft. This will establish how long the probe can be expected to remain in
communication contact with scientists. The behavior of the Methane condensation
(clouds on Titan) events is of immediate interest to the interpretation of
Huygens data and will provide important insight into the dynamical behavior of
the atmosphere and possible localized sources of condensable Methane. A graduate
student will carry out much of this work. &lt;br/&gt;***
