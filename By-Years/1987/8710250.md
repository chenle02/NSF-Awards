This project continues a line of research focusing on investor behavior,
managerial objectives, asset pricing, and capital structure. Under the previous
award the investigator concentrated on developing and analyzing single-period
models in conjunction with various combinations of possible financial
instruments. In particular, he analyzed the call provisions of convertible
bonds, which is a relatively simple situation, to gain a better understanding of
managerial objectives, conflicting interests between management and
stockholders, and the rationality and objectives of stockholders. The purpose of
this project is to extend the analysis to a multi-period setting, where
financial managers and investors have asymmetric information. This research is
important because it will provided a more fundamental understanding of financial
markets. The research results should shed light on the issue of to what extent
do financial managers adopt strategies that maximize shareholder wealth.
