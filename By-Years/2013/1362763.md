In this project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Amir H. Hoveyda of the Department of Chemistry at Boston
College and his research team of postdoctoral fellow, graduate scholars and
undergraduate students, as well as some high school students, design and develop
Ru-based catalysts that are easily accessible, robust and stable and yet promote
an efficient and selective manner one of the most important sets of
transformations in chemistry: olefin metathesis. Their exciting catalysts are
licensed by a company (XiMo, AG), which develops protocols for large scale
(multi-ton) production of polymers or pharmaceuticals. One of the most, if not
the most, widely used catalyst set for olefin metathesis, was discovered under
the auspices of the present NSF-funded project (popularly referred to as
"Hoveyda-Grubbs catalysts").&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project facilitates the
development of environmentally benign catalytic reactions that convert cheap and
common unsaturated hydrocarbons and other simple organic molecules to those that
are much more valuable and can be used to address a variety of compelling
problems in human health care as well as improvement of the quality of life. The
Hoveyda team develops catalysts that promote olefin metathesis processes
efficiently and, importantly, with exceptional levels of stereoselectivity; that
is, in reactions where a mixture of products are feasible, their catalysts
manage just to produce one form. This goal is important for several reasons.
Firstly, different isomers possess entirely different shapes (one is U- and the
other is Z-shaped) and thus induce different responses in a biological setting
or generate materials with completely different properties. Secondly, separation
of isomeric mixtures, which is what is generally produced with many of the
existing catalysts, is not only costly, difficult and time consuming, it leads
to generation of significant amounts of waste.
