This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science project
between Professor Frederick Frey, Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and
Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Masaaki
Obata, Department of Geology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan. This project
is part of Professor Frey's current research to determine the trace element and
isotropic systematics of minerals and whole-rocks from contiguous layers in the
Horoman peridotite, Hokkaido, which grew out of a conference in July 1990
sponsored by the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program. At that time, Professor
Frey and his colleagues at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution obtained
samples of the Horoman peridotite that they brought back to study in their
petrologic and geochemical analytical laboratories. During Professor Frey's
visit to Japan in 1992 he will discuss his laboratory results and revisit and
study important field locations.
