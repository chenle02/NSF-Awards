The project converts a printed circuit board-based manufacturing facility into a
laboratory for the integrated design and manufacture of electronic products.
Specifically, the design content of this lab is expanded by considering the
logical and physical design of the circuit, reliability analyses, manufacturing
process design, and life-cycle costing. In addition, the manufacturing content
is expanded to encompass activities such as CAM, quality and process control,
and production control. These educational objectives are obtained by adding
design, analysis &amp; control software, and material, mechanical and electrical
testing hardware (to provide design and process feedback) to an already
substantial equipment base.
