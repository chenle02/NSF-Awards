The systems to be studied arise as models for communciation systems, computer
networks, and manufacturing systems. As engineering systems become more complex,
their mathematical analysis at the design stage becomes increasingly important.
Considerations of the applicability of the mathematical models studied during
this year will be central to the activity.
