This project will improve both the knowledge of science and the techniques of
teaching science of junior high school teachers. Twenty- four participants will
be selected from the Gaston County area of North Carolina. The objective will be
to provide a background in both theory and the laboratory which can be readily
and directly incoporated into the classroom. The format for this project will be
a four-week period of course work during the summer to be followed by a series
of nine, late afternoon workshops during the regular school year. The summer
work will combine both lecture and laboratory work and will lay necessary
groundwork for the continuing series of workshops. At the end of each year a
participant will be selected to become a part of the teaching faculty for the
following year.
