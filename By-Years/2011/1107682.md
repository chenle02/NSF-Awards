The goal of this project is to study the relationship between supermassive black
hole growth and galaxy evolution at the highest redshifts by carrying out
detailed observations of the most distant quasars and their host galaxies using
ALMA and new optical/near-IR facilities. The program will obtain deep, high
resolution submillimeter continuum and [CII]/CO line observations of a complete
sample of SDSS quasars at redshifts around 6 during the ALMA early science
phase. These observations will reach an order magnitude deeper than current
limits, and will be used to measure star formation rate, size, and gas
kinematics of the host galaxies, and provide estimates of the galaxy dynamical
mass. The program will also use new sensitive near-IR spectrographs on 6-10m
telescopes, including Magellan, LBT and VLT, to measure supermassive black hole
masses and chemical abundances in the environments of distant quasars. The
observations will map the accretion and growth history of quasar central black
holes, and probe the star formation and galaxy assembly history of their host
galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergraduate and graduate students, and pathfinding use of ALMA in early
science mode.
