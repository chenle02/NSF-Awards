This Pathways proposal seeks to find the most effective means for communicating
research, research processes and ocean sciences to the public from the ocean
ship Joides Resolution (JR). The JR is an NSF-supported research vessel that
assists scientists and educators in their quest for understanding the science of
oceans and ocean floors worldwide. The goal of this project is to find the best
mechanism for communicating science through the numerous platforms of informal
science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a series of discussions by
stakeholders that include scientists, educators, end-users in the informal
science education community and evaluators, 3-5 pilot projects will be selected
for further elaboration, testing and evaluation for communication methodologies.
From these studies and refinements, models for communication will be produced
for further implementation. Partners in this venture include: Consortium for
Ocean Leadership's Deep Earth Academy (DEA)and the Education Division for the
Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
enhance the public's understanding of oceans, ocean floors, and related research
in these elements, and inspire younger individuals who may consider ocean
science as a career. Models for how best to communicate the world of ocean
science will be tested and disseminated through informal science education
networks and platforms. Further, models for evaluation of this multidisciplinary
science endeavor will be helpful to advancing the informal science education
field.
