The objective of the proposed research is the metabolic engineering of Bacillus
subtilis for reduced acid formation and enhanced product yield. Preliminary work
in both E. coli and B. subtilis showed that the addition of citrate allowed
enhancements in growth and product formation. Acid formation was also
substantially lowered. These improvements were tied to the level of pyruvate in
the cell. Direct deletion of the pyk gene, NMR experiments, and flux modeling
confirmed these results. The specific objectives of this research include: (1)
improving the performance of B. subtilis which shows reduced growth with the pyk
mutant, and (2) utilization of these results for the improvement of toxin
production in Bacillus thuringiensis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
