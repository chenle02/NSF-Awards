This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research proposal will develop a
printable conductive ink for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) antenna
applications. Currently, most RFID antennas are etched or wire coil, either
copper or aluminum, made by wire winding copper wire or etching films that have
had copper applied to them. These require expensive processes to form the
antenna. In addition, current antennas are fragile and susceptible to breakage,
rendering the RFID tag useless. Silver inks, used for screen printable
processes, are also expensive because of the valuable metal, present
environmental problems, and lack performance. The objective of this work is to
develop a highly conductive ink that can be used in an inexpensive screen
printable process. This ink will then be applied to an appropriate substrate to
fabricate and test flexible RFID antennas. These RFID antennas are expected to
be cost about 90% less than comparable copper antennas, encouraging the adoption
and improving the reliability of RFID technology for a wide variety of
identification and tracking applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications
include high frequency tag antennas, reader (small to large) inductor antennas,
RF air interface enhancements and passive field focusing couplers, chipless
antenna tuning balun (balanced / unbalanced) circuits, and chipless printable
RFID. This will result in replacement of higher-cost copper antennas and one
that will out perform the silver ink antennas. Commercial applications in
situations where low cost and reliability are desirable, such as tracking
documents and confidential information are likely. &lt;br/&gt;
