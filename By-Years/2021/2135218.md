This project includes laboratory investigations of the atmospheric reaction
kinetics and the chemical and physical transformations of toxic chemical
additives to plastics (e.g., plasticizers, antimicrobials, and UV filters) in
the environment. These additives often end up in the oceans where they can leach
into the surrounding water, becoming enriched in the sea surface microlayer.
There they can become airborne as components of aerosol in the marine
environment and travel long distances, serving as a respirable pathway for human
exposure and impacting air quality in downwind regions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following scientific questions will be addressed: (1)
What are the chemical lifetimes of plastic additives in the aerosol phase with
respect to heterogeneous reactions with hydroxyl radical (OH)? (2) How does
particle composition, with respect to concentrations of inorganic ions (e.g.,
NaCl), organic matter, and presence of photosensitizing dissolved organic matter
(DOM) influence OH reactive uptake and degradation kinetics of plastic additives
in the aerosol phase? (3) Does addition of marine-relevant photosensitizing DOM
degrade aerosol-phase plastic additives upon visible/UV irradiation in the
absence of OH, is it competitive with heterogeneous oxidation, and what are the
dominant photosensitized pathways? (4) Do gaseous semi-volatile UV filters
oxidize in the gas phase to produce appreciable secondary organic
aerosol?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort and includes support and training for
a postdoctoral researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
