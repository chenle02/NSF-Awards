This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the "Oxtoby Centennial Conference"
that will be held at Bryn Mawr College on October 30-31, 2010.

The purpose of this conference is to celebrate the legacy of John C. Oxtoby
(1911-1991), a longtime faculty member at Bryn Mawr College and a driving force
in the evolution of that institution's strong mathematics program. The focus of
the conference is on the areas of ergodic theory and measure theory, in which
Oxtoby was a figure of great influence by virtue of both his research
contributions and his pioneering graduate text on measure theory. Both topics,
but especially ergodic theory, remain central and extremely active subjects of
current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people, including
undergraduates, will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged
in the various conference activities.
