Clustering is a crucial component of exploratory data analysis. This project
aims to develop novel algorithms that address various shortcomings of k-means,
the most widely used clustering algorithm. Specific objectives include (a) the
development of initialization methods to address the sensitivity of k-means to
the initial cluster centers; (b) the investigation of alternative distance
measures to address the sensitivity of k-means to outliers; and (c) the
development of practical acceleration methods. Innovations developed during this
project should be readily applicable to a wide range of clustering algorithms.
For example, initialization is crucial for most clustering algorithms.
Furthermore, an effective initialization method can be used independently of
k-means as a standalone clustering algorithm. K-means is often used as a
subroutine in other learning algorithms. Therefore, development of acceleration
methods for k-means is of great practical interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project is expected to make broader impacts on several fronts. At the
international level, we intend to make significant contributions to the data
mining literature by publishing in top-ranked journals. At the national level,
we aim to enhance the competitiveness of the US by seeding the next generation
of scientists. At the regional level, we hope to improve the quality of
education in an EPSCoR state and contribute to the development of a diverse and
skilled workforce. At the institutional level, we intend to improve the research
environment and the curriculum of our Computer Science program. Finally, at the
individual level, we hope to increase the participation of students from
underrepresented groups in research and equip them with valuable skills
including self-confidence, independent thinking/problem solving, and effective
communication.
