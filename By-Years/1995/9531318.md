Dr. Kenneth Merz and other members of the Chemistry Department at Pennsylvania
State University at University Park are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98,
ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects from a broad offering in analytical, bioorganic,
biophysical, inorganic, organic, physical, and materials chemistry. Students
participate in lunch-time seminars on current research, in talks on the
theoretical background and practical aspects of major instruments used in
chemical research, and discussions on research ethics. Students are recruited
locally and from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.
