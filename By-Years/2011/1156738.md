This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science
Foundation supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at
University of Memphis. The REU Program will bring ten students to campus for ten
weeks each summer for an intensive research experience. These students will
synthesize materials with varied properties and potential applications.
Theoretical studies of these materials and their properties will complement
experimental studies. Other research examples include the synthesis,
characterization, and theoretical investigation of bistable photochromic
materials for development as optical switches or optical memory devices, the
synthesis and characterization of gold nanoparticles for single-cell biosensor
applications, and the development and characterization of water-soluble analogs
of G protein-coupled receptors, an important class of membrane proteins. The
membrane-protein studies would enable alternative strategies for studying the
structure and activation mechanisms of this important class of receptors.
Results from these and other proposed projects will be disseminated through
publications and presentations. Travel funds for REU participants will allow
presentations at national and regional meetings during the year following their
research experience. An important addition to the current recruiting plan is an
expanded effort to enable the participation of students who are parents in this
intensive research experience. Therefore, this REU site will broadly impact
training in chemistry, the participation of underrepresented minorities, and
student parent participation in chemical research. The REU Site will also
promote partnerships between the University of Memphis and regional HBCU
institutions.
