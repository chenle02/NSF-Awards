"Anaerobic Dehalogenation and Its Environmental Implications" to be held at the
Georgia Continuing Education Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA. The
tentative dates of the conference are Aug. 30 to Sept 4, 1992. Additional
support for the conference is being request from the Environment Protection

developments in microbial mediated dehalogenation of toxic contaminants and
interest in biomediation as a strategy for environmental clean-up underscore a
need for an international conference on these new developments. This conference
will focus specifically on microbial dehalogenation processes with the aim of
integrating and advancing our understanding on this process.
