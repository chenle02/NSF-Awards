AST-0205815 &lt;br/&gt;Beers, Timothy C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Beers is
awarded funds at Michigan State University to work with collaborators at the
University of Texas at Austin and Ohio State University. This team will lay the
groundwork for a more detailed understanding of how our Milky Way galaxy formed
and evolved. Models of galaxy formation and evolution depend on understanding
the motions and chemical enrichment of local main-sequence stars that are far
lower in heavy elements than ordinary stars, and how these stars compare to
globular cluster stars. The known sample of these "subdwarfs" is very
small.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Beers and collaborators will study a new sample
of these subdwarf stars in the&lt;br/&gt;Galaxy's halo and thick disk; this
sample represents a huge increase over the number of subdwarfs previously
studied. The investigators will obtain accurate and self-consistent measures of
temperature, reddening, and composition for a critically selected sample of
approximately 150 subdwarfs identified in recent surveys for metal-poor stars.
They will also apply theoretical models to explore the dependence of the main-
sequence luminosity on detailed stellar chemical composition. The results will
be used to improve the temperature and abundance scales of globular cluster main
sequences for comparison to spectroscopic determinations on the giant branch,
and to thus determine the relative ages and distances of globular
clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
