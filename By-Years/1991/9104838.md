This research will use a combination of coincident vertical- incidence and
wide-angle reflection profiling to study the controversial Boulder batholith, a
late-Cretaceous epizonal granite in Montana. While much progress has been made
on granite petrogenesis through studies of melting relations, isotopes and trace
elements, little use has been made of modern seismic techniques that can image
the subsurface with much higher resolution than has previously been possible.
The nature of the seismic boundaries, including the Moho, which may be
reconstituted during batholith emplacement, will be determined through forward
modeling by illuminating them with P-, S- and converted waves at different
angles of incidence.
