INT 9722488 Musfeldt This U.S.-Hungary research project between Janice Musfeldt
of the State University of New York at Binghamton and Katalin Kamaras of the
Hungarian Institute for Solid State Physics, Budapest, will contribute to our
basic knowledge of structural phase transitions in low-dimensional organic
solids. Specifically, their efforts will feature characterization of the C60
photopolymer in a variety of structural phases, including: order-disorder and
glassy behavior in pure single crystals, doping induced structural
modifications, and nano-phases such as tubules and wires. The U.S. contribution
will feature low-temperature infrared and pulsed EPR (electron paramagnetic
resonance) measurements while the Hungarian contributions will include polymer
film growth, structural analysis and thermal characterization. Results should
contribute to our ability to correlate the spectral, magnetic and thermal
response to the chemical structure of this polymer. This project in materials
research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence. ??
