9504293 Brooks One of the most promising capabilities of modern Atomic Force
Microscopes (AFMs) is the ability to measure surface properties (such as
conductance) along with topographic information. It is an open question how best
to display multiple properties simultaneously to the user. Possible
representations include surface color, transparency and shininess; sound
modulated by the value of the property; and various force parameters, such as
surface texture and stickiness. In this project subjects such as which channels
are best for conveying which parameters and how many channels can independently
carry information will be investigated. Various physical and virtual hand-held
tools to see which is most useful will be studied. This is similar to a
carpenter who has various tools for cutting, smoothing and engraving. So might a
surface scientist want different tools for different tools for different tasks.
Working with surface scientists, which tools and visualizations are most
effective can be determined. A new and more powerful interface to AFMs will be
designed and built. ***
