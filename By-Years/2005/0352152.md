Project Summary This Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) for SCADA and IT
systems workshop brings together a multi-disciplinary team of control, power
system, and security experts to discuss areas of Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) and information technologies (IT). The meeting draws on both
academia and industry expertiseto explore new ways to combat the information
infrastructure vulnerabilities in industrial and infrastructure control systems.

SCADA and IT communities have traditionally had very little cross-fertilization.
For example, SCADA systems traditionally focused on the electronics and hardware
solutions to security, whereas IT internet-based security has been predominantly
a software discipline. In recent years, SCADA systems, however, are increasingly
using software implementations to replace the older hardware systems, making
these physical control systems potentially accessible via the Internet. The
insertion of maintenance, monitoring, debugging, and repair hooks into SCADA
systems for remote maintenance and diagnostics can provide the basis for
unauthorized access and security breeches. Since IT has been addressing these
breeches for some time, it is expected that those professionals have insights to
help SCADA operators. Similarly, the SCADA operators have been designing
networks that are robust to failure for some time. The workshop will provide a
forum for exploring the relationship of current practice and known weaknesses to
the challenges and opportunities that may exist for SCADA systems in the future.
The primary goal of this workshop is to identify both the near-term technology
solutions and the longer-term research needed to secure and strengthen the U.S.
industrial infrastructure.
