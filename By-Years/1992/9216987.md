This award supports a conference entitled: "Representation Theory and Analysis
on Homogeneous Spaces". The conference will be held February 5-7, 1993, on the
campus of Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey. The conference will be
concerned with harmonic analysis on nilpotent and solvable Lie groups,
representation theory of real reductive Lie groups, representations of p-adic
groups, infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, discrete groups, and
spectral theory of invariant differential operators on homogeneous spaces with
applications to local solvability and regularity of more general differential
operators. The purpose of the conference is to create an environment for cross-
fertilization among the above-named subfields of "non-abelian harmonic analysis"
and to emphasize the connections between them.
