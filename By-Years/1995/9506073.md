9506073 Mukherjee The objective of this grant is to explore the feasibility of
laser-assisted, die-less superplastic forming. Computer numerically-controlled
laser energy is applied to a sheet of superplastic alloy under a hydrostatic
pressure to develop a desired concave or convex "bulge". The position, shape,
and the amount of displacement in a given area is controlled by the local laser
energy coupling aided by the computer controlled motion of the assembly. This
motion of the assembly (or the laser beam) is based on a finite element
prediction of thermal and displacement parameter mapping. Microstructure and
strain-rate sensitivity parameters are taken into consideration for the
analysis. The proposed research is a collaborative effort between three faculty
members with experience in the necessary areas of expertise required for this
study: laser processing, superplastic deformation, and finite element analysis.
%%% This program is the first comprehensive investigation of a new laser-
materials processing technology on die-less superplastic forming. The
combination of studies with application of computers for laser processing,
superplastic deformation, finite element analysis, microstructure and strain-
rate sensitivity will produce an innovative forming process. *** KEYWORDS:
