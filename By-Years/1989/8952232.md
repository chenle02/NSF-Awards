The purchase of a liquid scintillation counter will enhance student laboratory
opportunities in molecular biology, plant and animal physiology and
endocrinology, as well as student research linking current techniques to
radioisotope detection and use. The instrument will also aid in linking field
and laboratory experiences by using animals at the college's field station in
studying endocrinology, immunology and nutrition. The university will provide
50% matching funds.
