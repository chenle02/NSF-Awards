AST-9619230 Stellar Abundances in the Galactic Center. Dr. Kristen Sellgren will
initiate a study of the chemical evolution history in the dust-obscured center
of the Milky Way galaxy. A two-pronged approach will combine high resolution
infrared spectra of 30 Galactic Center stars with moderate resolution infrared
spectra of more than 200 Galactic Center stars. The goal of the project is to
test recent ideas that inflowing gas from the disk of the Galaxy fuels sustained
star formation in a central zone of molecular gas which is within a radius of
200 parsecs of the Galactic Center. ============================================
