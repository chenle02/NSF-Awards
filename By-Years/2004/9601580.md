Infrastructure: The Purchase of a Scaleable Parallel Computer to Complete the
High End Computing Infrastructure This Academic Research Infrastructure award
supports the acquisition of a high speed SMD computing systems operating at a
peak speed of approximately 15 GFLops. The research projects supported by the
equipment include: 1. Astrophysics research in simulation of cosmic ray
cascades. 2. Numerical simulations of strong nuclear interactions. 3. Molecular
structure simulations. 4. Quantum chemistry. 5. Applied seismology. 6. Advanced
materials including nanostructures and electronic properties of solids. 7.
Atmospheric physics.
