This project provides Electrical Engineering Technology undergraduate students
with a low cost and modern approach to laboratory instrumentation, circuit and
system design. This laboratory facility allows the students to quickly access
hardware and software programs so they can do both analysis and design of
circuits and systems. Analog-to-digital and digital- to-analog converters and
software added to the personal computers allow the students to build complex
systems, concentrating on the principles. Because of the flexibility, the system
can be customized to suit investigative and/or educational problems. With
powerful software design tools and interface hardware students design, simulate,
and test circuits and systems from the workstation. The equipment allows
electrical engineering technology students to design and analyze systems with
the same operating technology as their industrial counterparts, and learn
industry standard operations and practices.
