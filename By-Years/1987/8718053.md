In recent years it has been discovered that most, if not all, hormone molecules
in the blood of mammals are bound to particular molecules. Many of these
proteins, called binding proteins, are highly specific or selective for single
hormone or a group of related hormones. Thus, it is becoming clear that these
hormone binding proteins are much more common and widespread than imagined.
Apart from carrying their particular proteins for particular hormones, it is
believed that they serve more important functions than transport alone. We are
studying a binding protein which is specific for the sex steroid hormones,
namely sex steroid-binding protein (SBP). This protein undergoes large increases
in concentration during the reproductively important periods of puberty,
pregnancy, and reactivation of seasonal activity. The purpose of the proposed
study is to purify this protein so that it can be labeled and administered to
pubertal animals in order to determine 1) where the protein goes during this
period (e.g., does this protein leave the circulation and become concentrated in
the target tissues of sex steroid hormones?) and 2) what role this protein may
play in the important actions of hormonal steroids during the pubertal process.
