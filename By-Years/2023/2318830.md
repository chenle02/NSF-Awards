A profound question that underlies much inquiry across scientific disciplines is
that of what forms admit desired properties and behaviors. The focus of this
project is on a molecular biology instantiation. The rapid growth of publicly-
available small molecular databases has spawned much research and interest
recently in deep learning treatments of in-silico molecule design and
optimization. While many of the existing deep learning methods demonstrate their
ability to generate chemically-valid molecules, they are currently limited in
their ability to inform wet-laboratory studies aiming to exert control and
answer the following question: can your informatics model generate molecules
that are constrained to these specific regions of a landscape of biological
properties of interest? Models, findings, and data will be disseminated broadly
with the scientific community. The investigators will jointly mentor students of
all levels. They connect their efforts with their institutionâ€™s infrastructures
to broaden the impact of their educational and outreach activities and ensure
the participation of diverse students across the various disciplines that come
together in this project.

This project advances property-controlled molecule generation. A key insight
propelling it is that machine learning models need to be situated in biological
data and knowledge. The research activities are organized in three thrusts: (1)
developing generalizable and interpretable models capable of incorporating
biological constraints, (2) accommodating small, incomplete, and noisy wet-
laboratory data, and (3) integrating computation and wet-lab inquiry under an
active learning formulation. The project catalyzes synergistic and innovative
work at the interface of machine learning, AI, generative AI, and the biological
sciences to address long-standing challenges in molecular biology both broadly
and specifically on quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), small disinfectant
antimicrobial compounds, where structural innovation has been sorely lacking and
resistant bacteria represent an uncountered threat.
