During the last two years research in machine vision has used psychological
evidence to develope a representation for shape that attempts to capture
people's notions about the part structure of 3-D objects. The mathematical basis
for this representation is superquadric profile solids, linear and quadratic
deformations, and contructive solid geometry (CSG). The concise nature of this
representation has led to the development of a technique for approximating the
minimal length encoding of range data in terms of this 3-D shape representation.
This technique has been used to experimentally demonstrated both learning and
recognition of 3-D objects in unconstrained outdoor environments. The current
technique, however, is still quite experimental. Further, it is inefficient on
serial machines, has difficulties with largely occluded forms, and is limited to
use with range data. This project, therefore, will investigate the potential for
improving the reliability, efficiency, and applicability of our general approach
by (1) incorporating feature information such as edges, corners, and
T-junctions, (2) employing a coarse- to-fine search strategy, (3) extending the
current technique to multiple views (e.g., stereo and motion), and (4)
investigating how our technique might be adapted for use with standard intensity
imagery.
