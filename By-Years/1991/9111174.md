This project will apply Levi's knowledge acquisition model to estimation and
identification. The resulting epistemic utility estimators will have the
following characteristics: (a) estimates will consist of all values that are
seriously possible given the data, available a priori information, and the
decision agent's values and goals, and, (b), the willingness to risk error in
return for information is explicitly specified.
