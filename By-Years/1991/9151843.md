This project addresses the upgrade of the the Universal Testing Machine (UTM), a
key piece of equipment in the materials engineering laboratory, by interfacing
with computers and automating the data acquisition process. As a result,
undergraduate students obtain a better understanding of material behavior and
testing techniques.
