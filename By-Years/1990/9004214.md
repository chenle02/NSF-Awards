The University of North Florida will connect their campus network to SURAnet
(Southeastern Universities Research Association network, a regional network
which is part of the NSFNET). Direct connection to SURAnet will provide
researchers with improved access to national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet and
USENET. Improvement is sought in reliability, speed, turn- around, flexibility,
and functions such as file transfer, remote login, and teleconferencing. The
University of North Florida will join the Florida State University System's FIRN
InterLAN project by linking to SURAnet. This project provides sharing of
resources among the nine state institutions. This link will greatly facilitate
research by students and faculty, and will provide a valuable resource to
supplement course work.
