The media, many businesses, and many academicians are proclaiming the
information highway and the web as providing universal access to information and
as providing the infrastructure in which a Oglobal villageO and Ovirtual
organizationsO will emerge. Within this infrastructure, individuals are assumed
to be able to freely interact and have their ideas compete in an open market.
This assumption, however, neglects the fact that people continually form groups
and that groups develop norms and procedures that restrict the flow of
information and prevent non-group members from having the same benefits as group
members. IndividualsO communication behavior is significantly affected by groups
that emerge in on-line communities. This proposal is to investigate the
evolution of electronic groups and to ascertain the factors affecting group
formation and maintenance on this information highway. One of the outcomes of
this work will be an empirically validated model of electronic group
development. By investigating the development of naturally occurring electronic
groups, this work is expected to contribute to the study of group dynamics and
investigations of the impact and use of new telecommunication technologies.
