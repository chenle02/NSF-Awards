The proposed collaborative project from Lafayette College and California
Polytechnic State University is rooted in the theory of intersectionality as it
relates to gender and race/ethnicity. The project has three major objectives
that include assessing the attentiveness of recent ADVANCE programs to issues
germane to women of color, examining the rationale of those strategies utilized
in addressing the underrepresentation of women of color and identifying
successful practices and strategies that have been successfully implemented in
the ADVANCE program. This project, which represents the first systematic
exploration of the ADVANCE program and its focus on women of color will combine
a pilot study, funded proposal content analysis and interviews with funded
ADVANCE project personnel. It is expected that the outcomes of this effort will
support the ADVANCE program in promoting inclusiveness as it relates to gender
equity.
