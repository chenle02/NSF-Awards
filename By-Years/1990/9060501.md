ABSTRACTS For many language processing applications, wide coverage of the
language is important. That is, it is important for the parser to assign
reasonable structures to many strings of the language. Wide coverage has not
been achieved in spite of many person-years of effort. The grammars of wide
coverage of the language gets better. This project will demonstrate that this
bottleneck can be avoided by an efficient parser that is designed to accept a
superset of the language. The problem that such systems have encountered in the
past comes not from the acceptance of ungrammatical strings, but from the
detection of spurious ambiguity in grammatical strings. This problem is avoided
on the present approach by using new and more powerful disambiguation strategies
based on a more systematic representation of semantic properties and commonsense
knowledge than has been available before, together with powerful automatic
reasoning techniques. Phase I will specify the design of this system in detail
and use a careful assessment of prototype performance to establish the
feasibility of the proposed design for commercial applications. In Phase II the
specified design will be built and tested in target applications.
