The mammalian skull is an integrated complex of overlapping units that are
involved in multiple functions such as breathing, vision, hearing, smelling and
swallowing. Therefore most morphological features in the skull tend to be
considerably inter-correlated, limiting variation. Non-independent cranial
features, however, are problematic for reconstructing evolutionary
relationships, because they subjectively bias efforts to group most-closely
related species. This study uses CAT scans and radiographs of primate skulls to
test several hypotheses about interrelationships between the brain, cranial base
and face in primates, in order to assess specifically the utility of skull
characters for reconstructing evolutionary relationships in primates and human
ancestors. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate techniques, including scaling
and matrix analyses, will be used to test patterns of constraint and integration
among skull characters in 70 primate species and growth samples of 10 species of
monkeys and apes. Preliminary results suggest that constraints which result from
integration, while rare, considerably affect variations in primate skull form
and should be taken into account when testing phylogenetic hypotheses about
primate and human evolution.&lt;br/&gt;
