The research entails investigations into aspects of value distribution theory in
several complex variables and complex geometry with special attention to classes
of complex curves in complex projective planes. The methods and techniques are
likely to have ramifications to other branches of mathematics, in particular,
algebraic and arithmetic geometry and number theory.
