This proposal is for a new grant for work on the `gatedaemon' software package
which has been invaluable to the NSFNET community of networks in allowing the
exchange of routing information between administrative areas which use
incompatible routing protocols. New funding is also sought to work on issues
which are considered critical for supporting interfaces between the NSFNET
Backbone Network and the Midlevel Networks including experimentation in policy-
based routing and other routing issues.***
