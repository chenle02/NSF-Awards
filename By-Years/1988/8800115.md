This equipment grant provides funds for a focal plane detector system to be
used in conjunction with superconducting solenoid spectrometers. The combined
detector/spectrometer system will have numerous applications in nuclear physics
research as a highly efficient large solid angle collector for the products of
nuclear reactions induced by heavy ions.
