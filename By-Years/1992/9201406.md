This grant provides partial support for travel of 20 scientists to a conference
on Great Subduction Zone Earthquakes to be held September 1992 in Fairbanks,
Alaska. The focus of the conference will be on the Shumagin Gap, a zone along
the Aleutian Islands chain in southwest Alaska that has been designated by the
International Association for Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior as
a test site for international collaboration on earthquake prediction research.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
