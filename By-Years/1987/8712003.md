This is a proposal for support of a conference on vision to be held July 26-31,
1987. It is part of the FASEB conference series, modelled on and sharing many of
the virtues of the Gordon Research Conferences. The number of participants is
relatively small; this favors communication among them. The format also promotes
interaction among the conferees, who live and eat together during the week of
the conference. Since all discussion is "off the record" open communication is
encouraged. The topics are well chosen and integrated. This conference should be
of considerable value to the progress of research in the field of vision science
and represents an excellent investment for NSF, which is providing less than 20
per cent of the total budget for conference expenses.
