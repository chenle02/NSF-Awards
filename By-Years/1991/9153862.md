Lesley College initially requested support for a two-year project to be an
extension and elaboration of its current project, Creating Communities of
Inquiry. The three central activities of the project are: (1) providing the
opportunity for 80 elementary school teachers per year in the Boston and
Cambridge, Massachusetts to "shadow" practicing scientists in the private sector
for 90 hours, following which they will jointly develop a science activity for
the classroom; (2) establishing electronic networks that will permit electronic
mail communication among the teachers' classrooms, industry scientists'
laboratories, and possibly college and university laboratories; (3) conducting
bimonthly teleconference among the teachers and their mentors to share
experiences and ideas. In the course of negotiations the project's duration
became 4 years, the number of teachers affected became 160, and the private
sector's contributions more than doubled.
