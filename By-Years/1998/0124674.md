0124674&lt;br/&gt;Logan&lt;br/&gt;This project is to develop a new technology to
create a biologically based source of clean hydrogen from wastewater. The main
barrier to efficient conversion of dissolved organic matter in wastewater is
preventing interspecies hydrogen transfer so that hydrogen generated through
fermentation processes is not lost to anaerobic microorganisms. To prevent
interspecies transfer, the microbes responsible for fermentation will be
separated from those responsible for methane production using a two-tank
membrane bioreactor. The purpose of the membrane is to control cell detention
time in the first reactor so that slow-growing methanogens are not able to exist
in the first tank and will therefore be unable to significantly degrade the
hydrogen produced from fermentation. The reactor is to be operated in a mode
that has been shown to limit membrane biofouling in suspended growth reactors.
