This award will provide one-half the funds necessary to purchase two computer
workstations for seismological and geophysical research in the Department of
Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University, St. Louis. The remaining
funds needed are to be committed by Washington University. The workstations will
be used primarily for NSF sponsored research projects including the study of
deep seismic attenuation and velocity structure of back- arc rifts, near- source
structural effects on earthquake body waveforms, the source parameters of
earthquakes (particularly tsunami earthquakes), and the study of intraplate
deformation and stress using earthquake seismology and stress modeling.
