The University of Texas-Pan American is a Hispanic serving institution,
committed to increasing the representation and success of women in STEM fields
across faculty and leadership ranks, particularly for Latinas. This commitment
is facilitated through the implementation of an integrated approach that is
rooted in the American Psychological Association?s Psychologically Healthy
Workplace Practices (HWP) and supported by an Office of the Vice Provost for
Faculty Affairs, ongoing support for faculty, a self-assessment study, a
sustainability plan, and the establishment of a broad coalition of faculty and
administrators who ensure the successful implementation and institutionalization
of the NSF ADVANCE project at UTPA. Specifically, this ADVANCE project
addresses: faculty recruitment and advancement, policy and climate, education
and empowerment and social science research that is intended to broaden and
deepen the knowledge base related to issues that hinder the success of women,
particularly Latinas, in STEM fields. As such, the UT Pan American ADVANCE
program has the potential to seminally contribute to a deeper and more inclusive
understanding of gender equity in the STEM disciplines, while systematically
addressing the underrepresentation of Latina in the US STEM workforce.
