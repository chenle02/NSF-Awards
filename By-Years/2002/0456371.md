The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS), formed in&lt;br/&gt;the
fall of 1982 under the aegis of Lee Stanley, has supported
3-4&lt;br/&gt;regional meetings per year of 1-2 days' duration since then.
These&lt;br/&gt;meetings are held at various locations and cover a broad
spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical logic with particular emphasis on complexity
theory,&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, pure
and applied&lt;br/&gt;model theory, proof theory, recursion theory, set
theory,&lt;br/&gt;subsystems of analysis in accordance with the program of H.
Friedman&lt;br/&gt;and S. Simpson, and topos theory. NSF support is provided for
some &lt;br/&gt;of the expenses of the speakers and attendees, in particular of
the&lt;br/&gt;graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Via the meetings
sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains the&lt;br/&gt;vitality of the field of
mathematical logic. Special emphasis is &lt;br/&gt;placed on enhancing the
participation of younger researchers and&lt;br/&gt;members of traditionally
underrepresented groups, especially women.&lt;br/&gt;This is done by providing
an intellectual forum in which all interested&lt;br/&gt;persons are invited to
contribute and in which there are lectures on&lt;br/&gt;current topics of
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
