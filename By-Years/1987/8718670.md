This award to East Carolina University will allow a team of researchers to
study small scale fishermen in Puerto Rico. They hypothesize that different
degrees of involvement in wage labor will result in different levels of
diversification, investment, and capital formation among fishing households. The
cognitive orientation of the fishermen will be analyzed to see how it constrains
their choices among economic alternatives. The project will interview about 200
randomly selected fishing households to get basic census ecological and economic
data. Smaller subsamples will be selected for the collection of judged
similarity data that will be analyzed by various multivariate techniques to
elicit the underlying cognitive structure. This project is important because
since WWII the world has seen a sharpening of the international division of
labor, with underdeveloped countries experiencing a growing working class. The
economic activities of small scale proletarians in such societies are important
in the overall economy, yet we know little about them. The effects of these
economic activities in the local economy, and their impact on the tropical
marine environments are important topics that this research will help us to
understand.
