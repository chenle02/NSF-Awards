In addition to reducing vegetation that may mitigate the effects of increased
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the clearance of large tracts of forest also
is feared because it may reduce the diversity of plant and animal species. One
facet of declining biological diversity is the loss of plants that have
medicinal qualities. It is generally assumed that undisturbed, old-growth
forests in tropical areas represent more plentiful locales for plants used by
native healers. Because many modern pharmaceuticals have been developed from
tropical medicinal plants, preservation of old-growth forests therefore is
believed to be especially important. This project tests the validity of the
assumption that underlies this belief by testing the hypothesis that areas from
which old-growth vegetation has been removed in order to establish second-growth
forests, cocoa plantations, or degraded pastures may actually be more
significant sources of medicinal plants for native healers than are old-growth
stands. Working in carefully selected sample sites near the Pau Brasil
Ecological Reserve in eastern Brazil, the investigator will identify medicinal
plant species in each plot with the help of local healers. Complementary
inventories of plant species in each plot will permit generalization of the
impacts of four general land-use regimes on the diversity of medicinal plant
species. This project will provide new data and understandings of value in a
number of different ways. It will expand information about native medical
practices and about the uses of different types of plants by healers with
different medical traditions. It also will provide a direct test of hypotheses
dealing with the number and types of plants found in undisturbed forests and in
sites that have been altered in different ways by human activity. The project
therefore should enhance understandings of the impacts of human activity of
biological diversity in an important environmental setting.
