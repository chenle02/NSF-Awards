The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is the improvement in disease
diagnostics. The proposed technology provides a process for the rapid
development and optimization of diagnostic tests. The results will be available
on a website for use by subscribers in laboratories anywhere in the world. The
proposed testing platform technology is entirely virtual and does not need
shipping, thus saving significant time and costs. Once the proposed technology
is verified, recognized, and in wide use, it will have the potential to be made
portable for field, pen, or bedside testing. The proposed technology can test
for multiple pathogens in one sample. The system works on plant, animal and
human diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will initially focus on the
needs of the citrus industry. Citrus planting materials are shipped all around
the world. However, before planting material can enter a country, it has to go
through extensive testing to ensure that it isn’t carrying any citrus disease
from some other part of the world. The U.S. tests all citrus varieties for up to
30 different disease causing viroids, viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The testing
and ‘curing’ of this valuable planting material can take years with available
technologies. This technology platform enables researchers to test for all
pathogens in a single sample, saving significant time and reducing costs. The
research objectives of this project are to develop diagnostic test probes for
citrus pathogens of concern to the U.S. and test them in parallel with the
currently used standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
