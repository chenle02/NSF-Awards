CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS: Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies: Community-
Based Learning Systems: Exploring Models in Use. Maricopa Technical Community
College has been awarded $298,698 for a 1 year planning project that will use
the motivational and social learning potential of Multiple User Design
environments (MUDs or MUSEs) in conjunction with computational modeling to help
students develop conceptual understanding of scientific concepts. The social
characteristics of MUDs, which students construct themselves, bring students
into environments where they interact with adult mentors, including teachers,
who expand student's horizons. While engaging in their current state, MUDs can
be transformed into powerful pedagogical spaces. This planning project will
develop the technological aspects of MUDs to integrate computational modeling,
and define specific pedagogical goals, building on the work of MariMuse with
Longview Elementary School, a Title K-6 school, serving a culturally diverse
population of students. The project is a collaboration of Longview Elementary,
Phoenix College (part of Maricopa Community College District, and Xerox Parc
Alto Research Center.
