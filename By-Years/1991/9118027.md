In central and western New England both the Taconic and the Acadian orogenies
were involved in the evolution of the eastern edge of North America during the
lower Paleozoic. Traditionally these have been treated as separate events of
Ordovician and Late Silurian-early Devonian age respectively. Recent work has
produced a model for this area that proposes that the two events were actually
part of a continuum of tectonic processes that operated as the ancient proto-
Atlantic ocean closed. The study will involve U-Pb geochronology of zircons,
monazites, sphenes and apatites to constrain both the protolith ages of key
units in Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut, and the ages of their peak
metamorphism.
