9453665 Snead The Detroit Urban Systemic Initiative has as its core a vision
that seeks to improve the mathematics, science and technology literacy of all
K-12 students in the Detroit Public Schools. Key elements of the Initiative are:
(1) twenty-three K-12 constellations (a neighborhood high school with feeder
middle and elementary schools); (2) a core curriculum based on the NCTM
Standards and emerging NAS science standards and that includes practical
applications, African-centered/multicultural perspectives, algebra for all
students and state-of-the-art technology; (3) a teacher enhancement program that
targets all professional staff and focuses on enhancing content knowledge,
improving instructional strategies, and altering belief systems; (4) systemwide
organizational and policy changes that will address equal access, flexibility
and change attitudes; and (5) redeployment of extant resources. Organizational
changes include establishing K-12 constellations as learning communities,
increased use of mathematics specialists in all elementary schools, and plans to
attract, retain and certify minority mathematics and science teachers. Community
collaborations and partnerships, parent programs, and career counseling are
designed to support achievement of the goals of the USI.
