9702596 Bramel This CAREER award addresses a number of important research and
educational issues in the analysis of production and distribution systems. The
research plan considers two open research areas. The first is the analysis of a
general distribution problem, which incorporates multi-product capacitated
vehicle routing problems, pick-up and delivery problems, vehicle routing
problems with delivery and back hauls, and general swapping problems. The second
is the analysis of certain scheduling and inventory control problems that arise
in production/distribution problems. In both thrusts, the approach consists of
probabilistic analyses of performance bounds for both exact and approximate
solution algorithms. The educational plan includes enhancing a recently
developed course on service operations management, development of an industrial
projects course for working business professionals, production of an advanced
text in logistics and distribution management, and integration of software
developed as part of the research plan into teaching modules. The management of
production and distribution systems is one of the most difficult problems faced
by managers today. Many companies have acquired model-based decision support
systems to assist in the complicated task of developing an effective logistic
management strategy. This research has the potential to significantly improve
the performance of both the models and the algorithms that lie at the core of
these decision support systems, and ultimately to decrease the total cost of
operating a production/distribution system. The educational plan will build on
the investigator's efforts to integrate research and teaching and will
strengthen the level of knowledge of quantitative operational methods among the
students at the investigator's institution and other business schools around the
country.
