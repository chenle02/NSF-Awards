This Presidential Young Investigator award deals with research directed toward
the synthesis and characterization of advanced polymeric materials. Among the
topics to be investigated are the synthesis of a new class of photodoped
conducting polymers, of inorganic-organic composites, and of transition-metal
catalysts for the living polymerization of monomers.
