This project deals with inverse problems and in particular the problems
associated with constructing an image of an object using limited data.
Applications range from medical imaging with X-ray and nuclear magnetic
resonance devices to radar detection. The techniques employed include automatic
symbolic manipulation, soliton theory and spectral theory.
