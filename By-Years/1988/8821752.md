This project is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of photochemistry and electrochemistry. Chemical synthetic methods
will be employed to prepare a wide variety of linked intramolecular electron
transfer systems that have unique properties absent in non-linked systems. The
complexes are based on trisbipyridine (II) as a light-harvesting photocenter.
This photocenter is covalently linked via flexible linkages to
N,N'-diquaternary- 2,2'-bipyridinium as an electron acceptor and/or N-alkyl
phenothiazine as an electron donor. In other series, triply bridged
heterodinuclear ruthenium/rhodium complexes with relatively rigid linkages will
be studied. Ground state properties will be characterized by electrochemical,
spectroelectrochemical and spectroscopic methods. Electron transfer rates will
be determined by time-resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy. Combined
electrochemical, photochemical and photophysical studies of linked
donor/acceptor photosensitizer systems will lead to a better understanding on
the molecular level of light-induced electron transfer systems. The results will
aid in the design of more efficient molecular systems for converting light
emergy into useful chemical energy.
