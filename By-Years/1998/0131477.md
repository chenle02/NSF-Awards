The objective of this work is to use ordered molecular environments to control
growth at a crystal surface. In biomineralization, nature uses a number of
protein sequences to recognize specific crystal faces. To try to understand and
model this process, functionalized gel matrices which present an array of
carboxylates will first be used to control crystal growth. Functionalized bis
urea gelators will first be used to study the effect of spatial group
orientation on calcium carbonate crystal growth. Small constrained peptide
sequences will then be synthesized (20 residues with 4 Asp or Glu residues and
with and without internal lactam bridges) and their ability to interact with
target minerals such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfide will be
investigated. Second and third generation peptidomimetic molecules will then be
designed to interact with specific crystal faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; With
this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Andrew D. Hamilton of the Department of Chemistry at Yale
University. Dr. Hamilton will explore the basic chemical processes involved in
the natural process of biomineralization. Designed organic molecules and
specific protein sequences will be investigated for their ability to control the
growth of minerals such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfide. The ability to
control calcium carbonate crystal growth has applications in biomedical science
for controlled bone growth. The ability to control calcium sulfide growth has
applications in the semiconductor industry. Students trained as a result of
working on this project will gain experience in inorganic materials research as
well as supramolecular organic chemistry, hence they will have skills needed by
both the computer and pharmaceutical
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
