In aiming to explain the existence of environmental inequality - the
disproportionate location of environmental hazards near low income and minority
neighborhoods - this project contrasts two theories. One is based on direct
racial discrimination, and another is based on the indirect consequences of
housing inequality by class and race. The evaluation of the contrasting theories
comes from the analysis of data from three sources. One source identifies the
location of toxic facilities, another provides figures on home ownership, and a
third uses figures from the U.S. census. With data over the 1940-1990 period for
eight selected areas, the analysis examines the relationship between housing
segregation and environmental inequality. The results not only help evaluate the
alternative theories and the relative roles of class and race in promoting
environmental inequality, but also address policy options in alleviating the
problem.
