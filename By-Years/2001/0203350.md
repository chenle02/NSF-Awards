Transversal hot zones can form in commercial packed-bed reactors and may be
deleterious because they may decrease the yield of the desired products,
deactivate the catalyst and initiate runaway reactions that may ultimately
result in explosions. The PI plans to conduct experiments and theoretical
numerical studies on hot zone formation and dynamics. The problem is of both
academic interest and engineering importance as the goal is not just to observe,
analyze and characterize such hot zones, but to gain the ability to predict and
control them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans experimental studies using an
infrared imager of hot zone formation and motion for two test reactions: the
oxidation of carbon monoxide and acetylene hydrogenation. These experiments will
be used to determine under what conditions hot zones form and what are their
characteristic motions. Numerical simulations of a three-dimensional two-phase
model will be used to gain an understanding of the critical rate processes and
parameters affecting hot zone formation in a uniform packed bed reactor. The
model will provide guidance about interesting regions for experimental study and
for the organization of experimental
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot spots and
hot zones are a perennial problem of packed bed reactors. Providing guidance
from first principals on how to avoid or control them would have significant
safety benefits for the industrial operation of chemical manufacturing
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
