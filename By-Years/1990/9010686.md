This Research Initiation Award is for theoretical and experimental work in
robotic parts assembly. The theoretical research will identify information
invariants for simple manipulation tasks: inherent assembly-time tradeoffs
between sensing, action, and prediction. Dr. Erdmann will then test his theory
on a robotic parts-orienting system, with sensing and manipulatory tasks
decomposed along information-invariant boundaries. This research could lead to
improved manufacturing design as well as reliable and efficient parts assembly.
