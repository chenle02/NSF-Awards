The focus of this research is at the meeting point of theory and experiment. The
isomerization and fragmentation reactions of small hydrocarbons will be probed.
Reactions for which rates, activation parameters and mechanisms will be examined
include: cis-trans isomerization of ethylene-1,2-d2; structural and geometric
isomerizations of cyclopropane-1,2-d2, cyclopropane-1,2,3-d3 and
cyclobutane-1,3-d2, plus numerous methyl- and ethyl-substituted cyclopropanes;
geometric isomerization and elimination of molecular hydrogen from
cyclopentene-3,4-d2; isomerization of a number of bicycloalkanes; and thermal
decomposition of 2-methyl-2-propanol-1,1,1-d3. All of the reactions are of
interest to computational modelers, and for each there is some uncertainty over
rate, mechanism or stereochemistry. With this Research in Undergraduate
Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) are supporting the research efforts of Drs.
David K.Lewis and Bansi L. Kalra of the Department of Chemistry at Connecticut
College. The project examines the rates and detailed mechanisms of prototype
isomerization and fragmentation reactions of small hydrocarbons. The work, at
the interface of theory and experiment, will allow the continuation of a well
established undergraduate research program.
