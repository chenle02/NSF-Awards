The main objective of this research is to develop an understanding of the
dissipative characteristics of fluid-filled poro-elastic media. The research
explores one basic aspect of the Biot equations, namely the characteristics of
the wave of the second kind. Fundamental solutions will be developed that take
into account the effects of boundaries as well as the effects of material in
homogenetics. A basic assumption of allowing for displacement discontinuities in
the poro- elastic functions will be made in order to obtain solutions which can
describe significant fluid-solid relative motion. The relevance of such
dissipative waves to various marine applications will be investigated.
