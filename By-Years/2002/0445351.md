Evolution, conflict and cooperation in mixed-species bacterial
communities&lt;br/&gt;Lauren A. Meyers&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at
Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary theory has much to say about the
evolution of single species and about the evolution of two species living in
conflict or harmony with each other. Ecosystems, however, consist of many
species that compete and cooperate with each other in diverse ways. These
interactions may result from a number of different causes, such as protection
from the elements or other species, or the use or production of limited
resources. The interactions may be irregular - dependent on the environment,
asymmetric, or non-transitive. For example one species may out-compete another
for resources only when it is the first to colonize a particular environment; or
one species may facilitate the growth of another, the second may facilitate the
growth of a third, but the third have an antagonistic relationship with the
first. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together two complementary
approaches to evolutionary research - experimental evolution of bacteria and
mathematical modeling of ecological and evolutionary dynamics - to investigate
the evolution of multi-species communities. Using four bacterial species that
can coexist in the laboratory, we will characterize their ecological
interactions; build mathematical models of these interactions with which we will
predict their evolutionary dynamics; and finally test our predictions by
evolving communities consisting of one, two or four species in the laboratory.
This work represents a novel direction in experimental evolution, one that will
provide insight into the evolution of ecological dynamics within a community,
and extend our purview beyond the interactions of just two species. An important
broader impact of this project will be the training of graduate students at the
interface of the mathematical and biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
