This research is an experimental and theoretical study of the interplay of
reaction kinetics (both homogeneous and particle surface controlled) with
aerosol dynamics (particle growth, coagulation, migration, and deposition) in
aerosol reactors and the influence of these factors on product powder
characterization. Special emphasis will be placed of the effect of dopants on
the size distribution of the resulting particles. As a case study, production of
titanium oxide powders formed by the oxidation of halide vapors in a furnace
reactor will be investigated by FTIR spectroscopy, near real time aerosol
sizing, and microscopy of captured particles. Aerosol reactors are used in
manufacture of carbon blacks, pigments, powders for advanced ceramics, and
lighwave guides. Current design of such reactors is largely empirical. This
research should help put the design of such reactors on a firmer basis and lead
to greater quality control of the powder produced.
