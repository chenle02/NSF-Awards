With their involvement in intelligent structures, and aerospace and nuclear
applications, civil engineers must also be concerned about the reliability of
the software they develop to control, sense, and monitor. Consider for example
the high dependability and fault tolerance required of software for active
structural control. Because these real-time systems operate without a human in
the loop, the impact of errors can be particularly devastating: control system
failure could excite the structure rather than dissipate vibration. The overall
goals of this research are to examine the impact of reliability issues in real-
time, civil engineering software, and to define a practical methodology,
consisting of both predeployment validation and run- time support, that can be
used to ensure reliability. More specifically, the study will focus on software
reliability of active structural control, and will draw on notions such as
static verification and real-time testing techniques to ensure software
correctness, as well as fault tolerance and redundancy to provide dependable
behavior in the presence of hardware and software errors. The benefits of this
study are expected to enable the development of reliable, fault-tolerant, real-
time computer software for practical civil engineering applications.
