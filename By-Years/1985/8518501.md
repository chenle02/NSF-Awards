This is a multifacted project with several investigators involved. The
fundamental studies to be performed will provide biomechanical information about
the etiological factors involved in osteoarthritis. It is expected that the
present state of knowledge of diarthrodial joints will allow integration into a
comprehensive model to predict the deformational behavior of joints.
