This proposal is designed to support the development of a new undergraduate
laboratory course in neuroscience. The goal of the course will expose students
to the field of neuroscience with particular emphasis on the methods of cellular
neuroscience. This course will provide laboratory training in neuroscience and
behavior as it is practiced in the l990s and it will become one of the focal
points for an undergraduate neuroscience and behavior "concentration" within the
University. It is our intention to make the proposed laboratory course the
center piece of a more extensive research experience for undergraduates. Our
long range goal is to create a vertically integrated training enterprise that
would attract undergraduates to careers in biology and to neuroscience in
particular. The requested equipment will serve the formal laboratory in one
semester and will be the center of an honors laboratory and a Research
Experience for Undergraduates program in the second semester and during the
summer months.
