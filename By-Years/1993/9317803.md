support the efforts of the American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES)
to promote and advance sustainable development in the U.S. engineering community
through the AAES Task Force on Sustainable Development and, internatinally,
through the World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO), the Pan
American Federation of Engineering Societies (UPADI), and the World Engineering
Partnership for Sustainable Development (WEPSD). The proposer, in collaboration
with WEPSD, will compile papers on sustainable development, as well as policy
papers elaborating on each of the sustainable development action principles for
the engineering profession, developed by the Task Group and approved by the AAES
Board of Governors. Other proposed activities include; a possible conference on
sustainable development, preparation of an AAES/WEPSD video on sustainable
development, and a speakers' bureau.
