Retinal ganglion cells connect the nerve cells that process information in the
eye with the visual centers of the brain. In the vertebrate retina, most retinal
ganglion cells respond to light with either an increase in activity (ON-cells)
or a decrease in activity (OFF-cells). In the mature retina, two features
characterize the organization of the ON and OFF ganglion cells. First, the
processes of ON and OFF cells ramify at different levels in the retina, and
second, ON and OFF cells are distributed across the retina in regular mosaic
patterns. The studies performed in this research program are directed at
understanding the events underlying the formation of ON and OFF retinal
pathways. Neuronal activity is known to play a role in the establishment and
refinement of neural connections in a number of systems. In these investigations
a series of experiments will be undertaken that are designed to assess the
contribution of afferent input to stratification of dendritic arbors in the
inner plexiform layer of the retina, and the role that axonal interactions at
target nuclei play in programmed cell death and in defining dendritic
territories in the retina. Precise and appropriate patterns of connections are
necessary for the normal function of the nervous system. These studies will
contribute in a fundamental way to our understanding of the strategies used in
the development of these connections.
