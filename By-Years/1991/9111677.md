The objectives of this project are: (A) Development of lower-cost techniques for
concurrent detection of program execution errors caused by processor hardware
faults, (B) development of lower-cost techniques for tolerating errors caused by
transient faults, (C) development of theory that sets optimal bounds on the
effectiveness of such techniques, and (D) development of analytical and
experimental methods for evaluating the techniques against the theoretical
bounds. New techniques are developed using a behavior- based-error-detection
paradigm, in which a simple error-detection coprocessor monitors a program for
deviations from a compiler- formed abstraction of its behavior. Existing low-
cost behavior- based techniques exploit certain redundancies in program codes or
in a processor's architecture. New techniques are also developed by using the
methods from information theory, coding theory, and graph theory to identify new
redundancies to exploit, and by using experimental data to uncover gaps between
existing techniques and theoretical bounds. Concurrent error detection is
necessary because transient faults are becoming more frequent as device size
decreases, as the number of devices per processor and the number of processors
per computer grows, and as more computers are subjected to noisy environments.
The proposed work is important because, although computer dependability is
increasingly important, existing concurrent-error-detection methods are too
costly for all but a few applications.
