A balanced experimental and theoretical research program in the area of
nanometer-scale thermal engineering in electronic materials is planned. Research
will be focused on (1) thermal properties, heat generation and transport in sub-
micrometer-scale structures; (measurement of temperature and thermal properties
at nanometer scales; (3) heat transfer across interfaces. These studies will be
carried out on electronic and opto-electronic materials such as silicon, III-V
semiconductors like gallium arsenide and its alloys, as well as metals. Typical
applications involve high electric fields, leading to non-equilibrium electron
energy distributions. Electron-phonon interactions further lead to non-
equilibrium phonon interactions. Theoretical/numerical studies will involve the
development of Monte Carlo simulation packages for transport of non-equilibrium
electrons and phonons. Experimental studies will involve measurements made with
the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM). A
technique to use AFM to measure effective lattice and electron temperatures with
nanometer resolution will be developed. Studies of the thermoelectric effect
associated with heat transport by electron tunneling will also be studied. The
studies are of fundamental importance to nanoengineering and may also have
applications in the development of nanometer-scale tunneling sensors for
temperature and heat flux.
