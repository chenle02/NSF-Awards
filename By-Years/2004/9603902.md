Natvig 96-03902 Unlike N. crassa, which is heterothallic and produces haploid
ascospores of two separate mating types, N. tetrasperma is self fertile as a
consequence of each ascopore receiving one nucleus of each mating type. This
reproductive system has been termed pseudohomothallism, because occasional
single mating-type spores are self sterile and heterothallic, suggesting the
potential for outcrossing in nature. At one level, the mechanism of
pseudohomothallism in N. tetrasperma appears quite simple. An overlap of
spindles at the second meiotic division, together with subsequent programmed
nuclear movements, leads to four heterokaryotic ascospores per ascus, instead of
the eight typical of N. crassa and other truly heterothallic species. Despite
this deceptively simple mechanism for creating self-fertile ascospores, it is
now clear that pseudohomothallism in N. tetrasperma has important and complex
implications. One recent study revealed that laboratory outcrossing with
geographically diverse strains of N. tetrasperma results in high levels of
sexual dysfunction. Another demonstrated that recombination between N.
tetrasperma mating-type chromosomes is suppressed relative to that observed for
truly heterothallic species, such as N. crassa; and it demonstrated that the
mating-type chromosomes and autosomes of N. tetrasperma reflect very different
evolutionary histories. Paradoxically, suppressed recombination on the mating-
type chromosome, coupled with the unique sexual developmental pathway of N.
tetrasperma, has produced wild-type strains with high levels of heteroallelism
on the mating-type chromoqome, but with virtually complete homoallelism for
sequences on autosomes. The results of these two studies appear to be very much
interrelated. For example, one aspect of sexual dysfunction seems to involve
protoplasmic incompatibility brought about by heteroallelism at certain loci.
The high levels of homoallelism observed for autosomal sequences in wild type
strains may reflect an avoidance of this incompatibility. This research will
investigate (1) the genetic bases of sexual dysfunction and (2) the mechanism
and biological significance of suppressed recombination on the mating-type
chromosome. Our study focuses on several fundamental aspects of developmental
and life-cycle biology, and it therefore has broad implications for reproductive
genetics in higher organisms. This study will go far toward developing N.
tetrasperma as an experimental organism for future genetic studies.
