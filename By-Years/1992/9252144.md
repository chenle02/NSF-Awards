GC/MS instrumentation will augment several courses beginning with General
Chemistry and progressing through the curriculum to Instrumental Analysis and
student research. Isotope analysis and air sampling studies will be introduced
in General Chemistry. Organic Chemistry will use GC/MS for structure
determination and reaction product and mechanisms studies. Further experiments
on kinetics and thermodynamics in Physical Chemistry and careful analytical work
in Instrumental Analysis will be employed. Laboratory instruction will be
supplemented by the use of computers and programs already available in mass
spectra interpretation. Further, a video based on our acquired instrumentation
will be prepared to introduce the GC/MS technique prior to student contact with
the equipment.
