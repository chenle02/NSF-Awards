Prof. Teukolsky's group is investigating gravitational collapse and the
formation of black holes by solving Einstein's equations on a supercomputer.
They will determine how much gravitational radiation is emitted during such
events. Some situations they will study include collisions of star clusters and
of black holes, and gravitational collapse of unstable star clusters. They are
also investigating the coalescence of two neutron stars in binary orbit about
each other, and are studying the properties of rapidly rotating stars in general
relativity, and how information about the nuclear equation of state might be
discovered from astrophysical observations. They are exploring the formation of
black holes in supernova explosions, which are usually thought to produce
neutron stars and not black holes. Finally, they are analyzing the recently
discovered planetary system around a pulsar to provide an absolute confirmation
that the system does in fact contain planets. This work will be important to
elucidate possible astronomical observations which can provide critical tests of
Einstein's theory of gravitation.
