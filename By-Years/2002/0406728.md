The focus of this research is the preparation of poly(paraphenyleneethynylene)s
(PPEs) via alkyne metathesis. The goal will be the synthesis of PPEs with large
chiroptical activities, PPEs that carry polymeric or conjugated side chains as
novel rod-coil polymers and PPE-heterostructures for use in polymeric light
emitting diodes. Also, the absolute molecular weight of the PPEs will be
determined by transformation from rigid rods into flexible coils by catalytic
hydrogenation. Further, synthetic methodology will be developed for access to
polydiacetylenes and hybrids with PPEs and poly(paraphenylenevinylene)s (PPVs)
by alkyne metathesis with simple in situ catalysts or defined molybdenum
carbynes. Materials properties will be determined and the polymers will be
exploited for device applications such as LEDs, circularly polarized LEDs and
PPE-based lasing devices.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Uwe H. Bunz of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
at the University of South Carolina. Professor Bunz will focus his work on using
alkyne metathesis for the synthesis of both new and known conjugated polymers.
These polymers are attractive as stable, processable and emissive semiconductors
with a wide range of potential applications. The research is also an excellent
training ground for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.
