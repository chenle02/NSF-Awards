Emma Previato will continue her research into integrable systems of differential
equations and moduli problems in algebraic geometry. She will be studying some
of the soliton equations which arise naturally in physics. In particular she
will work with the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. These model various
standing wave configurations and demonstrate many symmetries. Previato will be
investigating the geometrical aspects of this theory. Since the special
qualities possessed by these integrable systems are algebraic in nature, her
work will have impact in both differential and algebraic geometry. The major
objective of the research is to embed integrable systems in moduli spaces in
order to gain information on the latter's function theory and properties as
projective varieties. This offers potential applications to the study of moduli
spaces for vector bundles on curves as well as the possible discovery of some
new and interesting finite dimensional integrable systems.
