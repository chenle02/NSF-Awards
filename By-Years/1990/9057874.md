The goal of this project is to design a 'process-oriented' environment
architecture and build tools to effectively support software development in a
distributed work-station environment. A process-oriented environment
architecture presents itself to the user (e.g., software developer or manager)
as a collection of methodological tools supporting the planning and
specification of explicit software process models and their controlled
execution, rather than as a collection of tools supporting isolated development
activities (e.g., coding or testing). This project involves work in a variety of
areas including process modeling, environment architectures, measurement, reuse
and learning, and experience bases. Example research and development tasks
include: o Design of a process-specification driven environment architecture o
Definition and implementation of a comprehensive process specification language
o Use of measurement data in characterizing project goals and selecting the
appropriate software processes to achieve them o Design and implementation of
process execution support o Using measurements to improve existing process
specifications.
