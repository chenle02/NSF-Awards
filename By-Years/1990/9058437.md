The thrust of this Presidential Young Investigator Award is to organize
molecular components onto superconducting surfaces for the purpose of developing
superconductor-based macromolecular devices. The initial focus will be on two
areas: (1) superconductor / molecular film junctions, using conductive molecular
films such as polypyrrole and polyacetylene; and (2) optical devices prepared by
coating Josephson junctions with thin-films of dyes such as
metallophthalocyanines or rare earth ions.
