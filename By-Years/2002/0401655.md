Dr. Lorenzo Sadun will analyze several problems on the &lt;br/&gt;topology and
dynamics of tiling spaces. One problem concerns computing &lt;br/&gt;the Cech
cohomology groups of tiling spaces. Another problem is to find
&lt;br/&gt;criteria for when the natural translation action on a substitution
&lt;br/&gt;tiling space (or a deformation of such an action) is topologically
&lt;br/&gt;mixing. A third problem is to consider tilings of hyperbolic space,
&lt;br/&gt;where the natural group action is nonabelian and in that the group is
&lt;br/&gt;not amenable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These problems are motivated by
quasicrystals, a class of solids that &lt;br/&gt;are highly ordered but are not
crystals. Quasicrystals are modeled by &lt;br/&gt;aperiodic tilings, and ergodic
theory relates the bulk properties of a &lt;br/&gt;quasicrystal (such as its
ability to diffract light, its electrical &lt;br/&gt;conductance, and its
rigidity) to certain averages taken over a space of &lt;br/&gt;possible
quasicrystals, or equivalently a space of tilings. The better &lt;br/&gt;we
understand the abstract mathematical properties of tiling spaces, the
&lt;br/&gt;better we understand the down-to-earth physical properties of
&lt;br/&gt;quasicrystals and of other materials.
