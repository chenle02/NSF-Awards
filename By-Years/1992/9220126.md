Whereas most invertebrates (animals that lack backbones) live for just a few
weeks, ticks typically live for several years. Moreover, one particular group of
ticks, the Ornithodoros ticks, can survive for several years without feeding.
The proposed research will elucidate the behavioral and physiological means by
which these ticks survive long periods of starvation. Ornithodoros ticks are the
preeminent transmitters of relapsing fever to human and livestock. They are also
the only biological transmitters of the African swine fever, a highly contagious
disease against which drugs and vaccine are presently not available. The ability
of the Ornithodoros ticks to harbor and transmit disease agents is enhanced by
the fact that they feed on a variety of birds, mammals and reptiles. No less
significant are their longevity and their ability to survive long periods of
starvation. Because these ticks can live for as long as fifteen years without
feeding, they are superb reservoirs of many bacterial, protozoan and viral
diseases even in the absence of suitable hosts. A better understanding of the
mechanisms for this spectacular capability of a physiologically and ecologically
rational strategy for their control.
