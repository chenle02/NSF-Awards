The objective of this proposal is to develop a technique capable of
identifying, locating and quantifying leakages through liners or barriers that
contain hazardous leachates. The technique is based on the use of seismic
boundary waves. These waves propagate along soil/water and soil/soil boundary
created by a liner or barrier. These boundary waves are focused on the liner
interface and are highly sensitive to the conditions of this interface. Changes
in moisture, void ratio and permeability can be detected and correlated to
leakage events. On Phase I the feasibility of this concept was demonstrated by
conducting a small scale field test. The objective of Phase II is to: confirm
the concept, integrate the hardware, develop the analysis and interpretive
software, develop implementation methods and interpretive techniques.
