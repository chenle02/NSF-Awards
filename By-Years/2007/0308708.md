0308708&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Virginia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Coding theory and quantum
computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Mathematics and the Institute
for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Virginia will sponsor an
interdisciplinary conference on quantum computing and coding theory at the
University of Virginia on May 20-26, 2003. The conference will begin with an
instructional workshop consisting of three mini-courses presented by senior
experts aimed at providing an introduction to quantum computing and coding
theory. The target audience for the workshop will consist of advanced graduate
students and junior faculty. Quantum computing has connections with many
different areas of mathematics, so that the educational impact of the program on
mathematicians attending the conference should be considerable. The workshop
will be followed by a short conference featuring invited speakers discussing
recent developments. Other conference participants will also have the
opportunity to present contributed talks on their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
cannot overstate the potential impact of quantum computing. Current methods of
encrypting data for private transmission are secure not because they are
unbreakable but&lt;br/&gt;rather because today's computers and algorithms do not
have the speed or efficiency to break the code. When developed, quantum
computers will make current encryption methods insecure and obsolete. These
computers will also provide new means of quickly searching databases of
information, which would have many important applications
in&lt;br/&gt;biotechnology and data mining.&lt;br/&gt;
