Srere 9418565 In order to study the problem of metabolite channelling, a recent
and elegant technique employed has been to link the DNA for two enzymes and to
express the fused protein in cells. We have used this latter technique to
prepare a fusion protein of yeast mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS1) yeast
mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH1). Yeast cells which lack mitochondrial
enzyme activity of the Krebs TCA cycle cannot grow on acetate (acetate-
phenotype). When either CS1 or MDH1 is deleted from yeast cells (CS1- or MDH1-
cells) or when a double deletion is made (CS1-/MDH1- cells) the cells cannot
grow on acetate. The fusion protein restored growth on acetate when placed in
yeast cells which lacked CS1, MDH1, and CS1 and MDH1. In addition, kinetic
studies on the purified fusion protein indicated channelling of the intermediate
oxalacetate (OAA). We propose to extend these studies by changing the order of
the enzymes; by testing linkers of different lengths and sequences; and by using
heterologous enzymes of CS and MDH. Nonsequential fusion proteins of Krebs TCA
cycle enzymes will be made also. We will investigate the in vitro channeling
assay using different OAA trapping systems and isotopic methods. %%% When cells
are broken, one finds apparently mainly free enzymes which given rise to the
idea that the cell is essentially a "bag of enzymes". There are many
indications, however, that in the cell, sequential metabolic enzymes are in
complexes which dissociate upon cell rupture. We have studied the interactions
of sequential enzymes and their consequences in a variety of ways, including
biophysical and genetic techniques. This grant proposal is to continue our
studies on a fused two sequential enzyme systems, yeast mitochondrial malate
dehydrogenase (MDH), and yeast mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS). This fusion
protein was isolated and its kinetic studied. The results indicated that
channeling of the intermediate occurred. We propose to study the phenomenon by
producing a series of other fusion proteins of MDH and CS with changed order,
changed linkers, and heterologous MDH and CS. These studies will serve as models
for possible metabolic advantages and regulatory properties of enzyme-enzyme
interactions in cells. ***
