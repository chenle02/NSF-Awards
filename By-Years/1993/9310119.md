9310119 Pfeffer Drs. Pfeffer and Challa will continue their investigations into
the physical processes responsible for hurricane formation, pursuing two major
thrusts. The role of environmental forcing in the transformation to cloud
clusters and depressions into hurricanes will be explored using potential
vorticity diagnostics of model simulations. Specifically, the PIs will look at
the relative important of upper level atmospheric waves and low level wind
surges in the hurricane genesis. The other principal effort will be to assess
how the representation of boundary layer and cumulus cloud processes affects
simulations of hurricane development through sensitivity studies with various
parameterization schemes. In addition, they use a coupled atmosphere-ocean model
to investigate how variations in thermocline depth affects tropical cyclone
development. This research is an important contribution to improving our ability
to better predict hurricane development and behavior. ***
