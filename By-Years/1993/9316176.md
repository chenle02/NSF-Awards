9316176 Yin Although the Indo-Asia collision is believed to be responsible for
the Tibetan plateau, the role of pre-collisional crustal shortening information
of the Tibetan plateau remains poorly defined, but may be present due to the
existing of pre-collisional folds and thrusts. A reconnaissance investigation
indicated such features are extensive, and this project is designed to conduct
detailed field mapping and thermochronological studies to further describe the
pre-collisional deformation and assess to what extent they were responsible for
pre-collision thickening of the crust. ***
