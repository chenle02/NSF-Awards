Electronic imaging is an emerging technology area that will promote
acquisition, transmission, storage, and display of information through visual
means. Advances in this technological area will lead to important new systems
for factory automation using robots, medical diagnostics, office automation, and
defense. The State/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Electronic Imaging at the University of Rochester in collaboration with the
Rochester Institute of Technology will address the following major research
topics: (1) digital image processing, (2) image sequence processing, (3) digital
compression, and (4) color reproduction in different media. The initial
industrial partnership includes seven companies. The technology transfer will
occur through collaborative research with company personnel, and industrial
residentship in the Center. The Center will participate in the new program of
undergraduate education under the Rochester Education Demands Involvement
Initiative by implementing special projects, and developing new courses that
relate to electronic imaging.
