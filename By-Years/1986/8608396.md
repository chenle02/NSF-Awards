The primary goal of the research is to develop a stochastic finite element
computer program suitable for metal plate connected wood trusses. A secondary
goal is to develop a procedure for determining a generalized reliability index
where distribution, shape, scale, and location are incorporated into the
transformation of the structural limit state equation into standard normal
space. The first objective will be to develop the stochastic finite element
computer program. The next objective is to perform sensitivity analyses using
the program. The final objective will be to examine the reliability of the truss
members using the program output.
