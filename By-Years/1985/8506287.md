Research equipment is being acquired for work in the field of heat transfer. The
Mach-Zehnder interferometer is a powerful tool for heat transfer studies. An
attempt will be made to extend the current capability of this instrument to
three-dimensional temperature fields. The studies for which the equipment will
be used deal with heat transfer in fire research problems, among others.
