Collaborative Research: Biologically Inspired Cilia-Driven Microscale
Robots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in smart electroactive polymers have
created a unique opportunity to combine microscale science, robotic engineering
and biomimetics. These materials can be applied to microscale structures of
arbitrary shape with biomimetic features. Largely inspired by nature, we propose
an approach in integrating electroactive materials and control into a new class
of cilia-driven microscale robots. The objective of the proposed research is to
investigate key scientific issues on: i) materials development and
identification, ii) biomimetic design of microscale cilia structures, and iii)
robotic controls. The proposed cilia-driven microscale robot systems have a wide
spectrum of future engineering applications such as drug delivery micro-robots
and micro-colonoscopy systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed
research program is to provide students with the expertise to broadly address
the future needs of industry and academia in small-scale science and engineering
as well as robotics on small scales. Also, the proposed study will help increase
the diversity in the research and educational mission of this effort.&lt;br/&gt;
