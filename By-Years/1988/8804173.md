Wellesley College is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
For the summer of 1988, the program will support 8 students recruited from
Wellesley and other institutions. Research activities will include studies in
the following areas: o Molecular spectroscopy and photochemistry of transition
metal complexes o Synthesis of nucleosides o Synthesis of compounds containing
N-N bonds o Protein synthesis at the translational (ribosomal) level o NMR
studies of biological systems o Structure of compounds containing primary amine
groups o Synthesis and characterization of liquid crystals o Carbocation
solvation o Catalysis of organic reactions o Isolation of natural products o
Conformational analysis of phenyl delta-lactones o Enzyme purification
