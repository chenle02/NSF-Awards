1126193&lt;br/&gt;Sengupta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order for polymeric
nanofibers to be used more widely, a thorough understanding of fiber-formation
physics and fiber chemistry is critical. The research conducted using the
Nanospider electrospinning apparatus will be transformational because it will
provide answers to some fundamental questions involving polymer-solvent
interaction, role of viscosity and surface tension in fiber spinnability, effect
of potential gradient and collector distance (from needle containing the
polymer). These answers are critical to provide innovative solutions to overcome
technical barriers that exist in more widespread use of this technology. The
Nanospider, in concert with other equipment already available at UMD, will
propel UMass Dartmouth toward a niche area in material development and
characterization that will attract local businesses and universities to assist
their business/academic needs.
