Abstract

Award: DMS-0306947 Principal Investigator: Gang Tian

This proposal consists of three projects in integrable systems and calibrated
geometry to be conducted by Emma Carberry. The first of these centers on complex
tori in the nearly-Kaehler 6-sphere. Isotropic surfaces in the 6-sphere have
been classified by Bryant and include all rational examples. I propose to find
an algebro-geometric description of the non-isotropic complex tori. This
description will involve an algebraic curve called the spectral curve, and hence
give rise to a natural invariant of the torus, namely the genus of its spectral
curve. The existence of tori for each value of this invariant will then be
investigated and the characterization used to produce examples. Cones over these
tori are associative in the imaginary octonions, which provides additional
geometrical motivation for their study. The second project concerns the energy
of minimal tori in the 3-sphere. Ferus, Leschke, Pedit and Pinkall have an
estimate for the energy in terms of the spectral genus, which provides exciting
progress toward the proof of the Willmore and Lawson conjectures, but fails to
say anything about these conjectures when the spectral genus is low. It is
precisely the low-genus cases upon which we shall focus, using spectral curve
techniques. The final project concerns the possible singularities of special
Lagrangian 3-folds, a topic of considerable current interest due to its role in
mirror symmetry. Specifically, cones over tori will be studied and the question
of whether the links may be real-algebraic will be addressed.

Energy is a fundamental quantity; physical systems seek to minimize energy or at
least to find (possibly unstable) critical points of it. One typically studies
critical points of energy, for example minimal submanifolds, which appear in all
of the above proposed projects. These have a long and distinguished history in
both mathematics and physics, and remain subject to much attention. Absolute
energy minimizers are rare and difficult to locate. However one source of them
is calibrated submanifolds, of which both associative and special Lagrangian
submanifolds are examples. Special Lagrangian submanifolds have other
interesting applications to physics. In super-symmetric string theory, the
universe is modeled as a ten-dimensional object, consisting locally of the
familiar four-dimensional space-time, and a six-dimensional space (a Calabi-Yau
manifold) that is compact, and hence sufficiently 'small' that one does not
observe it in everyday life. A popular approach to deepening our understanding
of these Calabi-Yau manifolds is to study their special Lagrangian submanifolds.
