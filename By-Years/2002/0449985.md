Meteor radar systems, used to monitor horizontal winds in the middle atmosphere
by analysis of specular reflections from meteoric ablation remnants, are
upgraded to assimilate new digital receiver and multi-frequency transmitter
technologies. In addition, lingering confusion about the veracity of the derived
winds, stemming from proprietary analysis algorithms, is eradicated by
establishment of unified transparent algorithms available for review. The design
and construction of these new-technology meteor radars paves the way for low-
cost unified networks of the radar systems, and broad spatial coverage of middle
atmosphere dynamics between 80 km and 100 km. Undergraduate and graduate student
participation in the project generates a new population of expert RF engineers
and remote sensing radar operators. That population broadens the research impact
from its Aeronomy core to surveillance, resource exploration, and security.
