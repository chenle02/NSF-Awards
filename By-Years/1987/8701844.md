Diffusion of Macromolecular Complexes: This award recommendation is made under
the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the Exchange of Scientists and
Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is designed to enable U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research institutions
in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia,
and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected on the
basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of science, the
prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as well as
criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in science and
engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and engineers
who are embarking on their research careers. This research project will utilize
Pulse Field Gradient NMR (PFGNMR) diffusion measurements to investigate the
formation and structure of macromolecular complexes of isotactic and
syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and lignin preparations. An
analysis of the structure and molecular weight distributions of PMMA and lignin
preparations will precede characterization of their diffusion coefficients as a
function of concentration, molecular weight and degree of association. The
development of a model for the diffusion of the associated macromolecules from
diffusion results will entail analysis to obtain hydrodynamic volume and shape
information as a function of degree of association. The project is under the
direction of Dr. Theodore M. Garver, Research Assistant, Department of Forest
Products, University of Minnesota at St. Paul, MN 55455, U.S.A., and Professor
Paul Callaghan, Department of Physics and Biophysics, Massey University,
Palmerston North, New Zealand. This award recommendation provides funds to
cover, as appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend,
dependents allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
