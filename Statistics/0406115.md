ABSTRACT PI: Merlise A Clyde PROPOSAL: 0406115

The investigators propose new advancements for the problem of variable and model
selection, one of the most fundamental and widespread problems in statistics.
Bayesian methods are appealing for this problem, due to the natural
probabilistic framework which addresses both model and parameter uncertainty.
The implementation of Bayesian methods, however, becomes challenging as the
number of models or variables grows, an all too common problem where massive
data sets provide many potential predictors. The PI and co-PI investigate two
major challenges in the implementation of Bayesian model selection and model
averaging: prior specification and posterior calculation. They investigate new
families of automatic objective priors that have desirable risk properties,
adapt to unknown degree of sparsity and also permit tractable computation for
large scale model search. To implement the new methodology, they develop
efficient software for stochastic search and model averaging for high
dimensional model spaces. Applications in industrial and biological problems
will be developed using the new methodology.

Finding and using models to describe relationships between variables in massive
datasets is a fundamental problem in both statistics and the sciences. Bayesian
methods have been shown to be very successful for this problem, however, the
implementation of Bayesian methods becomes challenging in applications where the
number of possible models is astronomical. The PI and co-PI develop innovative
new methods and software in statistical computing and modeling for selecting and
combining models. These methodological developments are driven by applications
in industrial and biological problems. The automatic procedures proposed by the
investigators for selecting and combining models have applicability to many
other important application areas where variable selection is utilized.
