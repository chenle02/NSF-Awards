With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and the Chemistry
Instrumentation Program, Professor Smalley is continuing his investigations of
the properties, photochemistry, and surface chemistry of small metallic cluster
ions. His studies of carbon clusters are directly relevant to the understanding
of carbon condensation and survival and soot formation under conditions ranging
from flames to the interstellar medium. Studies of surface reactions on small
metal clusters should stimulate (and provide a rigorous testing ground for) the
development of first-principles theoretical approaches to the molecular level
details of surface phenomena. The research on mass-selected cluster ions will
include (1) optical spectroscopy of cold clusters using tandem time-of-flight
mass spectrometry, (2) ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy of negative
clusters, and (3) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance studies of the
surface chemistry and photophysics of cluster ions trapped in a magnetic field.
