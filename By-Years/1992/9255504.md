Logic Synthesis and top-down design are increasingly being used for digital
system design in industry. Introducing logic synthesis techniques into a
computer science or engineering curriculum can be a daunting task for the
educator because of the wide number of choices of languages and toolsets. Two
workshops on Logic Synthesis in the Classroom will be held; one workshop will be
aimed at educators on a budget and will consist of all public domain tools which
participants can immediately begin using in the classroom. A second workshop
will feature a combination of the Viewlogic commercial tool suite and public
domain tools. Both of these toolsets have been used in the MSU Advanced Digital
Design course with great success.
