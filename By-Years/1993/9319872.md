9319872 Fleischer This award is for support of a Small Grant for Exploratory
Research (SGER) to document and analyze a surge, which is in progress, on the
Bering Glacier in Alaska. Surging is defined as periodic, very rapid movements
of large quantities of ice within a glacier, alternating with much longer
periods of near stagnation. The Bering Glacier is the longest (191 kilometers)
and largest (5,173.5 square kilometers) glacier in North America. This work is
part of an on-going program of the Bering Glacier Research Group (BERG) and will
involve state-of-the-art, continuous-recording, ice penetrating radar
measurements of ice thickness. The results of this work should help in the
understanding of the role of subglacial water in the surge mechanism. ***
