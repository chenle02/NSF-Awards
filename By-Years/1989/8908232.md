Plants suffer the vagaries of their environment while animals often have
homeostatic mechanisms by which they regulate the conditions in which their
metabolism occurs. The molecular and evolutionary mechanisms by which plants
respond to environmental cues such as light, temperature, and CO2 level are
studied in the Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is
necessary to grow plants under a range of environmental conditions for these
studies. Other studies conducted in the relatively low CO2 and high 02 level in
normal air. These mutant plants grow well in environments enriched with CO2. For
these and many other studies undertaken in this department, we require
unaffected by the prevailing weather. Growth rooms were originally installed in
1957 to fill this need, but these rooms were no longer meet the needs of the
department for modern plant growth facilities.
