This award is for the partial support of the conference in the field of
Approximation Theory at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. The conference
will concentrate on various topics including classical approximation theory,
wavelets, mutivariate splines and nonlinear approximation. The conference will
be the tenth in a traditional triennial series of such conferences, held earlier
at UT Austin, Texas A&M and Nashville.
