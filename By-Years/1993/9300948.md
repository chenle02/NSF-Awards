9300948 Friedman This project is concerned with a number of nonlinear problems
in partial differential equations. These problems include: (a) free boundary
problems that arise in studying the visual development in electrophotography,
(b) the formation of electric images in electrophotography, (c) free boundary
problems for Navier-Stokes equations, (d) coalescence models for dislocations,
(e) diffusion of networks, (f) a kinetic model for photobleaching, and (g) the
Stefan problem with kinetic condition. The research is concerned with nonlinear
problems in partial differential equations as motivated by physical and
engineering models; many of these models come directly from U.S. industry. The
problems involve either (1) partial differential equations and systems, which
are nonlinear and possibly degenerate as well, or (ii) linear partial
differential equations and systems in domains with a free boundary. The problems
to be considered arise from such areas as semiconductor processing,
electrophotography, and coating flows. ***
