This project enhances Elementary and Secondary Education students' understanding
of the mathematics they will teach through the use of computer-based modeling
and explorations. The institution is purchasing 30 Macintosh computers for a
mathematics computer laboratory. The facility is used to support class
discussions, small-group explorations, and individual efforts to make
mathematical models of real-world phenomena. Modeling-based activities can
support prospective teachers' conceptions of mathematics in ways that cannot be
accomplished without the use of high-powered technology. The project supports
the students' development of a deep conceptual understanding of mathematics. It
also fosters an appreciation for technology as a powerful tool for teaching and
learning. The university is in an ideal position to achieve this goal for
several reasons. First, it has a nationally-recognized mathematics education
faculty who often work collaboratively. Second, it offers four core mathematics
courses for prospective elementary teachers, which allows faculty to plan for
the integration of several computer-based explorations in a systematic way. *
