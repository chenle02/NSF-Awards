This dissertation examines how resources, political structure, and collective
values contribute to different styles of participation in environmental decision
making in rural communities in the Czech Republic. It uses several theoretical
frameworks; resource mobilization, political opportunity structure, and framing,
and hypothesizes that different levels and combinations of resources and
opportunities are associated with specific types of political behavior:
confrontation, institutional mechanisms, and silence. It maintains that values,
interests, and beliefs communicated in public presentations moderate the
predicted relationships. The fieldwork uses survey and case study methods.
Employees of the Institute for Public Opinion Research in the Czech Republic
will be trained and conduct the interviews. Data bases and archival sources will
be used to address relevant demographic variables and supplement information
collected in the survey. The information sources will be supplemented by
qualitative fieldwork, providing a series of comparative case studies of
proposed developments in locations where community members had different
reactions to similar proposals. The dissertation should contribute to social
theory and public policy, by providing a basis for refining the structure of
institutions and political processes in order to facilitate community
participation.
