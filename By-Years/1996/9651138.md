This project focuses on the implementation of an innovative laboratory for
undergraduate students in Neurobiology, with laboratory exercises designed to
acquaint students with the multidisciplinary nature of Neurobiology but at the
same time permit them to focus on a particular experimental topic throughout the
semester. Specifically, at the beginning of the semester, students choose one of
three experimental subjects (slug, frog, or rat) and one of several suggested
topics to investigate in semester-long projects. The students themselves develop
some of the details of the experiments, such as which brain areas,
neurotransmitters, or behavioral tasks to investigate. The exercises are
structured, but open-ended, providing students with enough guidance so that
their efforts are fruitful and enough latitude to follow their own interests.
The proposed laboratory approach teaches Neurobiology, and science in general,
from a practitioner's perspective. The laboratory is physically arranged in
three centers--anatomy, physiology, and behavior--where different aspects of
Neurobiology are being explored. The same general topic, such as the mechanisms
of learning, is investigated during 4-week rotations in each of these centers,
where students employ different techniques to study different aspects of their
topic. For example, learning can be induced and observed in the behavior center,
and the morphological and electrophysiological properties of the neurons
involved in this learning studied in the anatomy and physiology centers,
respectively. By the end of the semester, students have a broad and
comprehensive understanding of their topic. They can gain an appreciation for
the breadth of Neurobiology, the usefulness of the three different approaches to
studying Neurobiology, and the excitement and meticulousness of scientific
discovery.
