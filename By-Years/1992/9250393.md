This project will add a second semester laboratory to the physical chemistry
sequence by making use of an FTIR spectrometer and a differential scanning
calorimeter. The course will focus on spectroscopy and physical polymer
chemistry experiments. An expanded instrumental analysis course will also make
use of the FTIR. The new instruments will also make possible the restoration of
a Polymer Chemistry course to the chemistry elective offerings. Besides
significantly upgrading the instrumentation capabilities of the University, the
new instruments will allow the Department to upgrade its curriculum to meet ACS
prescribed standards. They will also give students hands-on experience with
mainstay equipment in the field of chemistry in general, and in physical and
polymer chemistry in particular.
