Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide
support to defray expenses of researchers participating in the Prarie Analysis
Seminar 2008 that will take place November 7 and 8, 2008, at the University of
Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas. This seminar is eight in a row of seminars organized
since 2001, five of which were supported by previous NSF grants. Support will be
provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions
made for plenary speakers. It is understood that much of the funding will be
directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain
senior participants will be funded as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Fall
2008 meeting, about 40 participants from regional universities as well as from
other institutions are expected. The program will feature three principal
speakers, who will deliver one-hour lectures, and a number of contributed talks.
Significant participation by graduate students from both University of Kansas
and other institutions typifies this conference series. The programs for the
later meetings, still in the planning stages, will have a similar structure.
