The project deals with the processing conditions required for gel spinning of
vinyl polymers into high modulus fibers. Gel spinning involves dissolution of
the polymers in a solvent, quenching into a gel filament, then drying and
drawing to a high draw ratio. The work to be done for one year deals with 1)
microbeam x.ray studies of high strength fibers, 2) chemical modification of
poly (vinyl alcohol) fibers, and 3) dynamic mechanical spectroscopy of gel spun
fibers.
