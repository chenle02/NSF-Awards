This is a one-year planning activity to develop a collaborative working
relationship among research groups at the Georgia Institute of Technology,
Louisiana State University, the Environmental Protection Agency, and SRI
International. The objective is the development and demonstration of a jet-REMPI
(resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization) instrument for analyzing combustion
byproduct emissions that are environmental hazards such as dioxins, furans, and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Current methods of analysis for these
chemicals in the different and disparate research studies at LSU, GIT, and EPA
are very time consuming, requiring up to a month for a single analysis. In
contrast, SRI's jet-REMPI device can analyze low levels of simple chlorinated
hydrocarbons in seconds. Adaptation of this technique to the research
environment will remove a major impediment to progress in several areas of
environmental chemistry.
