During the Cretaceous Period, the earliest divergence of mammalian orders was
taking place, and the South Atlantic was beginning to open. Fossil vertebrates
of Cretaceous age from west Africa are extremely rare, but potentially important
to our understanding of the early history of mammals and the extinction of
dinosaurs. Drs. Jacobs and Flynn have collected some fossil vertebrates from
Cretaceous rocks from Cameroon, and they propose to explore the fossil-bearing
deposits more completely, and to identify the fossil groups discovered. The
proposed research could greatly improve our understanding of the early evolution
of mammals, and of how the geographic distribution of vertebrates was affected
by the separation of continents during the late Mesozoic.
