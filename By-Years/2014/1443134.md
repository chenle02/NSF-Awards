This project is in support of a week-long workshop at UC Berkeley on "Coding:
From Practice to Theory", to be held at the Simons Institute for the Theory of
Computing. The workshop is part of a program on Information Theory which will
take place from January 13 to May 15, 2015. The intellectual roots of the
workshop include deep results in algebra and combinatorics that yield efficient
codes, new paradigms for securely storing, distributing, sharing and compressing
data in distributed systems, and technological considerations related to mobile
devices, deep space probes and low power computing.

The workshop will enhance communication among the mathematics, computer science
and engineering communities. It will be open to all potential participants and
the workshop findings (including videotapes of presentations) will be
distributed to the public for comments and engagement. We will support students
to attend the workshop, and will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of
backgrounds to contribute to a wide range of application
