A crucial need for researchers in the area of science and technology studies is
access to the works of scientists and engineers. Traditionally, this has
required travel to the archives where the papers and other materials are kept.
In a few special circumstances, the works have been published in scholarly
editions. Yet for certain purposes, even published papers are not sufficient for
the kinds of studies that researchers wish to undertake. A new technology, CD-
ROM, allows easy reproduction of the original sources as well as computer
searches of texts. Under this grant, Dr. Renn is seeking to establish an
international collaboration in order to enhance the accessibility of some of the
major collections in the history of science such as the Galileo collection in
Florence and the Einstein Archive in Jerusalem. In order to be able to assess
the existing technical possibilities for realizing this project, this grant
provides support for an exploratory study over 8 months of various approaches to
putting the Galileo and Einstein papers on CD-ROM. At the completion of this
feasibility study, a meeting will be held in Italy to discuss future directions
for the use of CD-ROM technology in the history of science and technology.
