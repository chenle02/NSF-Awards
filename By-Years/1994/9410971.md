aThis research focuses on a number of issues that are central to better
underlying the dynamics of business cycles. The model to be developed allows for
variation in work effort and capital utilization over time. It takes into
account the fact that most workers have long-term attachments to their
employers, which makes them willing to adjust their work effort with no
immediate change in pay. The model also takes into account increasing returns to
scale in production, the pricing behavior of firms, and the tendency for prices
to remain fixed despite changes in economic conditions, and investment behavior.
In addition, people's consumption and labor supply choices are modeled as a
joint decision. This research will give us a better understanding of the factors
affecting the fluctuation of productivity over the business cycle and the
prospects for long- term productivity growth.
