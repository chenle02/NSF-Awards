Summer undergraduate research opportunities in the Department of Biological
Sciences at Wellesley College, and undergraduate college for women, will be
offered to ten students for the summer of 1988. Participants will be selected
from junior Biology, Biological Chemistry or Psychobiology majors who have
serious purpose and definite interest in independent work, have sufficient
course preparation and have shown ability to think imaginatively and
independently. Participants will be selected by the project director and faculty
committee after evaluation of application forms designed to recruit the best
qualified students for particular projects. The student will participate in all
aspects of the investigation, from pursuing a literature review to carrying out
experimental procedures and observations, continuing to analysis of data and
determination of conclusions. She will formally and informally discuss the work
with her advisor, and also will prepare several discussions with all fellow
participants, both student and faculty, for weekly group seminars. This will
encourage both experience with oral presentations and exposure to suggestions
and criticism of others involved in research. Research reports at the end of the
program will involve the writing of a paper, preparation of a poster for a
poster session and also colloquia presentations to students and faculty during
the next academic year. Throughout the summer program seminars will be presented
by women scientists in research careers in academia, industry and medicine; at
least one field trip to a biotechnology company will be taken.
