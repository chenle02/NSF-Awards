This action is to support the international participants who are to attend a
workshop dealing with metabolic mapping techniques for brain imaging during
behavioral functions. This workshop will be the first meeting to review state-
of-the-art applications of a new generation of cell metabolic mapping techniques
capable of visually imaging brain functions related to animal learning and
behavior. The potential impact of these functional mapping techniques for
elucidating brain mechanisms of behavior is enormous. This workshop brings
together leaders in this field from around the world and seeks to formulate
recommendations for the directions of future research.
