9316608 Lasaga This award will support continuing theoretical and experimental
work on the atomic descriptions of geochemical processes and the development of
kinetic theory in geochemistry and petrology. The research will continue the
task of obtaining high quality quantum mechanical information on bonding in
important geochemical gas molecules, silicates, aluminosilicates and other
minerals. The quantum mechanical results will be incorporated into potential
energy functions, which are then employed in kinetic studies of reaction rates,
estimates of kinetic isotopic effects, molecular dynamics and monte carlo
simulations. These studies will elucidate the relationship between atomic
physics and macroscopic thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena of interest to earth
scientists.
