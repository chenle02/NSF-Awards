Abstract 9512196 Barwick This Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) award
provides funds for equipment to instrument approximately one cubic kilometer of
ice at the South Pole Station to make the largest detector on Earth for
energetic particles. An array of optical detectors will be buried more than a
kilometer deep in the very clear ice to detect Cherenkov radiation from
particles passing through the ice. The resulting Antarctic Muon And Neutrino
Detector Array (AMANDA Mark 2) will have several scientific uses: most
importantly it is expected to be the first detector capable of routinely
measuring particles produced by energetic neutrinos from astrophysical sources.
There are two ARI awards, one to the University of California, Irvine and one to
the University of Wisconsin. Both universities have agreed, in accordance with
ARI proposal requirements, to provide matching funds. The AMANDA project is a
collaborative effort of the University of Wisconsin, the Universities of
California at Irvine and Berkeley, the University of Stockholm, the University
of Uppsala (both in Sweden) and DESY in Germany. ***
