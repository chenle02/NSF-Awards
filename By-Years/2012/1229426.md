With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-
funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program
and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA), Professor Arthur Utz from
Tufts University and colleagues Terry Haas, Elena Rybak-Akimova, Clay Bennett
and Samuel Thomas will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped
with a CCD detector. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and
education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) mechanism-based design
of selective, efficient, switchable receptors and catalysts for oxidations and
other small molecule activation reactions; (b) design of functional organic
materials; (c) design and development of catalysts for regioselective and
enantioselective synthetic methods; (d) design of nanomaterials and
nanocatalysts; (e) intermolecular interactions and self-assembly in fluorinated
biomolecules; (f) functional polymer materials; (g) single molecules on
surfaces; (h) biomimetic protein-based materials; and (i) design of cyclic
peptides with enhanced affinity and selectivity of binding to their targets.

An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry
and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well
as research not only at Tufts University but also in a series of Boston area
primarily undergraduate institutions that include Bridgewater State University,
Emmanuel College and Suffolk University. Outreach to Braintree High School
students and to deaf undergraduate students is being planned.
