The focus of this renovation project will be parts of the Burthe-Cottam
Building at Tulane University Medical Center. The space targeted for renovation
is in the Department of Biochemistry, which has been assigned the responsibility
to house, operate, and manage an institutional shared instrumentation facility
for research in molecular biology. Included in the facility will be several
equipment bays, a tissue culture laboratory, a room for storage and transient
disposal of hazardous chemicals (mutagens, solvents, radioisotopes, etc.) and
laboratories for new investigators. One area will be partitioned, furnished, and
equipped to provide chromatography and centrifugation facilities, a dark-room, a
cold-room, and instruments for general sample- handling. A second area will
serve as the Protein and Nucleic Acids Chemistry Facility. The third area will
be partitioned and renovated to provide a multi-user tissue culture laboratory
and shared space for the storage of hazardous materials and preparation for its
disposal. A fourth, very large, room (about 3800 sq. ft) will be partitioned to
create laboratories, and shared work areas for three new investigators. This
award will allow the modernization of this space so that it is totally usable
for biological research.
