With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Shelley Velleman will conduct four
years of research on the phonological development of children learning African
American English (AAE) as their first language. She seeks to understand
differences that result from exposure to AAE and Mainstream American English
(MAE), especially key features of the sound systems of the two dialects.
Velleman will follow 40 learners of AAE from 12 to 42 months of age to track
milestones in these children's language development. Both caregiver-child play
observations and formal phonological probes will be used to document the
children's progress in phonology. This project will use these new data to
contribute to emerging theoretical models of phonology that incorporate language
variation.

This research is significant because it will establish the normal sequence of
phonological development for children learning AAE. Many children who speak AAE
are enrolled in special education or speech-language therapy because their
speech differs from that of children who speak MAE. To correct this
inappropriate labeling, it is essential to know what to expect from normally-
developing AAE speakers at various ages. In addition, reading difficulties are a
major problem among children who speak AAE, and researchers have not yet
definitively identified the causes of these problems. Reading is influenced
phonological awareness skills, which are built on the foundation of oral
phonology skills. A better understanding of phonological development among
speakers of AAE will help educators understand how to prepare these children to
learn to read. This project will also support the development of scholars who
speak AAE themselves, as they will have the opportunity to engage in research.
