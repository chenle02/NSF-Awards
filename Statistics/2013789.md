Technological innovations have provided a primary force in advancement of
scientific research and in social progress. Large scale network data and
relational data are frequently encountered in genomics and health sciences,
economics, finance and social media. The proposed project will (1) enhance
methodological and theoretical developments for statistical analysis of network
and relational data. (2) advance the understanding of the community structure of
social network. The research emanating from this grant will advance the
frontiers of theory and methods for network data modeling. The new developments
will provide better understandings of large scale network data for researchers
from diverse fields of sciences and humanities, e.g., understanding the social
behavior of individuals and the dynamic nature of social network.

The proposed project has the following three interrelated objectives under the
theme of statistical inference for large scale network and relational data. (1)
To introduce a new framework for community detection with covariate information.
There have been many existing approaches to community detection. However, a
majority of them focus on analyzing the network without considering the
covariate information, which could be valuable for achieving greater accuracy of
community detection. The goal of this research is to study when and how will
covariate information help in terms of the community detection accuracy. (2) To
develop a new dynamic stochastic block model framework with applications in
change point detection. The stochastic block model along with its variants are
usually defined for a static network. The goal here is to define a dynamic
version of the stochastic block model, with a clear interpretation of how the
network evolves over time. A general dynamic spectral clustering method will be
proposed and its theoretical properties established. The important problem of
change point detection of the dynamic network will be studied in details. (3) To
introduce a conditional dependency measure with applications in undirected
graphical models. It is of fundamental interest to ascertain variables or
factors underlining the network dependency structure. The goal is to introduce a
flexible conditional dependency measure, which can capture a wide range of
different dependency structures. The PI will develop a new method for generating
a general undirected graph with desirable features by making use of the
resulting conditional dependency measure.
