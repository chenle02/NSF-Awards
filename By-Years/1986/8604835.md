Thios research equipment award will assist in the procurement of mechanical
loading systems for the application of time-dependent biaxial loading. The
equipment involved consists essentially of two independent load actuators to
apply forces in the x and y direction with independent servo controllers on each
axis. The actuators are restrained by a hexagonal loading frame. This equipment
will be utilized to study the behavior of composite materials under biaxial
states of stress. Research plans include studies of polymers-matrix composites
(silicon ccarbide in titanium and graphite in aluminum). Studies of these
materials will focus on non-linear deformation, static failure criteria,
delamination, damage initiation and growth, and compressive stability.
