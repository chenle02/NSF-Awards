The proposers plan to implement the Improved Student Performance model of school
reform, developed by the Ventures Education System Corporation (VESC), in the
reservation schools. This model was chosen by the teachers and administrators of
the participating districts. Supporting the Ventures implementation, as well as
the other objectives, the project leaders plan to conduct professional
development for in-service teachers, and include pre-service student teachers in
the activities as well. The project will also provide modest funding for
extracurricular content-focused activities for students, and to better involve
parents, as well as contracting for services to increase the cultural content in
the curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
