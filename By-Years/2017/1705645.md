This project will demonstrate that light-enabled gene patterning can control the
human cardiac pacemaker region. Light-enabled inhibition of key culprit regions
implicated in atrial fibrillation will be investigated. Exciting preliminary
results on automated high-throughput all optical cardiac electrophysiology
platforms using optogenetics was demonstrated and will be employed.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds upon the PI's optogenetic work in
optical control of cardiomyocyte function by incorporating gene editing tools
(CRISPR) to allow optical manipulation of gene expression. The optical
localization, using CRISPR action, will be used to modify local gene expression
in cardiac tissue constructs. The proposal covers unexplored territory in
cardiac pacing and has significant transformative potential.
