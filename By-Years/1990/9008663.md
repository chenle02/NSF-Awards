This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will support a study of the gas-phase chemistry of transition metal complexes
for which the solution chemistry is already well-known. The study is expected to
provide valuable information about the role of the solvent in solution-phase
reactions of these substances. Gas-phase ion techniques, especially Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, will be used to study the
reactivity and thermodynamic properties of coordinatively saturated or near-
saturated metal complexes which exist also as stable molecules or ions in the
condensed phase. These experiments will both address fundamental questions
regarding the intrinsic chemistry of such systems and provide insight into the
effect of solvation on reactivity and thermochemistry. Classes of complexes to
be investigated include: (1) early transition metal electrophilic cations of
titanium, zirconium and hafnium, (2) organometallic and coordination complexes
that have reversible one-electron changes, (3) electrophilic agostic complexes
of cobalt(III) and rhodium(III), and (4) early transition element alkylidene and
alkylidyne complexes. To provide improved thermodynamic data infrared
multiphoton dissociation techniques will be entended to new wavelength ranges,
and temperature control of ion cyclotron resonance spectrometry will be
developed.
