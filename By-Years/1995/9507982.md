Frictional fusion occurs during high strain-rate events and is recorded by
pseudotachylyte. Thus potentially, this material may provide information on
several parameters of the brittle faulting process that are currently difficult
to obtain, such as frictional temperature attained, the presence of a fluid
during faulting and degree of elemental and isotopic reequilibration attained
`efore quench. This research will utilize electron microbeam techniques and
laser heating isotopic methods to examine these factors in natural and synthetic
pseudotachylyte. Results have the potential of yielding significant insight into
the factors attending frictional fusion, and therefore could provide a tool for
understanding the behavior of brittle faults in the high strain-rate or
seismogenic regime.
