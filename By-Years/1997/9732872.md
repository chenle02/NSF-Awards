This research focuses on a computational analysis of the barrierless reactions
of transient carbenes and biradicals. Computational approaches to tunneling and
entropy controlled reactions will be examined with a specific emphasis on
developing the theoretical underpinning needed to predict product ratios.
Undergraduate students involved in the research will be introduced to modern
computational approaches to chemical dynamics and semi-empirical electronic
structure theory. With this Standard Grant, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program supports the research and educational activities of Dr.
Charles Doubleday of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University. Dr.
Doubleday will focus his research efforts on the theoretical analysis of the
reaction dynamics of carbenes and biradicals. Although implicated as
intermediates in a number of organic transformations, in most cases these
species can not be observed experimentally because of their short lifetimes.
Computational methods capable of treating these barrierless organic reactions
will be developed and tested through the prediction of reaction product ratios.
Dr. Doubleday's educational activities will include introducing undergraduates
to the development and testing of modern computational approaches to chemical
dynamics.
