This award provides support to the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology
for a three-year national and international Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site in collaboration with the Mongolian University of
Science and Technology (MUS&T) for research in advanced materials and
biochemical engineering. The goals of the REU site are to (1) provide ten
undergraduates of chemical engineering or allied fields with a unique research
opportunity; (2) provide American Indians, women, and other under-represented
groups a working knowledge of research in chemical engineering as a career path;
(3) provide an opportunity to gain research experience in an international
setting; (4) enhance students' critical thinking and communication skills
(including written, oral, listening, and audio/visual presentation skills); (5)
increase the students' interest in graduate studies with a target of 30% of
participants pursuing graduate degrees; (6) introduce students to the 'beyond
the classroom' experience in a research setting; and (7) enhance the students'
ability to think independently. At least 30% of the students will be recruited
from Tribal, four-year, and community colleges and universities from the four
surrounding states of Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wyoming, where
research opportunities historically have been lacking.
