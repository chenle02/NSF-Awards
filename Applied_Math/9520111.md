Tagg 9520111 An interdisciplinary meeting is proposed on the mathematics and
physics of fluid flow between rotating cylinders (the Couette-Taylor problem)
and other flows involving instabilities that arise in curved geometries due to
centrifugal forces. The Couette-Taylor problem is a prototype that has led to
several advances in understanding the nonlinear dynamics and evolution of
complexity in fluid flows. The subject is unique for the degree to which it
brings together mathematicians, experts in computational fluid dynamics,
physicists, and engineers to discuss a wide variety of theoretical, numerical,
and experimental techniques that may be first proven with this system and later
extended to more general problems. The meeting consists of a day of invited
talks honoring the 65th year of physicist Russell Donnelly, followed by three
days of contributed talks. A one-day pre-conference workshop will also be held
with the intention of attracting under-represented groups and researchers from
small institutions to a broader range of research topics in fluid instabilities,
pattern formation, and the origins of turbulence. %%% An interdisciplinary
meeting in proposed on the mathematics and physics of fluid flow between
rotating cylinders and related fluid flow problems. This area of work has been a
prototype for several advances in the understanding of instability and the onset
of turbulence in fluid dynamics. These advances include connections between
chaotic dynamics and turbulence, the spontaneous formation of patterns in
physical systems, the nonlinear dynamics of waves, and an astonishing variety of
ways that turbulence occurs. More than 100 mathematicians, computational
experts, physicists, and engineers are expected to attend. Special features of
the meeting include a pre-conference workshop that is intended to enable under-
represented groups to begin work in this field as well as a day of invited talks
honoring the 65th year of the distingui shed physicist Russell Donnelly. ***
