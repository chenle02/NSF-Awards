Wilson OPP 9527394 Jarrard OPP 9527319 Zoback OPP 9527412 Abstract This award
supports a collaborative research program to obtain the first age-calibrated
stress-field history within the West Antarctic rift system of Antarctica. The
opportunity to acquire the stress data is provided by the international drilling
program planned at Cape Roberts, which is located along the margin between the
uplifted Transantarctic Mountains and the rifted crust of the Victoria Land
basin. Information on the paleostress history of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic rift-
basin fill will be obtained from the core and downhole logging of natural
fractures and faults. To establish the contemporary stress state, the cores will
be examined for coring-induced stress fractures and the borehole will be
examined via downhole televiewer and dipmeter for any wellbore breakouts and
fractures reactivated by the contemporary stress field. The stress data will be
analyzed to address questions relevant to the paleo- and neotectonic evolution
of the Antarctic plate. The results will contribute to the resolution of
outstanding questions such as the cause of the anomalous aseismicity of the
continent, the geometry of stresses along the lithospheric boundary between the
Transantarctic Mountains and the West Antarctic rift system, and the evolution
of the Antarctic intraplate stress field and its relation to rifting episodes
associated with Gondwanaland breakup. Contemporary stress data obtained from
this program will be added to the global stress data base, and will help to fill
the current void in the global stress coverage marked by the Antarctic plate.
