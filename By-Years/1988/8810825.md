This is a feasibility study of a membrane gas-separation process operated with
the feed pressure cycled between two levels. The process is suitable for
separating gases with opposite diffusivity and solubility selectivities. The
main driving force for separation in this process is the solubility selectivity.
Thus, many gases with close permeabilities can be separated by this process, but
not by the conventional constant-pressure process. By proper cycling of the feed
pressure, the separations achievable by the conventional processes are also
enhanced. Experiments on several polymer-gas mixture systems will be performed.
Model simulations will accompany experiments. Success of the research would lead
to new possibilities for membrane separations which are not achievable by the
conventional operation.
