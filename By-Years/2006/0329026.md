The objective of this research is to develop a self-adapting vision system
inspired by biological systems. The proposed system will construct models of its
environment and will employ feedback processes in a hierarchical framework based
on natural systems. The project will investigate a new class of symmetry
phenomena involving approximate or qualitative symmetry; qualitative symmetry is
beyond the scope of most cognitive models of perception and humans often
classify nearly symmetric figures as not symmetric. The model offers the
potential of explaining a number of unintuitive and surprising aspects of human
performance on the task. The work proposed is aimed at fleshing out and testing
these explanations, and secondarily at developing a robust modeling tool for
this task.

The proposed research is meritorious intellectually since it addresses the
problem of qualitative symmetry detection, an aspect of qualitative spatial
reasoning, a topic that is a very important in artificial intelligence. This
work has a broad impact on many areas important to computer science and
engineering including computer-aided design, interpretation of diagrams and the
creation of diagramatic representations. This work will also have a broad impact
on understanding human qualitative reasoning in general.
