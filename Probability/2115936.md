Interacting particle systems with random dynamics are fundamental for modeling
phenomena in the physical and social sciences. Such systems can be used to
describe chemical reactions, as well as the spread of disease, information, and
species through a network. These models often become more meaningful when
multiple particle types are incorporated. For example, the celebrated First
Passage Percolation model describes the spread of a single species through an
environment; the incorporation of competing species enriches the model. This
project seeks to study more realistic variants of well-known models for chemical
reactions, epidemic outbreaks, and the spread of information as to deepen our
understanding of important phenomena from across the sciences and further
develop the mathematics that helps explain them. The project will involve the
undergraduate students training.

This project will consider five different stochastic multi-type interacting
particle systems: (1) The Diffusion-Limited Annihilation model is an
annihilating particle system in which collisions between opposite type particles
result in mutual annihilation. The version in which particles have different
speeds is difficult to study and conjectured to exhibit anomalous behavior when
different particle types are initially balanced. (2) The Ballistic Annihilation
model has three particle types and all collisions result in annihilation. The
limiting particle density in different regimes will be characterized. (3) The
Chase-Escape model is a competitive stochastic growth model conjectured to have
a coexistence phase even when the predatory species is fitter than the prey. The
effect of the environment and fitness of the different species on coexistence
will be investigated. (4) The A+B->2A model describes a growing system of
infected particles. This process was recently generalized to the continuum,
which leads to several new questions at the intersection of discrete and
continuous probability, which will be addressed. (5) Lastly, the classical
Susceptible-Infected-Removed model is well-understood on random graphs near the
critical connectivity threshold. A natural extension is to have susceptible
individuals rewire their connections away from infected individuals. This more
realistic modification may change the size of epidemics. These five processes
will be studied using a variety of tools from discrete and continuous
probability theory such as the mass transport principal, recursion, couplings,
large deviation estimates, and stochastic differential equations.
