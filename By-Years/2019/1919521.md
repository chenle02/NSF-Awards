TECHNICAL AND NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $7000 are
requested towards the travel expenses and conference related ground
transportation uses for sixteen US based speakers at the United States-Japan
Polymer Symposium: "Macromolecules: Challenges and Opportunities for the 21st
Century", to be held June 18-21, 2019 at Stanford University. The request
includes part-support for facility usage. The goal of the symposium is to cover
state-of-the-art developments in controlling polymer structures and
understanding structure property relationships to achieve novel macromolecular
designs and precisely controlled materials properties and functions. There will
be 34 speakers (16-US, 17-Japan) half among them world leaders in their fields
and the other half younger rising stars. A total attendee of 50 is
anticipated,the planned small number intended to ensure rigorous
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
