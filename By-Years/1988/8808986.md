The goal of the research is to develop thin gel composite membranes for
application in gel chromatography for bioseparations. The proposed composite
membranes will be formed by interfacially polymerizing onto thin porous
supports. Use of such thin gel composite membranes could result in large-scale
bioseparations. The productivity, selectivity, and effective thickness of the
resulting membranes will be related to the polymerization conditions. Water-
soluble polymers that are representative of biomolecular size will be tagged
with dye molecules and used as the permeating solutes. Membrane flux and
selectivity will be determined with a flow-through diffusion cell which uses a
fiber optic probe colorimeter to instantaneously measure the downstream
concentration. This project will stimulate further research in the area of gel-
based membrane separations. Processes based on the thin-gel composite membrane
potentially may replace additional steps in the purification of proteins and
other biological molecules.
