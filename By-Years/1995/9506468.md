9506468 Liou This research involves a study of rocks from the Dabie-Sulu
ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terrane of eastcentral China. Topics to be studied
include: (1) the areal extent of the extreme geochemical anomalies in negative
delta 18-oxygen values and high epsilon Nd bulk-rock values, (2) the breadth of
UHP metamorphism in the Dabie-Sulu collision zone, (3) the source and
composition of volatiles during UHP metamorphism, and (4) the petrochemical
differences between the UHP garnet-bearing ultramafics derived from cumulate
intrusive and those from mantle wedges. These UHP metamorphic rocks are under
intense investigation because they have been subjected to P-T conditions
involting low temperatures and high pressures up to 45 kbars, in a tectonic
setting responsible for arc-magma genesis and for intermediate-depth
earthquakes.
