9310970 Cruickshank The 1993 Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry
will be held at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island, with technical
sessions from June 21 through June 25, 1993. The theme of the conference will be
"Predicting Atmospheric Change". The conference will address several timely and
interrelated aspects of atmospheric chemistry involving regional, continental
and global scale processes in both the troposphere and stratosphere. Relevant
atmospheric processes include photochemical pollution, tropospheric oxidative
capacity, acid formation and deposition, greenhouse gas build-up, cloud and
aerosol effects on chemistry and radiation, biogeochemical cycling of trace
atmospheric species and stratospheric ozone depletion. ***
