This award was provided as part of the NSF Social, Behavioral and Economic
Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF
program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for
scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF
awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established
scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research.
NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the
scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its
research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an
important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each
Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance
their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Brandi L.
MacDonald at the University of Missouri, this postdoctoral fellowship award
supports an early career scientist examining the intersection of aesthetics and
politics in the production of ceramic vessels. The proposed research examines
novel and highly specialized polychrome ceramics. While engaging with research
concerned with the roles of sense and spectacle, this project investigates
political aesthetics through the lens of production. The central empirical
question this project investigates is: how was polychrome ceramic production
organized socially and spatially? Focusing on the production of the kero, the
project will produce fine-grained mineralogical and geochemical data in order to
identify and distinguish the scales and sites of kero production. The proposed
project will focus on three key stages in the manufacture of keros during which
raw materials were procured: 1) the selection of clays; 2) the selection of
tempers (non-clay mineral/organic substances added to clays prior to forming and
firing ceramic vessels); and 3) the selection of pigmentaceous materials. The
project will employ petrography to investigate the selections of clays and
tempers, Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and Neutron
Activation Analysis to investigate the selection of clays, and portable X-ray
fluorescence and Raman Spectroscopy to investigate the selection of
pigmentaceous materials. More broadly, this project will expand upon previous
scholarship investigating the role of craft production in the social and
political relations of early states.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
