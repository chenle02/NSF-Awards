We propose to fabricate and test microwave devices based upon the non-linear
voltage current characteristics of Josephson junctions. In particular one and
two-hole microwave SQUID (Supercon- ducting Quantum Interference Detectors)
devices and planar microwave sensors utilizing the non-linear characteristics of
the junction will be fabricated. The junctions will be ion beam milled to
tolerances of 100A in order to take advantage of the latest advances in etching
techniques. Only planar devices with the electrical ground in the plane of the
film will be studied. Laser deposited YBCO films will be used. We will derive
fundamental relationships between the critical current, Ic, and resistance, R,
and the fabrication parameters of the junction in order to estimate microwave
properties in the junctions. In addition to the calculation of D.C. voltage-
current characteristics of a junction in the presence of a microwave field,
microwave reflection (S11) and transmission (S21) coefficients will be
theoretically calculated for the first time. Measured performance of SQUID
devices and microwave planar devices will be modeled in terms of the fluxoid
dynamics and free energy of the junction or weak links.
