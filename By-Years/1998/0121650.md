The International Technology Education Association (ITEA) and the Eisenhower
National Clearinghouse (ENC) are establishing a comprehensive (broad and deep)
digital collection of resources that supports the teaching and learning of
technological literacy. K-12 classroom teachers, teaching faculty, museum
directors, and parents are using the proposed collection to discover
technological literacy resources; interact with those resources and other users;
locate relevant research; and link to online professional development. ITEA
provides content oversight, which includes the development of categories for
technological literacy and descriptors; identification of digital information
sources; and evaluation of candidate resources. ENC is building a robust
electronic infrastructure to support: the development of relevant and
appropriate metadata (in conjunction with other synergistic NSDL projects); the
processing of records and abstracts; the development of value-added user
interfaces; and the maintenance of computer services for optimum and continuous
digital library operations. An advisory board is providing annual input into
digital library development and identification of quality digital resources.
Field testing of the collection and its services is being undertaken with
diverse groups of users to evaluate ease of navigation and discovery of content-
rich, pedagogically sound resources. Finally, a variety of methods of
sustainability for the collection are being explored including public and/or
private sponsorship and subscriber support.
