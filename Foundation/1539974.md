This award supports US participation in the Third Muenster conference on inner
model theory, the core model induction, and hod mice that will be held July
20-21, 2015 at the Institut fur Mathematische Logik, WWU Muenster, Germany.

The conference will be devoted to recent work on the construction of canonical
inner models via the core model induction method, and to the theory of hod mice
upon which this work rests. Large cardinal hypotheses play a central role in the
set-theoretic foundations of mathematics. The inner model program attempts to
associate to each large cardinal hypothesis a canonical minimal universe of sets
in which that hypothesis is true. Some of our deepest understanding of large
cardinal hypotheses come from this program. The core model induction method is
our most powerful method for constructing such canonical inner models. This
conference will be devoted to recent work that strengthens the method in
important ways. The website for the conference is http://wwwmath.uni-
