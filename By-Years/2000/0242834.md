The proposed research covers a wide range of topics in superstring theory and
phenomenology. The main focus will be in non-Abelian generalizations of the
Born-Infeld theory describing the SO (32) gauge boson excitations of Type I open
Superstrings. Dualities will be used to analyze the effective action of these
theories. Duality techniques will also be applied to understanding questions of
superstring phenomenology such as supersymmetry breaking and mass generation
with the purpose of obtaining testable prediction for present and future
collider experiments. Among these predictions will be predictions of gaugino
condensation mechanisms for understanding tan b and to understand cascades of
supersymmetry breaking and their experimental consequences.
