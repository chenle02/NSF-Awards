The goal of this project is to develop an undergraduate major in Information
Technology that includes courses in telecommunications, information storage and
organization, human-computer interaction, technology transfer, and computer
programming. The curriculum development efforts of fifteen faculty from the
Information Technology and Computer Science departments will be coordinated by
the three principal investigators. Team members will participate in a workshop
in summer 1993, work individually and in small groups throughout the year on
construction and evaluation of course materials, and host a national workshop on
undergraduate Information Technology in fall 1994. Already rich in information
expertise, RIT intends to become a leader in this emerging field. The results of
our curriculum development efforts will be shared through professional meetings
and publications. We also hope to initiate a professional society in Information
Technology so that curricular and technical developments can be disseminated
nationally.
