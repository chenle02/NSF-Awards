This research project develops new artificial neural network concepts for
environment related prediction and spatial control that are inspired by the
hippocampal function. Hippocampus is an enfolding of cerebral cortex into the
lateral tissue of a cerebral hemisphere. The research combines a theory of brain
development and a theory of hippocampal function with recent developments in
statistical decision theory based upon recurrence and robustification of
artificial neural networks. The major focus of this project is on a study of
hippocampally inspired recurrent neural structures, adaptively developed
connectivity, robust neural operations and mapping, and information-theoretic
approaches for accessing and eventually reducing the computational demands on
the networks. The combination of biological and engineering research produces a
self re-enforcing, positive feedback, and the robust theory leads to a deeper
understanding of the function of hippocampus, and new concepts for better
implementations of spatial control based on robust decision theory.
