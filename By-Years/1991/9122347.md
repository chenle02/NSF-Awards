Corporations generally must enter the capital markets for financing to fund
their investment projects. The issuance of shares to shareholders and the
issuance of debt to bondholders are the two primary sources of financial capital
available to corporations. Because their claims differ, the interests of
bondholders and shareholders frequently diverge. For example, relative to
bondholders, shareholders generally prefer higher dividends, riskier projects,
and financing new investment projects with additional debt. Bond contracts
contain bond covenants that attempt to mitigate these potential conflicts. The
contribution of this project comes from assembling a unique database on the
contractual relations between shareholders and bondholders. The data are used to
look directly at one of the most basic corporate relationships, that between
shareholders and bondholders. Registration statements for bond issues are used
to compile a database detailing the use of restrictive covenants in bond issues.
The registration statements are for 327 nonconvertible bond issues registered at
the Securities and Exchange Commission by 217 utilities and industrial firms
during 1989 and an additional 198 registration statements for the same firms in
1986. The data will be placed in public archives and made available to other
researchers in this area. This will be a significant contribution because
previous work has had to rely on financial data sources that provide incomplete
summaries of actual bond covenants.
