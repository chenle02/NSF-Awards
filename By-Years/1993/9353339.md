9353339 Giannangelo INSTITUTION: Memphis State University TITLE: West Tennessee
Geography Project This project proposes to significantly improve the geography
knowledge of 90 teachers in a three year project. The teachers will be grouped
with 30 elementary teachers the first year, 30 middle school teachers the second
and 30 secondary school teachers. Each of the three workshops will receive an
intensive (seven hours per day) six week content enrichment in geography,
including map skills and training in using GIS. These same teachers will also
develop leadership skills and contribute to the development of an in-service
training manual to be used with teachers during the academic year. These
seminars will be conducted by University personnel and summer teacher
participants. The first cadre of teachers will begin their training during the
summer of 1994 with other sessions in 1995 and 1996. The cost share of this
project is 36% of the face value of the Foundation award. ***
