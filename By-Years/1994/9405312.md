This proposal requests support for a portion of the travel costs of speakers
invited to participate in the 9th Annual Penn State Symposium in Plant
Physiology to be held May 19- 21, 1994, in State College, Pennsylvania. The
topic for 1994 is "Pollen-pistil interactions". This symposium will bring
together outstanding scientists who will provide critical analyses and syntheses
of recent research concerning the development of pollen and pistils, pollen-
stigma interactions (e.g., the nature of the pollen coat and sporophytic self-
incompatibility), the mechanisms of growth in pollen tubes and analagous systems
such as root hairs and fungal hyphae, pollen-style interactions (e.g., post-
pollination signaling and gametophytic self- incompatibility), pollen selection
(non-random fertilization) and the processes of fertilization. This topic is of
tremendous interest to both basic and applied plant scientists. One of the goals
for this symposium is to foster interaction and communication among scientists
of all ranks working in academia, government and industry spanning the spectrum
from basic to applied research.
