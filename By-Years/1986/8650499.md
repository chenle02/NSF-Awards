This project will incorporate high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into
the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Jacksonville University. HPLC
instrumentation will be used by students in Separation Chemistry and Advanced
Experimental Chemistry, and for undergraduate research projects. In addition,
the HPLC system will be used for special projects by students in the Biology and
Marine Science Departments. Experiments in the laboratory courses include
investigations of operating parameters; use of ultraviolet, refractive index,
and electrochemical detectors; and design of a separation system for analysis of
a "real world" sample with a complex matrix. Research projects include joint
endeavors between the Chemistry and Marine Science Departments to analyze
various pollutants in the St. Johns River, a project to develop a more versatile
electrochemical detector for liquid chromatography, studies on rearrangements of
ephedrine derivatives and oxidation of phospholipids, and isolation of natural
products from marine algae. This project will enhance students' appreciation for
the capabilities of HPLC, a powerful modern technique, and develop their
expertise in the design and application of chromatographic separations.
