9316289 Nash Our preliminary data and the results of other workers indicate that
during the 16 Ma evolution of the Yellowstone thermal anomaly the frequency of
eruption has varied significantly, as has the temperature, chemical and isotopic
composition of magmas. This proposed study intends to examine each of these
parameters within a well constrained temporal framework. The PIs proposed to
collect and analyze tephra erupted during the evolution of the Yellowstone
thermal anomaly in order to: 1) Measure the frequency and volumes of explosive
eruption, assess possible periodicity in eruption rate, and evaluate suggested
gaps in explosive activity; 2) Determine the major and trace element chemical
composition of glass and phenocrysts; 3) Use mineral thermometers to determine
temperatures of magmas; 4) Measure Nd and Sr isotopic ratios to determine
relative input of mantle and crustal sources into the silicic magma generating
system, and to record the effect of eastward translation of the thermal anomaly
from accreted oceanic ltihosphere to the continental craton. This study will
provide an integrated investigation of the evolution of the major thermal
anomaly and should lead to a better understanding of the interaction of this
type of heat source with the continental lithosphere.
