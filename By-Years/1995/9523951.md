The PIs will test various data assimilation schemes on the January 20-30, 1993
World Campaign CEDAR database. This database contains observations from ground-
based instruments, which will be supplemented with UARS satellite data and
simulations produced by the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-
Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM). The PI will: (1) develop,
implement, and validate an optimal nudging data smoothing scheme; (2) develop a
direct optimization parameter estimation scheme; (3) research the applicability
of the adjoint model technique; (4) develop and implement an adjoint model
parameter estimation scheme; and (5) apply assimilation schemes to the January
20-30, 1993 10- day campaign data.***
