0214259 Koper

This grant provides partial support for an upgrade of the high-performance
computing environment for geophysicists at Saint Louis University. Research
carried out by the group is wide-ranging and includes Earth structure studies,
seismic source studies, seismic hazard analysis, application of space-based
remote sensing data to tectonic problems, and development of freely distributed
software. The grant will especially benefit three recently hired assistant
professors (Koper, Kusky and Zhu) in establishing research programs.
