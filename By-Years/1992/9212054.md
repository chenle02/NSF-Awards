The phase behavior of small-molecule amphiphiles in solution and well-defined
block copolymers in the strong segregation limit is strikingly similar. However,
a unified molecular-based understanding of this phenomenon is not well
developed. Since constraints defined by the molecular architecture dramatically
influence phase behavior, a molecular-based description of ordered fluid
microstructures is clearly required. The research is intended to further the
understanding of the crucial molecular parameters that govern condensed-phase
microstructure. This involves the design, synthesis, and characterization of two
new families of macromolecular architectures. These architectures will be
constructed by covalently linking stiff-dendritic macromolecules with linear
flexible chains. The design of these architectures relies upon considerations
taken from both small- molecule amphiphiles and block copolymers. One of the
unique features is that the architectures incorporate a stiff-dendritic segment
whose geometry is precisely defined. The insight gained from these studies will
enhance the discovery of new polymeric materials with bicontinuous phases. Since
bicontinuous phases have potential for controlling transport phenomena, the
research also has technological significance.
