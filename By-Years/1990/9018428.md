The goal for the first three years' research in my lab is to establish
Arabidopsis as a useful system for the biochemical and genetic analysis of
ribosomal gene regulation. Ribosomal RNA genes comprise 8% of the total
Arabidopsis genome. We have isolated numerous ribosomal RNA genes from an
Arabidopsis thaliana genomic library, and are looking for RFLP's that map to the
intergenic spacer in potential regulatory regions. We have putatively identified
the transcription start site by S1 mapping, and have noticed a duplication of
the start site sequence further upstream in the intergenic spacer. Future work
will determine if these duplicated sequences represent spacer promoters, which
have never been described in plants but are present in many other organisms. We
will also look for sites of transcript 3' end formation to help localize
potential terminator sequences in the arabidopsis spacer. To test the activity
of potential cis-acting elements, such as promoters and enhancers, we will
construct ribosomal minigenes whose transcripts can be distinguished from the
endogenous ribosomal gene transcripts in transient expression assays. Once the
assay is optimized, we will attempt to determine if spacer repeat sequences
enhance transcription, as in Xenopus and mouse. We will also examine the effects
of auxin on specific initiation by RNA polymerase I. Finally, we will screen
Arabidopsis genomic and cDNA libraries for the plant homolog of the vertebrate
RNA polymerase I transcription factor, UBF. These studies are aimed at
establishing the relationship between ribosomal gene organization and
biochemistry in Arabidopsis with other, better species as a prelude to genetic
analyses that can be undertaken in plants.***//
