Ultracentrifugation can provide direct, quantitative information concerning the
purity, size, shape and interactions of biological macromolecules. The
development of a modern analytical ultracentrifuge methods for macromolecules
and automated methods for the analysis and interpretation of ultracentrifugal
data is important for advances in molecular biology. The tasks addressed by this
proposal include: 1) completing the development of real- time, gravitational-
sweep sedimentation velocity analysis, including the integration of graphics-
based data interpretation software, 2) development of methods for the analysis
of associations between molecules which are heterogeneous with respect to
buoyant mass, and 3) adapting the real-time interference optical system to the
XL-An ultracentrifuge. The ultimate goal is to provide the scientific community
with a modern, fully-automated instrument and software capable of complete
hydrodynamic and thermodynamic analyses.
