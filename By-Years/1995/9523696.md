9523696 Bender Changes in the concentration of molecular oxygen in air are
linked to those of carbon dioxide by photosynthesis, respiration, and
combustion. Because of this linkage, distributions of oxygen reflect rates of
natural carbon cycling and anthropogenic perturbations in the carbon cycle. An
important difference in the behavior of these two gases is that carbon dioxide
is much more soluble in the oceans. Because oxygen is so insoluble in seawater,
variations in atmospheric oxygen concentrations reflect carbon and oxygen fluxes
without the confounding effect of changes in the ocean reservoir. In this
project, measurements of the oxygen distribution (actually the oxygen/nitrogen
ratio) of air at remote sites will be continued. These measurements will give
information about important unresolved fluxes of carbon and oxygen. Specific
results anticipated are: 1. Long term records of the oxygen/nitrogen ratio will
define the rate at which the oxygen concentration is decreasing with time, which
is due to fossil fuel combustion. These data, together with the rate of increase
of carbon dioxide, can be interpreted to determine the net rate of change in the
land biomass and the rate of carbon dioxide dissolution in the oceans. 2. The
seasonal amplitude in oxygen concentration reflects rates of net oceanic
production over a large scale. This information is currently not available from
any other experimental method. 3. Interannual changes in the magnitude of
seasonal variations in the oxygen/nitrogen ratio reflect interannual variations
in winds, cloudiness, and ocean circulation. ***
