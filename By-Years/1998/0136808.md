In February 1999 long-term monitoring of Mid-Atlantic Ridge Seismicity was begun
between 15 and 35 degrees north using autonomous hydrophones moored within the
SOFAR channel. The goal is to obtain a first-order understanding of the spatial
and temporal patterns in overall seismicity, and the partitioning between
magmatic and tectonic events at this slow-spreading ridge. The current grant
extends the deployment of the current hydropone array for an additional four
years, and makes the information more widely available to the ocean science
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
