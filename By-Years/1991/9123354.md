The present project hinges around a central concept known as "flutter
derivatives" which are quantities that need to be identified in certain
aerodynamic contexts. Such derivatives arise, for example, in regard to a body
placed in a cross-wind flow, where the dimensionless form of the aerodynamic
lift, drag or moment is given by a coefficient C that changes according to the
angle of inclination of the body. The flutter derivatives C' prove to be of key
importance in the response of bluff structures- like long bridges- to wind, as
their characteristics clearly define the possible proclivity of the bridge to
become unstable in the wind. Focusing on the engineering design of bridges,
knowledge of the coefficients C' for bridge deck forms has heretofore been
acquired exclusively by means of wind tunney experiment. Now, however, with
advances in computational fluid dynamics, the possibility arises of acquiring
knowledge of C' via calculation alone. such studies lie in the realm of research
and development, and a back-and-forth exchange between calculation and wind
tunney experiment is needed.//
