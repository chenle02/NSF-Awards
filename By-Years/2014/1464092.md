The future Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) will consist of heterogeneous devices
such as smartphones, tablets and laptops moving dynamically. Accurate and robust
spectrum sensing and identification of unauthorized spectrum usage are essential
components of spectral efficiency in future radio systems. This project aims to
utilize consensus-based cooperation featuring self-organizable and scalable
network structure to capture the swarming behaviors of spectrum users and
providing cooperative spectrum sensing in a fully distributed manner. By using a
combination of control theory and machine learning techniques, the project
designs secure weighted average consensus for cooperative spectrum sensing that
can not only capture the swarming behaviors in CRNs with heterogeneous devices,
but also is robust to practical channel conditions. Robust localization
approaches are developed grounded on dynamic signal strength mapping, which have
the capability to localize multiple malicious users. Additionally, the new
techniques are validated using an actual testbed with on-campus deployment and
system demonstration to industrial collaborators. The integration of control
theory with dynamic spectrum access will enable a new revolution in the way for
enhancing spectrum efficiency in CRNs. The project serves as a pioneer in
exploiting multi-disciplinary knowledge (e.g., control systems and machine
learning techniques) to achieve a more efficient spectrum usage in future radio
systems, aiming to alleviate the increasing crowdness of the spectrum occupancy
and support the co-existence of heterogeneous devices. This project also carries
out a broad range of education and outreach activities to encourage students to
pursue careers in the fields of science and engineering. Research results will
be disseminated to academia and industry through presentations and publications
in meetings, conferences and journals.
