The PI proposes a theoretical study of the large scale and slow dynamics of
spatially extended non-equilibrium systems. Two classes of model systems will be
investigated: 1. one and two dimensional lattices of discrete chaotic elements
or oscillators with dynamics preserving a conserved quantity or having an
internal symmetry; 2. two dimensional fluid flow. Numerical simulation, Monte
Carlo methods, mean field theory, and renormalization group methods will be
used.
