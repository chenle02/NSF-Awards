Computer Science (31) This project develops, evaluates, and disseminates an
integrated Internet-accessible embedded systems laboratory and associated
instructional materials. Development of this laboratory involves the adaptation
and implementation of four key ideas from several prestigious institutions
(Arizona State, Kansas State, GA Tech, CMU, and Princeton). The laboratory
relies on new educational pedagogies to enhance the learning experience of our
students in three degree programs Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
and Computer Science. The project develops and disseminates a substantial amount
of instructional material on embedded systems an important, emerging educational
area. It also provides complete documentation on the design and use of an
Internet accessible laboratory model. This model, applicable to other
disciplines, provides students access to expensive, sophisticated equipment
either remotely or in a hands-on mode, as appropriate to the educational goals.
