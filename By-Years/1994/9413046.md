9413046 Bellan This proposal calls for an investigation of the linkage between
orbit stochasticity, a microscopic effect, and macroscopic properties of the
plasma. In particular the investigator will look for a flattening of the
distribution function and a reduction of fluid response to the drift wave in the
plasma. The technique used will involve laser induced fluorescence. In a more
sophisticated application of the fluorescence technique, optical tagging will be
used to allow tracking the trajectories of specific subgroups of ions.
