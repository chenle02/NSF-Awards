The effects of reduced dimensionality an quantum confinement on fundamental
magnetic and electronic spin dynamics are being investigated in quantum
structures fabricated from II-VI diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS). Magneto-
optical spectroscopy probes spin-dependent phenomena such as carrier spin-flip
scattering, spin dependent electronic tunneling and localization, magnetic
polaron formation, and spin-lattice relaxation processes. The program combines
state-of-the-art techniques in femtosecond optical measurements, integrated
DCSQUID technology and epitaxial materials fabrication to obtain a real-timed
view of dynamical behavior in quantum magnetic systems.
