The objective of this work is the use of the MU radar (49.5 MHz) in Kyoto,
Japan, configured as an interferometer, to investigate those processes which
appear to cause a "tilting"of refractive index structures. Such tilted layers
produce differences in the measured vertical velocity using Doppler techniques.
By using the MU radar as both a Doppler device and an interferometer, these thin
scattering layers can be observed simultaneously thus producing independent
measurements of the entire field of motion.
