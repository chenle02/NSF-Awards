This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MSP-Start Partnership project,
"Active Approach to Algebra" develops a close partnership between California
State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) and the Montebello Unified School District
(MUSD) and establishes supplemental partnerships with four area community
colleges. This two-year project focuses on partnership-building, data collection
and analysis, the implementation of comprehensive evaluation measures, and the
development of an action plan which includes Professional Learning Communities.
The project will culminate with a full MSP Targeted proposal which will be
designed to improve the teaching and learning of algebra at MUSD high schools.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project reaches a diverse student body at CSULA,
which is a federally designated Title III and Hispanic Serving Institution with
42% (nearly 9,000) Latino students, and reaches an underrepresented population
in the Montebello Unified School District, with 94% of the students of Latino
heritage and 36% learning English as a second language. Moreover, this project
reaches many students who are the first in their families to attend college, who
are of low socioeconomic status, and who work at least part-time jobs to support
their education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This partnership studies how student
interest and success in science and math is related to a strong foundation in
algebra and studies if teaching algebra can be made more effective and engaging
by using problem-based learning assignments in environmental sciences. The
effectiveness of group-learning approaches, especially for students from
underrepresented backgrounds, is also examined. An external team is overseeing
the evaluation and results on partnership building will be disseminated broadly.
