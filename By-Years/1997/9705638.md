ABSTRACT Kopotun Kopotun will work on the area of Constrained Approximation. In
many applications, it is desirable for the mathematical model to preserve
certain geometric properties (e.g., monotonicity and convexity) of the data.
This is the subject that Constrained (or Shape Preserving) approximation deals
with. Kopotun has obtained a number of results in the area of approximation by
polynomials that preserve shape (or which satisfy other constraints). He will
work on estimates of the rate of constrained polynomial approximation in the
integral metrics and in nonlinear constrained approximation. Kopotun will work
on a variety of topics in the field of Constrained Approximation. Approximation
theory is one of the areas of Analysis that interacts more actively with
applications. In Constrained Approximation theory the objective is to
approximate a certain model preserving certain geometric characteristics of the
model. A major open area here is the nonlinear case of constrained
approximation.
