Error control codes have been extensively used to achieve high reliability in
computer and communication systems. This project deals with several new classes
of error control codes applicable to VLSI systems. These classes include: codes
that can mask bridging faults and open faults in busses; constant weight codes
that can reduce power consumption and noise in CMOS circuits; and assymetric
codes that can be applied in communications systems and ALU designs. In all of
these classes, promising preliminary results are being extended by the design
and analysis of new codes.
