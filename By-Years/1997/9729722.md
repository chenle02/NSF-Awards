The Foundation for Independent Higher Education requests support from NSF to
connect seven of their member institutions of higher education to the Internet.
These include: Harcum College, Bryan Mawr, PA Lancaster Bible College,
Lancaster, PA Our Lady of the Holy Cross College, New Orleans, LA St. Gregory's
College, Shawnee, OK Warner Southern College, Lake Wales, FL Each of the
institutions included will connect to the Internet using service providers in
within their respective areas. These institutions of higher education need the
Internet connections to be able to access information resources throughout the
state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff
students of these institutions as well as the community in general. The award
provides partial support of the project for two years.
