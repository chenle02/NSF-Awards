CTW is approaching completion of the fifth and final season of new show
production for Square One TV -- a daily PBS television series designed to
promote interest in and enthusiasm for mathematics among eight- to twelve-year-
olds, with special attention given to girls and minority children. Research has
shown that Square One TV is educationally effective, and the series has received
numerous awards, from both the educational and broadcasting communities.
