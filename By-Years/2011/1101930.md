The objective of this program is to demonstrate a low-insertion-loss integrated
optical waveguide isolator. The isolator uses a lossy and high refractive index
layer that is a ferromagnetic matrix in an indium gallium arsenide phosphide
layer. Key tasks include: develop software capable of analyzing waveguides with
ferromagnetic layers in the presence of static magnetic fields; design and
fabricate integrated waveguide isolators; and design and fabricate a
semiconductor laser integrated with an isolator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit is the realization of a practical optical isolator technology
for photonic integrated circuits, which does not currently exist. The proposed
isolator is transformative, removing the barriers to large-scale integration in
photonic circuits and allowing integrated photonic component counts to equal
that seen in microelectronics. This project will also result in the first
software capable of handling ferromagnetic layers in complex, multilayer
photonic waveguides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the nature of
the researchers, the inclusion of young researchers and the free distribution of
software. The photonics research group at SMU has always been diverse with more
than 50% female graduate students. A visiting female professor from Brazil will
be part of this project. Undergraduate students and high school students will be
involved in this project, helping recruitment of U.S. students for graduate
study. The ferromagnetic waveguide software developed on this project, like all
the photonic software developed by the SMU Photonics group, will be made
available to the photonics community.
