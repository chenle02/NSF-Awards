9354437 Cornette Iowa State University faculty members in Mathematics and in
Zoology and Genetics will develop and implement a one-year
mathematics/mathematical modeling course for freshman and sophomore students
majoring in the biological sciences. The emphasis of the course will be on
understanding mathematical models using biological processes to demonstrate the
applications of calculus. Calculus and differential equations are essential
tools for describing systems that change with time and will form the core of the
mathematical content. The students will collect data from a number of 'wet lab'
experiments that demonstrate time varying systems, and will use the data to
construct models and learn the concepts and manipulations of calculus. This lab
feature is a unique component of the proposal. The mathematics will begin with
the elements of calculus and will culminate with stability analysis of the
solutions to two differential equations in two unknown functions. Both discrete
and continuous systems will be studied. Students will also develop computer
models of more complex biological systems using commercially available software
(Stella) and will write some elementary codes. We also plan to have students use
Stella later in the curriculum in physiology and environmental science. Faculty
in Zoology and Genetics will develop the biological experiments and
descriptions. To facilitate use of the materials with large numbers of students
and at other institutions, the illustrations of biological systems and some
analyses will be developed as multimedia computer software recorded on read only
memory compact disks. The targeted student population includes the large
fraction of biology students who do not take an engineering calculus course. The
majority of these students are women.
