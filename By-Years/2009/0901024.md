Abstract Speh

Professor Speh proposes to work on several problems concerning the restriction
of an irreducible representation of a reductive Lie group G to a symmetric
subgroup H. She proposes to obtain a branching formula for the restriction of
certain class of unitary representations to a symmetric subgroup. The
restriction of complementary series representations of groups of real rank one
to subgroups of the same type will also be considered. Both of these problems
have applications to automorphic forms and the cohomology of arithmetic groups.
She also proposes to continue to investigate generalized modular symbols and
period integrals defined by symmetric subgroups. She proposes furthermore to
investigate together with D. Barbasch the representations in the residual
spectrum of type E.

Representations of reductive Lie groups are used to describe the symmetry of a
physical system, a differential equation, a geometric object. or a problem in
Number Theory. Professor Speh proposes to study the "breaking of the symmetry",
i.e consider the problem for a different, usually smaller, symmetry group.
Special cases of this problem have been consider in physics. The intellectual
merit of this research is a better understanding of symmetries in nature and in
mathematics.
