9302318 Auchmuty The investigator studies the construction, analysis and
numerical simulation of variational principles for certain problems in fluid
mechanics, field theories, chemistry and astronomy. He also studies certain
minimax problems and the development of algorithms for the numerical solution of
nonconvex extremal problems. The problems to be studied here include the
analysis and development of algorithms for modeling atoms and molecules using
the equations of quantum chemistry. Similar methods also apply in studying the
equations for vortices in fluids (which are important in studying hurricanes and
tornadoes) and models of rotating stars and planets. These are all described by
systems of nonlinear partial differential equations which arise from "nonconvex"
variational principles. This proposal studies aspects of the mathematics of such
problems and also questions of developing algorithms for solving these problems
computationally. ***
