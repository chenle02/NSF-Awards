9614822 Dahl This project involves a collaborative, multi-faceted, and multi-
disciplinary investigation of compositional and other factors governing Ar
retention, Ar closure temperature, and 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages in natural
amphiboles and micas. The fundamental research objectives are to: (1) determine
the compositional dependence of Ar retentivity within dioctahedral and
trioctahedral micas and common amphiboles; (2) examine the role of grain
boundaries and sub-grain domains on Ar retentivity; (3) examine the diffusion
geometry or anisotropy of Ar in these minerals; (4) test rigorously the ionic-
porosity model for Ar retention, and secondarily for Sr and Ca; (5) refine our
basic understanding of the crystallographic factors influencing Ar transport and
closure temperatures, and (6) add to existing knowledge of cooling history in
selected orogenic terranes. The field aspect of the proposed work will be
focussed in the Adirondack Mountains, NY, and the Black Hills, SD.
