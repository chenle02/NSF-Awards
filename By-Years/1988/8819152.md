In this project funded within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Robert R. Holmes of the University of Massachusetts will
investigate the extent to which phosphorus and silicon nucleophilic displacement
reactions are described by a common basis. The study of the substitution
reaction mechanisms of these elements relates to a wide range of relevant
problems such as phosphoryl transfer reactions in biological processes and the
polymerization of silanols and siliconates to form silicates and silicones. The
problem will be studied by a combined experimental and theoretical approach
which leads to the determination of the energetics and stereochemistry of the
likely intermediates in these processes. The theoretical program consists of ab-
initio molecular orbital calculations and will treat common nucleophilic
displacement reactions for which a series of entering, leaving and non-departing
groups are varied. The experimental program involves the synthesis and
structural characterization of five-coordinated anionic siliconates such as
penta(alkoxy)- ,penta(hydroxy)- and pentahalo-siliconates as well as mixed
alkylhalo-, alkoxyhydroxy- and chlorofluoro- penta-substituted siliconates.
Single crystal X-ray structural analysis and solid state nuclear magnetic
resonance measurements will be conducted to determine structural change between
the solid and solution states and to evaluate activation energies for ligand
exchange processes.
