This two-day workshop will define particular opportunities in the field of
cognitive neuroscience. It is unique in its intent to explicitly identify
particular linkages to promote among cognition, computation and biology. The
three organizers are highly regarded leaders in their fields, and the speakers
include a diverse group with many well-recognized names. Topics include how to
define cognitive neuroscience and how to use biological, behavioral and
computational approaches to study cognition, and the format provides adequate
time to discuss the several topics proposed.&lt;br/&gt; Results from the
workshop will include a set of recommendations to NSF for programmatic and
cross-directorate activity mechanisms to encourage productive new approaches to
cognitive neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;
