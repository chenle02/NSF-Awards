This proposal focuses on two distinct but related lines of research: singular
limits of nonlinear wave equations, and the development of theory and
applications of a function space, BnV. The former problems entail describing the
asymptotic behavior of certain families of nonlinear wave equations containing a
small parameter. These are mostly well-known equations from mathematical
physics. Specific problems include a number of issues related to vortex dynamics
in solutions of the Gross-Pitaevsky equation, for example dynamics of vortex
filaments in three or more dimensions. The function space BnV turns out to
provide a natural setting for this and related problems. BnV consists of
functions that, in a precise sense, have bounded n-dimensional variation. The
principal investigator will investigate properties of BnV functions with an eye
towards applications to problems in partial differential equations and the
calculus of variations.

We propose to study some questions that include the motion of vortex filaments
in certain kinds of superfluids, and related questions in pure mathematical
analysis. The most familiar example of a vortex filament is a smoke ring. Such
rings start out small, and as they move, their diameters tend to expand.
Simultaneously, they rotate more slowly as their vorticity decreases. If one
could blow a smoke ring in (bosonic) liquid helium, it would exhibit quite
different behavior. In liquid helium, the vorticity can only assume certain
values. This in effect should prevent the vorticity along a smoke ring from
decreasing, which in turn should prevent the ring from exanding. Thus a vortex
filament in liquid helium is expected to propagate without its length increasing
and without the rate of rotation changing. Some of the proposed work involves
developing an understanding of this filament motion, starting from basic
equations that describe bosonic superfluids. This is difficult, in part because
the vortex filaments do not appear in the equations in any explicit way. Other
aspects of the project involve studying a class of functions that can be used to
describe these vortex filaments and other related phenomena.
