This is a proposal by the Medium-Energy Nuclear Physics Group at Kent State
University (KSU) to study Gamow-Teller strength, stretched-state excitations,
analyzing powers, and polarization-transfer observables in (p,n) reactions
supplemented by (n,p) reactions; to probe the nuclear equation-of-state (EOS) by
measuring triple-differential cross sections for neutrons from high-multiplicity
collisions of equal-mass nuclei as a function of mass number and bombarding
energy, where the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane is determined by
measuring the transverse velocities of charged fragments emitted in a collision;
and to probe nucleon and nuclear structure via electron-induced reactions. KSU
is committed to an experiment to determine the electric form factor of the
neutron by using the KSU polarimeter to measure the polarization of the recoil
neutron after quasielastic scattering of a longitudinally-polarized electron
from an unpolarized neutron in deuterium. Also KSU has submitted letters of
intent to CEBAF for experiments on the charge form factor of the neutron, the
photoproduction and electroproduction of rho mesons, neutron knockout in the
quasielastic (e,e'n) coincidence reaction, and two-nucleon knockout (e,e'2N)
reactions. The group is continuing to develop improved instrumentation for the
detection of neutrons. Current projects include improved neutron polarimeters
and higher efficiency neutron detectors.
