Experimental research will be carried out on flow-induced orientation of liquid
crystals in liquid crystalline polymeric materials. Birefringence and
velocimetry will be used to study orientation details and their kinematics in a
sequence of increasingly complex nonhomogeneous flows. A newly developed
spectrographic birefringence technique is available for this purpose. Liquid
crystal materials are utilized in a variety of engineering systems, and their
characterization under dynamic conditions is presently still only poorly
understood.
