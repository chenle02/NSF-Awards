Proposal number: CNS-0427748&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ITR: Panoply: Enabling
Safe Ubiquitous Computing Environments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Leonard
Kleinrock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ubiquitous
computing offers both powerful possibilities and great risks and challenges.
Mobile devices entering ubiquitous environments may bring dangers in or face
threats already there, so careful control of the interaction between such
devices and a ubiquitous environment is required. The Panoply project will
provide safe ubiquitous computing environments by using the innovative spheres-
of-influence model to dynamically organize related devices into geographical and
semantic groups. Spheres of influence offer both a conceptual model for
reasoning about group interactions and an organizing principle for an actual
implementation. Devices in a sphere share a common security policy and
mechanisms that can prevent importation of malicious code or improper use of
local resources. Contaminated devices entering a sphere can be rejected,
decontaminated or allowed to operate in limited, safe ways. On the reverse side,
devices entering a sphere can control what they expose and offer to other
devices there, rather than allowing complete access, thereby providing greater
privacy and safety for mobile device users. Panoply will use policy negotiation
and automated planning capabilities to provide safety in a sphere of influence.
The project will build an implementation of the spheres-of-influence model and
will demonstrate its safety and effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;
