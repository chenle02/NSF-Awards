Software distributed shared memory (DSM) systems provide the abstraction of
shared memory to networks of workstations and distributed memory machines, such
as the Paragon, CM-5, or SP-2. Unfortunately, the latencies for global
operations in either environment are several orders of magnitude more expensive
than on tightly-coupled multiprocessors. The result is that current DSMs perform
well for only a restricted class of applications. The Sparks project is designed
to address this restriction by providing a protocol construction library that
will allow DSM performance to be improved to within a few percent of tightly-
coupled multiprocessors. Sparks' abstractions allow the design space of high-
level synchronization operations to be explored cleanly and systematically,
rather than in an ad hoc fashion. The emphasis is more on creating and
investigating the abstractions that make a broad variety of optimizations
possible, rather than on the individual optimizations themselves. However, the
performance gains allowed by the synchronization types created via the Sparks
library will be thoroughly quantified. The Sparks interface will be implemented
in CVM, a new distributed shared memory system. In addition to providing support
services to Sparks, CVM implements novel coherence protocols and multi-
threading support. ***
