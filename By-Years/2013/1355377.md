Graph analytics form a canonical Big Data problem that is of significant value
to the long tail of science, from social sciences to genomics. While graph
algorithms for big-memory machines abound, they are inaccessible to the wider
community. Developing appropriate abstractions for graph applications on
distributed cyber-infrastructure like Clouds and commodity clusters has been
challenging. This work explores a subgraph-centric approach which offers the
potential for an order-of-magnitude performance benefit. This work investigates
graph algorithms, focused on de novo plant genome sequencing, that use a
scalable subgraph-centric graph programming model for Clouds. It offers a novel
research direction that can profoundly impact next-generation genome sequencing
in addition to other domains where graph abstractions can be employed. It
catalyzes research into distributed graph analytics through a critical mass of
subgraph-centric algorithms, mitigating the lost opportunity cost in delayed
adoption of the technology and domain specific computing abstractions. In the
process, it will fundamentally advance scalable graph processing to rapidly
accelerate and democratize cyber-infrastructure for Big Data for next generation
sequencing.
