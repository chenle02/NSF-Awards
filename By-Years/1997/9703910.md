This grant supports a workshop on the applications of Voronoi diagrams and
splines. Voronoi diagrams are one of the central concepts in computational
geometry, and have found applications in a broad range of scientific
applications. This workshop brings together leading researchers on Voronoi
diagrams from various areas of expertise. NSF funds are being used primarily to
support participation by young researchers.
