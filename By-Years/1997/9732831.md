9732831 English This grant provides funding for the development of an effective
and efficient framework for the quality monitoring and control of processes
generating time dependent data common to the process industries (i.e., chemical
processes). First, the empirical covariation chart will be analytically
developed, and its performance potential will be evaluated. Second, the
interface between statistical process control (SPC) and automatic process
control will be further exploited beyond what is found in the literature. Third,
other new and existing SPC approaches will be evaluated in the context of a new
process disturbance paradigm unique to time dependent data. Fourth, the
recursive discrete time Kalman filter (RDTKF) will be modified and evaluated for
application in this scenario. If successful, this project will provide a
cohesive design of tools for quality monitoring and control for the process
industries. The resulting framework should be suitable for application in many
manufacturing processes and will be well tested based upon analytical and
simulation results. Scenario specific strengths and weaknesses will be
documented within the tasks of the research agenda. The impact of the research
will be realized through the dissemination of findings in scholarly journals and
applications within various industries.
