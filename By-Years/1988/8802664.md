Martin Magid will investigate timelike and spacelike surfaces in Lorentz space.
The primary motivation for studying these surfaces comes from physics and the
theory of general relativity. He intends to use the Gauss map to achieve a
deeper understanding of these surfaces. Timelike surfaces can be used to
construct spacetimes and to understand the geometry of spacetimes by providing
lower dimensional examples. The Gauss map of a spacelike surface has its range
in the Grassmannian of spacelike two dimensional planes in Lorentz space. Magid
will investigate to what extent such a surface is determined by its Gauss map
and which maps are Gauss maps. He will also consider surfaces for which the
image of the Gauss map has constant curvature. His second project is concerned
with the classification of timelike surfaces with zero mean curvature which are
given as the graph of a function.
