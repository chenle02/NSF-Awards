Support is provided for the Materials Research Laboratory (MRL), which
constitutes a materials research core at MIT, concentrating on major problem
areas of scientific and technical interest which require multi-disciplinary,
multi-investigator research. The research is organized into five thrust areas
which comprise research on flow and fracture in high temperature alloys; defects
in semiconductors; phase transitions; polymers; and a new industry-university
cooperative initiative addressing innovations in the technology of high strength
steels. This research addresses innovation in the technology of high-strength
steels, with the aim of understanding and controlling metallurgical
microstructure on an unprecedentedly fine scale in commercial alloys. Its theme
is to advance and apply basic principles in physical metallurgy and related
disciplines as a foundation for novel concepts in alloy design.
