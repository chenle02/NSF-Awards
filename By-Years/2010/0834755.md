Innovations in computing technology, decreasing costs, and advances in
miniaturization have made it physically and economically possible to incorporate
computers into a wide variety of devices ranging from diminutive wireless
sensors to large consumer appliances. This proliferation of computing devices
has served to create a world full of possibly millions of such computers,
scattered ubiquitously across physical spaces. These devices in combination
represent a computational fabric which has the potential to enable an ambitious
new class of applications that can exploit the resources in the physical world
and also affect the environment around them. At present however, devices exist
in isolation because their software and hardware architectures are incompatible
and they have not been designed with interoperability in mind. This project
envisages the design and implementation of a software system that (1) will allow
large collections of heterogeneous devices to interoperate via the use of
standard interfaces, (2) will enable the representation of a (potentially
changing) set of such devices as a single composite device to simplify
programming, and (3) will support the construction of complex applications from
small modular pieces that run across multiple devices. If successful, the
project will achieve a seamless integration of the computing and physical worlds
in a manner that is highly sensitive to the needs of individual, groups, and
organizations. Intellectual advances associated with the project will be
incorporated into the computer science curriculum and will be disseminated as
open source software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
