Quantum mechanical tunneling has always been an interesting phenomenon in
semiconductor devices, although the practical utilization of this effect in
device applications is limited. Recently with the high degree of crystal
interface perfection and the precision growth possible with MBE technology, new
and novel tunneling structures can be fabricated. The goal of this research is
to characterize and optimize electron transport in tunneling structures. MBE
technology will be developed as necessary to optimize this transport.
Investigation of novel geometries that could be used as either high speed or
opto electric devices will be performed.
