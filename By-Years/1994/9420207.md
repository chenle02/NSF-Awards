This award is for the Fifth International Conference on Seismic Zonation which
is being organized by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, in
cooperation with the French Association for Earthquake Engineering. The
conference will provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the advances in seismic
zonation from the perspective of the earth sciences, engineering, urban
planning, social sciences and public policy. The conference will focus on useful
applications of seismic zonation that have led to loss estimation and refined
mitigation efforts related to the built environment, land use, and emergency
preparedness. Gaps in knowledge will be identified and recommendations for
future research will be developed.
