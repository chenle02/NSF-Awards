Manufacturing features such as chamfer, round, fillet, keyway, and bore are only
implicitly embedded in solid modeling representations. The objective of this
research is to develop an algorithm capable of extracting such manufacturing
features from a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) tree and further rebuilding
the tree to unify feature representations. This research consists of two phases:
Phase 1 focuses on the study of individual features mainly to develop algorithms
that are capable of extracting and unifying a large variety of features; and
Phase 2 involves an effort to coordinate all distinct features within a CSG
tree, and then to support application uses such as automatic process planning
and volume approximation.
