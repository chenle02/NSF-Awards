A graduate program in science education will be developed for elementary school
teachers from schools in the Boston, Cambridge, and Fall River, Massachusetts,
school systems which have high minority enrollments. Most of the teachers will
be minority women. It will include three courses taught in the schools and one
in which the teachers will be in a field assignment in industry or at the Boston
Museum of Science. The three in-school courses will include one in a specific
science discipline and two more covering topics such as Hands-on Science
Learning, Teaching Science with Technology, Problem-centered Science, and
Applied Mathematics and Science Tools. Field assignments will include actual
work in industry or the museum coupled with follow-up sessions dealing with how
to translate those experiences into useful classroom activities. Teachers will
receive certificates of graduate work in elementary science education from
Lesley College and can transfer the credits to a master's degree in science
education program if they matriculate within five years. The program will be
headed by Lesley College faculty members with the assistance of an advisory
committee including elementary science teachers and industry and museum
scientists. Cost sharing by the partners will total 100% of the National Science
Foundation funding.
