9629839 Chubukov The work proposed in this grant involves a careful theoretical
study of the antiferromagnetic cuprates as they are doped and transform from an
insulating commensurate antiferromagnet to a metallic, superconducting state.
The project contains both analytical and numerical approaches. Specifically one
part of the project contains a study of the evolution with doping of the Fermi
surface of vacancies, of the density of states and the vertex corrections to the
d- wave superconducting pairing. Yet another project involves a careful analysis
of the two magnon Raman scattering in undoped and lightly doped regimes. Finally
there are plans to investigate the critical behavior of a frustrated quantum
antiferromagnet. %%% The high Tc superconducting materials start out as an
insulating antiferromagnet before they are doped and transformed into metallic
superconductors. This project by a young assistant professor, concerns a careful
and detailed study, using a variety of techniques, of the evolution of these
materials as they are doped. The study is of critical importance in
understanding the mysterious properties of these materials including the
appearance of high temperature superconductivity. ***
