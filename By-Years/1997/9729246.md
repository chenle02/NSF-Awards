9729246 JACKSON The nigrostriatal dopamine pathway is an anatomically and
chemically distinct and important component of the motor control system in
mammals. The prenatal development and physiological function dopaminergic
neurons in this pathway is known to be accelerated in female rats as compared to
males, and this sex difference does not appear to be dependent on steroid
hormones. Little is currently known about the underlying mechanism of the more
rapid maturation of this pathway in females, whether other types of cells in
this system show similar sexual differences, or whether these early differences
persist during postnatal development and adulthood. This study seeks to
determine if dopamine and other neurotransmitters have regulatory effects on
neuronal growth and synapse formation in this system, and to characterize the
range of the affected neuronal types at both pre- and postnatal times. The
results of this research will enhance our understanding of how hormone-
independent gender differences arise in this system, and whether these
differences persist during postnatal development.
