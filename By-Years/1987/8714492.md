This research deals with the design of a vision system for a specified task
facilitated by sensor-placement techniques that efficiently compute the set of
viewpoints from which a specified surface target is not occluded by any object
in the environment and from which the entire target lies within the pyramidal
field view of the sensor. The target, which cannot be properly viewed by one
sensor, is partitioned into a minimal number of components each of which is
covered by one sensor. The following issues are addressed: acceptable locations
for triangulation range sensors; appropriate camera parameters (image plane,
lens, and aperture diameter), given an approximate sensor location; sensor
region for targets composed of curved surfaces; and the best viewpoint for a
given task.
