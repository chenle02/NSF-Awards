Access to pain medication varies considerably in different settings. How this
affects concepts of pain and the way different types and experiences of pain are
treated remains poorly understood. This research uses theory from cultural
anthropology to investigate how cultural variation in pain care affects how
sufferers understand and experience pain and, in turn, how variation in
conceptualizations of pain affect social relationships. The project provides
training for a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and undergraduate
students from underrepresented groups. Results will be disseminated broadly to
academic and non-academic audiences, including healthcare workers and other
stakeholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to investigate
pain and care practices to understand how practices and meanings of pain are
shaped by varying biomedical and cultural contexts. The project uses
ethnography, interviews in health facilities and community settings, and
document and archival analysis to pursue three complementary objectives: to
investigate differences in biomedical versus community-driven care practices; to
understand how differences in care practices affect and are affected by social
relationships; and to understand how different cultural contexts intersect with
2 and 3 to shape experiences and understandings of pain. This research will help
to develop and test theories that account for the complex intersections of
individual attributes and social, cultural, and political structures in shaping
meaning and experience in the mind-body connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
