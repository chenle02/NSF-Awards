Quantile regression is emerging as an important and active research area driven
by diverse applications. Compared with the conventional least squares
regression, quantile regression methods are robust against outliers and can
capture heterogeneity. In recent years, significant results related to
estimation and variable selection for quantile regression have been obtained for
big data applications. However, there exists little work on inferential methods
including hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction for quantile
regression in the high-dimensional setting. This project seeks to develop new
statistical theory, methodology and algorithms to address inference problems in
high-dimensional quantile regression. The research is motivated by a large
clinical trial of diabetes intervention, and the developed methods can also be
applied to data from genome-wide association studies, neuroscience, and
environmental studies.

The research will focus on two main directions. First, new testing procedures
will be developed to assess the overall significance of high-dimensional
covariates on quantiles of the response distribution. Two types of tests are
proposed, including a maximum-type statistic based on marginal quantile
regression, and a score-type statistic. Theory and methods for both fixed and
diverging dimensions will be studied. Second, focusing on high-dimensional
quantile regression without the conventional minimum signal strength condition
on the coefficients, the PI will rigorously study the asymptotic theory of
penalized estimators and develop valid post-selection inference methods based on
both asymptotic theory and bootstrap procedures. The PI will integrate research
and education by developing advanced topics courses, engaging graduate and
undergraduate students, especially those from under-represented groups, in the
project, and reaching out to K-12 students and developing countries through
collaboration and knowledge sharing.
