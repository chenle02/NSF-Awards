Under the terms of this grant (NSF-DMS-1004827) the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will administer a travel award program for
approximately 100 mathematical and computational scientists, particularly early
career faculty and graduate students to attend the International Congress on
Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2011), to be held on July 18-22, 2011
in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The ICIAM congresses are held every four
years and are the primary worldwide forum for presentation of advances in the
mathematical and computational sciences and their applications to science and
technology. Travel awards are especially important for early career researchers
and graduate students who may otherwise have difficulty in marshalling
sufficient funds. Without travel support, they would be likely to take advantage
of this less opportunity for direct interaction and networking on an
international scale. This support will help U.S. mathematical and computational
scientists keep pace with the advances in applications to technology and science
being developed throughout the world. The award process will acknowledge of the
importance of diversity, encourage women and minorities to apply, and give
priority to qualified applicants. The travel awards will cover air
transportation, lodging costs, and registration costs for participants (up to an
amount of $1000). They will be awarded to individuals who are affiliated with
U.S. institutions consistent with the rules and procedures of the National
Science Foundation.
