The main objective of this project is to extend the basic technical concepts
behind present short-term energy management so that they can integrate radically
different constraints and incorporate alternative optimization criteria to
permit quantitative evaluation of the new ways in which power systems are
evolving. The project seeks to include generation options available from the
independent power producers in a security constrained dispatch methodology. The
primary goal is to develop an optimization approach that can be performed in
real time for operator use. An approach which iteratively combines the
alternating consideration of technical and economic criteria is the main focus
of the work.
