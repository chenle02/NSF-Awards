9412468 KING This is a two year cooperative research project proposed by Dr.
Alexander King, State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Professor Fu-
Rong Chen, National Tsing Hua University. This proposal is to conduct a study to
understand the embrittlement of copper-bismuth alloys. It requests funds to
support a half- time graduate student to work on this project and to support the
P.I.'s travels to Taiwan. This project enables Dr. King to gain access to
equipment that is not yet available in the United States, while he can provide
expertise to his collaborator in the areas of specimen preparation and
interfacial structure analysis. The embrittlement of metals is an important
problem in materials science and currently poses significant limitations in
material applications. This is an excellent project, which addresses an
important problem with promise for useful results and provides a hands-on
opportunity for training a U.S. graduate student. This project is jointly
supported by the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council (NSC), which
provides major support for laboratory operations. The modest support from the
NSF in this case is extensively leveraged by the NSC.
