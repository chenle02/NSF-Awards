This research will create a new generation of computational tools, called
contextual prediction models, for analyzing and modeling social nonverbal
communication in human-centered computing. This computational study of nonverbal
communication not only encompass the recent advances in machine learning,
pattern analysis and computer vision, but goes further by developing and
evaluating new algorithms and probabilistic models specifically designed for the
domain of social and nonverbal communication. The ability to collect, analyze
and ultimately predict human nonverbal cues will provide new insights into human
social processes and new human-centric applications that can understand and
respond to this natural human communicative channel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
new endeavor will advance through the development of prediction models and their
accompanying selection algorithms and feature representations for predicting
human nonverbal behavior given a social context (such as the immediately
preceding verbal and nonverbal behaviors of a conversational partner). The
investigator's previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of using machine
learning approaches to model nonverbal communication. Probabilistic sequential
models were shown to improve performance of nonverbal behavior recognition
during human-robot interactions and make possible the natural animation of
virtual humans. This project addresses three fundamental challenges directly:
feature representation (optimal mathematical representation of social context),
feature selection (subset of social context relevant to prediction of nonverbal
behaviors) and probabilistic modeling (efficiently learning the predictive
relationship between social context and nonverbal behaviors). This research will
evaluate and test the generalization of the computation tools using a large
corpus of natural interactions in different settings (human-human, human-robot
and human-computer) and domains (e.g., storytelling, interview, and meetings).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These prediction models will have broad applicability,
including the improvement of nonverbal behavior recognition, the synthesis of
natural animations for robots and virtual humans, the training of cultural-
specific nonverbal behaviors, and the diagnoses of social disorders (e.g.,
autism spectrum disorder). The code resulting from this work will be made
available to the research community through an open-source Matlab toolbox. The
outcome of this research effort will produce state-of-the-art computational
models more accessible to researchers who aim to analyze social nonverbal
communication and develop natural and productive human-centered computing
technologies.
