9626850 Singh This project was submitted to the "Structural Control for
Performance, Safety and Hazard Mitigation Research" competition. The main goal
of this work is to examine and develop a sliding mode control for its
application to civil structures. The mathematical structure of this method
permits its application to linear and non-linear systems. To this end several
basic research question will be addressed analytically and experimentally by the
project which is divided into several tasks. The first task is to develop
optimal sliding mode controllers, including frequency shaping and frequency
domain approaches, both for linear and non-linear systems; next task is to
integrate active control; and finally to verify experimentally the developed
control algorithms. Results from this research will lead to the development of
experimentally verified active and semi-active control methods to be applied to
civil structures for improving their performance and safety under seismic and
wind forces. ***
