The purpose of this study is to investigate slowly growing irregularities in the
high latitude E region that cannot be described accurately by a local linear
instability, but instead have a convective, nonlocal evolution. The study will
make use of an extension of an existing nonlocal model from high latitudes to
mid and low latitudes. The model is based on an expansion of the plasma
perturbation equation, along with the principle of conservation of wave action.
At high latitudes, previous research using this model has uncovered a new
mechanism for wave growth or decay purely from conservation of wave energy, when
a wave propagates into a region of different background plasma density. This
process proved to be more important than traditional gradient drift growth in
most cases. At low latitudes, where the polarization drift causes irregularities
to propagate vertically through the vertical plasma density gradient, growth
from the principle of conservation of wave energy will be an important, if not
dominant process. This research will investigate the process, and in general
improve the understanding of the evolution of E region irregularities, by
generalizing the model to the magnetic field geometry at low and mid latitudes.
Additionally, instability simulations from the model will be compared with
Jicamarca Radio Observatory data. This will help understanding and
interpretation of radar observations of E region irregularities. Plasma
irregularities in the equatorial electrojet are important because they modify
transport properties and affect the mean state of the E region, altering the
electrojet current, and influencing electrodynamics throughout low and mid
latitudes. The irregularities also provide means of measuring parameters like
electric fields and winds in the equatorial MLT region that cannot be readily
probed in other ways. The validity of such measurements improves as our
understanding of the instability processes at work grows. Finally, the study of
naturally occurring plasma waves and instabilities has important overtones for
research in confined laboratory plasmas that society may eventually depend upon
as energy sources.
