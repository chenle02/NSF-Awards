9700942 Schoener A primary question in ecology is how a top predator affects
other trophic levels. While many field-experimental studies have been directed
toward understanding how food webs function, few have included very large
terrestrial carnivores. One reason may be the general difficulty of manipulating
such predators in limited, well-defined sites. Certain islands of Australia's
Great Barrier Reef provide an opportunity to conduct field experiments on a
system which contains a kind of very large terrestrial carnivore, monitor
lizards, that is easily observed and handled. Monitor lizards and the next-
lowest trophic level, the smaller scincid lizards, will be excluded or not from
experimental plots in a crossed design. Skink and leaf-litter arthropod
densities and taxonomic compositions, among other variables, will be recorded at
regular intervals after inception of the experiment. To complement the
experimental study, a comparison of skink and arthropod densities and taxonomic
compositions will be performed on islands with and without monitor lizards
naturally present. This study will help begin to fill the major gap in our
ecological knowledge concerning the importance of very large carnivores in food
webs.
