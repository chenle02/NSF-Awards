This proposal supports research between U.S. scientist, Kurt C. Fisch of the
Polymer Institute, University of Detroit, and Piotr Penczek of the Institute
Industrial Chemistry, Warsaw, Poland under the Maria Sklodowska- Curie Joint
Fund II. Dr. Fisch will travel to Poland to continue research in synthesis of
novel polyurethanes with possible liquid crystalline properties. The reviewers
found the proposed work to be innovative and believed it could lead to
interesting and potentially useful new polymers. This project is jointly
approved and supported by NSF and the Polish Academy of Sciences under the US-PL
Maria Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund II.
