The controls on phosphorize formation and mineralization rates will be
determined by analysis of the upper several meters of the shelf sediments from
cores sampled during ODP leg 112 and several wide-diameter cores to be sampled
during two future expeditions. Detailed chronostratigraphic analysis will be
obtained by stable isotope analysis of benthonic foraminifera, bulk sediment
dating and absolute dating of interdispersed authigenic minerals and shell
material. These data will allow the PIs to relate the formation and occurrence
of phosphorize to environmental parameters over a time scale of hundreds to tens
of thousands of year.
