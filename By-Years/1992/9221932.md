This Americas Program award will fund a cooperative research project, involving
sol-gel processing and characterization of supported metal catalysts, between
Dr. Richard D. Gonzalez of Tulane University and Professors Ricardo Gomez Romero
and Tessy Lopez Goerne of the Autonomous Metropolitan University of Mexico at
Iztapalapa. The focus of this proposed study will be on sol-gel processing of
silica and alumina. A new series of high surface area catalysts in which the
metal is in a highly dispersed state will be prepared. Sol-gel processing will
lead to the formation of more homogenous-supported metal catalysts with a much
more uniform distribution of particle sizes. The reforming catalysts prepared by
sol-gel processing have the potential to compete favorably with industrial
catalysts in use. This cooperative research project will share facilities
available at Tulane University and Mexico. The synthetic procedures and catalyst
characterization studies will be performed at Tulane while catalytic studies
will be performed in Mexico.
