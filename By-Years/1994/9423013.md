9423013 Moodera Experimental investigation of the properties of magnetic
materials by the surface-sensitive technique of spin-polarized tunneling is the
aim of this research program. In particular, electron tunneling between
ferromagnetic metals, through ferromagnetic insulators, and exchange effects in
ultrathin films, and at the interfaces between ferromagnetic metals and
paramagnetic metals will be studied. Planar tunnel junctions will use
superconductors as electron-spin detectors at low temperature and voltage. Our
recent success in using ferromagnetic metals as electron-spin detectors at room
temperature and higher voltages greatly broadens this field of research and
suggests technological uses. %%% Improvement of computer magnetic memory systems
is currently of high priority. Study of surfaces and interfaces has become
increasingly pertinent from the point of present and future technology. This is
a proposal for the study of the physics of magnetic effects in thin film
surfaces and trilayers using the technique of spin-polarized tunneling. The
recently discovered large magnetoresistance effects in ferro-magnetic tunnel
junctions at room temperature promise important applications for these effects
in READ/WRITE sensors and memory elements. ***
