Enumerative combinatorial geometry studies fundamental counting questions for
geometric combinatorial objects. One example of such a question is to determine
the possible number of intersection points among a given number of lines in the
plane. This project investigates such combinatorial questions using methods from
algebraic geometry. Some combinatorial invariants have been shown to have
algebraic geometric nature, that is, there are algebraic varieties associated to
special combinatorial objects, and it is possible to express combinatorial
invariants using the corresponding algebraic varieties. Once such algebraic
geometric nature is realized, one can translate combinatorial questions into
questions about algebraic varieties, with the potential to reduce them to known
results in algebraic geometry. The underlying algebraic geometry structures
beneath combinatorial objects can also lead to deeper understanding of the
combinatorial objects.

Matroid theory is a fundamental subject in combinatorial geometry. The first
goal of this project is to explore the algebraic geometric nature of the
numerical invariants of matroids that are realizable over some field. More
precisely, the project aims to express the numerical invariants in terms of the
(Ã©tale or singular) cohomology ring of some associated algebraic varieties,
obtaining new properties of the matroids. The more ambitious goal is to develop
combinatorial generalizations of theorems in algebraic geometry and to derive
properties for non-realizable matroids.
