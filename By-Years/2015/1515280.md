Robustness in synthetic genetic circuits is a central issue for the reliable
operation of engineered genetic devices. This project is anticipated to uncover
principles of genetic circuit design that can lead to the robust performance of
such engineered devices. The research will also advance our understanding of the
functional life span of synthetically engineered organisms in different
environments, and aid in devising active mechanisms to enhance or attenuate
robustness. The wider implication of this this research is that it can help to
provide a "safety net" that limits the survivability of engineered organisms
that escape or are released into the environment. The project provides training
opportunities through the development of laboratory courses that integrate bio-
engineering principles with concepts of robustness and bio-safety.

This project will develop design principles for enhancing the functional
robustness of engineered cells using genetic homology and gene network topology.
When introduced into host organisms, genetically engineered devices or synthetic
genetic networks will be subjected to continuous perturbations due to changes in
cellular processes and environmental factors, and the synthetic genetic
components themselves operate stochastically due to the random nature of the
underlying biochemical processes. Engineering robust genetic circuits under
mutation pressures (whereby mutated strains quickly outgrow the original
engineered strain) is one of the key challenges for synthetic biology. This
project will take a step toward designing robust synthetic circuits by applying
integrated mathematical, computational, and experimental approaches, where the
goal is to model such fitness changes to enable the design of controlled
functional robustness. The fitness landscape design concept will be tested in
synthetic circuits implemented in E. coli. This study will help the analysis and
prediction of the degree of robustness of synthetic genetic circuits, and help
to identify and correct mutation-prone genetic components and network
structures.
