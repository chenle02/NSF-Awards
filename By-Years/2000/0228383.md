This project will examine the meso-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling
processes which create traveling convection vortices (TCVs). TCVs were
originally thought to be the ionospheric signature of flux transfer events at
the magnetopause, but this has now been largely discounted. The project will
search for TCV events where conjugate satellite data can be used in conjunction
with the ground-based ionospheric observations. Data from several satellites
will be used including the FAST, DMSP, Oersted and CHAMPS satellites. Data from
the GEOTAIL satellite will also be for statistical information.
Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling will be done to determine the dynamical state
of the M-I system when TCVs are observed.
