This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project is to develop
Electrochemical Printing technology for the repair of integrated circuit (IC)
test probe cards. Electrochemical Printing (EcP) will be developed as a tool for
repairing and manufacturing small quantities of high value metal micro-
structures on probe cards. EcP is a maskless solid freeform fabrication
technique that electrodeposits dense metal micro-scale patterns beneath a
rastering microjet print nozzle.

The broader impact of this research is to provide an economical means of repair
for probe cards that are currently scrapped.
