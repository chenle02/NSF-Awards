The goal of this research is to determine how the antigen receptor repertoire
of the population of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) derived
from a previously immunized animal differs from that recognizing the same
antigen but obtained from an immunologically naive donor. The CTL response to
fluorescein-coupled cells will be used as a model system. A variety of
structural homologues of fluorescein can be coupled to the surfaces of
stimulator and target cells and used to define the fine specificity of the
responding CTLs. An extensive number of short term monoclonal fluorescein-
specific CTL populations will then be determined by analysis of the reactivity
patterns of each of the clones on the panel of fluorescein homologues as well as
variants of the stimulating major histocompatibility molecule. Simultaneously,
methodologies for the derivation of long term clones of primary and secondary
CTLs will be refined in order to ascertain the use of particular receptor gene
combinations in early and late CTL populations. One of the proposed techniques
for the generation of long term CTL clones which will be tested involves a
novel, and potentially extremely useful application of hybridoma technology, in
which DNA derived from a tumor cell is transfected directly into an activated
CTL. The overall goal of this research is to further understanding of the nature
of immunological memory. In particular, it asks the question: "How does the
population of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes derived from a previously
immunized animal differ from that recognizing the same antigen but obtained from
an immunologically naive animal?" Previous results from this laboratory have
shown that cytotoxic lymphocytes from previously immunized animals are capable
of recognizing cell surface attached antigen at a lower density than are
lymphocytes from non-immune animals. The current research is directed toward
determining the factor(s) controlling this difference. The results of this
research should increase our fundamental understanding of the mechanism of
immunological memory.
