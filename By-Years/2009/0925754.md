The objective of this research is to develop effective tools to help power
system operators and planners to address the challenges posed by the
intermittency effects that are becoming more pronounced due to the increasing
penetration of wind-based energy in the resource mix. The approach is to
develop, through detailed statistical analysis, probabilistic models of the
output of wind farms with different technology turbines located at various sites
in a power system. These models will be used to evaluate system operational
reliability and operational costs under different reserve policies for systems
with various levels of wind penetration. The investigation will determine the
robustness of the models as the penetration becomes deeper and will allow the
construction of trade-off surfaces between different levels of reliability and
operational costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed probabilistic models will be able to
represent the impacts of wind speed variability and their imperfect forecasts on
wind resource generation. The models will consider geographical correlation
between wind sites, demand/wind speed temporal correlations, cannibalization
effects among units in wind farms and smoothing effects resulting from the
integration of several wind farms into a power system.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
allow the realization of one of the main aspects of the smart grid vision ?o the
widespread deployment of renewable energy resources. The educational goals are
to develop a vision for reshaping the power and energy systems curricula to
provide appropriate training to the new generation of green energy engineers,
who will provide the leadership and expertise to make sustainable energy a
reality.
