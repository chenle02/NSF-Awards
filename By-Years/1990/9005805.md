This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Sciences Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences.
This equipment will be used to support five research projects in the Program in
Applied Mathematics of the University of Colorado, Boulder: aspects of
solutions, integrable systems, and computation, directed by Mark Ablowitz;
iterative methods for the solution of nonlinear equations, directed by James
Curry; discrete dynamical systems, directed by Robert Easton; dynamics of
Hamitonian mappings, directed by James Meiss; the Kadomtsev- Petviashvili
equation and water waves, directed by Harvey Segur.
