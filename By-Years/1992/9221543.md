to the NSFNET to the Veteran's Administration Medical Center and the LDS
Hospital which are affiliated with the University of Utah School of Medicine.
The connections to the two hospitals will be made via a 23 GHz microwave system.
The hub of the microwave network will be at the University of Utah Health
Sciences Center. High-speed data communication services will significantly
enhance the education and research activities of faculty and students from the
University of Utah that work at these affiliated hospitals. To provide high
speed access (10 megavits per second) to the NSFNET for researchers, clinical
instructors and students at affiliated teaching hospitals in order to: 1.
Provide access to resources and services on the NSFNET for faculty, staff and
