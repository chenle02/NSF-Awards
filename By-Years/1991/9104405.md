This is an international travel grant to support the Principal Investigator's
participation in the "International Symposium on Computer Methods in Structural
Masonry", April 3-5, 1991, in the United Kingdom. The PI has been invited to
present two technical papers on results of his research work on masonry with the
U.S. TCCMAR team. In addition, he has been appointed to be the U.S. member of
the Advisory Panel for the Symposium under the direction of Dr. J. Middleton,
Department of Civil Engineering, University College of Swansea, U.K. The
proposed participation in the Symposium and on the Advisory Panel will enable
Dr. Ewing to: (a) Present and disseminate technical information on the results
of masonry research in the U.S. developed by the TCCMAR Project supported by
NSF. (b) Join the Symposium's Advisory Panel in the development of research
goals and priorities in masonry structures. (c) Exchange research results on
international levels during the International Decade of Natural Hazards
Reduction (IDNHR). This effort will encourage the development of research
cooperation between the U.S. and European countries in the area of earthquake
resistant masonry design. In addition it will assist NSF in the dissemination of
TCCMAR research results in masonry design and construction.
