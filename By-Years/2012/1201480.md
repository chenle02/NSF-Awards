The Principal Investigator will study the arithmetic of integral models of
Shimura varieties, with particular emphasis on explicit Arakelov theory and the
relations between intersection multiplicities of special cycles and the
coefficients of Eisenstein series. The prototype of such a relation is the
Gross-Zagier theorem, whose proof proceeds by computing the arithmetic
intersection multiplicities of Heegner points on modular curves, and then
comparing these multiplicities with the Fourier coefficients of the kernel
function for the Rankin-Selberg convolution L-function. The PI will prove
similar relations for cycles on unitary and orthogonal Shimura varieties, and
use these relations to prove Gross-Zagier type theorems for modular forms of
higher weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shimura varieties are particular kinds of
higher-dimensional surfaces, and their rich geometry and arithmetic puts them
among the central objects of study in modern mathematics. They play an essential
role in the Langlands program, which is of increasing interest in theoretical
physics, and are essential tools for understanding elliptic curves and abelian
varieties, which have applications to cryptography. The Principal Investigator's
research into Shimura varieties is motivated partly by their connections to the
conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, one the the Clay Mathematics
Institute's million-dollar Millenium Prize Problems. The strongest known results
in the direction of this conjecture come from work of Gross and Zagier, whose
methods relied on the detailed study of one-dimensional Shimura varieties called
modular curves. The PI will study higher dimensional versions of these results
in order to better understand the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, and its
generalizations and variants.
