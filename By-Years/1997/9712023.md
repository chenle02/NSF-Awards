The improved bonding of polymer/ceramic composites is studied under this
project. The bond is achieved by porous walled polymer fibers releasing organic
polymer chemicals into an organic matrix. The idea is novel and especially
powerful because it offers an automatic way to perform repair of these bonds in
case of their degradation. The repair is performed by introduction of repair
chemicals via the existing porous walled polymer fibers. The project performs a
selection of chemicals that will provide both a desired chemical interaction and
an acceptable toxicity level. The delivery system for repair chemicals and its
control to reach the targeted debonding zone is also studied.
