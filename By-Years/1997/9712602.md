9712602 This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is funded to
initiate efforts to provide guidelines for assessing, controlling, and
monitoring ground movements and building damage that are direct and
uncomplicated, that will be accepted by contractors, designers, and
preservationists, and that will aid in the provision of improved, adequate, and
economic protection of structures. The research will develop model tests
involving four large tieback walls, which will be extensively instrumented and
monitored during testing by excavation. Models will be used also to investigate
scaling relationships and interaction between ground, retaining walls, and
surrounding structures, during and after excavation. Results of analyses will be
compared with data from previous and current field cases. These efforts will be
used to support the development and assessment of guidelines for controlling
damage. By capitalizing on their strong existing cooperative efforts with
industry, the principal investigators will formulate new criteria that will
result in safer, more realistic, and more economical control of ground
movements, while providing a higher level of protection for historic and urban
structures. ***
