Multi-pulse and plasma line capabilities will be established at the Millstone
Hill incoherent scatter radar facility in order to provide the sensitivity and
spatial resolution required by the CEDAR scientific objectives. Modifications to
the radar pulse generation, receiver, and processing hardware will be used to
support the Lower Thermosphere Coupling Study in 1987 and 1988. These
modifications will permit full utilization of the available radar power and duty
cycle capabilities. Postdoctoral and graduate student positions provide for the
analysis of the LTCS date.
