Manifolds with positive sectional curvature can be characterized by the property
that the sum of the three angles in any triangle is larger than 180 degrees,
i.e., their geometry is similar to that of the round sphere (the surface of a
ball). Global Riemannian geometry can be described as relating local invariants
like curvature to global invariants; manifolds with positive or more generally
non-negative curvature play an important role in this subject. Another major
theme in mathematics is that of symmetry. The principal investigator has made
many contributions by combining both concepts, classifying positively curved
manifolds with large symmetry groups and finding new examples, one of the most
difficult parts of the subject. The principal investigator also studies such
objects as submanifolds of Euclidean space, a classical subject since the
seminal work of Gauss.

This research project studies non-negative and positive curvature in several
contexts. The work aims to find new examples of manifolds with positive
curvature and to find obstructions to non-negative curvature by using concave
functions arising from Jacobi fields. A frequent theme is the geometry of group
actions whose orbits have small codimension, especially cohomogeneity one
actions. The PI studies submanifolds of Euclidean space with nonnegative
curvature and their rigidity properties. In recent years the Ricci flow has
found many important applications in geometry. The PI plans to study further
applications of such flows or possible modifications to the existence problem in
positive curvature. The PI also studies relationships of positive or non-
negative curvature with the concept of geometric formality and that of polar
actions. In another project the PI studies initial value problems and existence
of Einstein metrics on cohomogeneity one manifolds.
