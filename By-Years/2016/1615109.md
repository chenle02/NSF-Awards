The team will use the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to observe the
dense gas in nearby galaxies. The team has added a cutting-edge instrument,
Argus, to this NSF facility. This has paved the way for these important
observations at millimeter wavelengths. The team will study how galaxies form
stars in their dense gas. They will compare their observations to theoretical
models. Senior team members will train junior members recruited from
underrepresented groups. The team will feature the research in materials for the
Bay Area Science Festival in California and the Green Bank Visitors Center in
West Virginia. The team will also help others use Argus for their own research.

The team will use Argus on the GBT to map the dense molecular gas in nearby
galaxies at high spatial resolution. They will combine these new data with
existing data at other wavelengths to study (1) how the amount of star formation
per unit of dense gas depends on the local conditions in the galaxies, and (2)
how the amount of dense gas depends on the local conditions in the galaxies.
