The project develops a virtual prototyping facility for the design of mechanical
assemblies containing polymer composites. Design approaches are investigated for
lowering the cost of manufacturing, especially methods which replace mechanical
subassemblies by a unitary composite part. A suite of automated design tools is
developed for virtual prototyping of assemblies made of polymer composite
materials AND making these tools accessible on the Internet. Industrial
relevance is insured by direct participation of a midsized company specializing
in advanced polymer composites design and fabrication.
