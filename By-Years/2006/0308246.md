This proposal has many facets, most of which have to do with various theories of
gauged supergravity. The PI proposes to study supersymmetric versions of the
five dimensional Randall-Sundrum world brane scenario that has interesting
features and may bring in some new ideas about the stability of brane
configurations. The theories of gauged supergravities in five and six dimensions
have not been explored in the past. It has become clear over the last few years
that attempts of embedding world branes into supersymmetric theories are
incomplete since not all versions of five and six dimensional gauged
supergravities have been constructed. The PI proposes to study 5d supergravities
with tensor multiplets and to consider the consequences for supersymmetric
Randall-Sundrum brane world scenarios. Another aspect of the proposal is related
to developments with gauged supergravities in various dimensions, including nine
The PI proposes a new version of 9d gauged supergravity where it has been found
that domain walls exist. This theory will be explored in the context of brane
worlds as well as for cosmology. The PI proposes to study Noncommutative
Supersymmetric Gauge and Gravity theories in background anti symmetric fields.
The thrust will be to develop a consistent complex supergravity theory. The PI
also proposes to study teleparallel superspace formulations of supergravity
where there is the possibility of breakdown of local Lorentz symmetry.
