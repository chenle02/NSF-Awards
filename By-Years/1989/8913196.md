This project continues work initiated in an earlier effort dealing with the
phenomenon of vibration isolation in structures with parametric uncertainties
and irregularities, and focusing on generating fundamental insights into the
physical mechanisms of localization from the study of generic idealized models
of periodic structures. The current project looks at three issues which are (a)
the evaluation and prediction of the significance of localization effects in
engineering structures, (b) the development of concise statistical tools for the
analyst and designer confronted with uncertainties in structural dynamics
applications, and (3) the use of these novel techniques and insights to develop
a theory for vibration transmission in complex structures. An experimental
verification of localization effects will be performed on a multi-span beam. The
impact of the work is clear. Many large structures, i.e., truss beams,
turbomachinery rotors, submarine hulls, overhead power lines, etc., are
periodic. Their design and analysis is based on the assumption that the
periodicity is perfect. This not the case, and often periodic structures can be
highly sensitive to small irregularities in manufacturing tolerances. Neglecting
these variations may lead to erroneous results and serious consequences. This
research focuses on correcting this problem through development of new
techniques for vibrational analysis of large periodic structures.
