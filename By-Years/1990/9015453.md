PIs will continue research on the role of intrinsic factors in evolutionary
rates and modes of marine invertebrates, centering on the bivalves and shelled
gastropods in two reigons: the Neocene (including Recent) of the eastern Pacific
and the Late Cretaceous of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain. PIs will refine
databases on developmental modes and geographic and bathymetric ranges, add data
on body size and population densities, and collect more data on patterns of
extinction, survival and rebound for European mollusks around the Cretaceous-
Tertiary (K-T) boundary. PIs will test hypotheses on: separate and continued
effects of geographic range, developmental modes, body size, population density,
and preservation potential on evolutionary rates and patterns; relation of those
patterns to bathymety and latitude; evolutionary trends in body size and the
frequency of Cope's Rule (broadly vs narrowly defined); and similarity of
survivorship and rebound patterns at the K-T boundary in Europe and North
America, and their relation to the background patterns as listed above.
