This project is a ROW planning grant for an initial study of how American
households' participation in credit markets affects their decisions regarding
spending, saving, and working. The focus is on use of installment credit since
default on installment contracts result in wealth-reducing repossession of the
good being purchased. Household budget surveys from the interwar years (when
availability of installment credit became widespread) is analyzed to ascertain
the correlation between installment buying and household reliance on more than
one wage- earner or on non-wage income; occupational or industrial categories of
household workers; saving rate; and debt service to disposable income ratios. In
the Great Depression, consumption accounted for disproportionate shares of falls
in gross national product. Literary evidence asserts indebted households
severely reduced consumption spending to avoid defaulting on installment
contracts. This study provides now-lacking evidence on this assertion. Further,
the underlying model of household behavior indicates how recent federal tax law
changes encouraging home- equity over installment debt may affect labor force
participation and household spending decisions.
