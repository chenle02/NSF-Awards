Wave induced flow and sediment transport are dominant processes on the spatial
and temporal scales of benthic organism behavior, feeding and growth. The
responses of marine benthic organisms to waves have been investigated via
coupled field and laboratory observations and tests of "null-effect" hypotheses.
It has been determined that both sediment microorganisms and macrofaunal
consumers can respond to oscillatory flow and sediment transport on short time
scales. Using field and laboratory experimentation, the effects of oscillatory
flows on the feeding biology of intertidal and shelf invertebrates will be
studied. Many of the experimental tests will utilize a uniquely constructed
oscillatory water tunnel, which have future benefits in the study of the
adaptations of benthic animals to their physical environments.
