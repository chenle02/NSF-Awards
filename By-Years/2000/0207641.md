This investigation will address the question: Is the quiet solar chromosphere at
the top always hot (7000 K), with small temperature variations (5%), or mainly
cold (2000 K), with large temperature excursions (up to 25,000 K)? Two kinds of
current empirical models, one a set of time-independent models of the steady
emission, the other, a time-dependent simulation of the dynamics of the non-
magnetic chromosphere, come to fundamentally different conclusions. To gain a
resolution of this problem a two-pronged approach will be employed. On the one
hand, space observations are to be analyzed to determine the temperature and the
amplitude of oscillations in the actual solar chromosphere, and on the other,
numerical and analytic tools will be developed for a theoretical assessment of
chromospheric heating by magnetohydrodynamic waves.
