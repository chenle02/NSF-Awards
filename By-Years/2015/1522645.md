Recent advances of sensor and data collection techniques have led to "data
deluge" from wide applications in science and engineering. In order for data
scientists to make sense of this massive amount of data, it becomes increasingly
important to develop new tools in both theoretical and computational point of
views for data representation, analysis and mining. In practice, it is natural
to represent data as a collection of points sampled from a low dimensional
manifold in a high dimension space. In this scenario, intrinsic geometric
information extraction is a crucial step to conduct high level structure
understanding of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate geometry and
partial differential equation (PDE) based methods for analyzing point clouds
data in 3D and higher dimension. One objective is to develop and improve
numerical methods for solving PDEs on point clouds sampled from Riemannian
manifolds. Another one is to utilize solutions of specially designed geometric
PDEs on point clouds to conduct intrinsic and global understanding of data sets,
such as topological information extraction and point clouds intrinsic
comparisons. This investigation will lead to different viewpoints for tackling
problems in intrinsic data analysis. The research also contributes to related
areas in numerical methods for solving PDEs, computational differential geometry
and non-convex optimization. By collaborating with computer scientists and
biomedical engineers, applications to real problems will also be explored by the
PI.
