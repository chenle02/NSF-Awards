This collaborative proposal offers a multiyear build-up designed to increase the
number of graduates for Federal employment at Mississippi State and Jackson
State Universities. At MSU we will extend information assurance (IA) course
offerings outside the current Computer Science and Electrical and Computer
Engineering student base to other departments and students across campus. We
will initiate this scholarship program during the first year at MSU and extend
it to JSU, located approximately 120 miles from the MSU main campus, in the
second year. We will offer a joint security course of study electronically
between the two institutions during the second year of the program. The program
coordinator at JSU will participate in the MSU scholarship selection process
during year 1. During the succeeding years, those students enrolled in the
security course from JSU will also be entitled to scholarship consideration.
