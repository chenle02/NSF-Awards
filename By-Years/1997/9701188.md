SHULT 9701188 The principal investigator will investigate new infinite families
of geometries recently discovered. Also, the PI will study locally-generated
geometries generalizing some earlier results to characteristic two. This area
bears some relation to the classification of the finite simple groups. Finally,
the PI will look at point-line characterizations of classical geometries of
infinite rank. The field of group theory is the mathematical theory of symmetry
and interacts with many other disciplines, for example physics and chemistry
outside of mathematics, coding theory, number theory and geometry inside
mathematics. The investigator's particular area is finite groups and geometries.
It is an old subject but still facing great unsolved problems and with many
opportunities for breakthroughs.
