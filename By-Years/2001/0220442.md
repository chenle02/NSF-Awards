This project provides 14 undergraduate (upper classman) and 16 graduate
scholarships, focused enrichment activities and support-services to academically
talented but financially disadvantaged students including non-traditional
students and those from underrepresented groups. The scholarships promote full-
time enrollment and academic success in the Master of Science in Systems
Technology program and in upper-division computer science curricula. The project
encourages more students to pursue degrees in advanced technology needed for
national competitiveness in the global economy of the 21st century.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students' classroom and laboratory experiences are
enriched through advanced technology utilization, research training, and
interaction with industry partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student support
strategies build upon institutional resources as well as established industry
linkage to further Scholars' career success. At least half of the scholarships
assist students from underrepresented groups. Project components include:
recruitment; selection; financial assistance; student support services including
faculty and peer mentoring; and professional development, research and
internship opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;
