This award supports a three year project to determine the morphology of the base
of a surge-type glacier (Black Rapids Glacier, Alaska) using modern wireline
drilling and sampling techniques, along with related measurements of basal water
pressure, surface speed and other parameters. The project is an attempt to shed
light, by direct observation, on the most important unsolved problem in glacier
and ice sheet dynamics: the role of basal motion and how it is affected by the
basal morphology. The role of bed morphology in glacier surging is of particular
interest, because the restricted geographic occurrence of these glaciers may
reflect necessary basal conditions. The drilling and sampling program proposed
here should be able to recover continuous core of virtually any length, from the
base of the clean ice, through any basal ice, sediments or combination of
sediments and ice, and into the underlying bedrock. Although such sampling has
been accomplished before in connection with mineral exploration, it would be the
first scientific effort of its kind in a temperate glacier.
