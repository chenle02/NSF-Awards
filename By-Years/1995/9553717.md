CA 95825 Title: Theme Curriculum: An Integrated Curriculum Development Project
This is a planning project to pilot the use of macro, industry- based problems
to generate themes and sub-themes for the mathematics, science and engineering
technology courses in advanced technology education programs. The premise is
that this will not only make instruction take on a real-world character, but
also serve to show the interconnections of the various disciplines as well.
