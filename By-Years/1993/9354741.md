9354741 Anderson Progressive problem sets and innovative classroom exercises are
being developed which can be used in both the high school and college
precalculus classroom. These materials present concepts from various points of
view, emphasize writing, use technology where feasible, encourage the use of
collaborative learning, and stress the application of mathematics to other
disciplines. Guidelines presented in the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics Standards, current research in ways people best learn mathematics,
and compatibility with innovative calculus curricula are being used to evaluate
the problem sets as they are developed. The materials consist of homework and
in-class problems, as well as suggestions for their use, additional resources
for schools without technology, and complete solutions. The problem sets are
being pretested as they are developed; workshops for both high school and
college teachers, designed to demonstrate the materials and generate feedback,
are being held; and a year-long piloting project, involving one four-year
college, one community college, and nine high schools, is being conducted. ***y
