Many plant species, including numerous economically important ones, regularly
shed (abort) a large portion of their fruit crop. Recent study of fruit abortion
on the common and important forage crop, birdsfoot trefoil, shows that this
plant not only selectively aborts those fruits with the fewest seeds but, by
doing so, it improves the average quality of its seed (progeny). In another
study of common zucchini squash, the number of pollen grains placed onto the
stigmas of the flowers were varied. Again those fruits with the fewest seeds
were the most likely to abort. Moreover, the fruits with the most seeds produced
progeny that germinated more rapidly, were more vigorous as seedlings, and had
greater flower and fruit production as adults than did the fruits with fewer
seeds. Dr. Stephenson proposes to examine the hypothesis that these observed
differences in seed quality are due to genetic differences in the pollen grains
that fathered the seed. That is, when there are more pollen tubes than eggs,
only the best pollen fathers mature seed. In contrast, when there are fewer
pollen tubes than eggs, both the good and the mediocre pollen fathers mature
seed. Therefore, by aborting those fruits with the few seeds (produced when
there were fewer pollen tubes than eggs) the plants eliminate those progeny
fathered by the mediocre pollen while retaining the fruits fathered only by the
best pollen. These findings should not only far reaching implications for basic
evolutionary biology and ecology but will also have significance for applied
areas of plant science. For example, the ability to rapidly screen large numbers
of pollen grains for agriculturally desirable traits, using only limited space,
represents enormous potential gains for plant breeders. Such screening could
prove to be less expensive, more rapid, and easier to implement than many of the
other state-of-the-art techniques, such as recombinant DNA and tissue culture.
