The focus of this research is the development of catalysts for the asymmetric
phosphonylation of aldehydes to form alpha-hydroxyphosphonamides of high optical
purity. In addition, allylic hydroxyphosphonates will be prepared and the
methodology will be applied to the preparation of enzyme inhibitors. With this
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Christopher D. Spilling of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Missouri, St. Louis. Professor Spilling will focus his work on the development
of synthetic methodology for the preparation of alpha-hydroxyphosphonamides, a
class of compounds having important biological activity.
