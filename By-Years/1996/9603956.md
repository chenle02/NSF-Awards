9603956 Ortega The growth of fungal sporangiophores, large single cells that are
amenable to manipulation, is influenced by external factors, for example light
and temperature. These cells represent an ideal system to study single cell
development. Dr. Ortega is a biophysicist and has described the growth of these
cells by a set of parameters, resulting in a set of "augmented growth equations"
which were then studied by pressure probe measurements. The proposal
concentrates on the elucidation of mechanisms that control helical growth of
elongating sporangiophores. The work includes pressure probe measurements during
growth, and analysis of microfibril orientation and slippage of fibrils. The
work is strongly based on mathematical models and relies on experimental data
mainly to gauge the veracity of theoretical considerations. The value of the
work lies in the analysis of a simple model system that can provide a model for
the more complex cell wall growth characteristics of plant cells.
