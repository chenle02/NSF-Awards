This project addresses improving the procedures for modeling structures. Such
modeling is critical in the design of mechanical systems. Failure to use high
fidelity models in the design process will only compromise the reliability of
the final product. Techniques currently exist for determining the frequency
response function for single input/output systems. The technique for more
realistic multiple input/output systems is not yet developed. This activity
addresses that need. This is a four phase research study which develops for
multiple input/output systems a theory capable of generating accurate pole-zero
models for the dynamic response of structures. In addition to estimating the
system parameters, the method can quantify the error of each estimated
parameter. The theoretical methods developed will be tested for a structure
representative of the common problems associated with modal testing. Results of
this work will have application beyond structural modeling. They will also be
applicable to the technology of control of structural components and systems.
