Graceland College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line. The connection enables the school's faculty and students to
communicate and collaborate with the international scientific and educational
community, and to access network resources such as libraries, databases and
supercomputers. This award funds part of the costs for two years.
