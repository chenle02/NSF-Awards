This award will support collaborative research in physical oceanography between
Dr. Silvia Garzoli, Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University
and Dr. Alberto Piola of the Servicio de Hidrografia Naval in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. The objective of the project is to analyze data from an international
high resolution study of the confluence zones of the Brazil and Malvinas
currents. A large international effort by the US, France, and Argentina to study
the dynamics of the Southwestern Atlantic will be completed by early 1990. The
program consists of intensive field work based primarily on the deployment of a
large array of instruments (inverted echo sounders and current meter moorings)
for a period of 18 months, the collection of infrared satellite images for a
period of two years, and the realization of three hydrographic/nutrients
extensive surveys. The study will result in a jointly-collected, valuable and
extensive set of oceanographic data available for calibration, reduction and
analysis. This award will provide funds for Dr. Garzoli to visit Argentina for
the purpose of establishing standards for common data calibration and for a
computer data link between Argentina and Lamont-Doherty. This will facilitate
the joint data analysis and consequent joint scientific inter-pretation of the
whole system of circulation and thermohaline variability in the Southwestern
Atlantic.
