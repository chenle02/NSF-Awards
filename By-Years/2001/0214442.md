This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a novel, electrostatic based metrology solution that has the potential
of being developed into a rapid and quantitative test of interfacial adhesion
for the semiconductor industry. The portion of a semiconductor device that
carries logic signals between the transistors on a chip is commonly known as the
Back-End-of-the-Line (BEOL). The BEOL typically consists of, among other
components, current carrying metal lines surrounded by an insulating or low-
dielectric constant (low-k) material. To keep increasing chip performance at the
current pace, it will be necessary to replace the current dense insulators with
a porous low-k material. Interface adhesion between porous low-k and the various
other layers in the BEOL is known to be poor and extremely problematic during
integration. The semiconductor industry faces a significant barrier to further
progress, because a rapid and quantifiable test to assess interfacial adhesion
does not currently exist. The principle of the technique is to use a normal
tensile force created by an electrostatic field to delaminate thin films from
their underlying layers. This is a unique undertaking with regards to adhesion
testing and reflects a revolutionary shift in how adhesion tests will be
conducted if successful.

The economic benefit to the industry will be achieved by reducing the time to
market and improving yield. If interfacial adhesion can be monitored rapidly and
quantifiably, the effects of varying process parameters (deposition, etch, pre-
treatments) on film-adhesion can be quantified in a greatly shortened time
reducing the length of the process development and R&D phase. This would lead to
shorter times to market, increased productivity, and may increase market share
for early adopters of the technology in the US.
