DMS-9503652 Tartakoff/Lewis This award will continue to partially support the
Midwest Partial Differential Equations Seminar, a semiannual meeting on recent
developments in partial differential equations. The Seminar is hosted by several
midwest universities, and are of particular value to graduate students and young
post-doctorals. They have the opportunity to the meet research mathematicians
from other campuses and discover new facets of their field which are not
represented at their own institutions. Partial differential equations form a
basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical
analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative
and quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to
questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often
develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuraay of
these approximations.
