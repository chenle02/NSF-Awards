Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the C10 and C15 members of the isoprenoid
family of plant products. Selective techniques for extraction of glandular
trichomes and affinity chromatography methods allow purification of the enzymes
of terpene metabolism in high yield. This research tests a stereochemical model
for the coupled isomerization- cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to
symmetrical monoterpenes. Stereospecifically labeled precursors, selective
chemical degradation schemes and chromatographic resolution of enantiomers,
permit the cryptic stereochemistries of the reaction steps, and hydride-shift
patterns, to be deciphered. Four types of sesquiterpene cyclases are being used
to compare the mechanism, stereochemistry and enzymology of sesquiterpene
biosynthesis. Cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylases catalyze the first step in
the oxidative transformation of parent cyclic terpenoids; and several of these
highly specific mixed- function oxidases have been isolated. These microsomal
systems will be solubilized and separated into components, and reconstitution
experiments, kinetic analysis, and binding studies will be employed to establish
the basis for the extreme substrate selectivity observed. Potent, highly
selective inhibitors of the hydroxylases will be designed which, along with a
specific inhibitor of cyclization, will be used to manipulate terpene production
in vivo. %%% Many biological molecules and natural products are composed of a
basic five-carbon building block. Terpenes are the compounds made from this
building block that impart fragrances to many plants making them useful as
perfume, spices and attractants or repellants to insects. This research will
improve our understanding of terpene metabolism, aid in attempts to exploit
ecological interactions involving terpenoids, and assist in efforts to improve
production of these commercially valuable natural products.
