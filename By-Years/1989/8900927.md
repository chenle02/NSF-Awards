This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of bioinorganic chemistry. The project deals with the synthesis
and reaction chemistry of derivatives of vitamin B-12. Various derivatives of
this vitamin serve as coenzymes in the catalysis of about 15 enzymic reactions
in organisms ranging from bacteria to human beings. Details of two kinds of
recently discovered isomerism in organocobalt derivatives of vitamin B-12 will
be studied. The first involves formation of upper (beta) and lower (alpha)
alkylcobalt derivatives when cobinamides (vitamin B-12 derivatives lacking the
pendant axial ligand) are reductively alkylated with some, but not other
alkylating agents. The reason for the different outcomes with different
alkylating agents will be studied as well as the mechanism of formation of two
isomers and the conditions under which the isomers can be interconverted.
Preliminary results indicate that interconversion of such isomers may involve
novel dialkylcobinamide species. The second type of isomerism involves formation
of pairs of apparently isomeric alkylcobalt derivatives when aquocobalamin is
reductively alkylated with alkoxyethyl bromides. These cannot be alpha and beta
isomers, but are believed to be 2-alkoxyethyl and 1-alkoxyethyl cobalamins. The
structures will be determined by NMR spectroscopy of products synthesized with
isotopically enriched alkoxyethyl bromides, and the mechanism of formation of
such pairs of isomers will be studied. The conditions under which the isomers
are interconverted will be determined also.
