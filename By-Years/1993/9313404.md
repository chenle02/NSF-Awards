9313404 Moon One of the objectives of the project is to transfer knowledge
discovered in the fields of nonlinear dynamics and fractals to applications in
material removal processes. In particular, the activity will focus on the
physics of material cutting dynamics and the relation between observed chaotic
vibrations in machine tools and fractal properties of workpiece surfaces. Modern
experimental, computational, and analytical methods in dynamical systems and
fractals will be employed on particular machine tool systems such as lathe
cutting and milling. The principal aim of the experiments will be to establish a
correlation between cutting tool dynamics and surface quality, especially
between chaotic vibrations in the tool motions and fractal or random like
properties in the surface finish. Nonlinear models for cutting tool dynamics
will be investigated both analytically and computationally. These models will
incorporate both time delay or regenerative effects as well as material
nonlinearity forces in the cutting process. Of particular interest will be the
search for coexisting multiple dynamical attractors and their basins of
attraction. Experimentally, the goal is to measure the surface roughness both as
the material is being removed and in the post dynamics state. Chatter of machine
tools is a critical phenomenon that severely limits their productivity. If the
chatter process can be better understood, the suppression of unwanted vibration
will allow machine tools to take heavier cuts with good surface finish.
