With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology
will acquire an Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Spectrometer. Faculty from the
Departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Earth and Environmental Sciences will use
this ESR instrument to carry out their research, including adsorption studies on
carbon nanotubes; in situ heterogeneous catalysis investigations related to
lean-burn engines; the application of zeolites in ground-water remediation; and
the modification of the electronic properties of single walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNT) due to chemical introduction of defects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer is especially valuable as it provides
information on short-lived free radicals. Free radicals play a major role in the
initiation of tumor growth and are intermediates in many important chemical
reactions. These studies should have a strong impact in the environmental arena,
as they may lead to a reduction in automotive emissions and cleaner groundwater.
In addition, the ESR instrument will be used in a variety of undergraduate
laboratory courses in the Chemistry and Physics departments.&lt;br/&gt;
