This award supports participation of students and speakers at the 35th Annual
Workshop on Recent Developments in Electronic Structure Theory, which will be
held at the University of California, Merced in June 2023. This will be an in-
person meeting with approximately 150 participants including graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and senior researchers from colleges, universities, and
laboratories around the world. The workshop will facilitate the exchange of
ideas between junior and senior researchers in electronic structure theory and
serve as an opportunity for creating new collaborations. The workshop will focus
on the latest developments in electronic structure theory and computational
materials science. The simulation techniques covered by the workshop are used
across a variety of fields including physics, chemistry, and materials science,
both in academia and in industry.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
