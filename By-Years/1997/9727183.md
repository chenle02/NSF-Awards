9727183&lt;br/&gt;Abers&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research involves a
deployment of portable PASSCAL seismographs across the Alaska Range near Mount
McKinley to study the active tectonics and generation process of large mountains
at subduction zones. Two broad types of processes are usually proposed:
horizontal compression, which results in crustal thickening and support of
mountains by Moho deflections, and dynamic uplift mechanisms, which heat the
lithosphere or elevate it by subduction-induced flow. The PASSCAL seismic line
of stations follows a corridor that typifies mountain building over a subducting
slab with North America's highest topography directly over the 100 km depth
contour of the slab where arc volcanism might be expected. Analysis efforts will
focus on receiver functions, attenuation and travel time studies, and shear-wave
splitting. Results will be integrated with topography and gravity observations
of mass distributions, in order to examine whether these are sufficient to
isostatically balance topography. These balances will show for the first time
the forces that elevate topography here and generate earthquake activity. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
