It is now widely accepted that stress conditions lead to an increase in the
frequencies of mutation measured by selection. The question now raised by the
"Directed mutation" issue is the specificity of the changes induced by
particular stress regimes. To answer this question, it is necessary to
characterize all DNA changes regardless of whether they facilitate growth under
selective conditions. This can now be done by PCR technology. PCR makes it
possible to examine specific regions of the genome following stress and detect
novel DNA structures, even if they can not be selected by growth. Initial
results demonstrated that a specific class of DNA rearrangement mediated by the
Mu phage transposable element did not measurably occur under normal growth
conditions but were easily detectable at relatively high frequencies under
selective conditions. Use of PCR will now allow detection of the frequency and
time of occurance of such genetic rearrangements with and without the selective
techniques that are usually required for measuring mutation rates.
