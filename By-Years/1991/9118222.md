Recent numerical modeling of the Basin and Range extension process indicates
that the lower crust must have a low viscosity in order for the Moho to remain
flat, as required by seismic observation. Assuming this modeling is correct, the
Lake Bonneville uplift should be re-examined with the goal of searching for
earth models with low-viscosity lower crusts which satisfy the Lake Bonneville
relict shoreline data. Preliminary modeling using an approximation to the Lake
Bonneville load indicates that such models may successfully predict the Lake
Bonneville uplift. The PI will examine a range of plausible low-viscosity lower-
crustal earth models using a realistic model of Lake Bonneville and assuming
linear viscoelastic rheologies. He will undertake finite- element modeling to
incorporate such effects as power-law flow and an elastic-brittle upper crust.
The modeling is significant because it may revise previous estimates of the
upper-mantle viscosity beneath the Basin and Range, as well as indicate whether
the Lake Bonneville uplift is compatible with the fluid lower crust required by
other modeling.
