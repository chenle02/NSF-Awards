This project, acquiring and developing a 3D Imaging and Virtual Environment
System, aims at bridging the content gap that limits the use of 3D models
because of the difficulty of creating and obtaining 3 D content. The integrated
platform collects laser range data in conjunction with photometric stereotypes.
Motivations include:

-Enabling development of integrated digital imaging and visualization tools for
different areas, -Providing powerful tools for developing new approaches for
acquiring, processing, and visualizing 3D data, and -Sharing the facility to
expand the contributions.

The facility, used for a wide variety of research and teaching activities,
should enable improved methods and tools for 3D characterization and modeling in
several areas. Expectations include:

- A Versatile digital imaging and analysis system for rapid characterization of
3D field objects, including procedures for 3D shape capture, generating 3D
textures surfaces, stitching images, automated image interpretation and data
extraction, and -Virtual environment system particularly suited to visualizing,
manipulating, and processing digitally scanned 3D images.

Broader Impact: Societal impacts involve integration of education and research,
participation of minorities and women, enhancement of infrastructure, and rapid
and broad dissemination of results.
