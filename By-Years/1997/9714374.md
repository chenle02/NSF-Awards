The National Research Council (NRC) proposes to assess the problems that face
the Internet over the next decade, identifying factors and issues that must be
resolved in order to ensure that the Internet can continue to grow and evolve.
The project will address how the Internet relates to other network complexes
(particularly the telephone and video delivery infrastructures) on which it
builds and to which it interconnects. It will use that examination to consider
broader issues posed by interoperation of networks operated by different
providers, using similar and different technologies and providing similar and
different services. This integrated analyis can help to inform technical design,
development, deployment, operation, and management decisions relevant to the
evolving networks of networks. Leveraging expert input, an authoritative report
and web site will be produced.
