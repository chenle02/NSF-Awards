The project develops a next-generation manufacturing curriculum leading to
Associate Degrees in Robotic Welding, Laser Cutting, and Advanced Metal
Fabrication/Welding. This project addresses a shortage of skilled technicians in
those areas by developing a technology rich, two-year curriculum. The curriculum
meets Manufacturing Skills Standards Certification (MSSC) and National Institute
for Metalworking Skills (NIMS) standards. This project builds upon a one-year
technical diploma curriculum in Metal Fabrication/Welding, by expanding it into
a two-year associate degree and offering MSSC and NIMS certification modules. A
multi-state steering committee is assembled comprised of industry experts in
curriculum development and manufacturing technology, including representatives
from several ATE centers. Steering committee members identified cutting edge
technical, academic, and life skill competencies needed to prepare advanced
manufacturing technicians for a labor market that requires postsecondary
education with MSSC and NIMS certification. To gather this information, the
steering committee surveyed regional manufacturers whose work centers on
manufacturing robotic systems. The curriculum produced will be disseminated to
technical/community colleges nationwide to help effectively educate, train, and
certify students in robotically-based advanced manufacturing and welding
programs. The curriculum will be in a digital format allowing dissemination
through the Worldwide Curriculum Databank, FLATE, and NCME.
