The cultural anthropologist PI will study downward social mobility in two
cohorts of people who grew up in a suburban community of northern New Jersey.
The substantive focus is to interpret social mobility through the analysis of
cultural meanings of changing lifestyles. Distinct forms of American culture
will be analyzed by studying symbolic dialects which color the perceptions of
different cohorts in different ways. The methodology will be to conduct about
100 life-history interviews with cohorts which graduated from high school in
1970 and in 1980, and another 100 interviews with their parents. Long-time
residents of the community will also be interviewed, and census and other
archival materials will be consulted. This research is important because many
younger adults in the U.S. can not replicate the lifestyle that they grew up in,
due to the changing socio-economic conditions they face. Understanding how they
perceive their condition, and the cultural interpretations they make of it, is
important in dealing with these dramatic changes in our society.
