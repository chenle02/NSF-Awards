Modeling the Production of Quality The PIs propose to investigate the trade-offs
that may occur in the management of quality. Increasing the quality of a product
or service may have negative ramifications, such as increasing the delivery
time, for example. The PIs intend to develop quantitative models which will
examine these trade-offs and then run computational studies in order to test
these models. One goal of this research is to provide information and support
for managerial decision-making in the areas of implementation and execution of
quality management programs. The PIs hope to provide insights to both the
manufacturing and service industries.
