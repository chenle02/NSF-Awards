Trace Elements In The Overflow Waters Of The North Atlantic The investigators
will participate in the 1993 IOC sponsored baseline cruise in the North
Atlantic. This cruise will conduct a detailed sampling and trace element
characterization of the northern overflow waters at the various sills in the
area of the Denmark Strait and Iceland Scotland Ridge as well as their
downstream mixing products. This sampling opportunity will be used to extend the
investigations of AL and Be geochemistry to the source regions of the various
components of the North Atlantic Deep Water. In addition it is proposed to
commence a detailed study of the geochemistry of dissolved Fe in this region
using a new on- board measurement technique.
