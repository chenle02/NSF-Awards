Title: FULLY NONLINEAR ELLIPTIC AND PARABOLIC EQUATIONS IN DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY

Abstract:

Fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations arise from many problems in
differential geometry. In recent years these equations have attracted a lot of
attention and significant progresses have been made to understand these
equations and related geometric problems. In this project, the principal
investigator will continue his research in this direction. The problems to be
investigated in this project include isometric embeddings of metrics of
nonnegative curvature; questions about hypersurfaces of nonnegative constant
Gauss curvature with boundary in Euclidean space and more general Riemannian
manifolds, including existence, uniqueness and regularity; spacelike entire
graphs of constant Gauss curvature in Minkowski space; Minkowski type problems
of finding closed convex hypersurfaces of prescribed Weingarten curvatures;
regularity of solutions to degenerate Monge-Ampere equations in non-convex
domains; regularity of pluricomplex Green functions and existence of holomorphic
functions in Kahler manifolds; Hessian equations on Riemannian manifolds and
applications in geometric problems; hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space of
constant mean curvature (or Weingarten hypersurfaces) with prescribed asymptotic
boundary at infinity; and evolution of hypersurfaces by curvature functions.

Equations arising from most of these problems are highly nonlinear. These
equations also model various phenomena in sciences and engineering. Solving such
equations heavily depends on establishing apriori estimates up to second order
derivatives. For many of the proposed problems in this project, these estimates
alone are often not enough to lead to existence of solutions; there are other
obstructions from geometry and analysis. These all impose challenging questions.
Research on these problems may also develop methods of numerical approximations
to the solutions that are useful in engineering and science.
