ABSTRACT CTS-9633959 The proposed project is to investigate wetting and
dewetting of a flat surface by a thin liquid film. Three cases will be
investigated: (1) the advance of a falling thin film with countercurrent air
flow; (2) the dryout of revulets, and (3) the formation of dry spots on a heated
plate. Extensive experiments will be conducted to observe the wetting and
dewetting process for each of these cases using a digital imaging system. The
dryout front will be measured for different parameter ranges. The experimental
data will be combined with theoretical results to develop models for describing
the wetting and dewetting phenomena. The theoretical part of the project will
include both analytical and numerical studies. Instability analyses will be
performed for cases that are amenable to analytical treatment. Otherwise,
numerical computations will be carried out.
