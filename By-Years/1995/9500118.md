9500118 Abur The project will focus on the observability problem and a
systematic method of determining network observability in the presence of
current magnitude measurements will be developed. This method will facilitate
the safe use of current magnitude measurements in state estimators where network
observability is to be extended through current magnitude measurements. Several
implementations issues will be resolved to make the method computationally
efficient during online operation. The method will then be extended to the three
phase power systems where several branches are mutually coupled and the
equivalent circuit models are therefore non-planar. ***
