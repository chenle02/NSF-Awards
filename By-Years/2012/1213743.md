Professor Marcus Weck is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and
Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to study the formation of
multiple synthetic non-biological polymers, which fold into secondary
structures, into supramolecular block copolymers thereby creating materials with
well-defined 3D architectures. The research design is based on the synthesis of
a small library of telechelic polymers (building blocks) that contain
noncovalent recognition motifs at their chain ends. Each building block is
either helical, sheet-forming or a random coil. These building blocks will be
self-assembled into supramolecular main-chain block copolymers yielding a single
material containing multiple 3D architectural motifs. Systematic structure-
property relationship studies to elucidate parameters of polymer chain lengths,
block lengths, and recognition motif on the self-assembly behavior of the
polymer building blocks will be carried out.

The proposed study is a step towards the rational design of well-defined, 3D
polymeric architectures, which has been postulated as a key requirement for the
next generation of complex materials for a variety of industries including those
in the electro-optics, energy, nanoscience and the medical fields. This project
in polymer chemistry and nanoscience pairs cutting edge research with the
training of undergraduate and graduate students and extensive outreach
activities to enhance the understanding and teaching of polymer science to K-12
school children.
