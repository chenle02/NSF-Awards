This research project will test a series of hypotheses about female mate choice
among free.ranging provisioned rhesus macaques at Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico.
Specifically the researcher will look at female preferences for lower as opposed
to high ranking males. This will be the first project to look at female mate
preferences: earlier projects have centered on male choices. This project will
help eliminate the cultural biases that have led many primatologists to assume
that female mate choice only reinforces the selective effects of male.male
competition. It will make female primates active participants in the
reproductive process. An increase in our understanding of the range of adaptive
reproductive strategies in primates will help physical anthropologists construct
better models to explain primate and hominid evolution as well as increase our
knowledge of primate social behavior.
