The proposed project addresses the transition from theory to application of an
approach to H00-control design based on skew Toeplitz theory. The theory will be
used as a new means for investigating control problems for flexible systems. The
control problems to be considered are similar in spirit to those studied
previously for finite-dimensional systems. A significant difference is that the
Laplace Transforms of distributed system components, not finite-dimensional
approximations of them, will be used in the control design process. Recent
theoretical advances have been made to address control problems for distributed
systems subjected to perturbations. The proposer and her collaborators have
applied the theory to problems of controlling the vibrations of ideal, flexible
beams subjected to an uncertain feedback time-delay and other perturbations.
Their beam studies suggest that applying the theory to more sophisticated
control problems for flexible systems is feasible. It is proposed that flexible
systems be analyzed in the frequency domain, pertinent H00-control problems be
formulated and solved, and computer experimentation with optimal and sub-optimal
designs be conducted. This will also include the development of supporting
computational methods and software.
