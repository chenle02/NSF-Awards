"Genes to Ecosystems" is a Communicating Research to Public Audiences (CRPA)
proposal based upon the Dr. Thomas Whitham's NSF funded research (#0425908
"Frontiers in Integrative Biological Research (FBIR): Ecological Genomics and
Heritability: Consequences of Extended Phenotypes"). "Genes to Ecosystems" has
two main educational objectives: to introduce a wide sector of the public to new
ways of looking at ecosystems, and to show how science happens, with practical
outcomes that are meaningful to the public. The CRPA request will support the
production of a one-hour documentary film, podcasts, a stand-alone DVD, and
radio segments for "Earth Notes." These deliverables are targeted to informal
learners and public television viewers in the western United States. The
documentary will follow a research project begun in 1982 which demonstrates how
genetic variation within a foundation species--in this case cottonwood trees--
impacts community members ranging from microbes to mega-fauna. The concept of
genes-to-ecosystems has introduced new ways of understanding ecosystems which
have practical implications for conserving biodiversity, ecological restoration,
coping with climate change, and other public policy issues. The project will be
managed by the PI, Dr. Thomas Whitham, and co-PI, Daniel Boone, both at Northern
Arizona University.
