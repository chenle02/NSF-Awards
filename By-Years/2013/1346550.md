This research focuses on the work practices and digital infrastructure use of a
fast-growing, high-value population called here 'mobile knowledge professionals'
(MKPs). MKPs have specific, typically rare, expertise: they are researchers and
knowledge brokers across all industries who combine expertise, creativity and
digital resources to successfully accomplish their intellectually demanding
work. An MKP's professional success requires sophisticated social and technical
acumen to efficiently and accurately leverage digital and organizational
resources -- a skill set that is based on understanding the availability, uses
and potential of technological systems and their relationship to organizational,
temporal and spatial boundaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research stands to
advance the state of mobile knowledge work and cyberinfrastructure (CI), while
simultaneously enabling the development of novel data collection methods and
archival standards. More broadly, its findings will help organizations better
envision the MKP workforce of the future, assist designers in their quest to
build new knowledge infrastructures, and help scholars prototype and implement
nascent standards for sharing ethnographic data as a community resource.
