A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V
Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel owned and operated by
Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System. BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for
profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New
York, and geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the
ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but
specifically work in support of the BATS program. RV Atlantic Explorer had 157
days funded in 2015, all but 38 of which (76%) were for NSF. In 20165, the
vessel is scheduled to sail 160 days with 120 (75%) of them funded by NSF. With
this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the
acquisition of the following Shipboard Scientific Support
Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steering Control System Upgrade
$47,682&lt;br/&gt;Bow Thruster Control System Upgrade $98,880&lt;br/&gt;Ballast
Water Treatment System $162,588&lt;br/&gt;Marine Sanitation Device
$89,901&lt;br/&gt;Doppler Speed Log $64,922&lt;br/&gt;Electronic Chart Display
and Information System (ECDIS) $46,510&lt;br/&gt;
$510,483&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of
the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal
Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to
use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
