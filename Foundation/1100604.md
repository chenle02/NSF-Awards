Lange will explore several subjects that require solving problems in pure
computability theory, some that are purely model-theoretic, and some that are a
mix of the two. For example, Lange is studying the structure consisting of the
computably enumerable (c.e.) sets under inclusion, an object of intense study in
classical computability theory. The problems she plans to study focus on when a
given c.e. set is mapped by an automorphism of this structure to a set that
computes the halting problem. On the other hand, Lange is examining the
computational complexity of structures associated with real closed fields,
generalizations of the ordered field of the reals. Many of these questions
cannot be answered without first solving purely algebraic or model theoretic
problems.

The aim of computable structure theory, Lange's area of research, is to examine
mathematical structures from an algorithmic perspective. There are many problems
in mathematics for which there is no way to compute a solution. Knowing a
problem is not computably solvable, however, provides only limited information
about its algorithmic complexity. Given two problems, if one can compute a
solution to the first problem from a solution to the second, the second problem
is at least as computationally difficult as the first. Lange and others in the
field work to precisely calibrate the algorithmic difficulty of a mathematical
problem by finding its place in the standard computational framework that grew
out of Turing's work. A critical aspect of computable structure theory is
understanding the relationship between definability and computability.
Definability refers to the ability to describe aspects of a mathematical object
using a formal language. Thus, answering questions in computable structure
theory often furthers the understanding of the mathematical objects under
consideration.
