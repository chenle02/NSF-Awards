This project aims at defining a new area of dynamically-controlled, robot-
assisted biological design. A convergent research team consisting of experts in
microrobotics, machine learning, and synthetic biology will focus on developing
a radically new approach towards analyzing and replicating intricate cellular
patterning in mammalian tissues. Not only will this research result in new
biological rules, synthetic biology tools, and microrobotics that can be applied
in numerous disciplines, it will also create a new in vitro native-like liver
organoid for biological and medical research. The work will open the door for
research into the creation and repair of other synthetic human
organs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will generate
multiscale, multicellular patterns and synthesize 3D patterns with vasculature
to produce native-like organs. To enable mapping of pattern design problems to
optimization problems, the researchers will define novel machine learning
techniques to classify and quantify cellular patterns. To enable control of bio-
compatible robots that guide cell organization and differentiation processes,
they plan to develop novel technologies that leverage and far exceed current
microrobotics. This will enable insights into fundamental scientific questions
about cell differentiation and connections between spatial organization and
function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
