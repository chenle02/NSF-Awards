This project will investigate the fabrication of high-performance InSb detector
arrays by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on GaAs. this effort will first develop
two strained superlattices (SSL) in tandem for a near-perfect lattice match
between the InSb and GaAs, and then fabricate the p-n junction for the 3-5
micron spectral region. The superlattice buffer will serve to block misfit
dislocations from propagating into the InSb. The epitaxy of the n-type and
p-type epilayers will be made in tandem by in-situ doping to form the p-n
junction detectors.
