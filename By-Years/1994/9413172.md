9413172 Firing In this project, PIs will directly measure ocean velocity
structure along six WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP) sections as part of the
Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE), and begin data processing and initial scientific
analyses. Measurements will be made on sections designated as WOCE sections I2
(10degN), I7S (54degE), I5W/I4 (25degS and 30degS), I7N (Arabian Sea), I8N/I5E
(80degE and 30degS), I9N (95degE), and I8S/I9S (meridional sections SE of
Australia). A shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) will be used on
all sections, with full depth profiles of velocity structure made at selected
portions of these sections using a self- contained ADCP lowered with the CTD
(Conductivity/Temperature/ (Conductivity/Temperature/Depth)Depth) unit. In
addition to determining various aspects of the current structure, the data will
provide an additional constraint for inverse models.
