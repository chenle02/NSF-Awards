Teaching Physics with Technology is a modified Chautauqua type program which
will provide in-service preparation for 75 high school physics teachers in North
Carolina. The teachers will receive training in the use of educational
technology in physics teaching. This model is unique in that two two-day
workshops are separated by a six to seven month period. In the interim a one-
week summer workshop is held. The first two-day workshop provides an overview of
the use of educational technology in physics teaching. The summer workshop is
used to present several mini-lessons in several areas of modern and classical
physics, and to provide time for the teachers to develop teaching modules
employing educational technology. Teachers will work in teams with each team
producing one module. The final two-day workshop is used to revise and edit the
modules based on classroom experience with them.
