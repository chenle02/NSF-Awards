The objective of this research is to consider the solution of convex
optimization and variational inequality problems complicated by misspecified
parameters. A possibly naive sequential approach would first (i) estimate the
problem parameters accurately through learning; and then (ii) solve the
associated computational problem. Unfortunately, as the learning problems grow
in size and complexity, such a framework is hampered by the significant increase
in solution time to obtain accurate parameter estimates. Furthermore, any
parameter estimation error propagates to the computational problem, possibly
with devastating impact. Accordingly, on contrary to the na√Øve sequential
approach, this research will aim to develop gradient-based algorithms that can
simultaneously learn the misspecified parameter and solve the computational
problem corresponding to the correct parameter. More generally, these coupled
schemes will be shown to be capable of contending with problem intricacies such
as uncertainty and nonsmoothness. Importantly, this methodology will cope with
situations where the observations used in the learning problem may depend on the
computational process. The research will emphasize the development of global
convergence statements, iteration complexity results, regret bounds with
reference to offline algorithms, and trade-offs between exploration and
exploitation.

If successful, this research will find impact at several levels. At a
fundamental level, this research is expected to lead to new truly adaptive
algorithms that can both learn parameters and optimize the associated systems
simultaneously. The algorithms will make impact through addressing a wide range
of large-scale application problems that are complicated by misspecification,
including portfolio selection problems and distributed optimization of networked
systems. Finally, the educational component of this project will comprise of
undergraduate research projects and high school course modules.
