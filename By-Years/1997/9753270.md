This award from the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and
Education (POWRE) program for the research and educational activities of
Professor Cynthia McClure of Montana State University is supported by funds
provided by the National Institutes of Health through interagency transfer to
NSF. The research enabled by the POWRE award aims at a new synthetic methodology
for production of nitrogen heterocycles of biomedical significance. Professor
McClure, an established researcher in organophosphorus chemistry, will undertake
exploratory study of the oxa-di-pi-methane photochemical rearrangement of a
series of aza-bicyclic systems, with a view to using the reaction as a method
for constructing the ring system that is present in a number of pyrrolizidine
and indolizidine alkaloid structures. Many of these alkaloids exhibit potent
antibiotic and anti-tumor properties. The opportunity afforded through the POWRE
program will enhance Professor McClure's research and leadership potential and
her educational mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students.
