The goal of the project is to introduce computer- and video- based image
acquisition and processing into undergraduate laboratory and field exercises,
and especially to introduce a variety of quantitative image analysis methods
into those laboratories. The specific laboratory exercises affected include: (1)
protist competition and predator-prey interactions using software for cell
identification and counting; (2) identification of invertebrate nerve cells
during intracellular recording using simple imaging and object measurement
techniques; (3) testing of theories of growth and development using computer
morpho-metric techniques; and (4) quantification of organism distribution
patterns. Laboratory exercises are under development that focus on the use of
digital image processing in animal behavior studies.
