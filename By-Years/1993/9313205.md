9313205 Stampf This award provides funds for continued operation of the Protein
Data Bank PDB at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The PDB database contains
atomic coordinates for proteins, nucleic acids and macromolecular assemblies,
such as viruses, whose 3 dimensional structures have been determined through
x-ray crystallographic or nuclear magnetic resonance NMR techniques. The
database currently contains in excess of 2000 entries, and is expected to double
in size in the next 3 years. The PDB may be accessed directly through electronic
mail; copies of the database are also available at a nominal charge from the PDB
and from a number of secondary sources. This database is used by structural
biologists in academic institutions, government and private research
organizations, and industrial research laboratories. ***
