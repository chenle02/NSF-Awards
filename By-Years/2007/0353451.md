This unique and exciting proposal for a three-year study of secondary life
science teachers' "adaptive expertise" is well grounded in the literature and
will likely advance the field in understanding teacher cognition and its
connection to instructional practice. Through intensive study of teachers'
approaches to instructional problem-solving tasks across the in-service spectrum
from novice to experienced teachers, SRI will both characterize adaptive
expertise as well as develop a valid and reliable instrument to measure adaptive
expertise that may be broadly applicable in further research across the science
disciplines. This project is innovative in its approach to advance theory and
research methodology. The PIs clearly articulate the broader impacts on teacher
research as well as in workforce development and show an understanding of
emerging multidisciplinary subfields of the life sciences that will demand not
only teacher quality but also teachers to be adaptable to the changes in their
discipline.
