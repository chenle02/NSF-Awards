Phylogenetic relationships within insects, the most diverse class of organisms,
are a major unsolved systematic problem. Nucleotide sequence characters could be
a key part of the answer, but there have been only a few studies, based mostly
on the same gene. One model system is the enormous order Lepidoptera (150,000
species), subject of innumerable comparative research programs whose well-
studied basal relationships provide a strong test for the utility of new
molecules. Prior to this project, computer search, Southern hybridization, and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were used to identify five previously
untested nuclear genes which appear suitable for higher-level phylogenetics
(elongation factor-l (alpha), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, dopa
decarboxylase, elongation factor-2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase).
Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for all five genes, plus the nuclear
ribosomal RNA gene, and tested for successful genomic amplification in primitive
Lepidoptera and related panorpoid orders. Portions of the elongation factor-1
(alpha) and ribosomal genes have been sequenced directly from PCR products for 6
and 11 taxa, respectively. The resulting trees, under several analytical
methods, show concordance with morphology. Additional studies will complete
evaluation of potentially informative nuclear genes by sequencing larger
portions of elongation factor 1 (alpha), RNA polymerase II and the ribosomal
gene in 15 species that together represent relationships strongly supported by
morphology within basal Lepidoptera and closely related orders. Trees
constructed by independent analyses of each gene will be tested for concordance
with each other and with the morphological phylogeny. For genes showing strong
concordance, the analysis will then be extended to an additional 20 moth species
that sample, in duplicate, all major lower lepidopteran lineages, including
problematic relationships; sufficiently conservative genes will additionally be
used to initiate a broader study of relationships among panorpoid orders.
