Neural Dynamics of Variability and Robustness in a Motor Pattern Generator

A central goal of neuroscience research is to understand how the nervous system
reliably generates rhythmic motor behaviors, including breathing, locomotion,
biting and swallowing. These behaviors are important for survival, and must be
robust to noise and environmental uncertainty. Furthermore, animals need to
flexibly control these behaviors in order to pursue various goals or respond to
stimuli. This project will investigate the hypothesis that the robustness and
flexibility of motor control emerges in part due to intrinsic variability in the
neural and motor activity, along with modulation by noisy sensory inputs. This
investigation will utilize a combined experimental and mathematical approach,
using the marine mollusk Aplysia californica as a model system. Experiments will
involve the direct activation and inhibition of specific neurons in the isolated
buccal mass of Aplysia, in order to better determine the role of these neurons
in controlling motor behavior. These experiments will be accompanied by a
mathematical investigation into biologically-inspired dynamical structures that
could underlie variation, robustness, and flexibility in motor pattern
generation.

The impact of this research extends beyond neuroscience and into engineering
applications, specifically in regard to the development of robust, biologically-
inspired robots and prosthetic devices. In pursuing this research, the fellow
will receive training both in computational and mathematical modeling and
laboratory experiments involving Aplysia. In addition, the fellow will assist
with the development of novel inquiry-based curricula for undergraduate courses,
which will emphasize interdisciplinary applications of mathematics and will
incorporate the results of the fellow's research as examples.
