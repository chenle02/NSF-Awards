9410457 Adve The objective of this research is to develop and evaluate
techniques for reducing the impact of synchronization latency in shared-memory
multiprocessors. Recent trends indicate that future microprocessors will employ
aggressive techniques (e.g., multiple instruction issue, dynamic scheduling) to
exploit instruction-level parallelism. Current shared-memory multiprocessors,
however, usually require a processor to stall on synchronization reads until the
read completes, precluding the full exploitation of future uniprocessors. The
research studies two approaches for reducing the impact of synchronization
latency: (a) overlapping latency of explicit synchronizations, and (b) using
implicit synchronization (where possible) to eliminate synchronization latency.
The key components of the study will be: (1) a practical hardware technique
based on guarded instructions for overlapping acquire operations, (2)
alleviating implementation overheads incurred with implicit synchronization by
using a novel combination of explicit and implicit synchronization, (3)
determining information in the form of high-level annotations that programmers
can provide to enhance detection of instruction-level parallelism, and (4) a
quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of the above techniques using extensive
instruction-level simulations of real applications. This research is a necessary
step towards enabling wider acceptance of parallel machines because it will
enable machines to be more cost-effective by exploiting more fully the potential
of next-generation microprocessors, and will broaden the supported class of
applications by allowing the efficient execution of finer-grained applications.
