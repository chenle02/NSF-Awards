Dr. Cassandra L. Fraser, Chemistry Department, University of Virginia, is
supported by a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award from the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program. The utility of
halo-methyl derivatives of bipyridine or phenanthroline metal complexes will be
tested as living polymerization reagents for the preparation of metal core
macromolecules in the form of star, heteroarm star, and star block copolymers.
Research efforts include polymerization of oxazolines, styrenes and acrylates;
functionalization of macromolecules via nucleophilic termination agents; and
examination of block length and composition influence upon aggregation behavior.
In an associated educational effort, the second year of a two-year introductory
honors sequence and a graduate level transition metal course will be redesigned.
The central motif of the undergraduate course is an interdisciplinary approach
to science education while the graduate course utilizes an interactive seminar
format. Metal-containing macromolecules have a wide range of potential
applications that exploit the unique characteristics of the metal complex core.
Metal core macromolecules may serve as liquid crystals, supported catalysts and
optical or electrochemical sensors. Interdisciplinary and seminar approaches to
chemistry education will be introduced at the undergraduate and graduate levels,
respectively.
