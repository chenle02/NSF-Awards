Series-parallel graphs are a subclass of graphs that can be defined recursively.
The proposed research will find fast algorithms for finding the edge-
connectivity of a series-parallel graph and for maintaining this connectivity
information dynamically. The long-term goal is to modify the techniques used for
solving problems in series- parallel graphs so that they can be used to solve
the same problems in wider classes of graphs. This may yield algorithms that are
faster or simpler as well as ideas that can be applied to a variety of problems.
