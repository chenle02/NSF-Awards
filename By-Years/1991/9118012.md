The Kigluaik Mountains in Alaska contain a granulite facies (high-temperature)
metamorphic overprint on relatively cool, high pressure, epidote-blueschist
rocks. Two competing hypotheses for this juxtaposition are (1) that it
represents an extensional metamorphic core complex with a pronounced structural
break between the different grade rocks, and (2) that the high temperature meta-
morphism formed in response to thermal re-equilibration of thickened crust with
no structural break. This study will directly test the second hypothesis by an
integrated program of field work, petrology and geochronology. It will also
evaluate heat transport mechanisms for the high grade rocks. The results will
provide important constraints on the thermal history of deep seated parts of
orogens immediately post-collision, and will thus have wide tectonic
significance.
