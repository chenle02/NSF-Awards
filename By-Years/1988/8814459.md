This award will support collaborative research between U.S. and British computer
scientists in the area of the formal specification of software systems. The U.S.
investigator is Dr. Stephen Fickas; the British researchers involved are Dr.
Alan Bundy, Department of Artificial Intelligence, University of Edinburgh, and
Dr. Anthony Finkelstein, Computer Science Department, Imperial College of
Science and Technology, London. The construction of a complete and consistent
software specification is critical to modern software engineering methodologies.
At the same time, a characterization of the construction process itself remains
an open research question. In essence, formal specifications to drive our
implementation systems are needed, but the means of constructing such
specifications in any disciplined manner are still lacking. The principal
investigator proposes to collaborate with two U.K. research groups, one at the
University of Edinburgh and one at Imperial College, London, in an effort to
both formalize and automate a model of specification design. Up until this time,
each of the three groups has focused on a different aspect of the specification
problem: Edinburgh has focused on mapping from informal descriptions to formal
specifications. Imperial College has focused on identifying necessary
specification activities, and tracking the dependencies among them; the
principal investigator has focused on knowledge-based approaches to
specification analysis. Dr. Fickas, in cooperation with the two U.K. groups,
will lead an effort to integrate the three approaches into a more general model
of specification construction. The results will be twofold. First, the
integration attempt itself will force each of other three current models to
become more refined. Second, Dr. Fickas plans to incorporate parts of the
Edinburgh and Imperial models into his existing computer-based system, thus
providing further extensions to an automated tool for specification
construction.
