The inter- and multi-disciplinary Center for Systems Science Research (CSSR) at
Tennessee State University has as its primary objective to establish a permanent
research base which produces quality, publishable research, enhances the
participation and substantially involves minority students and faculty in all
Center components, and through a regional resource center, strengthens science
and engineering awareness at HBCU's in Tennessee and Kentucky. The CSSR is broad
in scope and contains four engineering/science components which seek to apply
various forms of mathematical models to understand the behavior of complex
physical systems. These components will investigate: (1) a new approach to
optimal and robust control, (2) the modeling of complex astrophysical systems,
(3) the behavior of large- scale dynamic systems under stochastic structural
perturbations, and (4) the modeling of multiphase complex flows. The first
component intends to develop a practical design-oriented approach to system
control wherein low order and fixed structure controllers can be designed to
incorporate modern ideas of robustness and optimality. Extensively utilizing the
capabilities of the TSU automated observatory, the astrophysics component will
model the luminosity changes of Sun-like stars with magnetic activity, search
for extra-solar planets, refine the model of evolution of cool stars, model the
surface structure of stars, and investigate a wide range of stellar eruptions.
The third research component will expand studies of linear and nonlinear systems
of integro-differential and partial differential equations under the influence
of both internal and environmental randomly varying perturbations and will
formulate, develop, and analyze both probabilistic, analytic, and numerical
methods for the study of such systems. The fourth engineering components aims at
modeling multiphase complex flows with phase changes and specifically focuses on
three-dimensional convective sol idification and melting of dispersed or packed
solid particles.
