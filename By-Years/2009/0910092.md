Humans are extremely noisy and sounds that we produce are different in pitch and
often much louder than sounds heard in most natural settings. Conservationists
have worried that the new acoustic background dominated by human-generated noise
may negatively affect many birds, namely because they rely heavily on vocal
communication and noise may mask or drown-out their songs and calls, rendering
them functionally silent. This may be especially problematic because acoustic
characteristics of bird vocalizations are constrained by a species? evolutionary
history and body size to specific frequency ranges and amplitude limits. In
other words, species have acoustic niches and may unable to adjust vocalizations
to effectively communicate in our noisy world. Recently, however, a few birds
have been shown to have some flexibility in their acoustic niche and adjust
their vocalizations to overcome the masking effects of noise. In this project,
the investigators aim to 1) determine whether acoustic niche flexibility is
common or rare within an avian community and 2) evaluate whether a species?
ability to occupy noisy habitat is dependent on acoustic niche flexibility. To
achieve these objectives the investigators will focus their research on ten
species known to vary markedly in their tolerance to noise: four species that
avoid noisy habitat, two species that prefer noisy habitat, and four species
that appear uninfluenced by noise. For each species, the investigators will
record and measure vocalization characteristics from many individuals singing or
calling throughout a noisy intensity gradient. Because the project is a
community-wide approach, results will enhance the limited understanding of the
universality of acoustic niche flexible among bird species. This is especially
important in terms of avian conservation in and around human-altered landscapes
because it will provide needed insight as to why many species abandon noisy
areas and why a handful may flourish.
