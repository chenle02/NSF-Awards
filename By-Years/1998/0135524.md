Stixrude&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0135524&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elasticity measurements on
minerals are the bridge between the observed seismic velocity structure of the
Earth and properties of the Earth at depth, such as chemical composition and
temperature. The mineral physics community is poised to undertake a new
generation of experiments, which will allow us to accurately determine the
properties of deep-Earth materials under a new regime of pressure and
temperature (P-T) conditions. We will undertake a coordinated, multi-
institutional effort to develop advanced experimental and theoretical techniques
for determining sound velocities and elastic moduli on Earth materials. We will
build on the current technology that utilizes light scattering and ultrasonic
methods and exploit the full use of synchrotron radiation facilities for
simultaneous characterization. We will pursue new methodologies utilizing
inelastic x-ray scattering or gigahertz ultrasonics to expand the current
capabilities. We will closely integrate theoretical approaches with the
experimental to ground-truth both. Using multiple techniques, including
theoretical calculations, we will focus our efforts on determining the elastic
properties of olivine and its high-pressure polymorphs under high P-T
conditions, and standard materials for high P-T calibrations (e.g., Pt, Au, MgO,
NACI). Samples will be synthesized at a central community facility. The accuracy
of each technique will be improved through inter-laboratory cross-checks and
comparison with theory. This collaborative approach will greatly advance the
technology of high pressure geophysics, and focus a community effort on accurate
determination of the elastic properties of the most important mantle phases.
These results will, in turn, be used to clarify our view of mantle composition
and thermal structure.&lt;br/&gt;
