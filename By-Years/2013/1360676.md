This grant supports the Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference at the
University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia from March 13 to March 15, 2014.
The Spring Topology Conference is one of the largest and most successful annual
topology conferences in the United States. The conference generally attracts
150-200 participants from the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and,
increasingly, from Europe, Asia, and even New Zealand. The conference allows
participants to interact with a large number of active topologists, both within
and outside their specialties. The conference has expanded to encompass most of
the major branches of topology, as well as dynamical systems, and now includes
sessions in set theoretic/general topology, continuum theory, dynamical systems,
geometric topology, and geometric group theory. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
grant will support travel for the 18 plenary/semi-plenary speakers and for
graduate students and younger researchers who lack institutional support for
travel. Participants in the sessions come from a broad range of institutions
from small liberal arts colleges to research universities, and range from
graduate students to senior researchers. Most participants do not have
colleagues in their home departments with research interests close to their own.
They rely on this conference to keep up with recent work in topology and
dynamical systems, meet with colleagues who do have research interests close to
their own, and present what they themselves have been able to contribute. For
