The long term goal of this research is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
that regulate fruit abscission in higher plants. It has been documented that
cellulase (beta, 1:4 glucan glucanhydrolase) increases in the abscission zone of
Phaseolus vulgaris during leaf fracture. It is also known that this increase in
cellulase activity can be accelerated by the addition of exogenous ethylene. A
cDNA clone, complementary to bean cellulase mRNA has been recently isolated and
messenger RNA complementary to it has been shown to increase dramatically in the
abscission zone several hours after ethylene treatment of bean. The kinetics
suggest that other cellular events precede cellulase appearance in signalling
abscission. One approach to identifying the mechanism through which ethylene
promotes fruit abscission is to examine those genes which respond rapidly to
externally applied ethylene. Dr. Klein proposes here to isolate and characterize
ethylene responsive genes that are rapidly induced in the abscission zone and
examine their expression during fruit abscission in tomato.
