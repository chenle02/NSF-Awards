The focus of this research is in the development of practical applications for
novel DNA-cleaving agents, the development of new polymeric materials, and for
their organic synthesis. This research provides a theoretical basis for the
efficient control of known and design of new cycloaromatization reactions
(Bergman cyclizations) proceeding through thermal, photochemical and radical-
anionic pathways. The mechanisms of these reactions will be studied
experimentally to obtain a better understanding of factors controlling their
efficiency, and the findings will be applied to synthesis of substituted
triquinanes and new types of well-defined highly-conjugated carbon
"ribbons".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
efforts of Dr. Igor Alabugin of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
the Florida State University, Tallahassee. Professor Alabugin will focus his
research on the development of new ways to cleave DNA. This research will
contribute to the fundamental understanding of the principles governing the
closure of carbon rings using reactive intermediates. Chemistry students at the
graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral level will be trained in Professor
Alabugin's laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
