This award will support the attendance of students and recent doctorate to
Chapman Conference on Climate, Volcanism, and Global Change. Chapman Conferences
are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and are
designed to promote opportunities not normally available through the format of
larger meetings. The funds will be used to cover travel related expenses,
thereby assuring participation by a young audience. The conference will be held
on the campus of the University of Hawaii at Hilo, March 23-27, 1992.
