Professor Irving R. Epstein and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Brandeis Uniersity are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects range from studies of long-range order in
proteins and surfactants to the chemistry of interstellar space. Students will
be required to present both oral and written reports on their research.
Extensive follow-up plans will encourage and monitor the participants' interests
in a career of research and teaching in the chemical sciences.
