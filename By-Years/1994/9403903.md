9403903 Donald This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,
investigates computational aspects of engineering design problems that are
amenable to tractable algorithmic solution. In particular, the focus is on
determining the shape of microelectromechanical (MEM) structures, given
specifications of their parameterized geometry and their functionality
(parametric design). MEM structures are particularly suited for automated
parametric design because of (i) their highly specialized and automated
production process, which allows only a very limited number of elementary
structures; (ii) the rather simple geometry and functionality of the devices;
and (iii) the possibly large number of devices produced simultaneously in one
manufacturing process. In this exploratory research, actuator arrays for micro-
manipulation will be built based on single-crystal torsional oscillators.
Optimization in design and fabrication will be investigated, with the goal of
determining if the generated forces can be sufficient, for example, to move a
piece of paper. The research will develop models for the mechanics and a theory
of manipulation, and efficient algorithms will be described for evaluation.
