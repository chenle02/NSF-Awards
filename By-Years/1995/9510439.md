9510439 Plano This is a proposal from two members of the faculty in the physics
department at Rutgers to continue their research in the analysis of polarized Z
decays using the SLD detector and the linear electron collider at SLAC. The
accelerator has achieved a 80% polarization of the electron beam and the stated
plan is to collect 500,000 Z decays over the next several years. This will allow
the SLD group to make what is expected to be the world's most accurate
measurement of the Weinberg Angle by a technique which is different from that at
LEP. The difference between the measurements at the two accelerators will be an
important measure of the radiative corrections in the standard model. The
polarization of the Z will also allow them to make significant measurements of
Bs mixing. The group has joined the BABAR collaboration to study CP violation at
SLAC following at SLAC following the conclusion of the SLD program. ***
