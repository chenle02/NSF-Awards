This award supports acquisition of a dilution refrigerator, dedicated to
research in physics and engineering on the topics of quantum transport, point
contacts, Coulomb blockade, millimeter wave radio-astronomy receivers and x-ray
detectors. These programs are included in the Yale Center for Microelectronic
Materials and Structures, which would house the dilution refrigerator.
