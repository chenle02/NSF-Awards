ABSTRACT, NICHOLS 97-05132 Professor Nichols plans to continue to study
fundamental questions about Hopf algebras. He will develop and bring to bear
techniques of symbolic computation to attack some of these questions. Several of
the specific questions about Hopf algebras that Professor Nichols plans to
investigate are related by their connection with Yetter-Drinfel'd modules. With
the goal of proving Kaplansky's conjecture that the degree of an absolutely
irreducible representation of a semisimple Hopf algebra divides the dimension of
the Hopf algebra, Professor Nichols, in joint work with Bettina Richmond, has
been studying the Grothendieck algebra of a Hopf algebra. Information about how
certain Yetter-Drinfel'd modules multiply should help resolve a conjecture which
is a key part of that program. A quite different investigation involves
computations of bialgebras which are completely determined by Yetter-Drinfel'd
modules of finite groups. Even when the groups are small, these can be extremely
complicated. The algebra/coalgebra interaction in Yetter-Drinfel'd modules is
considerably easier to understand than is the corresponding interaction in the
Hopf algebra itself, yet it is rich enough to shed a great deal of light on the
Hopf algebra structure. Its elucidation in this situation should be quite
instructive. Hopf algebras and symbolic computation are both areas of growing
interest, areas which cross fields in mathematics, and areas which are very
important outside mathematics as well. Hopf algebras are useful in the type of
knot theory that is of interest to molecular chemists. Certain types of Hopf
algebras are now referred to as "quantum groups", in recognition of their
applications in physics. Symbolic computation is part of a key technology,
namely, scientific and engineering computation, that is becoming increasingly
important to science, technology, and society. It is leading to dramatic changes
in the theory and practice of mathematics. There are good reasons to expect a
synergistic relationship between investigations in Hopf algebras and symbolic
computation. Hopf algebra arguments often involve complicated symbolic
calculations which are quite similar to ones which (in the commutative case) can
now be done very effectively by machine. In the other direction, Hopf algebra
ideas help to explain and organize computations. Hopf algebras provide a
challenging setting in which to develop computational methods, but the very
structure that causes the scarcity of simplifying relations helps to keep track
of the ones that exist. It is expected that the insights gained in exploiting
this Hopf structure will contribute to the wider goal of advancing symbolic
computation.
