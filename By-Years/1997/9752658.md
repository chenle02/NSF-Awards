The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) is developing and disseminating an
electronic collection of peer-reviewed teaching and learning resources for
biology education specifically centered on the microbial world. The primary
purpose of the electronic collection is to establish a national center of
microbiological resources for teaching and learning. This electronic collection
of peer-reviewed educational resources for the undergraduate teaching community
is analogous to an electronic journal of peer-reviewed science articles for the
research community. The collection has two, unique features: 1) All items
included in the collection are correlated to key microbial concepts and basic
laboratory skills for undergraduate education; and 2) All items are peer-
reviewed and selected for scientific accuracy, educational quality and visual
presentation. Entries range from the basic sciences to engineering,
environmental sciences, medicine and public health, public policy, and business.
Curriculum development teams connect the national collection of microbial
resources to the World Wide Web (WWW) and correlate these resources to key
microbial concepts and basic laboratory skills. The development teams identify
the resources and link the tremendous collection of educational resources to key
microbial concepts and basic laboratory skills. The collection is updated and
augmented regularly. It can be transported easily into a variety of learning
environments both nationally and internationally. The collection is a model for
other national organizations in science, mathematics, engineering and technology
and contains specific information related to the preparation of teachers well
prepared to introduce microbial concepts into their classes.
