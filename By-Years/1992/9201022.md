Professor Tong will work on several problems connected with generalized
Riemann-Roch Theorems. He will study generalizations of the trace algebra of
Beilinson and Schectman in higher dimensions. The hope is to get a natural
connection on determinant bundles to give Grothendieck Riemann Roch formulas on
the level of forms. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
