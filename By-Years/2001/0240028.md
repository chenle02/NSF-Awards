ABSTRACT

The project will support a workshop, held by the American Mathematical Society,
in partnership with a number of colleges and universities, professional
organizations, and individual experts, on the mentoring and nurturing of
students in mathematics. The goal is to build awareness in the mathematics
community that programs with the identified characteristics can enhance student
academic experiences, improving student performance as well as aiding in
attracting and retaining students.

The workshop agenda is to identify and showcase effective mentoring methods to
improve attraction and retention of underrepresented minorities in mathematics,
utilizing expertise form institutions that have demonstrated successful
mentoring and nurturing. The workshop will include programs directed toward
undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students.

By identifying successful practices and disseminating these findings by way of
the AMS website and other professional society communications, and through
participating institutions, the PI anticipates that mathematics departments will
be motivated to initiate programs with mentoring components, which is expected
to improve departmental environment.
