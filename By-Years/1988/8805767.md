The PI proposes to continue and extend his basic research effort in nonlinear
control. His aim is to improve the analysis, the understanding and the design of
nonlinear deterministic control systems; more precisely, develop a sound
theoretical base for design techniques and to obtain whenever possible bounds on
achievable performance. The tools are mainly mathematical including computer
simulation, but the goal is engineering design.
