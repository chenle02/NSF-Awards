Pyruvate and phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP) are two central intermediates in
cellular metabolism. They are the branch points of many catabolic and
biosynthetic pathways. Although the importance of these intermediates has long
been recognized, the use of both genetic and engineering techniques for studying
the physiological effect of redirected pyruvate and PEP metabolism has not been
reported. Pyruvate is not normally recycled back to PEP under glycolytic
conditions. Because of this irreversibility, the yields of many specialty
chemicals produced from glucose via bacterial fermentations remain low. The
Principal Investigator proposes to construct and characterize strains of the
bacteria E. coli which can recycle pyruvate back to PEP. In addition to
improving the yields of amino acid fermentations, the results of this project
could contribute to the understanding of how the cell distributes its carbon
source, and how to decouple product formation from cell growth.
