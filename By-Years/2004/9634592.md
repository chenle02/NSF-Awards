9634592 Adams The objective of this conference is to provide a forum to explore
the biology, ecology, and biotechnology of thermophilic microorganisms. The
topics to be covered at this conference include: (1) the isolation and ecology
of thermophiles, (2) their phylogeny and molecular analysis, (3) the properties
of enzymes and proteins obtained from them, (4) how biological molecules are
stabilized at extreme temperatures, (5) the genetics and genome sequences of
some of them, and (6) Their use in present and future biotechnology
applications. This conference will have an attendance of at least 300 scientists
and industrialists from around the world. ***
