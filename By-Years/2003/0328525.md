Beverly Clayton from The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center(PSC), along with
collaborators of NSF's Education, Outreach, and Training Partnership for
Advanced Computational Infrastructure (EOT-PACI) are funded by a grant from the
ACIR Program in the CISE Directorate to provide the teachers of the City of
Pittsburgh Schools a professional development program entitled TeacherTECH.
Using successful strategies and materials developed in previous presentations of
this program, the trainers will equip the teacher participants with knowledge
and techniques to help them increase student's involvement in computational
activities. The program will focus on the effective use of software applications
that are currently available in the City of Pittsburgh Schools to creatively
support the standard curriculum in science and mathematics. In addition, the
program will contain elements of outreach and awareness intended to promote the
participation of underserved populations in science and engineering. The program
consists of a five-day, intensive, hands-on workshop designed to increase
teacher's knowledge of computer programs that are in use in the City of
Pittsburgh Schools and encourage more effective use of these programs. During
the school year, follow-up activities will be held that will give teachers an
opportunity to share gender equity issues, technology knowledge and the
techniques that they have developed with colleagues who were not participants in
the summer session. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
