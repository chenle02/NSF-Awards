9732453&lt;br/&gt;Beck&lt;br/&gt;This project is a study of the photon
statistics of pulsed vertical-cavity, surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). Low-
noise, high-efficiency detection will be used to characterize the noise behavior
of pulsed VCSLELs in detail. The measurements will lead to improved
understanding of the physics of microcavity lasers as well as be of benefit to
the lightwave communications industry.&lt;br/&gt;
