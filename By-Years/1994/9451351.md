9451351 Rothman This project will give undergraduate students in the field of
communicative disorders an opportunity for hands-on experience with the most
modern scientific equipment used in the investigation of normal and disordered
speech production. The acquisition of the following equipment allows the project
to achieve this goal: the Computerized Speech Lab allows analysis of the complex
acoustic information in speech, clarifying the speech production and perception
theories presented in lectures. The existing equipment of linearized
magnetometers provide the students with information concerning the coordinated
movements of the respiratory system. The pneumotachograph setup allows
measurements of airflow patterns within the vocal tract, yielding valuable
information about the activity of the vocal folds during voicing. All of these
instruments will be used for instructor demonstrations and student experiments
during laboratory course sections accompanying each of the undergraduate speech
science lecture sections offered in the department. By bringing students into a
scientific environment where they become active participants, this project opens
the door to a greater appreciation for the role of science in the service of
individuals with communicative disorders.
