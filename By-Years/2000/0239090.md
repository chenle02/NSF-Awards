This proposal outlines a set of research and educational endeavors as part of
the PI's career development plan to establish a Pattern Recognition and Machine
Learning Laboratory at Rowan University. The research will address the problem
of incremental learning of new in-formation without losing previously acquired
knowledge, using an ensemble of classifiers approach. It will also addresses
related issues that can benefit from an ensemble approach, such as estimating
classification confidence and learning in non-stationary
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be tightly integrated into
a variety of traditional and nontraditional educational activities. Traditional
activities include developing undergraduate and graduate courses, laboratory
exercises and seminars, while nontraditional activities include forming
integrated research and learning communities (IRLCs) to introduce research based
education to undergraduate curriculum. These communities will consist of
students of all classifications, freshman through graduate (vertical
integration) with a conscious effort of integrating diverse gender, ethnic, and
racial backgrounds (horizontal integration). Communities will be working on
different aspects of the project, with individual members responsible of tasks
that are commensurate with their intellectual and academic skills. These
activities will develop research, analytical thinking, problem solving, team
building and communication skills of the community members, while providing
maximum multidisciplinary research exposure to both undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
