This Cooperative Agreement provides support for the formation of a Scientific
Management Office (SMO) for the National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL), a facility
in Denver, Colorado which is jointly managed and operated by the National
Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and
which provides a state-of-the-art, safe and controlled environment to preserve
ice cores and an ice core processing area for investigators to conduct research
. The Scientific Management Office (SMO) will be housed in the Climate Change
Research Center (CCRC) of the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space
(EOS) at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). The Scientific Management Office
for NICL (NICL SMO) will serve as a direct point of contact for principal
investigators interested in access to ice cores. It will also facilitate the
formulation of a new Ice Core Working Group (ICWG) that will represent ice core
researchers and those in related disciplines whose research utilizes or applies
to ice core research. The ICWG will investigate a wide range of topics related
to ice core research including NICL oversight, sample access and distribution,
inventory, policy issues and the development of a plan for future activities.
Through yearly meetings and reports the ICWG will provide leadership and
direction to the ice core community. Members of the ICWG will be elected by the
scientific community and will serve on a rotating basis. The first Chair for the
new ICWG will be the Director of the NICL SMO and will serve for one year until
ICWG members elect a Chair. A Sample Allocation Committee (SAC) developed from
members of ICWG will provide timely recommendations to NSF and USGS on sample
allocation and core access for qualified investigators. A data management
coordination system with existing data centers will be organized by the ICWG
through the NICL SMO.
