9312783 Jordan This research is on the development of organizational networks
and decentralized decision-making within networks. The development of networks
is to be modeled as an evolutionary process by which firms modify their internal
information and decision networks in response to the perceived economic
performance of other firms. The second line of proposed research concerns the
design of management accounting information systems for networks of productive
activities. A management accounting system reports to activity managers
information, such as cost and revenue information, aggregated from the actions
of other activities, and also measures the performance. Different accounting
systems can be compared according to their ability to ensure profitable budgets.
The proposed research would extend this model to include fixed-expenses and
inventory budgeting and to include a more explicit treatment of the budgeting
process.
