This project is aimed at a fundamental reexamination of the Monte Carlo
approach, which is the current state-of-the-art, to estimate hurricane winds for
the Gulf and Atlantic Ocean of the United States. The significance of wind
engineering information produced in the measurements and analysis of recent
hurricane events, improved data bases, and basic modeling approaches will be
investigated. The feasibility of developing an improved hurricane prediction
methodology will be examined and the limitations of the approach will be
scrutinized by detailed research on each element of the model. Expected benefits
from this study are more reliable estimates of the 50 and 100-year return period
hurricanes windspeeds and directional characteristics.
