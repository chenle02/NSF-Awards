Dr. Goodman will explore the dense core structures in molecular clouds, to
better understand the interface between quiescent cores and the turbulent
molecular cloud environment that contains them. This study will cover more than
200 cores located in seven separate molecular cloud complexes. It will combine
information gleaned from both emission and extinction maps to create the largest
sample of dust column density and temperature maps of cores that has yet been
made. The newly created maps will be used to address specific open issues in
star formation theory, including: i) the evolution of cores toward star
formation; ii) the nature of the gravitational wells in which cores find
themselves; and iii) the relation of cores to the larger molecular cloud
topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be made
publicly available on several online interfaces, including the World Wide
Telescope site and Google Sky. Dr. Goodman will participate in the development
of a new science curriculum at an independent school which will incorporate
these results.
