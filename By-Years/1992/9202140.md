This research project involves the integration of fuzzy set theory with the
selective precision synthesis method of optimum mechanism design. This effort
will enable mechanism designers to effectively solve problems that are posed
with fuzzy information. Problems dealing with planar and spatial mechanisms with
specified fuzzy motion information will be investigated in this project.
Problems will be formulated as nonlinear optimization problems which will be
solved using a modified form of the generalized reduced gradient method of
optimization. The modification to this optimization method involves its ability
to handle fuzzy numbers. This work is important because it will advance the
knowledge base in optimum mechanism design in the presence of imprecise data and
may open the door for additional engineering applications for the fuzzy set
theory.
