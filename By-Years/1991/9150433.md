Materials for a computer-based elementary statistics course are being created
using data sets from recent research in the biological, social and other
sciences. These materials will improve statistical literacy and encourage
students to view statistics as an interesting and important means of answering
scientific questions. Students are learning modern methods of exploratory data
analysis (including those based upon computer graphics) and statistical
inference. The materials address the practical and intellectual problems
connected with the classroom use of computers and real data sets in the
elementary statistics curriculum. Specifically, they include: (I) a collection
of carefully documented data sets from recent and important scientific research
ready for computer use, (2) an instructor's manual, and (3) student workbooks.
Throughout the project, faculty and students from diverse institutions are
testing and evaluating these materials.
