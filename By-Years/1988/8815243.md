The objective of this program is to acquire a deeper understanding of electron-
electron interactions and their consequences in solids. Applications occur in
one-electron energy spectra, phase transformations, collective excitations,
dynamic scattering processes, transport phenomena, and superconductivity.
Another aspect of the program is the theoretical study of physical properties
which have been found to exhibit extremely anomalous behavior such as magneto-
transport in alkali metals, the phonon spectrum of lead, and the low-
temperature heat capacity of several superconductors.
