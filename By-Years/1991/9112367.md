The fish order Characiformes comprises the most important group of freshwater
fishes living in Africa and in Central and South America. They have been studied
extensively because of their economic importance as food and as aquarium
resources (for example, the "tetras"), and because of their remarkable
adaptations to numerous kinds of aquatic environments, including the infamous
predatory habits of the piranhas. However, the evolutionary relationships among
the major families of characiform fishes are poorly understood, and
morphological characters alone promise little help in resolving the matter.
Faculty advisor Axel Meyer will assist graduate student Guillermo Orti in an
extensive molecular systematic survey of mitochondrial DNA variation in
representative samples of the major characiform groups. The amount and kind of
mutational differences in mitochondrial DNA between fish species indicate
relative degree of genealogical relationship, and thus provide data to infer the
phylogeny of these lineages. Insight into the evolutionary history of this
species-rich group of fishes will in turn help in understanding the geographical
diversification between African and South American faunas following the
geological breakup of Gondwana.
