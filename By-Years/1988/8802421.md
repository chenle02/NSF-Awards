This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, utilizes
electron diffraction techniques to measure the structure and dynamics of liquid
droplets and new low temperature crystal phases. These experiments coupled with
model calculations will elucidate the nature of condensed phases consisting of
highly supercooled microdrops and new low temperature crystal phases. The data
obtained in these unique experiments will be used by modellers to both verify
their theoretical constructs and to suggest new models for liquids and solids
consisting of small numbers of molecular units. The electron diffraction
patterns of supercooled liquid microdrops and new low temperature crystal
phases, formed by homogeneous nucleation from the vapor phase in supersonic
flows, will be observed. The data obtained will enhance knowledge of nucleation
and growth of molecular clusters and will supply stringent new tests of current
theories of molecular liquids. By coupling the experimental results with Monte
Carlo simulations, more realistic representations of the interactions between
polyatomic molecules will be made. In view of the fact that liquids are the
least understood common form of matter, this fresh approach can be expected to
yield new significant insights. The other phenomenon be addressed is nucleation.
The ability to control the form of clusters nucleated and to study their
structure within microseconds of formation will be provide useful data for the
basic understanding of the energetics and dynamics of nucleation.
