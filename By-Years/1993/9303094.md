9303094 Lukas A deep-water oceanographic station established at a site 100 km
north of Oahu, Hawaii, in October 1988, will be occupied for five more years.
This program is considered a component of the World Ocean Time-Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) and is called the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT). Hydrographic
cruises will be made to the station site approximately seven to eight times per
year, for intensive sampling of the biochemical and physical properties of the
water column. Temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen will be measured and,
discrete water samples will be obtained for chemical analysis. An inverted echo
sounder (IES) will be maintained at the site to give continuity to the
hydrographic stations and to resolve the high frequencies observed in the data
for periods lower than the cruise sampling interval. In addition, as part of
this program, the analysis of the data collected since 1988 will be performed.
