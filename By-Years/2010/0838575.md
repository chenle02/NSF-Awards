This study challenges a widespread notion that most global CO2 degassing takes
place at mid-ocean ridges and subaerial volcanoes by evaluating degassing in
continental extensional areas. The hypothesis to be tested is that there is a
substantial and unrecognized upward flux of fluids and gases from deep within
the earth that rise through vents in the Rio Grande rift and other tectonically-
active regions of the western U.S. These fluids often issue as carbonate-
depositing (travertine) springs, degrade regional water quality, release carbon
to the atmosphere, and support distinct microbial ecosystems. This study will
gather data on time-variations in the geochemical character (including trace
element, stable isotope and noble gas analysis) of major spring systems and
associated groundwaters to evaluate a hypothesis that microseismicity is
triggering advective transport and degassing. Microbial sampling and DNA
amplification will be used to compare these ?continental smokers? to black and
white smokers known along oceanic spreading centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
study will support graduate and undergraduate training, as well as a museum
exhibit on travertine springs and their geological and hydrologic
significance.&lt;br/&gt;
