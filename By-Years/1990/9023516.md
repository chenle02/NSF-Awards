Professor Harold L. Friedman is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies in the area of
statistical mechanics of ionic solutions. This research is of primary importance
in furthering our understanding of the nature of chemical equilibrium and
chemical reactions in solution. Professor Friedman will employ a mixture of
analytical statistical mechanical theory and computer simulation to relate
measurable properties of solutions to a molecular picture of the underlying
structure and dynamics. The measurable properties of primary importance are the
electrical conductivity, concentration dependent equilibria and reaction rates,
especially for charge transfer reactions. New probes range from neutron
diffraction, which is uniquely powerful for establishing the molecular structure
of solutions, to spectroscopic methods that have, with the advent of ultra-short
pulses for both generating and probing fast molecular responses, become
enormously powerful.
