Madisetti This research is investigating a new method for the computation of the
Radon transform and its inverse that avoids a number of problems associated with
conventional methods. These include sensitivity to noise, necessity for
interpolation, and significant amounts of computation. The discrete Fast Radon
Transform (FRT/IFRT), as this method is called, provides an increased
flexibility in sampling, in addition to a dramatic reduction in the
computational complexity. The basic approach taken is to apply advanced signal
processing techniques in the frequency domain to the reconstruction problem. Use
of optimization methods and the properties of discrete periodic signals, result
in a rich theory for the FRT/IFRT. Experimental results have validated
theoretical analyses of its performance.
