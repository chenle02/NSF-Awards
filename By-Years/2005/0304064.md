We will evaluate the potential of hybrid nanotubes as nanomechanical detectors.
Our specific research goals are: i) to develop a TEM-based experimental testbed
for fundamental mechanical studies of hybrid nanotubes, ii) to assess the
mechanical properties of these systems through studies of resonant behavior,
iii) to understand the irreversible processes that will dictate energy losses
and thermodynamic noise in resonant nanotube detectors, and iv) to assess the
prospects of these nanosystems for "in-tube" NMR detection and as magnetic force
sensors.

This exploration will leverage Evoy's expertise in structural studies of
nanomechanical systems, and will employ Luzzi's and Johnson's existing abilities
in the synthesis of hybrid nanosystems. The proposed program will be implemented
through approaches and satellite activities that will have broader academic
impacts. An undergraduate project will allow a young researcher to provide his
own contribution to a larger program. In addition, the development of digital
curriculum will result in a Nanotechnology course to be delivered asynchronously
to local community colleges, and/or through closed circuit delivery at Puerto
Rican sites.
