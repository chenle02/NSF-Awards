ABSTRACT P.I. Erik Trinkaus SBR-9318702 Recently, it has become clear that in
the Near East, in the Middle Paleolithic, there were two rather distinctive,
morphologically defined hominids - the Neanderthals (or late archaic humans with
affinities to the Eurpoean Neandertahls) and robust early modern humans. The
late archaic group not only resembles the European Neanderthals in cranial
features, but also in a suite of features from the rest of the skeleton, most of
which appear to be related to overall robusticity, shared with some other later
archaic humans. By contrast, the Near Eastern early modern human sample more
closely approaches Recent human skeletal morphology than does the late archaic
sample. The issue to be addressed by this research is to what, if any,
significant behavioral differences might these two lineages possess? There are a
number of clues to the different possible habitual behaviors, but Trinkaus will
focus on one relevant aspect, leg bone size and shape, as related to differences
in locomotor activity (the implication is that the more Neanderthal - like
individuals possessed thicker, more robust leg bones, and were engaged in more
strenuous patterns of habitual activity). Whatever the outcomes of the proposed
research, it will provide further insight into the dynamics fo the origins of
modern humans in the Near East, one of the earliest regions to witness
populations we call early modern humans. The work will therefore contribute to
understanding more global issues of the origins of modern humans, for which the
Near East provides only one regional example. *** P\a nthro\jfried\9318702.abs V
