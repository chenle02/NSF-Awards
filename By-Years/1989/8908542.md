Melatonin is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland and known to
have an important role in the regulation of mammalian reproduction. This hormone
also influences circadian rhythmicity in a number of species, including humans.
The regulation of melatonin production by the circadian timing system has been
studied extensively as have the biochemical mechanisms in the pineal which are
necessary for melatonin biosynthesis. The major enigma remaining in
understanding the role of melatonin has been identification of its sites and
mechanism of action. Dr. Weaver has developed and validated a quantitative
autoradiographic method using an iodinated melatonin to localize its sites of
action in the brain. He will use this technique to characterize the melatonin
binding sites in the central nervous system and then correlate changes in
binding activity within specific neuronal structures with various physiological
conditions. Understanding the sites and mechanism of melatonin action has wide-
ranging implications, as the hormone modulates circadian rhythmicity in humans
and may be useful in treating conditions associated with abnormalities of
biological rhythms, such as jet lag and depression. Furthermore, elucidating the
mechanism by which melatonin regulates reproduction in animals that breed
seasonally may reveal general mechanisms for the regulation of reproduction
applicable to domestic farm animals. Basic research into the sites and
mechanisms of melatonin action is a necessary first step towards these goals.
