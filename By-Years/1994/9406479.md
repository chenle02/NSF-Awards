9406479 Hansen In this renewal, PIs will continue to test the escalation
hypothesis, in which biological hazards have increased through time, and the
adaptations to those pressures have also increased. PIs will continue to look at
gastropod drilling frequencies, prey effectiveness, and predator behavior
stereotypy based on the record of naticid drillholes. Recovery after a mass
extinction is a new focus.
