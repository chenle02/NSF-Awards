This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. His research will include a experimental and theoretical
investigation of very low energy molecular collision processes using a
collisional cooling technique. These studies will enable a more precise
determination of intermolecular potential surfaces and contribute to a deeper
understanding of molecular collision dynamics, energy transfer, and conditions
in interstallar gas clouds and outer planet atmospheres.
