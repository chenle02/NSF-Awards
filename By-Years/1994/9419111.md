9419111 Self This study is to map, sample, and analyze by both granulometry and
clast morphology the various facies of the 1991 ignimbrite at Mount Pinatubo,
Philippines. Fabric studies of the main body of the ignimbrite by anisotropy of
magnetic susceptibility (AMS) will also be undertaken. The main aim is to better
understand the lithofacies and facies association of the deposit, its
emplacement mechanisms, and the nature of the pyroclastic flows. The
information, which will be put into the well-constrained temporal framework of
the 3.5-hour-long climax, will shed much-needed light on the current debate in
volcanology concerning the nature of, and the spectrum of deposition mechanisms
from, pyroclastic flows. The study will also provide information on the amount
od co-ignimbrite ash generated during the 1991 eruption. Without detailed
studies of ignimbrites, models of pyroclastic flow emplacement will continue to
outstrip the amount of information available from actual examples that have been
explored in detail, and in this regard the value of results from the new, large
Pinatubo deposit should not be lost.
