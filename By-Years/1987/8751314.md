This is a three year project to provide 540 teachers and 180 administrators
with educational experiences and guidance on how to improve the programs at
their schools in the areas of critical thinking and mathematical problem
solving. Each year there is an initial training session offered to the
participants and this is followed throughout the year with teams of teachers,
administrators, and the project staff working together to become more
knowledgeable in and devise methods to enrich the problem solving aspects of the
programs at the target schools. The Corridor Partnership has effectively brought
together members of the local business community, scientists from the regional
research laboratories and professional organizations, and professional educators
at all levels to provide support and guidance to this project as well as to past
efforts of the Partnership. Among these efforts, for example, are programs that
were conducted during the fall and winter of 1986 which serve as pilot projects
for the proposed efforts.
