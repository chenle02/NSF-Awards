This project is an integrated study of the optical and physical properties of
the antarctic snow surface. It has several components which concern the
processes by which global climatic variability is imprinted into the proxy data
recorded in the antarctic ice. The effect of surface roughness (sastrugi
orientation) on the angular distribution of reflected sunlight, and the spectral
distribution of thermal infrared radiation will be measured to provide the
knowledge necessary for the interpretation of Earth Radiation Budget Experiment
(ERBE) satellite data. The mechanism of dry deposition of atmospheric sulfates
in the snow surface will be measured by observing the air flow in the permeable
upper firn, and samples of hoarfrost and will be examined for their isotopic
composition. The former will allow the evaluation of the extent to which the
concentration of aerosols in the firn and ice represent contemporaneous
concentrations in the atmosphere, while the latter will yield a comparative
study of isotopic ratios to the ambient air temperatures. Earlier work had been
concerned with austral summer conditions. The present project extends the
measurement program to austral winter conditions.
