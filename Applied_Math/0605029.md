The investigator combines multiscale modeling, analysis, and computation to
study a variety of polymeric liquids of anisotropic microstructures. The
microstructure of these polymeric liquids consists of anisotropic polymers and
nanoparticles whose configuration, conformation, rigidity/flexibility, and
chemical properties interact with the other constituents in the materials as
well as the macroscopic flow field to effect molecular scale or nanoscale
alignment that controls the ultimate performance properties of the materials.
One of the goals of the project is to study how the macroscopic flow field
interacts with the micro-structure of the complex fluids, leading to novel
mesoscale morphology, and ultimately influences the rheological as well as the
material properties at the macroscopic level. Other goals include studying how
various molecular geometries affect macroscopic material and rheological
properties, phase transitions, and mesoscopic structure formation, wave
propagation in biaxial liquid crystalline polymers, and external field assisted
flow processing of polymeric materials and nanocomposites.

The investigator develops state-of-the-art multiscale theories and models to
study material and rheological properties of liquid crystalline polymers and
polymer-nanoparticle composites and their fluid dynamics in various processing
conditions. The project is motivated by new discoveries and emerging
applications in nanomaterials and nanotechnologies. A good understanding of the
new materials and new processing methods not only advances science, but also has
implications for industrial applications in materials and nanotechnology.
