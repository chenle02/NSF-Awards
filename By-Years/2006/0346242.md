The major activities of this project will consist of a scientific workshop on
EarthScope in the Great Basin and its Margins. The primary purpose of the
workshop is to promote community self-organization that we believe is necessary
for the first Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction initiative in
the Earth sciences. The content of the workshop will include review the
EarthScope science and education program, review the state of knowledge in
various fields where Earthscope can be expected to make major contributions,
posters by all participants, and breakout sessions to identify major research
directions. The organizing committee will post all participants contributions
(papers, abstracts, powerpoint presentations, etc.) on the worldwide web for
open access by the global community, and prepare a workshop report.

The broader impact of this project is to deepen the understanding of the state
of knowledge and the objectives of EarthScope among scientists who are active in
the Great Basin, and to expand the constituency of Earthscope in this region to
include the resource industries, hydrologic scientists, regional museums, and
members of the education community.
