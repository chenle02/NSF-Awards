This award will support travel and conference costs for American students and
students from American universities to participate in the Joint Doctoral
Consortium, Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT) Conference, and Logic Programming
and Non-Monotonic Reasoning Conference (LPNMR), September 2015, in Lexington,
KY.

ADT is a multi-disciplinary forum focused on algorithmic issues in decision
theory. The first three International Conferences on Algorithmic Decision Theory
(ADT 2009, 2011, 2013) brought together researchers and practitioners from
diverse areas of computer science, economics, and operations research from
around the globe. LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic
programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of
the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and
practitioners interested in the design, implementation and application of logic-
based programming languages and database systems, and those who work in the area
of knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning. The Joint Doctoral
Consortium will include presentations to and by students, and personal and
small-group interactions with mentors.
