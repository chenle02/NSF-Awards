The primary objective of this research is to analyze the economic impact of
policies designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. As an illustration, a
tax on fossil fuel combustion, based on the carbon content of each fuel, could
be imposed in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This would induce
substitution of other inputs for fossil fuels and increase the relative
utilization of fuels such as natural gas with a low carbon content. To model the
economic impact of restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases, U.S. economic
growth is simulated with and without these restrictions. The model is
characterized by three distinctive features: (1) It is highly disaggregated with
separate models of production for thirty-five industrial sectors. (2) The
behavioral equations of the model are estimated econometrically from an
extensive new data base constructed specifically for this purpose. (3) The
dynamics of the model are based on intertemporal optimization by households and
firms. This project is important because it will begin to give us a better
understanding of the behavior of the U.S. economy in response to policies
designed to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases.
