Light Field Compression and Streaming&lt;br/&gt;In image-based rendering, a
large set of conventional 2-D images is used &lt;br/&gt;to render arbitrary
views of a 3-D scene. The images capture the light &lt;br/&gt;field around the
scene. Since hundreds or thousands of individual images &lt;br/&gt;are required,
the data sets are huge, unless they are compressed. A &lt;br/&gt;particularly
important application of light field compression is the &lt;br/&gt;streaming of
light fields stored on an Internet media server. For &lt;br/&gt;interactive
viewing, this requires a framework to decide, which packets of
&lt;br/&gt;compressed light field data to send over the network, and at what
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to develop and study new
techniques for efficient &lt;br/&gt;light field compression and interactive
streaming. For compression, a &lt;br/&gt;novel, elegant disparity-compensated
4-D wavelet transform will be &lt;br/&gt;investigated that avoids the re-
sampling problem of previous &lt;br/&gt;disparity-compensated wavelet schemes by
incorporating the disparity &lt;br/&gt;compensation into a sequence of lifting
steps. For light field streaming, &lt;br/&gt;the proposed work will build on
recent advances in rate-distortion &lt;br/&gt;optimized packet scheduling and
extend the state-of-the-art to interactive &lt;br/&gt;3-D
viewing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to have broad impact for
networked 3-D interactive &lt;br/&gt;graphics applications, ranging from
distance education and remote &lt;br/&gt;visualization of scientific and medical
data sets, to Internet e-commerce &lt;br/&gt;and networked video
games.&lt;br/&gt;
