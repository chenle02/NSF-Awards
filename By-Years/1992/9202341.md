This project consists of two components: a) the use of reaction-diffusion
equations in the study of natural selection and diffusion in simple genetic
populations, and b) the distribution of charged ions in solvents under the
influence of electric fields in electrochemistry. The evolutionary part extends
Fisher's classical model in population genetics by allowing the fitness of the
individuals and the population size to vary. Consequently, a number of
mathematical complications arise; e.g., the resulting system of equations does
not have a maximum principle. This, and other technical issues will be addressed
in this research.
