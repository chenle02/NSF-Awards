Biological Sciences (61) The interdisciplinary Behavioral Neuroscience program
at Andrews University is modeled after the very successful student development
program of their Biology Department. The primary objective of the Biology
program is to attract undergraduate students with promise and interest in
biology into science-based careers, including research. Students graduating from
this program are unusually successful, scoring above the 90th percentile on
nationally normed exit exams and demonstrating greater than 90% acceptance rate
into graduate programs and an 85% acceptance rate into medical schools. The
program also has demonstrated success rates with students from underrepresented
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factors resulting in the unusual success
experienced by the Biology graduates have not been clearly demonstrated. The PIs
are taking an experimental approach to answering these questions. This involves
the development and implementation of the interdisciplinary program in
Behavioral Neuroscience based on the features of the Biology program and
recruitment into the program that targets non-STEM majors. Careful assessment of
the new program is being used to define the factors that are responsible for the
success of the students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
