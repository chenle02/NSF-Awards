0212007 Mainelis The control of airborne microorganisms that are capable of
causing serious health problems or even death has become a serious concern since
the recent anthrax spore episode in the United States. Electric fields have been
used to kill various bacteria, yeasts and spores in liquids, but have not been
used to inactivate airborne microorganisms. This research will result in the
development of a laboratory test facility for exposure and determination of the
inactivation efficiency of airborne microorganisms by electrical fields of
different magnitudes and polarity for different periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;Three
different microorganisms will be used, one of which is a surrogate for anthrax
spores i.e. Bacillus subtilis var. niger.&lt;br/&gt;
