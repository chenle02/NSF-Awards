Big data permeates business, engineering, and science -- the number of connected
smart devices, even excluding phones, tablets, and PCs, is projected to grow
from billions to tens of billions within five years. Vast data is generated from
sensors, GPS, RFID, medical devices, and emergency and energy systems, to
provide rich information about untold aspects of the modern world. Despite the
ubiquity and significant interest in mining such data, there are few existing
analytical tools that are suitable. The investigator focuses on the development
of new statistical methodology, extending application of these methods to new
fields, and on increasing understanding of the theoretical challenges in data-
driven model building and inference. The methods under development have the
potential to strengthen research in numerous fields, including astronomy,
economics, emergency medical services, neuroscience, and statistics itself.

Time series analysis is a rich and historic field, but it remains centered on
univariate and low dimensional multivariate analysis. In recent years, big data
has begun to permeate business, engineering, and science, but despite the
ubiquity and significant interest in mining such data, there are few existing
analytical tools suitable for data with a time structured format. The
investigator studies the development of new high dimensional and functional time
series (HDTS) tools to help researchers and practitioners meet increasingly
ambitious inferential and modeling aims. Specifically, the investigator studies:
(i) new methods for simultaneous modeling, inference, and forecasting of dynamic
functional data; (ii) new structured regularization methods for modeling high
dimensional time ordered data; (iii) new adaptive, yet methods of stability
analysis for big data monitoring systems; and (iv) linking these new methods
with emergent lines of inquiry and providing an infrastructure for answering
critical research questions in a wide range of fields.
