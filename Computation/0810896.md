This project is concerned with the mathematical analysis and design of robust
and efficient computational algorithms for modeling wave interactions with
negative index metamaterials (NIMs). These negative index metamaterials have
some exotic properties (such as near field refocusing) never seen before in
those natural electromagnetic materials. The numerical NIM analysis plays an
important role for the design of the nano-structures with complicated geometries
that establish a NIM. these NIM models are far more complicated than the well-
studied Maxwell's equations in free space due to its dispersiveness, and the
introduced electric and magnetic polarization currents. Solving them accurately
and efficiently is quite challenging and very few work has been done in regards
of solid mathematical analysis and modeling. The ultimate goal of this project
is to develop an efficient set of time domain finite element methods that are
mathematically sound, accurate and fast convergent for simulating wave
interactions with metamaterials.

Study of metamaterials is one of the hottest topics in many disciplinaries since
2000, with potential revolution in design of antenna, waveguides and radar,
nanolithography and imaging at subwavelength resolution (used for better
understanding of the images obtained from noninvasive geophysical probing and
tumor detection), near field control and manipulation (used for detecting low
levels of chemical and biological agents, manipulation of molecules), and
invisibility cloak (used for stealth technology). Developing robust and
efficient algorithms for negative index metamaterials will benefit broader areas
such as electrical engineering, materials, optics, physics, nano-technology, and
biomedical technology. Furthermore, the proposed project will help the PI
recruit and train graduate students (this project will support a female Ph.D
student currently supervised by the PI) to pursue careers in computational
mathematics.
