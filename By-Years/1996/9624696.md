ABSTRACT Goodson 9624696 This work was awarded under the CAREER program and
includes objectives for both research and education. The research plan is to
create a Nanoscale ThermoElectroManipulator which applies heat and measures
temperature with a 50 nm tapered, metal-coated, optical fiber. The fiber tip
will be used to pick up and anneal groups of atoms, to induce highly-localize
chemical reastions at surfaces and to form, cut, and solder nanostructures with
extreme spatial resolution. The educational plan is to sponsor a national
competition for thermal design of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS). The
competition would be announced on the World Wide Web, and electronic mail would
be used to mentor design teams and submit design proposals. The MEMS designed by
the five finalist teams would be prototyped at the Stanford Nanofabrication
Facility with joint industry/NSF support and the students invited to Stanford
for a symposium.
