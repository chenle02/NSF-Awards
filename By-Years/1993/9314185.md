9314185 LiKamWa The speed of opto-electronic devices fabricated using MQWs are
governed by the rate of carrier removal from the MQW region. We have previously
shown that, by applying an electric field across the MQW, carrier sweep-out
significantly improves on the recovery of an all-optical directional coupler
switch. In most devices, carrier sweep-out is achieved through vertical
transport across the quantum wells and in these cases, the carrier escape
mechanisms are a combination of thermionic emission, tunneling, scattering and
recombination. Significant carrier re-trapping can also take place in adjacent
wells and this slow down the recovery rate of the devices. In this novel
approach, we propose to sweep the photo-generated carriers away from the
switching region by lateral sweep-out in a horizontal electric field. The rate
of carrier removal in this case would then be dependent on the guided spot size,
the electric field and the carrier drift velocities. The device recovery rate
would also be a second order exponential of the form y=e -12/A, which has a more
complete recovery in the long time regime, compared to the exponential recovery
normally associated with thermionic emission times. Lateral carrier sweep-out
should also be applicable to a wide variety of other MQW opto-electronic
devices. ***
