9633018 Yuen This research planning grant (RPG) will support the planning of a
systematic experimental investigation of novel layered magnetic materials, the
metal-telluride compounds. Preparation and characterization will be carried out
to produce samples with high homogeneity and single crystal samples.
Magnetically oriented samples will be produced in high magnetaic fields at the
National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). Various measurements will be
made including susceptibility, magnetization, and Mossbauer. Preliminary
experiments will be carried out. %%% This research planning grant (RPG) will
