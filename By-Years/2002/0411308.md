Interdisciplinary (99) An interdisciplinary team of faculty and administrators
introduce students and educators in the use of analytical techniques and
curricula associated with the broad scope of chemistry, biology and computer
science in order to launch a new, undergraduate program in forensic science. The
project incorporates the area of computer-related crime into the course of
study. The project also produces a short course in forensic science for the
interdisciplinary team, examines a variety of other university curricula and
produces laboratory and classroom pilot projects.
