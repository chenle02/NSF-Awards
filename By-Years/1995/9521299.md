9521299 Bannon The ability of atmospheric scientists to numerically model the
atmosphere is fundamental for improved understanding of atmospheric processes
and for weather prediction. Accordingly, it is important to understand the
energetics of the atmosphere and the capabilities of various numerical
representations of the atmosphere to adequately simulate the energetics. The
Principal Investigator will pursue a theoretical/numerical investigation of a
process known as atmospheric adjustment which is defined as the response of a
compressible atmosphere to a prescribed heating. The study of atmospheric
adjustment deals with the tendency of the atmosphere to return to a state of
balance after the imbalance caused by rapid atmospheric heating such as might be
caused by convective clouds. The atmospheric energetics due to rapid heating
will be examined with an assessment of the partitioning of energy between
acoustic and gravity modes. Often atmospheric numerical models are constructed
to remove acoustic waves, for they are not considered meteorologically
important. Recent research by the PI, however, has shown that this might not be
the case. This research will serve two practical functions. Since the research
will assess the role of acoustic modes in weather phenomena, a means will be
developed to document the merits of anelastic (non-acoustic) equations relative
to fully compressible equations (those that allow for acoustic waves). The
research also will provide a benchmark against which various weather numerical
models can be tested. ***
