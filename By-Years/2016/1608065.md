The "Science of Security" (SoS) encompasses research in cybersecurity that
emphasizes the means by which researchers and adopters can gain confidence in
research results. The SoS approach emphasizes both the activity of scientific
knowledge discovery and also the improvements of scientific methods for
validating predictions though logic or through potentially repeatable empirical
observational and experimental analyses. It also emphasizes gaining of coherency
in the scientific activity. Science of Security emphasizes the methodology of
research in cyber-security as much as the results of that research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding for students to participate in
the 2016 Annual Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security (HotSoS), held
in April 2016 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA.
