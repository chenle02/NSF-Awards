Benjamin Widom of Cornell University is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational chemistry program for the theoretical study, by
the methods of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, of the energetics and
structures of liquids and liquid mixtures, of the phase transitions such fluids
undergo and of the structures and structural transformations of the interfaces
between fluid phases. One study focuses on the borderline between two types of
wetting transition, where a range of first-order wetting transitions and one of
second-order transitions join at a point of "tri-critical" wetting; and to study
the behavior of the line tension as that tricritical point is approached.
Another study focuses on hydrophobic effects.

The studies have broad impact in many important and very different areas of
science, technology and society. For example, wetting is a central concern in
soil science; it is crucial in industrial flotation and separation systems; it
is also crucial for the proper action for the lungs in respiration. Hydrophobic
effects have numerous manifestations throughout chemistry and biology.
