Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The Polar Research Board (PRB) of the U.S.
National Academy of Sciences serves as the U.S. National Committee to two
international organizations: the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC),
and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). IASC encourages and
facilitates cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research and in all areas of
the Arctic region, provides scientific input to the Arctic Council and other
international policy organizations, and provides seed money to support
international science development. SCAR helps lead the international Antarctic
science community by implementing new research initiatives, identifying emerging
scientific themes, promoting international cooperation and partnerships, and
providing scientific advice to the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty and others on
issues related to the management and protection of the Antarctic region and the
Southern Ocean. The U.S. dues requested leverages in-kind contributions from
countries around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:
&lt;br/&gt;U.S. support for IASC and SCAR provides opportunities for U.S.
scientists to network and develop partnerships with colleagues in other
countries. For early career scientists these organizations offer a forum to
expand research interests and make new connections. SCAR and IASC?s policy
advisory activities help ensure that important policy decisions about managing
and protecting these regions are based, at least in part, on sound scientific
assessment. International collaboration through SCAR and IASC ?s
interdisciplinary, international research activities allows the U.S. to
accomplish scientific objectives that would be impossible for single
investigators, programs, or countries to do alone and provides opportunities for
U.S. scientists that would not otherwise be available.
