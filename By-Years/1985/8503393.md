Mathematical research is continued in the areas of harmonic analysis and
representation theory with special attention to nilmanifolds and their
applications to engineering and science. Emphasis will be on certain nonlinear
operators which are critical in the design of radar tests. During the years
between 1950-70 there was a great deal of work on the radar ambiguity function.
Since that time little progress has been made in the study of this important
operator.
