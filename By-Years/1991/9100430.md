This is the first U.S.-Taiwan joint workshop on solar variability effects on the
atmosphere and space processing proposed by Dr. Shi Wu, the University of
Alabama at Huntsville and Dr. C. H. Liu, the Taiwan National Central University
supported by the AIT-(U.S.) CCNAA-(Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. The
Division of Atmospheric Sciences has contributed $6,000 to support this joint
workshop. This workshop covers topics important to the NSF research mission on
global change and provides an opportunity for scientists to discuss the
geophysical phenomenon occurring specifically in that region, such as the
equatorial anomaly region. It provides a forum to plan future research programs
related to upper atmospheric research in this region of Asia and will increase
cooperative research activities in this field between U.S. and Taiwan
scientists.
