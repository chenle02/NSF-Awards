Oomycete and fungal plant pathogens cause a number of very important diseases.
Many of these pathogens can deliver proteins into the cytoplasm of their host
cells to disable host immunity; these proteins are called effectors. The
mechanism by which these proteins enter host cells is poorly understood. The
investigators have shown that oomycete and fungal effector proteins can enter
host cells without the aid of any pathogen-encoded machinery, but instead rely
on short amino acid sequences in the N-termini called RXLR motifs. The
investigators have discovered that the RXLR motifs can bind a class of membrane
lipids called phosphoinositides. In this project, the investigators will test
whether binding of the effectors to phosphoinositides is actually responsible
for transferring the effectors into host cells. They will identify which host
phosphoinositides are utilized by the effectors, and they will characterize the
mechanism of binding. Finally they will test whether it is possible to block
effector entry and so prevent disease. An extremely wide range of the most
destructive plant pathogens, including those causing wheat rust, rice blast,
grape powdery mildew and potato late blight depend on effectors. Understanding
effector entry and determining how to block it would provide an entirely new
approach to treating this broad class of diseases. Treatment of animal diseases
caused by fungi, oomycetes and some parasites may also be treatable by this
approach. This project will train two graduate students and provide summer
research opportunities for multi-cultural undergraduate students.
