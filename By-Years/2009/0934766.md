Two cohorts of eight junior mathematics majors each are being awarded two year
scholarships of $20,000 annually while completing an undergraduate mathematics
degree and meeting the requirements for New York State teacher certification in
mathematics. The project focuses on how preparation in an inquiry-based and
culturally relevant mathematics teaching and academic program can enhance
teacher quality in high needs school districts. Formative and summative
evaluation from an external evaluator guides the development of the program.

The extensive induction program for the new teachers is supported by the
Westbury, Uniondale, Roosevelt, and Brentwood School Districts in cooperation
with university faculty in both mathematics and mathematics education programs.
This program provides Scholars with: (1) an in-depth summer institute; (2) a
year long classroom experience; and (3) an extensive two-year induction program.
