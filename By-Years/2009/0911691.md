Professor Lei Geng of the University of Iowa is supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to probe transport
properties of nanoporous materials, with long-term aims of improved
understanding and enhanced applications in chemistry, biology and engineering
(e.g. as stationary phases in chemical separations, supports in heterogeneous
catalysis, substrates for chemical sensors and biosensors, and vehicles for drug
delivery). The experimental approach includes a combination of quantitative
confocal fluorescence imaging and single molecule spectroscopy to investigate
such properties as pore wetting, diffusion, adsorption, and desorption involving
a variety of both organic-modified and unmodified nanoporous silica particles.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work gains broader impact through participation of
graduate students from underrepresented groups and high school students, and
from infrastructure enhancement via enhanced availability of state-of-the-art
instrumentation. It offers potential benefits to society through improved
stationary phases for chemical and biochemical separations essential to
pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries.
