With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program
in the Division of Chemistry, Valerie Pierre of the University of Minnesota will
be developing a new class of three-dimensional precision polymers. The unique
wireframe topology of these hollow polymers opens up new possibilities for a
number of applications including their potential use as solubilizing agents, as
molecular and imaging probes, and as encapsulating and delivery agents. Broader
impacts of the project include the development and evaluation of new hands-on
activities to engage grade six students in science with the goal of improving
their attitude and increasing their interest toward science early in their
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Dr. Valerie Pierre and her team
will engage in a focused study directed ad the development of a class of three-
dimensional wireframe polymers. A unique aspect of the wireframe polymers is
their templated synthesis. The approach employs predictive supramolecular
strategies to template the position of each monomer on a DNA nanostructure.
Subsequent coupling of the monomers yields the final desired macromolecule in
one pot. The modularity of the templated approach will facilitate tuning of the
polymerâ€™s size, topology, and functional groups to match the needs of the
intended applications. Orthogonal conjugation chemistry will enable
functionalization of a large yet precise number of groups on the wireframe
polymer. The modularity of the supramolecular approach will enable the facile
introduction of a set number of a second and distinct monomers at precise and
predetermined locations on the macromolecules. The ability to pinpoint and
efficiently incorporate single monomer polymorphism opens the door to precise
bifunctional polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
