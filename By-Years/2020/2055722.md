Virtual reality applications have shown promise in providing effective training
for technicians. The technology can replace the need for expensive hardware used
in hands-on training. However, virtual reality applications are also expensive,
creating a barrier to adoption by community and technical colleges. The
potential impact of virtual reality on student learning in advanced
manufacturing technician programs is noteworthy, given the wide variety of
devices and information that technicians need to understand to perform their
tasks. This project will develop, implement, and assess a low-cost platform for
developing virtual reality modules that can be adopted and customized by
community colleges, including those with limited resources. By removing the
barrier to the widespread use of virtual reality in technician education, this
project aims to improve student learning in technical education programs. The
project intends to create a network of more than 30 community and technical
colleges that will be capable of creating, collaborating on, and sharing
effective and customizable low-cost virtual reality educational materials for
advanced manufacturing technicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to improve student learning by increasing the accessibility of
virtual reality training applications for students in advanced manufacturing
technician programs. To test the effectiveness of the platform, the project will
develop four virtual reality modules on blueprint reading, geometric
dimensioning and tolerancing, basic work area safety, and quality control. The
effectiveness of the modules in improving student learning will be assessed
using pre- and post-tests for incumbent manufacturing technicians and student
technicians. The project team will then train faculty to develop and implement
their own customized modules and contribute to an online library of all the
resulting virtual reality modules. As a result of this project, a consortium of
community and technical college educators will be trained to use the virtual
reality applications in their classes. The resources and instructional materials
produced during this project will be made available via the projectâ€™s website so
that academic institutions and manufacturers can access and use the resources
for training purposes. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological
Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-
technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
