Professor Koch will continue his investigations of models relevant to the
theory of critical phenomena, and of neural network models related to disordered
systems in statistical mechanics. This includes the development of new
techniques in renormalization group analysis, which connects his work to
constructive quantum field theory, where similar methods are being used.
Professor Koch's work is in the area broadly known as mathematical physics where
a deep mathematical understanding of physical models is sought. One of his
projects involves an investigation of the renormalization group, where an
attempt is made to understand interactions at all length scales simultaneously.
This is one of the most important and least understood problems in statistical
mechanics and quantum field theory today.
