The research focuses on the dynamics of ultra-cold atoms in magneto-optical
lattices. Two basic problems are addressed; the non-linear dynamics describing
the coupling of the atomic spins to their other degrees of freedom and the
control of the collective spin of the entire atomic ensemble. Of particular
interest is the connection between quantum and classical descriptions of the
phenomena.
