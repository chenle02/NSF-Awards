Three major types of phosphorites occur off Peru: (1) friable light-colored
laminae, including small peloids and nodules, (2) phosphatic sands dominated by
peloids, and (3) generally darker, well lithified dense nodules and hard-
grounds. The cores recovered during Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Leg 112 contain
all three phosphorite types and allow expansion of the existing information on
many aspects of the older Cenozoic to Quaternary sediments of this region.
Accordingly, the primary aims of this project are to (1) improve the
understanding of oceanographic and sedimentologic factors which control the
episodic deposition of phosphorites in the geologic record, and (2) to develop
geochemical and isotopic criteria which may distinguish primary properites
derived in the original depositional environment, from modified properties,
those acquired by the influence of a subsurface saline brine or during later
burial diagenesis, or by reworking and concentration through sedimentologic
processes. %%% Phosphorites on continental margins are an interesting and
potentially economical mineral deposit. This study will examine the controlling
factors for the formation of these deposits. Sediments from drill cores on the
Peruvian margin will be examined by a variety of geochemical techniques for
clues to the climatic influences on formation as well as the post- depositional
effects of fluid flow and diagenesis.
