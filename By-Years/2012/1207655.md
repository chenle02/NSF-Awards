Abstract

Award: DMS 1207655, Principal Investigator: Benjamin Schmidt

The principal investigator will study the rigidity and deformation properties of
curvature and geodesics in Riemannian manifolds. A specific goal is to classify
the Riemannian manifolds having all sectional curvatures greater than or equal
to one and with positive spherical rank. Conjecturally, these manifolds are
isometric to compact rank one symmetric spaces. Another broad goal is to
investigate the structure of constant vector curvature manifolds in dimensions
four and higher.

Objects in nature with a high degree of symmetry are quite often structurally
rigid. When highly symmetric spaces are altered, numerical measurements of the
way light propagates and the way space bends can be used to quantify changes.
The principal investigator will study the influence of Riemannian curvature, a
numerical measurement of bending, on the way that highly symmetric spaces can
and cannot be perturbed.
