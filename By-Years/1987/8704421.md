This proposal requests funds for the purchase of an open-flow microcalorimetry-
respirometry system. This instrumentation will enable analytical capabilities
not presently available and will foster the expansion and enhancement of
existing programs directed by five primary and three secondary users. It will
support research on (l) mechanistic analyses of hypometabolic states in
invertebrates, (2) regulation of glucoeogenesis in skeletal muscle, (3)
metabolic adaptations of planktonic invertebrates, (4) physiological basis for
flood-tolerance among congeneric plant species, and (5) nitrophenol-based
metabolism of soil microbes. In addition to quantifying total metabolic rates of
the respective tissues/organisms, the microcalorimetry- respirometry system will
allow anaerobic components, monitoring of metabolic compensation during entry
and exist from stressful environmental conditions, and analysis of the relative
contributions of different substrates to total metabolic rate.
