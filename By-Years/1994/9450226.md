94-50226 Lemme The Philadelphia Urban Systemic Initiative team proposes to
carry out a three-part program to: 1) produce several "prototypical" networks to
be used for the development and dissemination of specific components of the
overall USI K-12 SMT reform; 2) work with the schools to ensure that the State-
mandated School Improvement Plan (SIP) be used as a guide to direct and
replicate the reforms systemwide; and 3) complete a self-study of the current
state of SMT education in the District and begin systemwide implementation of
the components developed by their team. These activities will be undertaken by a
team composed of members of the Philadelphia School District, led by the
Superintendent, PSD, and two PDs, working with key stakeholders in the
community, and in partnership with the Franklin Institute. Completion of the
self- study and the implementation of the USI plan will be accomplished through
the use of several task forces composed of District staff and representatives of
key stakeholders charged with these tasks.
