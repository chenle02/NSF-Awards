The principal investigator will study the relationship between the Laplacian of
a compact manifold and the geometry of the manifold. He will attempt to
determine the extent to which the spectrum of the manifold determines the class
up to finitely many topological types. The principal investigator will also
study the relationship between spectrum and other geometric quantities such as
diameter and injectivity radius. This award will support research in the general
area of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the
study of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts
defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
