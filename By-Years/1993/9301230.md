Jackson Community College request support from NSF for connection of their
campuses to NSFNET. MERIT is the midlevel network located in the state of
Michigan that will provide operations and network information services. It will
give the colleges a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high
speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The colleges
needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
