This conference aims to bring together experts on classical isoperimetric
inequalities, sharp functional inequalities, and spectral inequalities for a
week-long conference in Carthage, Tunisia, where the mathematical problem named
after Queen Dido, the founder of Carthage, originated. The week-long gathering
at the end of May 2010 will serve as a training ground for young researchers and
graduate students, incorporating an intensive program on techniques of
rearrangement, spectral analysis, and geometric inequalities. Through a review
of major breakthroughs over the last 30 years, and the confluence of recent
results by both senior professors and junior researchers, the conference will
serve as a means to bring together the many trends within isoperimetry. The
conference will also serve as a forum to bring experts on isoperimetry in
Analysis and Mathematical Physics into direct contact with those working near
the roots of the problem in Geometry. Through 24 plenary talks (expository,
intermediate, and advanced), open problems sessions, and a poster session for
graduate students, the conference will serve as a venue for a wide-ranging
evaluation of trends within the discipline of isoperimetry. Attendees will be
exposed to classical mathematical traditions in the context of isoperimetry
(probabilistic, analytic, geometric) and more recent trends (nonlinear flow
techniques).

The award provides funding of travel expenses of researchers and students
working in the U.S. to participate in the Queen Dido conference. The conference
is envisioned as a fully international gathering, and it is essential that the
activities of mathematicians in the U.S. be adequately represented. The award is
co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.
