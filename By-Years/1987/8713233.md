Separations based on phase equilibria (and thus thermodynamic properties of
nonideal liquid mixtures) are often essential for design of efficient chemical
processes. Costly and time consuming measurements cannot be made except for a
tiny fraction of the enormous number of mixtures of interest. Group contribution
methods such as UNIFAC and ASOG show great promise for predicting phase
equilibria of nonideal liquid mixtures. However, these methods are presently
limited by the available experimental data to describe the group interactions.
Previous work directed by Design Institute for Physical Property Data (DIPPR),
under AIChE, has made progress in measuring data needed to obtain binary
interaction parameters to fill in the blanks in the UNIFAC tables. Much
additional work is needed to complete the tables and make the method more
generally useful and applicable. Vapor-liquid equilibrium and solubility data
are measured for binary liquid mixtures which is used to enhance the group
contribution methods. Specific systems are selected taking other work into
account to avoid duplication of effort. Significant advantages are realized in
the handling of the project by DIPPR, since DIPPR broadly represents the
chemical engineering profession and the chemical process industries, has a
strong ongoing interest in the results of the projects, selects researchers
competitively, and administers projects under contract with the researchers
doing the work.
