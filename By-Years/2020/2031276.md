Bacterial pathogens and their toxins are the most common causes of foodborne
illnesses. Detecting pathogenic bacterial contaminants in complex matrices
(e.g., fresh produce) is an essential step to ensure food safety. One of the
major challenges for detecting those contaminants lies in the lack of rapid and
ultrasensitive detection methods. This multidisciplinary project aims to develop
innovative biosensors that can rapidly and accurately screen a large number of
samples for pathogenic contaminants. This project is integrated with outreach
activities offered through the STEMette Summer Camp and Engineering High School
Day to introduce K-12 students to the state-of-the-art biosensor technology. In
addition, new course modules based on the results of this project are
incorporated into existing undergraduate and graduate courses at both the
University of Missouri and Rice University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
includes three research objectives: (1) design a clustered, regularly
interspaced, short palindromic repeats-associated system (CRISPR-Cas) to detect
foodborne bacterial pathogens, (2) develop an ultrasensitive SERS system in a
microfluidic device, and (3) integrate CRISPR with SERS in the microfluidic
device for rapid, ultrasensitive, and selective detection of foodborne bacterial
pathogens. This research discovers, contributes to, and supplements the
fundamental understanding of essential principles for engineering CRISPR-based
next-generation biosensors. By coupling CRISPR with SERS, this study also
creates a new sensing mechanism that has the potential to achieve detection with
single-copy sensitivity and single-base selectivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
