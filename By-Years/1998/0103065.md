This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to Clemson University is
cofunded by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS), and Design, Manufacturing and
Industrial Innovations (ENG), and is part of the Nanoscale Science and
Engineering program. Under this project, George Chumanov will develop novel
techniques to simultaneously synthesize and assemble silver nanoparticles in
multidimensional structures with nanoscale spacing. Monodispersed silver
nanoparticles with tunable optical properties will be formed by liquid droplet
formation and hydrogen reduction with electrostatic focusing for particle
transport and assembly on different substrates. This electrostatic focusing
method could develop a new bench-top technology for routine particle deposition
in the nanometer range and spacing. In addition, the research project will
provide education and training opportunities to undergraduate students in the
assembly, processing and characterization of nano particles with specialized
optical properties.

Under the award, novel monodispersed silver nanoparticles with tunable optical
properties will be formed by liquid droplet formation and hydrogen reduction.
Electrostatic focusing will be used to transport and assemble nanoparticles on
different substrates. These multidimensional regular arrays of nanoparticles are
expected to be robust, and could be used in next generation photonic and
optoelectronic devices. The method once fully developed could provide a bench-
top procedure for routine nanoparticle deposition.
