&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund a replacement scintillation counter for
Operation SWAB. The SWAB Program is operated by the University of Miami as part
of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
support infrastructure. The request includes one item:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)
Replacement Scintillation Counter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-
funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers. The SWAB program, in particular,
with it's broad application to all vessels in the academic fleet, allows for
safe and radioactively "clean" work environments for research.
