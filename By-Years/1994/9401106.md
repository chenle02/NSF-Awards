9401106 Ye The scope of the research centers around the study of classes of
geometric evolution equations. The equations in question characterize flow
systems relating to Ricci curvature, Yang-Mills gradient and harmonic maps as
some of the types. It is also intended to outline constructions of Einstein
metrics on manifolds in certain cases. The research may have potential
applications to gauge theory and general relativity theory in mathematical
physics. ***
