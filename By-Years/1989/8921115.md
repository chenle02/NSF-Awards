This is a Phase II SBIR project to develop a new type of isolation technique for
reduction of structural response during earthquake excitations. The new
isolation system is known as the Friction Pendulum System (FPS) which uses steel
connections to achieve a pendulum motion of the support structure in small
amplitudes. This concept represents a simple yet highly effective way for
seismic isolation. Engineering and design considerations as identified in the
Phase I research which was satisfactorily conducted, will be investigated.
Laboratory tests of prototype FPS isolators and building models will be carried
out. The effects of the unique and advantageous features of the FPS on building
seismic response will be evaluated. The applicability of the FPS to different
types of new and existing buildings will be studied. The successful completion
of this project will demonstrate that the FPS can substantially improve the
earthquake resistance of new and existing buildings, without an increase in
costs. Because of the inherent simplicity and versatility of the FPS concept,
this new isolation system could become a major tool for the seismic resistant
design of constructed facilities.
