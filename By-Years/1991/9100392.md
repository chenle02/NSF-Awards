The research to be carried out under this award is divided into three parts.
Part A is concerned with problems of estimation and prediction for time series
models whose theory is not fully understood. These include nonlinear, heavy
tailed and non-Gaussian processes, all of which play an important role in the
modelling of real time series data. The second Part deals with extreme value
theory, and the application of ideas from point processes to analysis of linear,
bilinear and generally stationary processes. Results of the second part will
help in a better analysis of the first part. Part C is concerned with processes
arising in the modelling of storage systems and population growth.
