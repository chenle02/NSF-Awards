Abstract

Award: DMS-0556398 Principal Investigator: Alan D. Weinstein

We propose to support travel to Japan for US participants (primarily graduate
students and postdocs) at the conference Poisson 2006, to be held in Tokyo June
5-9, preceded by a preparatory "school" of three days in length. The aim of the
meeting, whose full title is "Poisson Geometry in Mathematics and Physics," is
to bring together mathematicians and mathematical physicists with common
interests in Poisson geometry and its applications. With roots in classical
mechanics about 200 years ago and work of Sophus Lie about a century ago, the
subject of Poisson geometry crystallized through work of Lichnerowicz and
Kirillov in the 1970's. Its influence now extends to a wide variety of areas,
including symplectic geometry and topology, deformation theory, representation
theory, algebraic geometry, integrable hamiltonian systems, and field theory.

Speakers at the school and conference have been chosen not only for the
importance of their results but also for their ability to communicate them to a
broad audience of mathematicians and physicists. Proceedings will be published
in a manner which makes them accessible at low (or no) cost to a wide
readership, in order to stimulate further study and research in the rapidly
growing area of Poisson geometry.
