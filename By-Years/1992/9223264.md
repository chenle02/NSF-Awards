The proposed workshop (in mid-September 1992 in Fortaleza and Florianopolis,
Brazil) will develop a major focus of the research agenda for the Inter-American
Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) -- ENSO and interannual climate
variability. In particular, the workshop will (1) identify issues related to the
application of forecasts of seasonal-to-interannual climate variability to the
decision-making process at national and regional levels and (2) define methods
through which such forecasts can most effectively be applied to these processes.
The workshop is expected to develop recommendations for developing a systematic
flow of global climate forecasts to decision-makers at national and regional
levels. The workshop is also expected to identify needs for education and
training in this area and to prepare of recommendations for addressing these
needs. The workshop will focus on two specific regions -- the drought-affected
region of northeastern Brazil and the tropical and sub-tropical regions of
southeastern South America which have been impacted by ENSO.
