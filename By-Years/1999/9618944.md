The Soviet administrative-command economy was the greatest social science
experiment of this century. The dismantling of this system will be the greatest
economic and political challenge of the next quarter century. It is therefore
important to understand this system before it disappears or threatens to return.
The purpose of this research is to study the working arrangements of the Soviet
administrative-command economy from the 1930s to 1991 using the newly accessible
archives of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the
archives of its associated party and state organizations, personal archives of
Party and state leaders, and more than 60 accumulated interviews with Soviet
economic administrators conducted by the PI at the end of the Soviet period.
This research uses theories of information economics, public choice, and
theories of bureaucracy to study high-level decision making in the Soviet
administrative-command economy. It addresses the fundamental issue of the
viability of the administrative command economy raised by Hayek and Mises in the
1920s. It is one of the first in-depth studies of working arrangements above the
level of the Soviet enterprise. It would be the first to use the actual records
of the highest echelons of the Soviet Party and State to describe how and how
well the Soviet administrative-command economy worked. This project seeks to
answer a number of research questions: How the top Soviet leadership dealt with
the greater concentration of information at the periphery, how planners'
preferences were formed, the quality of information upon which high-level
decisions were based, the size of the party's apparatus, the use of monetary
versus physical targets, the formation of interest groups, the toleration of
criticism and dissent, principal/agent problems and identification of the levels
at which agents can be distinguished from principals, the factors behind the
choice of radical reform in the 1980s, and risk avoidance behavior.
