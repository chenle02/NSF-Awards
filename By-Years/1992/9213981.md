Bradley University with participation and support form major educational
institutions and industry, and a strong working partnership with CICNet, the
state of Illinois Central Management Services (CMS), and with considerable
networking experience within its member shop, is prepared to develop the
necessary technical and organizational infrastructure to establish and operate
this network known as netIllinois. This network with its connection to regional
and national networks, will support partnerships, consortia, and multi-
disciplinary research activities; it will also enable statewide access t
computing resources, databases, library information electronic mail and
messaging capabilities. Specific emphasis will be given to Illinois-based
information resources and research opportunities. The educational institutions
that will participate include: Western Illinois Univ., Eastern Illinois Univ.,
Governors State Univ., Northeastern Illinois Univ., Chicago State Univ., Wheaton
College, Illinois Benedictine Col., Olivet Nazarine Col., Elmhurst Col., College
of DuPage, and Illinois Valley Community College. The network will provide a
consistent statewide architecture for NSFNET access for a broad variety of
entities engaged in education and research. This cooperative network will
provide gateways to regional, national, and international networks and will be
consistent with their standards. It will further the institutions' work in
enhancing the state's economic development through a well-educated workforce,
accessible training opportunities, and research and development partnerships.
Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing
of resources between institutions, including those outside the state.***
