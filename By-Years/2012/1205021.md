The South Texas Aviation Maintenance Technician Education Project (STAMP) by Del
Mar College, a Minority and Hispanic Serving Institution, is to improve
technician education in aviation maintenance technology (AMT) and avionics in
community colleges and four-year institutions. Activities include development of
Web-enabled, interactive educational materials; professional development for AMT
educators; and recruitment and retention of students for AMT associate degree
programs and transfer to a baccalaureate aviation sciences program. STAMP
partner institutions include five Texas community colleges: Del Mar College
(lead), Midland College, Tarrant County College, Texas State Technical College-
Waco, and Texas State Technical College-West Texas, and a four-year institution
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (Daytona Beach, FL). The project will work
closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure that the AMT
curriculum aligns well with the FAA certification requirements to meet the job
market needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project disseminates the interactive
Web-based modules to community college AMT programs across Texas, and eventually
to AMT programs nationally through the National Center for Aerospace and
Transportation Technologies, reaching a potential 14,000 AMT students annually.
The modules, developed using modern practices, expedite and improve certified
aviation technician preparation for a more consistently educated technical
workforce. The project shares best practices for successful recruiting
strategies to bring more diverse students and veterans into AMT programs, which
increases the number of students underrepresented in AMT, particularly women and
Hispanic students.
