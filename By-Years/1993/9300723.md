9300723 Cohen This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral
Dissertation Research program. This questionnaire study of 100 product
development teams, uses an open systems framework to examine the effects of
organizational structure and team processes on team effectiveness. Hypotheses to
be tested concern the dependence of the teams on the organizations, uncertainty
characterizing work of the teams, differences between teams and organizations
with respect to institutional environments, problems at the team-organization
interface, and mechanisms that facilitate relations between team and
organization. This study will test a number of hypotheses about teams of workers
within larger organizations, thus contributing both to scientific knowledge in
the fields of small group relations and formal organizations and to the
productivity of American industry. In addition to the scientific gains to be
achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes
to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the
next generation of sociologists. ***
