This is a Research Opportunities for Women-Research Planning Grant. The purpose
of the research is to perform a feasibility study on the applicability of the
existing expert system to the industrial user. The ease of use, and ability of
the system to recognize quality perturbations in industrial settings is to be
determined. If the results of the feasibility study indicate that sufficient
potential exists for use of the expert system in selected industries, the model
is to be enhanced and refined to incorporate industrial data so that output
quality may be significantly improved so that American industries can compete
more effectively in a world market.
