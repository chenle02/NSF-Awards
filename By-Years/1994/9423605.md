This award is for support for a two year study to deternine the surface area and
effect on energy balance of lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet. The objectives of
the work are to determine the concentration of lakes, snow, and ice on parts of
the Greenland ice sheet which experience vigorous summer melting, and to
incorporate these concentrations into an energy balance calculation. The
concentrations of lakes, snow, and ice will be determined by using satellite
passive microwave data, with a method similar to that now routinely used for
determining sea ice concentrations and types. Satellite synthetic aperture radar
and AVHRR data will serve as auxiliary sources of information about the ice
sheet, for location of general areas in which lakes form, and for use in
determining microwave characteristics of the ground surface. The effect of lake
formation on energy balance in the lake region of the ice sheet will be
determined by extending and applying a surface energy balance model.
