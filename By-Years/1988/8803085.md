This research is in arithmetic algebraic geometry, the bridge area between
number theory and algebraic geometry. Adolphson will continue his research on
exponential sums and their associated L-functions. Wright will continue his
research on the distribution of discriminants of global fields, on the basic
theory of zeta functions associated to representations and on the use of his
combinatorial code for the boundary of the Teichmuller space of once punctured
tori in Maskit's embedding to prove Bers' conjecture on the density of cusps.
Cogdell will investigate connections between zeta functions of prehomogeneous
type and metaplectic forms. Yukie, the postdoctoral associate, will study
geometric invariant theory, algebraic groups, and Shintani's zeta functions.
