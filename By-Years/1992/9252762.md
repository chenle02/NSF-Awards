Heritage College and Seattle University jointly conduct a four-week summer
commuter/residential mathematics and physics camp for ethnic/racial minority
girls entering the eighth grade, with follow-up activities throughout the
subsequent academic year. The targeted populations are Native American and
Hispanic girls from the agricultural Toppenish area, and African-American girls
from the urban neighborhoods near Seattle University. The program, which
involves 50 participants each summer in the summers of 1992-1994, serves
students who are able and well-motivated but who might well lose interest in
science and mathematics without special attention. Activities include: 1) small
group daily interactive activities and experiments at each campus site on topics
such as fluid flows, waves, and water quantity and quality, supplemented by
field trips and guest scientists, primarily women; and 2) field experiments at a
residential lakeside science camp.
