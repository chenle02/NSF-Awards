The College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, is
developing a program for six underrepresented undergraduate engineering students
to pursue doctoral degrees. To meet the objectives of the program the College's
Women and Graduate Minority Program will actively recruit underrepresented
students, assist them in the application process, and award Graduate Engineering
Education Fellowships in accordance with selection guidelines. Graduate
Engineering Education Fellows will be place in research throughout the College
in areas in which the nation faces growing and critical needs, but where the
supply of new doctorates is inadequate.
