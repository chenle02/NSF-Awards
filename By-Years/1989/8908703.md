Drs. James Zeidler and Deborah Pearsall will collaborate for two seasons of
fieldwork at the site of San Isidro which is located in the Jama drainage in
northern Ecuador. They will continue to excavate at the site and also extend
their survey of the surrounding region. San Isidro contains a large, centrally
located earthen mound which suggests that it functioned as a regional ceremonial
and administrative center. The site's size and monumental architecture imply the
existence of surplus production capable of supporting a dense population, and
materials recovered to date suggest that San Isidro was a major point of
external contact and commodity flow both along the coast of Ecuador and between
the coast and the highlands. The research team will excavate large blocks within
the site to reconstruct settlement history and determine how it changed over
time. Continued survey and test excavation at other sites will allow extension
of this pattern to a regional level. Particular emphasis will be placed on
subsistence technology and an attempt will be made to reconstruct the
agricultural system. The goal of the research is to study the process of
demographic growth as well as change in subsistence and the accompanying
development of cultural complexity which took place in this tropical area of
northern Ecuador. Although such complex societies arose in the tropics, many
times, in different parts of the world, the underlying processes are not well
understood. This research will allow the testing of different models. While
Ecuador is known to be rich in prehistoric remains, little archaeological
research has been conducted there. This project will help to remedy that
situation.
