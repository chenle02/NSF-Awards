Tomographic techniques, applied to ionospheric imaging, have provided many
simulation studies to learn the nature of artifacts when reconstructions are
based on imperfect data. Scientists have also developed techniques to use
subsidiary ionospheric information to increase the accuracy of reconstructions.
Finally, validation measurements have enhanced confidence in these tomographic
techniques. These data, though, have been obtained mainly in campaign mode;
hence, they aren't suitable for long-term behavior studies, needed to improve
understanding of ionospheric weather. One chain, known as the Low-latitude
Ionospheric Tomography Network (LITN), covers the whole northern equatorial
anomaly region. The PI now gleans a set of LITN data, showing prominently the
equatorial anomaly. This feature, changing day by day, moves to a lower
geomagnetic latitude with altitude, demonstrating typical equatorial ionospheric
weather. The anomaly is tied intimately to the dynamo electric field through a
fountain effect, so the PI can also study this phenomenon. In all, mining the
LITN database is enhancing understanding of equatorial region ionospheric
weather.
