Jason Curtis is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Columbia
University. Using observations from ground- and space-based telescopes, Curtis
will study the relationship between magnetic activity and rotation of stars and
how this relationship changes with age. Because stars change very little over
most of their lifetimes, determining their ages is challenging, but it is
essential for understanding planets around other stars. Curtis will also conduct
an annual data science workshop in basic computing, statistical, and data
analysis methods for the participants of a program that prepares
underrepresented minority students for graduate school; and he will serve as
research mentor to one student from this program.

The proposed research will address stellar ages with a two-pronged observational
program: (1) Curtis will analyze rotation data for 3 GYr stars down to 0.39
Solar masses from his ongoing survey of Ruprecht 147 with the Kepler space
telescope, to calibrate gyrochronology relations at low mass at older ages. The
Kepler survey also will yield asteroseismic measurements for dwarfs in this
benchmark star cluster. Comparison of the red giant asteroseismic masses and FGK
dwarf rotation sequences between the similarly aged NGC 6819 and R147 will
demonstrate the precision and relative accuracy of each method; and (2) Curtis
has initiated a large chromospheric activity survey of middle-aged star clusters
with the Multi Mirror Telescope (MMT) to establish an activity-age relationship
that is applicable to K dwarfs. As part of his education plan, Curtis will be
integrated into Columbia University's Bridge to the Ph.D Program to (1) conduct
an annual data science workshop series that will instruct Bridge Participants in
basic computing, statistical methods, and data analysis with Python (materials
from the workshop will be incorporated in a Data Science Primer for
Astronomers); and (2) supervise one Bridge Participant's research, which will
focus on measuring 3 GYr M dwarf rotation.
