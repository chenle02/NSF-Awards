Abstract Driver The principal investigator proposes to continue the development
of integral and differential analysis on pinned and free loop groups. This
proposal is centered around the investigation of the "heat kernel" measure on
the loop group rather than the more standard pinned Wiener measure. However, the
P.I. does plan to investigate the relationship between these two measures. The
specific issues proposed to investigate by the P.I. are: (i) analytic properties
of the differential operator on forms on the loop group (relative to the heat
kernel measure) (ii) the Hodge-de Rham theorem for the loop group, iii) the
relationship between the heat kernel measures on the loop group and pinned
Wiener measure, iv) the relationship between the heat kernel logarithmic Sobolev
inequality and Gross' pinned Wiener measure logarithmic Sobolev inequality, v)
Meyer type inequalities on the loop group with the heat kernel measure, and vi)
the loop group analogue of the "Taylor series" isomorphism considered by the
P.I. and the P.I. and L. Gross. The P.I.'s work is centered on integral and
differential analysis of "infinite" dimensional spaces consisting of closed
curves in a finite dimensional space. Roughly speaking, the sort of questions
studied by the P.I. are analogous to the following "more" familiar examples in
every day life: what are the frequencies you hear when plucking a guitar string,
what is the temperature of a bent metal plate at some time given knowledge of
the temperature at an earlier time, and how do substances diffuse inside regions
with varying permeability and shape? One of the motivations for studying the
infinite dimensional versions of these questions comes from the study of quantum
field theories, a certain class of mathematical theories used by physicists to
describe sub-atomic particles. Quantum field theories deal with the same issues
alluded to above and are closely related to the mathematical theories studied by
the P.I.. The P.I.'s work may in fact ha ve future ramifications for quantum
field theories and hence particle physics.
