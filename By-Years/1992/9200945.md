Two problems of mid-ocean ridge structure and tectonics have been investigated
by the PI: the mechanism of sub-ridge mantle diapirism, and the controls on
normal fault evolution at a ridge. He has shown that depletion-related density
variations alone are an unlikely cause of mantle diapirism, but that buoyancy
resulting from melting and melt percolation through mantle upwelling below a
ridge can lead to diapirism. Further work is proposed to look at the role of
melt related viscosity in this prosess. The mantle conditions needed to explain
observations of crustal thickness variations along the EPR, in contract to those
along the MAR, will be considered. The results about the mechanisms of normal
faulting will be applied to the problem of ridge tectonics.
