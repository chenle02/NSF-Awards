9973154 Martin This project involves research by a cultural anthropologist from
Princeton University into the recent shift of opinion in American culture about
the cognitive or emotional lability associated with Attention
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHP) and manic-depression. The project
investigates the change in popular culture from seeing such lability as a defect
towards seeing it as a talent that is adaptive in the contemporary social and
economic environment of intense global competition. The need for rapid and
flexible adjustment to changing conditions in the workplace, schools and
communities may be supporting the more positive views of aspects of ADHD-type
personalities. Using historical and ethnographic methods, the researcher will
investigate these issues in neuroscience research laboratories, psychiatric
clinics, patient support groups, schools and worker training programs, and
pharmaceutical corporations. The research will take place in three sites: Orange
county, California, Baltimore County, Maryland, and central New Jersey to cover
a broad range of American society. By addressing the changing meaning of mental
illness and disability in the context of other social and cultural processes
that are changing, the research will contribute to making these highly
stigmatized conditions seem more ordinary and understandable. This should lead
to greater tolerance for people who suffer from the illness, as well as greater
understanding of how the image of an "ideal person" is changing in contemporary
American culture.
