The Fellow will examine the degree of which natural amphibolite- grad
metamorphic rocks have been infiltrated by external fluids during prograde P-T
evolution. The critical tools are modeling and measurement of oxygen isotope
zonation in garnets whose cation zonation and P-T paths are well determined. The
measured isotopic variation in garnets and inclusion phases will there be
compared with that predicted by the closed system models to determine whether
the rocks have been infiltrated by an extensional fluid of different isotopic
signature. The Fellows' host institution will be the University of Wisconsin,
Madison.
