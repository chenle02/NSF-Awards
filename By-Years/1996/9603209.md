9603203 Shinozuka This award supports the participation of American
scientists/engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Civil Infrastructure Systems
Research to be held in Hawaii from April 1-3, l997. The co-organizers are
Professors Masanobu Shinozuka of the University of Southern California and
Makoto Watabe of Keio University in Japan. This seminar will provide a forum for
identifying and comparing common issues, for promoting cooperative research
between the two nations and formulating action plans involving the following
themes of study; science of aging and deterioration, health monitoring and
condition assessment, renewal engineering, socio-economic issues, institutional
effectiveness and productivity, and research coordination. Civil infrastructure
systems (CIS) provide the societies' basic ability to transport people and
goods, to deliver clean water, electric power, gas and liquid fuel, to
facilitate communications, to mitigate the impact of natural disasters, and to
serve many other functions for the enhancement of the welfare and freedom of the
general public. Accelerating rapid growth of the societal activities and
resulting demand for CIS is suppressing the rate of new construction and
retrofitting of existing CIS. Both the U.S. and Japan share common problems of
CIS and are in need of cost-effective strategies for planning, design,
construction, maintenance and retrofit of their respective CISs. The exchange of
ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants
to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative
projects. ***
