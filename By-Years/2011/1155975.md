Proposal Number: EPS-1155975 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: EPSCoR 2030
Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: West Virginia Higher Education Policy
Commission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to conduct a
workshop with representatives from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the
EPSCoR community, and recognized leaders of industrial and legislative bodies
from both EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR jurisdictions. This workshop, entitled EPSCoR
2030, will be a timely follow-up to the ?EPSCoR 2020: Expanding State
Participation in Research in the 21st Century ? A New Vision for EPSCoR?
workshop held in 2006 and seeks to review progress on recommendations from
EPSCoR 2020 and make needed adjustments. In addition, EPSCoR 2030 seeks to
continue the dialogue with NSF on a shared understanding of EPSCoR goals and
metrics and the most effective actions to enhance research competitiveness
nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The EPSCoR 2030
Workshop will provide NSF senior management with recommendations for increasing
the quality and broadening the scope of research in EPSCoR jurisdictions, for
more effectively developing and utilizing their science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent over the next decade, and for better
targeting available funding to those jurisdictions for which the EPSCoR program
can provide the largest incremental benefit to their research infrastructure.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Recommendations from the workshop are
expected to prompt sustainable improvements in physical, human, and cyber
infrastructure with EPSCoR jurisdictions as well as broader collaborative
activities leading to collective solutions to challengers of regional and
national importance.
