The principal investigator's preliminary analysis of Geosat altimetry
observations reveal an abrupt change in mid-ocean ridge axis gravity with
spreading rate that is more pronouced than the topographic variations. below a
spreading rate of 60-70 mm/yr the ridge-axis gravity signature has high
amplitudes and is variable where as above this rate the gravity depends upon
both the topography and the compensation mechanism, the abrupt change in the
gravity signature must signify an abrupt change in the isostatic compensation
mechanism, there being no abrupt change in the topography. The principal
investigator's interpretation is that there are two dynamically distinct modes
of seafloor spreading. This work will address the problem of ridge-axis
morphology and its variation with spreading rate, crustal thinckness, and mantle
temperature from both a modeling and observational stand point. The objectives
are to develop a quantitative model of ridge-axis dynamics which in corporates a
realistic non-linear flowlaw as well as a rheologically distinct crust and
mantle to characterize ridge exis/flank gravity and ridge axis/flanktopography
in terms of spreading rate, crustal thickness and inferred mantle temperature,
and, by comparing model gravity/topography with observations, to establish the
role of the weak lower crustal layer in the transition between spreading types.
