The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps team project includes
possible commercialization of new, selective catalysts that provide safer and
more efficient production of chemicals and chemical products from petrochemical
and renewable feedstocks at lower cost, with less chemical waste, and with lower
energy requirements. Catalysts are substances that dramatically increase
reaction rates for desired products. In many cases, commercial production of a
chemical product is not possible without the use of a catalyst. Approximately
90% of all chemical production requires the use of a catalyst in at least one
step of the production process. This includes the production of bulk chemicals,
plastics and polymers, synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, agricultural
chemicals, fuels, and chemicals used in consumer products and in the food
industry. The need for new catalysts that are more selective and provide more
efficient chemical production at lower cost spans all sectors of the chemical
industry.

This I-Corps project focuses on a unique family of patented constrained geometry
ligands and metal catalysts that have potential applications in several of the
market segments of the chemical industry. Development of this technology for
specific applications is in the preliminary stages, but basic proof-of-concept
of proprietary constrained geometry catalyst production has been demonstrated
and patent coverage has been obtained. Based on initial customer interviews, the
team will focus on evaluating customer needs in the polymer, rubber, and
petroleum refining segments of the chemical industry. Specifically, the team
will explore customer needs for more selective, more active, and less expensive
catalysts for conversion of petrochemical and renewable feedstocks to polymers
and other value-added products.
