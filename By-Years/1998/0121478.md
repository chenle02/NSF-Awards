Mechanisms allow individuals with dispersed information to achieve desired group
outcomes. Experiments confirm theoretical predictions that different parameter
values and different mechanism rules can have important effects on the
efficiency of outcomes and the speed of convergence. A computer-based behavioral
model will be developed to test a wide range of mechanisms and institutions. The
model is to be based on evolutionary algorithms. Each smart agent has a
collection of different strategies to use in its decision-making processes.
Strategies compete for the right to make agent decisions through a selection
process based on an evaluation of each strategy's hypothetical and actual
performance. The model will first be tuned with mechanisms for which there are
significant experimental data. Examples include the Groves-Ledyard mechanism,
the voluntary contribution mechanism for public goods, the double auction, and
simultaneous trading in a set of parallel markets. Then the model will be used
to make predictions about behavior under those mechanisms that have not already
been tested in experiments with human subjects. This project will develop a new
methodology for economics research that has potential to be better, faster, and
cheaper than experimental economics.
