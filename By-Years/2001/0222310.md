This CAREER grant seeks funding for a systematic research program aimed at
investigating the root causes of the underachievement of African American
students in science. An important part of this project will be to use the
research findings to propose and field test classroom intervention programs
aimed at enabling teachers to help African American Students improvement their
achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work builds on that of Ogbu who has
written extensively on the question of academic performance of minority students
in American schools. A specific research question is how the performance of
these students in science is affected by their language use. Both quantitative
and qualitative research methods will be used. Individual students and teachers
as well as classrooms will be used as units of analysis&lt;br/&gt;
