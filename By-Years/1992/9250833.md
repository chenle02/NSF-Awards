An advanced laboratory course in Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience introduces
cellular and molecular neuroscience laboratory into the curriculum, a new field
of concentration at the undergraduate level. Laboratory exercises focus on
experimental design rather than on techniques per se. Students explore current
concepts of cellular and molecular neuro- biological research in three different
tissues: cardiac, neuronal and skeletal. Techniques explored include tissue
culture, receptor binding analysis, molecular biology including northern blots,
and microscopic analysis of specific cells. The equipment is also integrated
into related courses in the Biology Department and used by students for
undergraduate research projects.
