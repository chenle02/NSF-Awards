Abstract ATM-9713572 DeGaetano, Arthur T. Cornell University Title: An Empirical
and Dynamical Evaluation of the Interannual Variability of East Coast Winter
Storms This proposal aims to understand the temporal variability of east coast
winter storms and identify the climatological mechanisms that influence the
frequency and severity of these storm systems, AN objective climatology of east
coast winter storms will be developed using automated procedure. Frequency, year
to year variability, strength and possibly impacts of these storms will be
studied. Because the U.S. east coast is heavily populated, the successful
completion of this work could lead to large societal benefits.
