Three closely connected areas of violin acoustics are studied. They all strive
to enhance our understanding of the transient behavior and lack of exact
periodicity of musical notes played on bowed strong instruments. Of particular
importance is the dynamics of the bow and the related issues of transients and
responsiveness of the violin to the bow. The investigation uses both computer
analysis and an experimental apparatus to achieve these goals. Collaborations
with Dr. J. Woodhouse of Cambridge University and the use of the Pittsburgh
Supercomputer Center support the investigation.
