9320692 Nieves Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on
the behavior of neutrinos when they are inside a material medium. Topics will
include the propagation, evolution, and electromagnetic properties of neutrinos
in media. This work is very important to our understanding of the behavior of
neutrinos in ordinary stars and in supernova explosions. ***
