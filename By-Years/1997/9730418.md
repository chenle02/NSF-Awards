Riser/Pillsbury 9730939/9730418 The rate of exchange of water between the
Okhotsk Sea and the N. Pacific will be quantified by deploying two moorings
instrumented with current meters, temperature/salinity recorders, and Acoustic
Doppler Current Profilers in the Bussol Strait for a two-year period. In
addition, four bottom pressure gauges will be deployed in the strait. These
observations will be complemented by a similar mooring array and CTD
observations by Japanese scientists.
