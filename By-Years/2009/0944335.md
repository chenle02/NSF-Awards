Based on the NSF-funded design study of the High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz
(HEAT) telescope and successful deployment of its prototype at Dome A, this
proposal seeks funding to build a fully automated, 0.6-meter THz astronomical
observatory for remote operation at the highest location on the Antarctic
Plateau (Ridge A, ~200 km south of the Chinese summer station Kunlun). The HEAT
telescope will cover the 158 to 372 microns band observing the brightest
spectral lines from the Milky Way Galaxy in which the most crucial astrophysical
spectral diagnostics of the formation of galaxies, stars, planets, and life are
found. The telescope will be mounted on top of the Australian University of New
South Wales' PLATeau Observatory (PLATO) module that provide housing for the
instrument's electronics and diesel engines used to generate electrical power
during winter observations. The PLATO and telescope will operate autonomously
for over a year at a time, with commands and data being received and transmitted
from/to the home institutions via Iridium satellites daily. It is expected that
HEAT will see good atmospheric transmission above the 200-microns band during
much of the winter, and usable transmission in the pivotal 160 microns window
will be seen for more than 10% of the wintertime. The Ridge A site is
undeveloped but may actually be the driest, calmest, and clearest point on the
Dome A summit. Thus, the proposed telescope will test this site while obtaining
important astronomical spectral data and forging entirely new capabilities for
ground-based infrared and submillimeter astronomy that otherwise would be
unachievable except via expensive airborne or space-based platforms. This
pioneering mission will pave the way for future astronomical investigations from
the Antarctic Plateau and other potential high-altitude sites around the World.
The proposed project contributes to the education of a graduate student, thus
helping to grow a generation of young researchers in the field of astronomy.
