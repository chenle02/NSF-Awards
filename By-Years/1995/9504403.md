9504403 Komvopoulos The adhesion and microtribological phenomena of relevance to
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) will be studied. Special micromechanical
devices will be constructed to allow measurement of the very minute forces
involved. Emphasis will be given to the study of high friction leading to
sticking during operation of micromachines due to capillary, van der Waals, and
electrostatic force effects. The experimental studies will be supplemented with
molecular dynamics simulations of normal and sliding contacts to analyze the
dependence of friction on lattice parameters, direction and speed of motion, and
temperature. From indentation measurements constitutive relations will be
developed for evaluation of the tribological results. ***
