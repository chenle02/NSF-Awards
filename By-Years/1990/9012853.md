This project consists of three parts: (1) the study of perfect competition in
the context of large assignment models; (2) the development of a general
equilibrium model of bankruptcy and collateral with applications to financial
markets; and (3) the development of an extended notion of equilibrium in
extensive form games with continuous action spaces. This research contributes a
powerful new theory of competition, general insights into the impact of
bankruptcy on financial markets and new insights into ways of solving a class of
bargaining problems found frequently in economics. The work on characterizing
competition in large assignment problems is especially exciting because it could
lead to a new way of conceptualizing competition that would capture as special
cases such widely used criteria as non manipulability of prices and the
appropriation of agents' marginal contributions. The assignment model has a rich
history as a laboratory for the development of important new theories such as
linear programming and core theory. Past work by the investigator and his
collaborators suggests that their study of the uniqueness of equilibrium prices
in large assignment models could provide another new, powerful analytical tool
for economic theory.
