Security concerns increasingly shape local as well as transnational debates. The
research supported by this award examines how these debates affect
understandings of the role of the family. Family cultures are usually understood
to be rooted in particular practices and places, but efforts to securitize the
family in crisis contexts may take on common characteristics. Therefore, to
understand what is happening in the United States, a comparative perspective is
required. This project leverages ethnography's unique capacity for combining
deep listening with social analysis to better understand the conceptualizations
and concerns that motivate family-focused security
movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will take place primarily in
Mexico, with shorter trips to other sites where security crises and significant
family movements have emerged in recent years. The researcher will collect data
through archival research to trace the history of these movements; textual
analyses of media accounts; participant observation at multiple sites and across
organizational scales; interviews; social network analysis; and GIS and timeline
mapping of the global circulation of ideas about the family. These data will be
analyzed to understand the historical, cultural, and geopolitical significance
of individual family movement cases and how they connect to larger transnational
developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
