The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the
wearable device market. The customer discovery process will provide critical
data to determine the wireless charging needs for medical professionals,
patients, nurses, first responders, and other users who may use wearable
devices. The wearable market is expected to be $58B by 2022. Specifically, the
technology will impact patients and the most marginalized groups such as the
elderly and infants by providng wireless charging to their body-worn devices. It
will also allow military/defense personnel to stay on duty while their body-worn
communication devices and tactical gear are continuously charged.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will advance an innovative wearable
technology approach combining textile-based radio-frequency (RF) modules and
antennas for power harvesting. Implementation into a smart charging platform
provides power transmission via novel antenna topology and power management
circuitry suitable for the charging needs of wearable, medical, and Internet of
Things (IoT) devices. The proposed anchor-shaped antenna allows misalignment-
resilient power transfer for body wearable charging solutions. Combination of
the anchor antenna and high efficiency rectifier circuit provides a seamless
power collection and transmission method integrated into the upholstery of
surfaces (e.g. chair, couch, bedding). This system will charge gadgets, medical,
or military equipment and enable communication while charging through daily life
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
