Dr. Sulloway is continuing his research on why scientists accept or reject new
theories. Often scientists, in possession of the same relevant facts,
nevertheless take diametrically opposed viewpoints toward theoretical
innovations. The research design of this study, which is multivariate in nature,
seeks to assess the role of 80 different background factors in mediating how
several thousand scientists have responded to 30 highly diverse controversies in
the history of science. Under this grant, Dr. Sulloway is using questionnaire
data drawn from participants in three recent scientific controversies (cold
fusion, continental drift, and sociobiology) to illuminate the central role
played by patterns of identification with authority in mediating attitudes
toward innovation. This information provides a direct test of the hypothesis
that birth order, the single best predictor of the 80 considered in this study,
is a powerful mediator of identification with parents, and through parents, with
authority. He is also investigating the way in which scientists respond to novel
claims made on behalf of spurious, difficult-to-detect, or nonexistent
phenomena. By studying reactions to the "discovery" of N-rays and response to
the recent claims on behalf of "cold fusion," Dr. Sulloway is highlighting the
role that complex patterns of subjective influences can play in shaping
attitudes toward scientific innovation.
