The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an FT-NMR with multinuclear and
variable temperature capabilities for use throughout the undergraduate program.
The theory and practice of NMR starts with the first course in organic chemistry
and continues into upper-level courses in instrumental analysis, advanced
inorganic and physical chemistry. Students enrolled in these courses are using
the instrument to determine the structures of compounds prepared and isolated in
very small quantities, to measure the rates of fast reactions (millisecond
intermediate lifetimes), rotational barriers, and the characterization of
organometallic compounds. The instrument is also being used extensively by
students undertaking individual research investigations.
