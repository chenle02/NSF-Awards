Support is provided for the 1991 Gordon Conference, July 29-August 2, 1991. The
subject, development of microstructure and the processes that control it, is
part of the foundation of physical metallurgy. It is a continually evolving area
dependent on advanced characterization techniques, theoretical modeling and
analyses, and the stimulus of new and advanced materials. This conference zeros
in on the subject from a unified perspective. It ties together theoretical
modeling and analysis, ideal systems, real systems, and current limitations in
predictive capability and processing control. It is an ideal forum to discuss
the new NSF initiative on synthesis and processing, which has direct ties to
microstructure development.
