9420963 Lutz Wesley College proposes to network the entire campus and to provide
a link between the institution and powerful computing facilities worldwide using
SURAnet. This connection will also afford improved sharing of resources by and
with other educational institutions by providing connectivity with federal and
state agencies and institutions of higher education worldwide. The benefits of
the Internet connection include e-mail between local and remote researchers and
educators, file transfer capability and the ability to use remote computer
resources. Also Wesley College will have the ability to investigate innovation
in educational resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
