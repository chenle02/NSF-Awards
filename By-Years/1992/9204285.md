Fundamental research to investigate the formation of silicide and silicide-
germanide films on coherently strained Si and Si1-xGex films will be conducted.
Special features of the research are the ability to alter film-substrate strain
independently of film-substrate interfacial chemical composition; the direct
correlation of strain, independent of chemical factors, with thermodynamic and
electronic properties of the film-substrate couple; and, preliminary studies of
the chemistry and physics of formation of silicide or silicide-germanide
compounds from deposited metals reacted with Si1-xGexsubstrates. %%% This
research is expected to provide deeper fundamental understanding of basic
properties of thin films and interfaces critically important to the
functionality of electronic/photonic materials and particular compositional and
structural combinations and configurations relevant to devices and circuits.
From an application point of view, understanding these properties and their
relationship to materials synthesis and processing is highly beneficial to
semiconductor device design and fabrication. The results will be of importance
in a general way to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated
electronic and photonic devices and circuits.
