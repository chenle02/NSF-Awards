The investigator and his colleague atudy the computation of global attractors
and invariant manifolds for dissipative partial differential equations. Global
attractors are detected by interpolation of analytic (in complex time) rather
than direct simulations. The performance of this approach is connected to the
growth rate of solutions backward in time. Computations are carried out to
determine if a set of solutions with a particular rate is in fact a manifold.
Adaptations of a succesful contraction mapping algorthm for inertial manifolds
are made for center manifolds and foliations. Specific applications are made to
physical models including the Camassa-Holm, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-
Stokes equations, including issues from turbulence theory. This project concerns
a variety of mathematical equations describing such physical phenomena as
combustion, fluid flow, and turbulence. Part of the effort is to develop a
method to reliably determine whether a particular computed solution represents
permanent or merely temporary behavior. Another concerns the visualization of
geometric objects corresponding to distinguished sets of solutions, which
determine the ultimate behavior of the physical system. Though the work is
carried out for several specific, physically significant equations, it is
general enough to extend, in a natural way, to many others of a similar form,
including some modeling the weather.
