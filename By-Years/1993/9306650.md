9306650 Yin Phormia regina, the common black blowfly, has been used extensively
to study various aspects of biology from feeding behavior to egg development. It
is common knowledge that many adult insects need a protein meal before they can
develop eggs. What remains to be understood, however, is how this happens or,
more aptly put, "What is the link between nutrition and egg development."
Previous research by the group has shown that there is a midgut hormone that
provides this link. The current study is designed to purify and identify this
hormone. Once this has been done, a test will be developed permitting the
determination of the levels of this hormone in the insect's blood following a
protein meal. Finally, the PI will use another test to determine where this
hormone is produced and its site of action. The major significance of this
research is that this new hormone may provide a new and novel way to interfere
with and prevent egg development. Such a technique should serve as an exemplar
model for controlling egg development in other insects. ***
