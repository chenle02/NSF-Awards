9354440 Roy This project responds to a documented national need for enhanced
expertise in the area of materials synthesis and processing by developing two
courses on ceramic materials synthesis. The courses consist of lectures by
eminent scholars in the field of materials science and engineering which are
videotaped. The videotapes are available to other institutions, and each course
features a weekly one-hour call-in period for students to ask questions of the
lecturer. The videotapes are also to provide continuing education to faculty
members who act as tutors at remote sites where the courses are offered. This
approach is significant for faculty enhancement in fields where there is an
identified shortage of faculty with adequate expertise in the field. This is
true both of ceramics in general and ceramic materials synthesis in particular.
In addition to the videotapes, the tutors and students receive copies of
overhead transparencies, scripts, homework problems and solutions, and
examinations. The videotapes and instructional materials are disseminated by the
Materials Education Council located at the Pennsylvania State University.
