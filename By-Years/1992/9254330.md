The project is developing software to make computer-aided chemistry experiments
more accessible to students who have visual impairments. The software is to run
on an ordinary personal computer equipped with adapted outputs (synthetic
speech, electronic music, and enlarged text and graphics). Experimental data is
acquired through a modular data acquisition subsystem designed for use in
educational laboratories. Experiments for which software is being developed
include the instrumental methods commonly used in lower level chemistry courses,
and the software includes a data analysis package which enables visually
impaired students to perform extensive analysis on data acquired with the
system. The system and its software will be usable at any educational level
where instrumental measurements are performed, and should be readily adaptable
to disciplines other than chemistry.
