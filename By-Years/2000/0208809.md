The enormous growth in electronic commerce has led to an urgent need for the
protection and authentication of information, which now is stored and
transmitted in massive amounts. There is a multitude of applications where a
signal (typically audio, image or video) is to be communicated to a receiver,
along with information such as ownership identification or a timestamp
authenticating the signal. The communication channel on which the signal is
transmitted may be insecure, i.e., an adversary may modify the signal in such a
way that it can no longer be reliably authenticated. In some applications (e.g.,
wireless video transmission) the channel is considered to be insecure not due to
the presence of an adversary, but because of the significant degradations
introduced by the transmission medium. A secret message necessary for
authentication may be embedded in the signal (watermarking-based authentication)
or transmitted on a separate channel (hashing- based authentication). In
watermarking, the host data set is intentionally corrupted, but in a covert way,
designed to be imperceptible to a casual analysis. Hashing does not require the
signal to be modified, but requires the transmission of side information about
the signal (authentication tag) on a separate channel. Signal authentication
encompasses applications such as forgery detection and analysis, copyright
protection for digital media, copy control, fingerprinting (traitor tracing),
and database query and retrieval [1]|[30]. Watermarking and authentication are
now major activities in audio, image, and video processing, and standardization
efforts for JPEG-2000, MPEG-4, and Digital Video Disks are well underway.
Commercial products are being developed. Annual International Workshops on
information hiding have been held in 1996, and every year since 1998. Special
issues of major technical journals have recently been recently devoted to
information protection [31, 32, 33, 34], and comprehensive surveys of image and
multimedia watermarking techniques are available from [35, 36].
