Abstract

Award: DMS-0405281 Principal Investigator: Haydee Herrera

This research proposal focuses on the study of the topology of manifolds with
finite second homotopy group and the Differential Geometry of quaternionic-
Kaehler manifolds. The emphasis of the project is on the determination of
analytical and topological invariants of the manifolds, such as the signature,
A-roof-genus and elliptic genera. Following the evidence from our previous
research, we propose to apply the aforementioned theory to concrete Geometric
Analysis/Differential Geometry problems. Furthermore, this study has
applications to Algebraic Geometry (via twistor transform) and to Theoretical
Physics, since the manifolds under consideration are of interest in sigma models
and in String Theory.

My research interests are concerned with the study of certain spaces of large
dimension, called quaternion-Kaehler manifolds. In the quest for understanding
the universe, physicists have developed many and very sophisticated models, such
as Relativity Theory and more recently String Theory, that help explain and
predict phenomena observed in the Universe. One of the leading physicists of our
times, E. Witten, discovered that quaternion-Kaehler manifolds appear in the
formulation of certain Quantum Field Theories. My research focuses on finding
the possible shapes and properties of quaternion- Kaehler manifolds.
