The general theme of this research is to understand how sensory information is
encoded and processed in the central nervous system in order to generate
coordinated motor outputs. Dr. Christopher Comer will continue to study central
integration in a model system where the traffic of neural signals in the CNS can
be easily monitored, assigned to identified interneurons, and related to the
performance of a discrete and easily recorded behavioral act. Cockroaches evade
a predator's strike by turning away and then running. This orientating response
may be used as a model system to determine how signals are processed in the CNS
to control the occurrence and form of directional movement. Specific,
identifiable, giant interneurons in cockroaches which are wind-sensitive cells,
will be thoroughly examined electrophysiologically and anatomically for their
role in escape behavior. These studies will give us a more complete
understanding of how the nervous system encodes and communicates for escape and
startle responses.
