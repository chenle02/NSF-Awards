The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a super-efficient greenhouse system providing passive water
purification and accelerated water condensation technologies by recycling water
from transpiration. Irrigation for agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh
water representing approximately 87% of global fresh water consumption. In
particular, greenhouses lose roughly 90% of input water as vapor escaping
through ventilation systems. In theory, all lost water could be recycled to
realize great savings. However, recycling evaporated water is difficult in
practice because it requires the use of a passive technology to recycle ambient-
temperature vapor, particularly during the daytime. New technologies are
required to achieve moisture condensation for water harvesting during daytime
operation due to elevated temperatures from solar heating. The proposed
technology solution may enable water recovery under such conditions with reduced
energy requirements. Such a technology may support a more sustainable supply of
food by allowing for food production in regions where water is a non-renewable,
scare resource. Enhancement in agricultural water use efficiency is a promising
technology in order to enable urban consumption of water, with potential far-
reaching impact in arid areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
based on the development of a greenhouse system to recycle irrigation water
using sub-ambient cooling and water harvesting technologies. The key water
recycling mechanism is through radiative dew condensation, which is a passive
technique that does not consume electricity or fuel. Todayâ€™s known radiative dew
condensation techniques are low in efficiency. They are only effective during a
few hours in the night and the water collected quickly evaporates when the sun
rises. Using the proposed electricity-free radiative cooling technology, the aim
is to substantially boost the efficiency of dew condensation by permitting
operation during daytime. This may provide an inexpensive and sustainable
solution for providing fresh water more efficiently and effectively by recycling
formerly lost transpired water vapor in greenhouses. In addition, the technology
may allow the development of a super-efficient greenhouse system using passive
water purification using radiative cooling-accelerated water condensation
technologies to recycle water from transpiration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
