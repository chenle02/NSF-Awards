The use of mini-supercomputers provides theoreticans with computing performance
equal to that of large mainframe computers. Theoretical chemistry computations
give both a quantitative description of the energetics and rates of elementary
chemical reactions and also provides a qualitative understanding of the
fundamental factors governing chemical changes. Most of these studies would not
have been possible before the acquisition of the mini-supercomputer because the
cost on the central mainframe computers or the computer time required would have
been prohibitive. The applications of mini-computers are found in Theoretical
Studies of Chemical Reactions. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M
University to acquire a new departmental computer system. The areas of chemical
research that the acquisition will impact are the following: 1. Carbon-Hydrogen
Bond Activation and the Agostic Hydrogen 2. Electronic Structure in Solid State
Chemistry 3. Photon and Electron Induced Ionization of Molecules 4. Statistical
Mechanical Theories of Interfaces 5. The Development and Study of
Multiconfigurational Techniques for the Electronic Transitions of Molecules
