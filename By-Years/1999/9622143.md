9622143 Meier An engineering research equipment grant will support the
acquisition of a general purpose up-to-date precision ion milling polishing
system for preparation of electron transparent specimens for TEM and AP-FIM
observations. The equipment will be used in a number of research projects
related to high resolution studies of the microstructure of layered coatings,
environmental degradation, superconductivity, etc. ***
