Accessible, actionable, and relevant scientific knowledge holds promise for
providing significant societal benefits. However, identifying the mechanisms by
which such knowledge makes it way into the appropriate social entrepreneurship
and public policy streams remains a challenge. This workshop is to discuss and
develop a systematic approach for collecting, aggregating, and examining
information and experiences across sectors to develop an understanding of the
dynamics of successful social partnerships and devise strategies for effectively
channeling scientific knowledge into social policy.
