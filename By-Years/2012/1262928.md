This funding renews a highly successful CISE Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Houston. The theme of this site
is algorithm design and analysis focusing on real-time, parallel, data-intensive
problems in large-scale heterogeneous, and highly distributed modern computing
environments. Students will receive ten-week intensive training in specific
research fields as well as basic research skills including literature review,
algorithm design and implementation, experiment setup, data analysis, technical
writing and presentation. The research projects are interdisciplinary and an
emphasis will be placed on teamwork and collaboration. Local researchers from
the Texas Medical Center, NASA Johnson Space Center, and oil industry will helps
provide mentoring to the students.

This site will introduce 30 undergraduate students (over three years) to
computing research, with a goal of directing more U.S. undergraduates into
graduate computing programs. The host institution is both a Hispanic Serving
Institution as well as a Minority Serving Institution, so this project will help
attract minority students into STEM programs.
