Mechanisms for reliability and crash recovery in distributed computing systems
are being studied, particularly in distributed database systems. Tools are being
developed for evaluating and comparing the solutions; and using these and other
tools, solutions for several specific problems are classified and categorized.
The research emphasizes algorithm implementation and experimental performance
measurement on the new experimental network consisting of five computers with
over one gigabyte of disk storage. The goal is to investigate novel algorithms
for reliable operation, so the systems implemented are used to drive the
research. That is, new algorithms are implemented and evaluated in order to
understand their strengths and practical limitations. This, in turn, suggests
variations and improvements on the algorithms that will lead in new directions.
Even though the efforts center on system implementation, they continue to use
simulation and analysis when appropriate.
