9726264 Ripley This grant provides partial support to Indiana University for the
costs of acquiring a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) with
peripheral sample introduction and gas handling devices. The SIRMS will be
dedicated to sulfur isotopic analyses, replacing the 19-yr. old Nuclide mass
spectrometer currently operated at Indiana University. This new facility will be
shared by researchers from Indiana-Bloomington, the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana and the University of Missouri- Columbia. State-of-the-art
SIRMS allow analyses of much smaller gas samples (&lt; 1 micromole) than
currently possible on the Nuclide, thus greatly expanding the analytical
possibilities for this regional group. This facility will provide data for a
wide range of studies in economic geology, paleoceanography, biogeochemistry and
sulfur isotope systematics. Specific studies will include sulfur isotopic
investigations of the genesis of hydrothermal ore bodies within the Midcontinent
Rift system, species specific sulfur isotopic analyses of organic compounds as
proxies of diagenetic processes in anoxic marine sediments, characterization of
the biogeochemical pathways of sulfur in Chesapeake Bay sediment pore-water
systems, paleoenvironmental studies of pyrite formation in anoxic Black Sea
sediments, and experimental studies of sulfur isotope fractionation in sulfosalt
systems. ***
