The proposed study will explore magma transport rates in the middle to lower
crust of convergent margin volcanoes and therefore address one of the most
fundamental questions in geodynamics: How do magmas move from their source
region in the mantle wedge to the surface? Furthermore, results from this study
will provide first-order controls on arc magma petrogenesis, connecting the
mantle source and melting process with the crustal plumbing system as well as
provide insights on the aggregation of mantle-derived melts beneath arc
volcanoes. The project is designed to use an integrative approach combining
constraints from geochemistry, seismology, and fluid dynamics. The project will
lead to a better understanding of magma transport beneath active volcanoes and
improve our interpretation of monitoring dataset from such
volcanoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current models for magma transport in convergent
margins suggest the prolonged storage and evolution of mantle-derived melts in
the crust. This project will test whether a fast mode of magma transport even
for large, long-lived arc magma systems exists and what conditions may
facilitate such rapid ascent from the mantle to the surface. The time-
integrative nature of geochemical data often precludes a direct comparison to
geophysical signals that record transient processes. However, geochemical
speedometers employing fast elemental diffusion in zoned magmatic crystals may
bridge this observational gap and advance the application of geochemical tools
to short time scale magmatic processes otherwise only investigated through
geophysics. Such techniques have been successfully employed for near-surface
magmatic processes; this projects aims at extending such approaches to the
entire crustal magma ascent path.
