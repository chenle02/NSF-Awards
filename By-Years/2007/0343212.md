This planning grant for the Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&amp;M
University seeks to incorporate a diversity of scales and applications: chemical
Engineering Undergraduate Curriculum. The project goal will be to develop an
implementation plan for enhancing the TAMU chemical engineering curriculum with
emerging knowledge and technology applications to better meet the educational
needs of students and the emerging workforce needs. This will be done by: 1)
reviewing and revamping the existing chemical engineering curriculum to expand
time and length scales, expand applications, evaluate new technology, expand
synthesis content, and recover course time; and 2) exploring best practices in
pedagogy to enable deeper learning, particularly by underrepresented groups.
