Physical models, based on atomic coordinates and built using rapid-prototyping
technology, are being used in combination with traditional educational materials
to engage students in a meaningful exploration of the three-dimensional concepts
of biomolecular structure. The students' use of these models is guided by
supporting materials, including:

(i) the "Molecule of the Month" web site, where for the past three years, a
different molecular structure from the Protein Data Bank has been featured in a
series of pages with concise text and compelling illustrations;

(ii) a Chime tutorial that introduces students to the use of computer
visualization tools; and

(iii) structure files in the Protein Data Bank that are explored with these
computer tools to further investigate the structure and function of each
molecular topic. The intellectual merit of this project is the demonstration of
physical molecular models as kinesthetic tools that engage students in an
exploration of molecular structure, especially when used along with computer
imagery. The broader impacts of the project arise from the use of the models in
a variety of educational settings, and the involvement of pre-service and in-
service teachers as well as biology undergraduates.
