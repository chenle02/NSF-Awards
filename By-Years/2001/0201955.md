0201955 Luthy This research proposes to examine the availability,
biotransformation, and fate of perfluorinated compounds in aquatic sediments.
These compounds have been used extensively and have been detected in fish, birds
and humans. Little is known, however, about their behavior in the environment.
The research will examine microbial degradation pathways and sediment
interactions which will be used in developing a preliminary model for
determining the fate of perfluorinated compounds.
