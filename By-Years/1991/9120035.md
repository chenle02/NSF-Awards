The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. Alberto Patino Douce of
the University of Georgia, will investigate the melting of metamorphic rocks
that contain the minerals biotite and hornblende. Their experiments, to be
conducted over a wide range of pressure, will provide geologists with important
information regarding the generation of magmas within the earth's crust.
