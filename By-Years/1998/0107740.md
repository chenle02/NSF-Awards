This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will investigate the
propagation of power over distance using electromagnetic waves. Transmission of
power from space using microwaves (a particular form of electromagnetic
radiation) and lasers has been discussed for more than thirty years. It is
proposed to update the discussion, review current capabilities and relevant
issues, hold a workshop of interested parties, and to develop a report on the
topic. This proposal presents a possible outline of the report and describes the
process to be followed in developing the research report.

All electromagnetic, or radio waves, contain power. The most familiar topical
reference is the propagation of power in cellular radio systems. A basestation
transmits power in the direction of a user. This power spreads out as the radio
wave beam diverges over distance. The transmission of significant amounts of
power from one point to another on earth has been demonstrated. However the main
interest in microwave transmission of power is to collect power in space (where
solar radiation is available 24 hours a day) and transmit it efficiently to
anywhere on earth using a narrow, controlled, beam. Transmitting power as a
laser beam is an alternative. Finally the microwave power is converted to power
for use as mains electricity. The recent decade has seen considerable
developments that would assist this process. Power could be beamed to remote
locations, be used in other space-born applications, provide emergency power, or
be used as top-up power as needed. A study is required to determine the current
feasibility eif his means of power transmission, briefly determine the
environmental impact of high power transmission, and briefly outline the
economic issues. Experiments are to be proposed that will enable the issues to
be explored further.
