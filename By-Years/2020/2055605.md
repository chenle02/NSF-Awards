Achieving optimal robustness against adversarial behavior using minimum
resources is central to all information sciences. However, the understanding of
the impact of adversarial behavior in distributed protocols and the optimal
defense against them is far from complete. Collective coin-flipping is an
elegant functionality providing uncluttered access to the primary bottlenecks of
achieving security in any adversarial model. The project's novelties are to
simultaneously bound the insecurity of any coin-flipping protocol against
adversaries and characterize the protocol that achieves maximum
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typically, establishing lower bounds for
insecurity and constructing protocols with high security require different
analysis tools and techniques. The project's innovation is an inherently
constructive inductive approach that unifies these two aspects of protocol
design and analysis. Accomplishing the technical goals outlined in this project
requires several specific contributions: modeling coin-tossing protocols as tree
traversals, characterizing the susceptibility of a protocol to adversarial
attacks, creating potential functions to estimate the susceptibility accurately,
and completing an inductive argument that constructs the optimal protocols. The
project's impacts are widespread, spanning distributed protocol design and
cryptographic protocol design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
