This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes an innovative
approach for development of a high sensitivity laser ultrasonic receiver for
applications in industrial environments. Combining the high sensitivity of
classic reference beam interferometer with the ability to efficiently overcome
the limitation caused by the speckle light generated from the reflection from
rough surface will make this interferometer well suited for demanding industrial
applications where a low cost, sensitive and rugged receiver is needed. Because
the proposed interferometer takes advantage of the high integration level of
current state-of-the-art in electronic packaging, the system can be made very
compact. The robustness, high sensitivity and lower cost of this ultrasonic
receiver will enable laser based ultrasonic inspection to become a cost
effective solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial market for this
measurement system is the very broad NDT market. More specifically, this laser
ultrasonic receiver is targeting process control and in-service inspection
applications where there is a very high need for reliable and low cost
inspection systems capable of withstanding the demanding environment of
factories.&lt;br/&gt;
