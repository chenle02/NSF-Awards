AST-9529167 Stuart Vogel Sylvain Veilleux Measuring the Metagalactic Ionizing
Flux and the Gaseous Extent of Galaxies Using Optical Fabry-Perot
Spectrophotometry. Drs. Vogel and Veilleux will carry out a program to determine
the intensity of the local metagalactic ionizing radiation (the ionizing
background at zero redshift produced by the sum of all sources) and to study
diffuse ionized gas beyond the neutral disks of galaxies. For this work a wide-
field imaging Fabry- Perot spectrometer will be installed on the Palomar 60-inch
telescope. ======================================
