This proposal is for funds to purchase a wavelength discriminating imaging
system which will be dedicated to support research programs in catalysis and
combustion, and undergraduate laboratory experiments. The imaging system
requested consists of a scanning mechanism, a detector with high sensitivity in
the visible to near-IR, and a 0.5m imaging spectrograph along with signal
processing components. This equipment would allow the measurement of surface
temperatures from approximately 700K to greater than 2000K and resolved both
spatially (~ 50 m), and temporally (sub-second to ms). Multi-user use is
anticipated.
