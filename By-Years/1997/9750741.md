The undergraduate laboratory curricula for general chemistry, inorganic
chemistry, physical chemistry, and instrumental analysis can be improved by
adding a diode-array ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a
temperature controller and a cell for spectroelectrochemistry. Since the entire
spectrum of a solution can be recorded in a few seconds using a diode-array
instrument, several new experiments can be added to the chemistry curriculum
that take advantage of the rapid data acquisition and the data analysis
software. Students have the opportunity to use modern, computer-based
instrumentation beginning in their first course as they explore the absorption
spectrum of food dyes. Enhancements and additions to the upper-division
laboratory curriculum include the characterization of coordination geometry from
spectral data; kinetics experiments in which a transient intermediate is
followed; an experiment that uses a tandem technique, spectroelectrochemistry;
and the analysis of multicomponent systems. This project also gives students
experience with a system that incorporates numerous software features for data
analysis and that illustrates validation procedures to insure data quality and
integrity when gathering data electronically. *
