This project is concerned with Markov decision processes (MDPs) and concentrates
on two problems (1) Finding conditions under which there exist easily
implementable optimal policies and (2) Determining how to recognize these
policies. Variants on these problems are also studied, in particular finding
easily implementable approximations to policies and the computational complexity
of recognizing the policies and conditions. This grant will support a transition
from a mathematical logic-based approach to computer science (structural
complexity theory) to an engineering application-based approach. The
applications focussed on in this proposal come from the field of planning, as
described both by computer scientists in Artificial Intelligence, and electrical
engineers in Discrete Event Systems.
