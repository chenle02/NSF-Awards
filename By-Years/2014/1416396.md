The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that a
successful navigation assistive device designed from the study of 3D haptic
feedback will enable the blind and visually impaired more mobility, which can
translate to more employment opportunities and improved quality of life. Beyond
this market, the design of haptic 3D navigation technology will have
applications in fields that require situational awareness, particularly in
fields where the visual and auditory senses can be overwhelmed or temporarily
obstructed such as with first response, military, and search and rescue. There
are also applications in immersive entertainment
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project aims to perform a feasibility study into assistive
navigation technology based on 3D sensors coupled with haptic vibration to
provide individuals information of their surroundings. The blind and visually
impaired communities are underserved by infrastructure, and especially
experience difficulty when it comes to navigating new places both indoors and
outdoors. To this end, modular discreet wearable haptic devices are being
designed and evaluated to provide the wearer navigation information. The
intellectual merit of this project lies in the study of how, where, and what
number of locations haptic feedback can be used to convey detailed and crucial
3D information to&amp;#8232;the body. This will be achieved through experiments
in real world settings and virtual environment testing.
