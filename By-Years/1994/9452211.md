The purpose of this project is to establish at Michigan Technological University
a model computer laboratory with appropriate software for the learning and
teaching of geometry through inductive approaches. The laboratory will consist
of eleven Macintosh Quadra 650 computers networked together. Software packages
such as the Geometry Inventer, the Geometric superSupposer, Geometer's
Sketchpad, Terrapin LOGO, and the Factory will be utilized in the learning and
teaching of College Geometry to preservice secondary school mathematics
teachers. With this software, students can create their own geometric
constructions, look for patterns, formulate conjectures, and test these
conjectures rather quickly. The software packages will be explored for geometry
ideas and concepts which lend themselves to inductive learning via the software.
A plan for the use of the software on those topics will be developed by the
instructor, and summarized for the students in a software guide. The software
guide will serve as a supplement to their text and as a directory to when and
how they should use the software packages. Student attitudes toward learning
geometry in this manner and the amount of material covered will be evaluated.
