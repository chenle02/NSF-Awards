One-dimensional wave motion arises in many physical contexts such as the
propagation of nerve impluses and waves through optical media. The waves that
are physically relevant are the ones which are stable to perturbations in their
profile. It is thus of fundamental importance to develop techniques for
discriminating between stable and unstable waves. One of the main objectives of
this work is to develop techniques that will apply to travelling waves of
systems of reaction-diffusion equations that have some singular structure. The
wave is then composed of pieces that satisfy reduced equations which can be
analyzed. The idea is to build machinery for determining how the linearization
of the full problem at the wave is built up from the spectrum of these reduced
problems. This project contains also a study of a nonlinear Schrodinger equation
that arises in nonlinear optics and plasma physics.
