Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt; Modeling of many mechanical systems leads to a set
of nonlinear differential equations with periodic coefficients. The dynamics and
control of these systems is a very significant issue due to its impact on
reliability, capability of operating under high speeds and longevity. In most
instances, the linearized equations are used to design the controllers, which by
no means is an efficient or a practical solution. Further, in the case when a
system has linearly uncontrollable modes then a linear controller cannot be
designed and one must resort to a nonlinear controller. &lt;br/&gt; In this
study a set of practical and efficient techniques are developed that can be
applied to a wide class of control problems encountered in nonlinear systems
with periodically varying parameters. The main approach is based on the
application of Lyapunov-Floquet transformation and time-dependent normal form
theory. For linearly uncontrollable critical cases, bifurcation control is
suggested through an application of the center manifold theory. Backstepping and
Lyapunov's second methods are also employed to synthesize controllers.
&lt;br/&gt; The practical significance of this study is demonstrated through
applications (via computer simulations) to some typical problems including the
controller designs for an asymmetric magnetic rotor-baring system, helicopter
blades and structures subjected to periodic loads. As an application to cardiac
dynamics, a control system is designed to change an irregular heat beat to a
desired periodic rhythm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
