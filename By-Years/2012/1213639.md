The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports Professors Krishna Foster of California
State University- Los Angeles and Donald Dabdub of the University of California-
Irvine in a collaborative effort that will investigate the chemical kinetics of
oxy-polyaromatic hydrocarbons (oxy-PAH) in surrogates of particulate matter to
elucidate the impact of this chemistry on the oxidizing capacity of the lower
atmosphere. Photolytically excited oxy-PAH readily transfer energy to ground
state molecular oxygen, producing the reactive oxygen species singlet molecular
oxygen. This proposal is based on the premise that these reactions may take
place on aged particulate matter, and consequently, impacts the oxidation
capacity of the lower atmosphere. Innovative aspects of the proposal include the
application of emerging quantitative HPLC/MS techniques for oxy-PAH to the
discipline of chemical kinetics and MS analysis of gaseous mixtures. This is an
interdisciplinary, collaborative project between a chemistry professor at a non-
Ph.D. granting Hispanic Serving Institution and an engineering professor at a
local Ph.D. granting institution. This model maximizes resources by advancing
science and developing human resources simultaneously. Success of the proposed
research will improve air quality models, and consequently, impact millions of
people, especially those living in urban areas. The inclusion of undergraduates
from groups underrepresented in the sciences, reflective of the California State
University- Los Angeles population, will be a high priority. This project has
the potential to increase the number of underrepresented students who select
careers in the chemical sciences and pursue graduate education.
