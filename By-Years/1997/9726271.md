Research would be undertaken to evaluate a six-dimensional state space model for
the basic energy components of the night-side magnetosphere coupled to the
ionosphere by region 1 currents. This model provides a physics based alternative
to empirical forecasting techniques. The evaluation of this physics based model
with involve (1) a critical comparison of the model results to data- based
prediction filters, (2) couple the model to particle simulations, comparing the
results to geomagnetic indices within the Bargatze event data set, and compare
the model's nonlinear dynamical response to that of the magnetosphere as deduced
from state space analysis of magnetosphere as deduced from state space analysis
of magnetospheric variables.
