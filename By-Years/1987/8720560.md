This award will provide one-half the cost of purchasing a carbon analysis
system for the Department of Geology at Auburn University. The instrument is
needed for determining organic carbon and the carbonate component in sediments
and sedimentary rocks. The carbon analyses are necessary for a variety of
research projects to characterize fine-grained sedimentary materials and their
potential as source material for fossil fuels.
