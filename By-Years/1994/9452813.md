HRD - 9452813 PI: Dr. Eugene DeLoatch Morgan State University Baltimore,
Maryland Diversity in the Scientific and Technological Workforce (An NSF
National Conference) Morgan State University proposes to again collaborate with
NSF in the implementation of the student component of the NSF third National
Conference on Diversity in the Scientific and Technological Workforce, which is
scheduled in Washington, DC on September 29 - October 1, 1994. The conference
will focus attention on the Foundation's role in the education of minorities who
are underrepresented in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET)
fields. Conference activities will include research presentations by more than
300 student participants in NSF-sponsored research projects, and the
presentation and discussion of the NSF Action Plan that outlines a national
strategy to assure a significant expansion of the nation's scientific and
technological workforce to include underrepresented minorities in a variety of
roles. The university would prepare abstracts of student presentations, and
design and schedule activities to encourage student interactions with role
models and other minority SMET students, leading to the formation of support
group to reinforce student selection of SMET majors and careers. Grant
activities also would include working with EHR in scheduling student travel and
hotel accommodations, and arranging transportation to the conference for local
area precollege and college students.
