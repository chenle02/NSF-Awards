This project is theoretical research on heavy ion reactions. Previous work by
these investigators showed that analysis of fragment momenta gives information
on the temperature and density of the primary reaction products; analysis of
correlations gives information on the size of the disintegrating product and of
its distance from the original center of collision. It is proposed to look into
the mechanics of large mass transfer (incomplete fusion), so important for
nuclear chemistry, and to trace back the multistep components of the collision
process to try to find a region of high density which could test the equation of
state. In addition, Balantekin proposes to look at lepton production in a time
dependant electromagnetic field to see if this throws any light on the anomalous
charged particle emission observed in these reactions, and to look again at the
restrictions that can be placed on neutrino oscillations.
