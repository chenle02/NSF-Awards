Sonar is an attractive sensing modality for robotics because it is relatively
simple to implement and process, has low cost and energy consumption, can be
used in conjunction with camera vision, and for some applications it is the only
practical sensing modality. This research investigates a form of adaptive sonar
sensing, in which the sensor changes its physical configuration during the
sensing process in reaction to the observed echoes. This approach, analogous to
some approaches to active computer vision, is motivated by biological systems
that turn their ears toward the direction of the sound source and move to
observe an object from different directions. As part of this research, signal
processing algorithms are investigated to develop a sensing system that can
identify objects by their acoustic signatures. The current model of echo
production is extended to predict the echoes observed by the sonar system. The
sonar allows the robot to navigate around an unstructured environment precisely
and to construct accurate sonar maps by using environmental objects as
naturally-occurring beacons. This approach should support more autonomous and
flexible operation of both mobile robots and robot arms, thus improving their
functionality in manufacturing applications.
