A variety of fundamental phenomena can be modeled mathematically as systems of
many interacting components. The problem of analyzing the dynamics of any such
system becomes tractable if we recognize that individual components interact
primarily with only a small number of "nearby" components. This is referred to
as a quasi-locality property of the system. At the microscopic level, the basic
laws of quantum physics govern the dynamics of systems consisting of atoms and
elementary particles. Much of the recent progress made in understanding the
dynamics of such systems has been through the mathematical analysis of their
quasi-locality properties. In this project, new mathematical advances exploiting
the quasi-locality properties of quantum systems will be used to obtain a better
understanding of the physical systems of interest for new quantum technologies.
In particular, new methods will be developed to allow more precise modeling of
the quantum systems employed for quantum information processing and computation.

Quantum many-body systems at low temperatures describe a fascinating array of
behavior generically described as quantum states of matter. This project will
deepen the mathematical understanding of so-called gapped phases. Systems in a
gapped phase have one or more ground states and a spectral gap for excitations
in the bulk. One important goal of the project is to understand how the
excitation spectrum of such systems can be described as a system of quasi-
particles. In particular for systems in two space dimensions these quasi-
particles may be anyons, instead of the more commonly encountered fermions and
bosons. Techniques will be developed, based on the fundamental quasi-locality
properties of the dynamics, to prove the existence of anyons, their relation to
topological order in the ground state(s), and their dynamical properties. These
problems are motivated by the desire to learn more about the quantum states of
matter that occur in condensed matter systems, and to understand better the
potential of topologically ordered materials in applications such as quantum
memory and other quantum devices.
