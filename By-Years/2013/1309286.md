This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2013. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Julie Thomas is "Analysis of Alternative Splicing in
Drought Regulated Genes for Stress Tolerance in Rice". The host institution for
the fellowship is the University of Arkansas and the sponsoring scientist is Dr.
Andy Pereira.

Alternative splicing forms multiple transcripts from individual genes that can
generate very rapid changes in functional transcripts by post-transcriptional
processing to help the plant respond to environmental stresses. The objectives
of this project are: 1) analysis of alternative splicing in rice in response to
drought stress using RNA-Seq; 2) new developments in RNA-Seq technology and
Bioinformatics will be used to identify stress responsive differentially
expressed alternatively spliced transcripts; and, 3) evaluation of alternatively
spliced transcripts in a rice genotype diversity panel, to study the association
to drought stress response phenotypes or stress parameters. Alternatively
spliced transcripts that distinguish drought tolerance can be developed as
functional markers for molecular breeding.

Training objectives include bioinformatics, crop plant genomics, drought
physiology, and molecular breeding approaches. Broader impacts include
enhancement of the capacity for conducting interdisciplinary research in plant
improvement and associated sciences such as bioinformatics, physiology, genomics
and molecular breeding. The project will also address a major problem of climate
change, the response of plants to changing environments in which drought and
other abiotic stresses are becoming more frequent. An understanding of how water
scarcity affects crop yields would be a major contribution towards making crops
more tolerant to drought stress.
