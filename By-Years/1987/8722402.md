This project concerns the mathematical theory of control, stabilization and
optimization of infinite dimensional systems - in particular distributed
parameter systems governed by partial differential equations and hereditary
systems governed by delay- differential and functional-differential system. The
research will focus on four main topics: a). Modeling and models of hybrid
systems, b). General theory of controllability and stabilization of hybrid
systems, c). Optimal control of hybrid systems, and d). Robustness analysis of
hereditary systems.
