9500991 Myers This award provides support for the research infrastructure
necessary to investigate the viability of building scalable systems from
commodity components. Hardware components will include workstations and ATM
switches. Research topics to be conducted include the design of an operating
systems that scales with processor performance; and the design, implementation
and experimentation of five different scalable systems: DNA Assembly Server,
Scalable Storage Server, Cluster-C* applied to remote sensing, a general
computing environment based on an efficient fine-grain parallelism on multiple
processors, and a parallel simulator.
