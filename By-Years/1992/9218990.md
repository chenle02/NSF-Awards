Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include studies of
three-dimensional and high-temperature quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which will
lead to an understanding of the low-momentum or infrared behavior of such
theories; of high-energy and high-temperature electroweak processes, which will
quantify the extent to which nucleon- number violation and other non-
perturbative phenomena can be seen both at the Superconducting Supercollider
(SSC) and as dynamical effects in the early universe; of string theories and
two-dimensional quantum gravity, which will provide new and better mathematical
formulation of current string-theory problems; and of four-dimensional quantum
gravity and black holes, which will clarify the underlying physics of black
holes with mass near the Planck mass (at which gravity is as important as the
other forces). QCD processes are known otherwise as strong nuclear ones, and
electroweak processes drive atomic physics and some nuclear radioactive decays.
Together, these processes, including those involving nucleon-number violation,
are the central focus of the experimental program at SSC and of processes in the
early universe. String theory is the underlying framework for all elementary
particle interactions, including gravity, and the intersection of quantum
mechanics and gravity takes place in the physics of black holes of mass near the
Planck mass. The programs to be worked on are central to the most important
problems of elementary particle theory today.
