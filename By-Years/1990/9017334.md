Geometric studies in thrust belts have given rise to a number of kinematic
models for the development of specific structural geometries, but the models
have remained to a large extent untested for large scale examples because of a
lack of sufficient incremental strain data and diagnostic microstructures. This
project is designed to provide an adequate data set from well- exposed folds and
thrusts in the northern Lost River Range in Idaho in order to constrain models
for the development of those structures. The work involves construction of
detailed 3-D structural geometries and cross-sections and the determination of
strain histories using syntectonic fibers from samples collected from
appropriate parts of these structures. Results are expected to allow a vigorous
test of several hypotheses concerning how such folds and thrusts develop. The
outcome will be utility in understanding the kinematics of deformation in other
fold and thrust belts.
