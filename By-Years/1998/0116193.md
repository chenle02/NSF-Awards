Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this research
program is the development of analytical and numerical techniques to
autonomously monitor the integrity of actively controlled structures. For the
control system, the failure may be the loss of a sensor or actuator, or a more
compensatible loss such as a change in the gain of a sensor. For the structural
system, failure may be the partial or total loss of structural stiffness or mass
in a region of the structure. The basis for all proposed methodologies is to
utilize changes in the measured dynamics before and after a failure has occurred
to determine the current "state" of the actively controlled
structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, we will develop methodologies to
determine a statistically meaningful methodology to establish the existence of a
failure using system realization theory, time-domain signal processing and
outlier analysis. The proposed methodology will be able to distinguish between
changes in operational environment and actual failures. With existence
established, system realization redundancy will be used to isolate the failure
to either the control system or the structure and once isolated to determine the
individual component that has failed. Once the failure extent has been
estimated, the final step is to compensate for the failure to maximize the
performance of the "new" system using a Genetic Algorithm learning control
concept and a Neural Network adaptive controller. All methods developed will be
evaluating using both numerical and actual experimental
tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several systems which will benefit from
this research, including actively controlled civil structures
(buildings/bridges), aircraft, offshore platforms and deep-water risers, re-
useable launch vehicles, the International Space Station, and long term
exploratory space probes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
