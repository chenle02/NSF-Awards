Present efforts are concentrated on the growth of nonlinear optical crystals, in
particular, the sodium metaborate crystal. The growth and development of such
crystals is uniquely carried out here and at Stanford (demand is such that the
industrial sector is not significantly involved). These crystals are
particularly interesting because of potential applications as tunable sources
from the infrared to the ultraviolet.
