In recent years, confocal microscopy has been developed to meet the increasing
demands of 3-D imaging. The deficiency of the technique is that the image data
must be collected pixel by pixel through scanning, which makes the instrument
slow, inefficient, complicated, and expensive. 3-D imaging will be realized
through parallel pixel filtering techniques. A pixel filter array made of micro-
optics can be constructed to perform spatial filtering for all image pixels
simultaneously. Only the light from the focal depth region can pass through the
pixel filter array and the light from out-of-focus regions is rejected.
Sectioned images can be obtained without scanning. The technique is expected to
have better depth discrimination capability than that of the confocal technique.
Due to the elimination of image scanning, the technique will substantially
increase the imaging speed, simplify the instrument design, and greatly reduce
the costs. This program will lead to the development of a new 3-D imaging
technique and may find wide applications not only to microscopic imaging but
also to telescopic imaging.
