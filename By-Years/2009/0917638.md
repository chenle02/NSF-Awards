&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RNA switches provide a genetically-encoded technology for
programming information processing and control in living systems. This project
advances a modular, extensible framework for the programming of biological
control systems, in which target expression levels can be up- or down-regulated
in response to molecular inputs and the regulatory response properties can be
tuned for specific applications, thereby expanding the utility of the platform
to a broader range of applications. By providing a general framework through
which to link diverse molecular information to cellular phenotype, RNA switches
provide powerful strategies for generating new biological components exhibiting
a variety of sensory, enzymatic, or regulatory activities. This project
emphasizes the advancement of an enabling technology that has well-defined
design strategies and that is transferable to a variety of different systems,
increasing the utility to and impact on the larger scientific community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational programs
will be developed that merge research and education across different training
levels, engage interdisciplinary teams of student researchers and mentors in
open-ended research challenges and involve them in early phases of project
definition and design, and emphasize community building and communicating
research to different audiences. The programs will introduce cutting-edge
engineering research to younger students and actively target involvement of
underrepresented groups. The benefits of the research program to society are
far-reaching as the resulting technologies will significantly impact our ability
to interface with and engineer living systems.
