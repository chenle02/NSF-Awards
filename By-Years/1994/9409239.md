9409239 Schlecht There is an important need for compact, lightweight, efficient
laser systems that are tunable. In order for these laser systems to achieve the
output powers, efficiency, beam quality, reliability, and the small size and
weight required, they must be solid state fiber systems. The most efficient
source for pumping these laser systems is the diode laser where 50% efficiencies
are now possible. Further, in order to efficiently couple the pump light from
laser diodes into the laser and to efficiently extract both the laser output
power and any heat generated, a fiber laser system is demanded. LaserGenics
Corporation has grown fibers of titanium doped A1203, YA103, and MgA1204 by the
laser heated pedestal-growth technique during our Phase I effort. These
materials are very attractive as tunable laser sources from the near IR to the
near UV. During the Phase II effort we will further optimize the growth of
MgA1204 fibers, develop cladding materials and techniques for the three types of
single crystal fibers we have grown, construct a tunable fiber laser breadboard
system using these fibers and test this system with these fibers and report
these results. ***
