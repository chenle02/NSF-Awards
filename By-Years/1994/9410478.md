9410478 Nagel Technical abstract: The relaxations in supercooled liquids will be
investigated by means of different spectroscopic techniques including specific
heat and dielectric spectroscopies, shear modulus and quadrupole susceptibility.
The dielectric spectroscopy will be conducted over 14 decades in frequency. The
nature of the singularity in the interface that occurs when a singlr drop of
liquid splits into two or more separate sections will be probed using
photographic techniques. The observations will be modeled with detailed
numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. In addition, simulations
of patterns (temporal as well as spatial) that occur in a variety of geophysical
contexts will be simulated. Non-technical abstract: An investigation will be
carried out by which glasses are formed by the cooling of a liquid. Many
different spectroscopies will be used and compared to each other. Another
investigation is concerned with how a single drop of liquid splits into two or
more components. This study will be done using photographic techniques coupled
with detailed numerical simulations. Finally, a study will be continued in which
simulations are carried out of patterns that occur in a variety of geophysical
contexts such as earthquakes and river formation. ***
