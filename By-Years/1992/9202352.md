This project on inverse problems will develop mathematical recovery methods for
unknown coefficients from second order partial differential equations in multi-
dimensions. The stability of these methods and their computational costs will
also be analyzed. Applications to age-structured populations will be
investigated and information such as birth and death rates will be extracted
from certain functionals of the population. Inverse problems arise in
mathematical models describing physical systems containing uncertainties in
coefficients or boundary conditions. Using additional information, in the form
of boundary data or interior measurements, a more accurate model is sought --
one in which the output of the model conforms to the measured data as closely as
possible. Important examples of inverse problems are medical imaging using CAT
scans, acoustic sonograms, and non-destructive testing of aircraft wings in
searching for damaged or failed sections.
