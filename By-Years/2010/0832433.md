&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The University of Michigan and Michigan Technological
University propose a planning grant for a collaborative center
"Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC) on Assembly
Research" to maximize the global competitiveness of the US manufacturing
industry through innovations in assembly design and manufacturing. The proposed
center aims to conduct needs-driven, collaborative research projects within and
across four research thrust areas: assembly design, assembly systems, supply
chain management, and disassembly. Compared to fragmented attempts to tackle a
focused research issue in isolation with others, this holistic approach is
likely to yield strong synergy across the research thrusts and among industry
partners representing various industry segments. The knowledge generated in the
proposed center would also be applicable to non-manufacturing industry, such as
service industry, where products are "assembled" of multiple commoditized and
custom-made components. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
proposal would be to improve the competitiveness in the global manufacturing
environment and to educate and train students who would be the future work force
in the US manufacturing industry. The proposed center plans to disseminate
research results to the general public through professional education courses
and workshops and at the College of Engineering open house. Local high school
and community college teachers will be encouraged to participate in the
workshops, and the center will actively recruit students from the under-
represented groups.
