This project concerns the effects of brain damage in infants, using infant rats
as a model system. The brain area under investigation is the limbic system,
portions of which have been implicated in several intellectual and emotional
functions. Damage to this area, and particularly to portions of it called the
hippocampal formation and the amygdala, has been shown in adult animals to
affect (a) various forms of memory, (b) distractibility, and (c) a tendency to
persist or perseverate in the face of indications that behavior will not be
rewarded or will be punished. Studies of these kinds have been done in adult
animals, but never before in infants. Important questions are whether or not
limbic lesions will affect infants in the same way, and, if they do, whether or
not these effects will survive into adulthood. Dr. Amsel and his colleagues have
developed a "behavioral assay" to test infant learning and performance. They
have identified, for infant rats in the 10- to 25-day age range, the ages at
which each of a family of learned behavioral effects can first be observed to
occur. These effects reflect memory, perseveration, and the ability to alter
behavior in relation to changed contingencies of reward, frustration, and
punishment. Having this information in hand, the researchers will now attempt to
relate lesions in various limbic areas to the age of occurrence of their
established behavioral effects. They will also address the question of whether
or not there is recovery of function, that is to say, whether or not behavioral
deficits ascribable to a lesion in infancy will still be present if the animal
is tested in adolescence or as an adult. The brain damage is produced by three
kinds of treatments: electrolytic lesions, chemical lesions, and x-irradiation.
The first kind of lesion produces a rather general pattern of damage; the other
two attack more specific and localizable cell groups. In this way, Dr. Amsel may
be more able to relate brain structure to behavioral function.
