This award will support a two year cooperative research project involving
Professor Stephen Benkovic, Department of Chemistry, Pennsylvania State
University, and Professor Eiko Ohtsuka, Hokkaido University, Japan. The
objective of the collaboration is to develop catalytic antibodies that promote
amide synthesis and transesterification of phosphodi- esters in RNA structures.
This research will exploit two recent scientific advances in this area, namely
(1) the production of antibodies that resemble the transition state of a given
reaction which catalyze the synthesis or breakage of chemical bonds with
substantial rate accelerations and with exquisite specificity; and (2) the
demonstration that such monoclonal antibodies can be constructed in bacteria.
These advances open the way for constructing a library consisting of several
million FAB fragments, screened for binding and tested for catalytic activity.
Additionally, the production of gram quantities of a desired antibody can now be
carried out on a cost efficient basis using fermentation. It is hoped, as a
result of this research, to develop catalysts which will be useful in
understanding the mode of action of ribozymes, the RNA cleaving enzymes, as well
as developing superior means of constructing amide bonds expediting the
synthesis of hormonally active peptides. Both collaborating researchers are
highly competent scientists with distinguished accomplishments, and each is
considered an expert in his individual field. Their strengths are compleme-
ntary; Professor Benkovic will concentrate on the mechanism of catalysis and
Professor Ohtsuka on the structural properties of 2D NMR. Any advances in this
area will have significant benefits, both scientific and industrial. If this
project is successful it should have a major impact on modern biology.
