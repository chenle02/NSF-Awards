Abstract for "Piezo- and Ferro- electricity in 1-D nanomaterials" (CMS 0324643):

The project is aimed to achieve fundamental understanding of the piezoelectric
and ferroelectric effects at low dimension for the purpose of developing novel
nanoscale devices critical for nanoscale electromechanical systems. The subject,
which has not been extensively studied yet, is critically related to the further
advance of nanoscale science and technology. Efforts are made: (1) to develop
experimental capabilities for the study of piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity
at the nanoscale; (2) to demonstrate and verify the piezoelectricity of BN and
BaTiO3 nanowires; (3) to study the dependence of the piezoelectric and/or
ferroelectric effects on size, shape and external load; and (4) to prototype and
characterize nanoscale sensors and actuators integrating BN and/or BaTiO3
nanowires. The study is accomplished with the aid of multi-probe free-space
nanomanipulation and characterization capabilities integrated with real-time
visualization and nanoscale materials processing inside electron microscope. The
research will not only expand our scientific knowledge on low dimensional
piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity, but also achieve engineering
breakthroughs on nanoscale characterization, actuation and sensing for
nanotechnology. It includes also a comprehensive plan for integrating and
educating students, and promoting the public engagement in new scientific
research.
