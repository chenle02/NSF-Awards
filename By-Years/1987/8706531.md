Recent experience in Japan, Mexico, and elsewhere shows that substantial
damage, even total collapse, can occur to steel buildings. This project studies
the effects of several recently recognized factors on the seismic performance of
steel frame systems. These are: interaction of multicomponent ground motions,
P-delta effect, and the effect of low ductility members. The study makes use of
the established analytical capabilities in seismic analysis of buildings
subjected to interacting ground motions at the University of Missouri-Rolla, and
the extensive research experience in steel building structures at Lehigh
University. The collaboration should provide a unique opportunity to develop an
improved understanding of the seismic performance of tall steel buildings and
more reliable methods of evaluating safety of such structures. The results would
be useful for practicing engineers, academic researchers, and code writing
bodies.
