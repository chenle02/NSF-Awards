This NSF MRI grant funds the acquisition of a transmission electron microscope
(TEM) at Randolph-Macon College (R-MC). R-MC is a small liberal arts and
sciences institution with a long tradition of undergraduate student research.
Faculty members maintain active research programs and mentor undergraduate
research students in several ways, including credit-bearing independent studies,
capstone research projects, and through the endowed Shapiro Undergraduate
Research Fellowship (SURF) program during the summer. Acquisition of a TEM will
greatly enhance the research and teaching environment at R-MC by enabling
undergraduate researchers to use state of the art equipment that will promote
recruitment of students from all backgrounds into the sciences. Research
projects to be supported by the TEM span a broad range of the life sciences and
include: compartmentalization of mammalian sperm acrosomal matrix proteins to
understand their role in fertilization; evaluating how parenting responses
affect neuroplasticity in rats; ultrastructural analysis of motile cells in new
fungal species; characterization of host-symbiont interactions in the bryozoan
Bugula neritina and its bacterial symbionts; and understanding the regulation of
autophagy in T cells during calorie restriction in mice. Collaborative research
with investigators at other institutions will also be enabled. In addition, the
TEM will be used in several undergraduate courses, including a new Advanced
Microscopy course in which students will learn specimen preparation, digital
image acquisition, and analysis of electron micrographs. Existing and newly
developed outreach programs will engage students from local public schools in
projects and demonstrations to stimulate their interest in science.
