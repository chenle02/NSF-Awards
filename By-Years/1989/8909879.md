The recent emergence of masonry as an engineered construction material in the
same class as concrete and steel has not been matched by equal advancements in
standard test procedures for masonry. Existing test procedures do not or are
marginal in meeting today's needs and will be grossly inadequate for needs
associated with future limit state design for masonry. The U.S. Coordinated
Program for Masonry Research as well as other NSF funded research has developed
a broad database on the static and earthquake response of masonry especially
reinforced masonry. This research project uses these data to recommend needed
improvements to masonry testing standards. The research establishes specific
needs that masonry tests must fulfill both for current needs and for future
needs associated with limit state design, critically reviews the ability of
existing tests to meet these needs, it develops required modifications to
existing tests, and it develops new tests where existing tests are lacking. The
result of this study is a set of carefully documented recommendations for test
standard modifications or additions applicable to earthquake and static behavior
of structures. These recommendations provide the technical base to support
actions by others or by standard writing bodies.
