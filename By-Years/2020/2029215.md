In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Prof. Lu of the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign and Prof. Rong of the University of Illinois at Chicago
collaborate to develop a novel, widely deployable method for detecting the
infectious coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The sensing method is designed to enable
differentiation of infectious virus from those rendered non-infectious, as well
as other viruses and interfering species. Rapid and accurate detection of the
infectious viruses provides to patients the opportunity to receive proper
treatments early on, prevents patients from unknowingly spreading the infectious
virus to others, eliminates unnecessary quarantine of non-contagious patients,
and enables assessment of whether surfaces at critical locations has been
properly disinfected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to develop a
modular and scalable aptamer-nanopore sensor for direct detection of the intact
coronavirus. Specifically, this research will identify and synthesize DNA
aptamers that bind the infectious SARS-CoV-2, but not the non-infectious forms,
with high specificity and affinity. Detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the
single nanochannel membrane will be performed using steady-state measurements,
which is less resource intensive than the commonly used resistive pulse sensing
technique. The sensing method does not require sample pre-treatment or RNA
amplification and, thus, simplifies the testing procedure and minimizes the
chance of cross contamination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
