Characterization of materials and measurement of semiconductor device parameters
are an important part of undergraduate microelectronics laboratory. This project
enhances the analytic facilities of the laboratory through the addition of a
semiconductor parameter analyzer. This system enables the students to
characterize the electronic properties of the materials, and also to test and
measure their fabricated devices parameters. The unit is used in five
undergraduate courses in Electrical Engineering. The award is being matched by
an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
