9528844 Gelbke Research in heavy ion nuclear physics will be carried out at the
Michigan State University Superconducting Cyclotron Facility (MSU/NSCL). The
NSCL is a national user facility , with research being carried out by faculty,
staff, postdocs, and students from MSU, from other universities in the US and
abroad, from US national laboratories, from other federal agencies, and from
industry. Proposals are made to the NSCL for use of the available accelerator
beam time and for other specialized resources needed to carry out the
experiment. All proposals are reviewed by a national program advisory committee,
which in turn makes recommendations to award beam time or to decline these
proposals. The NSCl operation staff provides about 4000 hours o accelerator beam
time per year. ***
