NMR methodology has become probably the most versatile technique in chemical
analysis, finding application in every branch of chemistry. The excitement of
working with state-of-the-art equipment is an important factor in attracting top
students into scientific careers. Analysis, provides an ideal format for
introducing the concepts and skills of NMR and a two-semester projects-style
laboratory course, intended for juniors, will link the complementary approaches
of chemical science, synthesis and analysis, and serve to develop a readiness
for independent research in students. The NMR spectrometer will also be
available to participants in the Department's Chemistry Division supported NSF
Research Experiences for Undergraduate Program. This ILI award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry
at Boston University to acquire an NMR spectrometer that will be used to enhance
undergraduate laboratory instruction and undergraduate independent research.
