This grant will provide one-half the funds needed to purchase a computer system
for analysis of nuclear physics data. The remaining one-half of the required
funds will be provided by the University of Michigan as a matching grant. The
system will expedite very significantly the work of the Michigan nuclear
physicists, who carry out their experiments as users of other facilities, by
enabling faculty and students to analyze the resultant data at their home
university. The computer will also be used extensively by the Michigan nuclear
theorists. The scientists involved with this work enjoy international
recognition for their work.
