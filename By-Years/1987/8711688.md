Investigate a new, original approach which combines the advantages of magneto-
optic recording and transverse magnetic recording. The technique uses a
transverse recording method for the storage of digital information combined with
magneto-optics for the readback process. The study includes an investigation of
the magneto-optic and micro-magnetic properties of various thin-film materials.
The Bloch wall form is used to provide increased storage capacities in addition
to less stringent quality control at the manufacturing stage and a reduced risk
of head crash during operations. This project is one supported under the
Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
