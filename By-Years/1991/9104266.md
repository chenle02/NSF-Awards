The principal investigator will experimentally study the compositional
variations of chemically simple amphibole minerals in response to pressure,
temperature, and compositional conditions of formation. The resulting data will
lead to the thermodynamic characterization of these amphiboles, and to their use
as geothermometers and geobarometers, tools that help geologists reconstruct the
history of the Earth.
