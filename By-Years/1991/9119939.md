"Root-colonizing" microbes may not be confined to the soil; instead,
populations over large regions may be linked by various biotic and abiotic
transport systems whose strength, perhaps, is limited by the densities achieved
locally. Research will develop and validate an epidemiological model that links
local processes of growth and movement from single root systems to larger scale
process of transport, colonization, and persistence. The work will be conducted
with a specific model system - a bacterium, engineered with unique markers to
facilitate fluid experimentation, and an insect that feeds on corn roots- but
the questions, experimental approach, statistics and models are more general.
This work takes on special significance since bacteria are being engineered for
many environmental and agricultural functions, and will not be endowed with
trivial or ecologically irrelevant traits.
