The educational system can be viewed as a dynamic environment influenced by many
factors. In this project a multi-agent interaction and simulation model will be
investigated as a tool for evaluating educational systems as dynamic
environments. The long term aim of the tool will be to model the interaction
between education policy and human learning by first using typically measured
factors such as test scores and economic status and they exploring other factors
that are harder to quantify but which may result in a more accurate model. The
proposed work involved three phases: (1) constructing an initial model and
calibrating it against historical data; (2) examining how other, less typical
characteristics can be quantified and expanding the model to include these
additional measures; and (3) introducing the model to education policy makers,
building a user-interface that they can use and understand; and conducting a
pilot study with potential users. The research team consists of computer
scientists, dynamical system theorists, multi-agent researchers, school system
experts, and AI researchers.
