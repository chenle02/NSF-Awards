&lt;br/&gt;The Teacher Education Alliance for Math and Science (TEAMS), a
partnership of 7 school districts, Lee College, and the University of
Houston/Clear Lake, is developing and strengthening lower division teacher
education curricula in math and science; providing preservice students with
opportunities for field experiences and interaction with inservice teachers; and
recruiting prospective teachers, particularly from underrepresented groups.
Outcomes of the project include a new team-taught interdisciplinary course,
Physical Science/Algebra, a revised Math for Elementary Teachers course, and a
new fully articulated associate degree program for prospective elementary
teachers. New courses reflect the Texas state standards and new certification
requirements for grades 4-8. A series of Saturday Labs taught by community
college and university faculty focuses on the understanding and development of
math/science projects by pairs of preservice and inservice teachers. The
preservice/inservice teams are designing experiments geared for 4th and 5th
grade students and conducting the activities in the partner schools through a
Traveling Lab. In addition, prospective teachers are providing classroom
assistance to 4th and 5th grade mentor teachers in science and math.
