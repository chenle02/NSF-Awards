This research concerns the nature of the well-known zeta function in number
theory. Carlitz has developed an analogue of the zeta function and in joint work
with Anderson, the investigator on this project has shown the values of this
generalized zeta function are logarithmic and hence transcendental. This
research concerns the effort by the investigator to extend these results to
general function fields. In general, this research explores various analogies
between number theory and geometry. The research examines the prime
factorizations of Gauss sums and the factorization analogues for function
fields. For general function fields, the factorizations do not follow the
classical patterns for the field of rational functions.
