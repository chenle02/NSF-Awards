Rapidly changing scientific and economic landscapes are prompting graduate
students and postdoctoral scholars, graduate programs, institutions, future
employers, and the scientific community to consider more effective strategies
for developing the careers of early-stage scientists. One way to promote
intentional career planning is through the use of an Individual Development
Plans (IDP), a document that lists short- and long-term career goals and planned
actions for achieving those goals. Graduate departments that embrace IDPs will
take a more comprehensive approach to career development, maximizing investments
in graduate education. Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, especially
those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who use effectively designed discipline-
specific IDPs will be better prepared for a wider range of careers and better
positioned to address complex societal challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed team will use the I-Corps L curriculum to build and test a prototype
IDP toolkit for the chemical sciences, including processes, templates, and
career information resources, and to develop a roadmap for scaling the
prototype. Designed for iterative use, IDPs will facilitate: goal setting (long-
and short-term), self-exploration (values, interests, and skills), career
exploration, and identification and acquisition of needed knowledge, skills, and
experience. The effective implementation of IDPs, similar to other educational
innovations, requires relevant material that is conveyed using scaffolded and
interactive approaches. Input from graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and
faculty in the chemical sciences, examples from other disciplines and sectors,
social science research, and research on how people learn will be used to
determine the desired qualities and characteristics, uses, and anticipated
benefits of an IDP for the chemical sciences.
