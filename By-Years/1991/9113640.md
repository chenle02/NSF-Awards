This award supports a visit by Dr. Myron Charles Baker of Colorado State
University to the University of Western Australia to work with Dr. Michael S.
Johnson on behavioral and genetic components of the process by which new species
are created in birds. Behavioral studies of song recognition by several species
of Australian birds (the Fairy Wren multi- species complex) will be carried out
by playback experimentation in natural populations. These results will form the
basis for further investigations of features of the reproductive communication
used in mate choice and will provide understanding of the differing degrees of
divergence among the several species and subspecies. The researchers will
conduct genetic studies as an extension of an ongoing research program in North
America. Tissue samples from two closely-related species of buntings, and their
hybrids, will be taken by Dr. Baker to a biochemical systematics laboratory at
the University of Western Australia to be examined with enzyme and molecular
techniques. The results will address the question of the nature of gene exchange
in a pair of species that may be in the process of completing their isolation as
a new species.
