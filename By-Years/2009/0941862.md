Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software visualizations are
recognized as valuable teaching and learning tools. Prior NSF funding produced
jGRASP, a software development environment that allows students to visualize
their programs and data structures. While jGRASP has been widely disseminated
and has been met with a high degree of success, teachers do not use the data
structure visualization features to their full potential. Objectives of this
project are to train teachers to use effective program visualization practices
in the classroom and to develop a set of learning materials that integrate
dynamic visualizations with appropriate teaching
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two summer workshops are the primary strategy
for developing materials and training faculty. The first workshop is designed to
develop data structure visualizations and make plans for participants to use the
materials during the following academic year. The second workshop is designed to
refine materials and to train additional teachers. Expected outcomes include
learning resources, data structure visualizations and a diverse community of
trained faculty from high schools, community colleges and universities.
