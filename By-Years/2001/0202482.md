The Virginia Community College System develops a consortium of two-year
colleges, industry, and four-year universities to provide students throughout
Virginia with a consistent set of IT knowledge and skills. The consortium
integrates into the curriculum industry-desired "value delivery skills," which
include the employability skills described by the SCANS report and also more
mathematics and science. The SCANS 2000 Center at Johns Hopkins provides
guidance for adapting or designing classroom and laboratory activities.
Assessments with rubrics are developed to measure the extent to which students
gain the needed competencies. Workshops, along with electronic follow-up,
educate the faculty in new ways of facilitating the learning of IT knowledge and
skills. Pilot test activities determine the efficacy of the courses and the
faculty professional development. Connections are made to high schools through
Tech Prep.
