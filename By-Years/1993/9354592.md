9354592 Snell CHANCE is a course designed to teach fundamental ideas of
probability and statistics in the context of real world questions of current
interest. Such questions might include: Do basketball players tend to shoot in
streaks? Do lefties die younger than righties? How reliable are opinion polls?
Do men tend to die just before their birthdays and women just after them? Does
lowering your cholesterol make you more likely to die by murder, accident, or
suicide? CHANCE students learn that with the help of basic notions of
probability and statistics, they can think critically for themselves about
issues such as these. Teaching a CHANCE course only requires a solid knowledge
of probability and statistics, boundless enthusiasm, the time and energy needed
to keep up with the news, a receptive administration, a good library, and a
willingness to plunge into uncharted territory. Materials are being developed
and online resources are available by computer network that will make it
significantly simpler to institute and teach a CHANCE course.
