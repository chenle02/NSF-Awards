Dr. Joseph W. Lauher and other members of the Chemistry Department of SUNY-Stony
Brook are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate students will
spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.
Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical, inorganic,
organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of this program is the
focus on students from colleges and universities with large minority populations
including historically Black Colleges.
