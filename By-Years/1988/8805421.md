Many eukaryotic protein-encoding genes are interrupted by intervening sequences
(IVSs) which are excised from mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) by RNA splicing. The
long-term objective of the Investigator's research is to understand how pre-mRNA
splice sites are correctly recognized and joined in an orderly way during RNA
splicing. In previous work, Dr. Spritz has studied the sequence requirements for
splice site recognition, the pathways by which IVSs are excised from complex
pre-mRNAs, alternative pre-mRNA splicing, sites by and the structure of U1 small
nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNP) which mediate recognition of 5'
splice sites. The P.I. has isolated cDNA and genomic clones encoding the hU1-70K
protein, a specific component of U1 snRNP that may be directly involved in
5'splice site recognition. He has already demonstrated that this protein binds
RNA and have begun to map the RNA-binding sites in the protein. He now proposes
to characterize the structure and expression of the human gene encoding the
hU1-70K snRNP protein, to define the sites in the U1-70K protein that mediate
its interaction with U1 snRNA, pre-mRNA, and other snRNP proteins, and it
determine how specific substitutions in the hU1-70K protein affect 5' splice
site recognition by U1 snRNP. He also plans to perform similar studies of other
U1 snRNP proteins. These studies should thus be of profound importance for
elucidating the process of 5' splice site recognition by U1 snRNP. DNA of living
cells codes for cellular proteins via the intermediation of RNA. The RNA that is
transcribed from the DNA is larger than the functional form that is translated
into proteins. The processing of the transcribed form to the functional form
involves the removal of segments of RNA from the interior of the molecule, a
process known as splicing. The investigator has identified one of the components
of the splicing machinery and is study the manner in which it acts.
