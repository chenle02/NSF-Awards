This study will speed the design of adsorptive protein separations, with
emphasis on efficient scale-up. The focus is on instrumental techniques for
direct measurement of key separation parameters: o Intraparticle diffusion
coefficients, needed to predict effectiveness of any adsorptive process and
especially important at the high loadings of commercial separators. Pulsed field
gradient NMR techniques will be used for this purpose. o Adsorption kinetics,
needed to predict resolution and yield losses, and again most important at high
solute loading. o Convective dispersion coefficients, to characterize the
effects of system geometry and flow conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging will
be used. Success will permit rational design based on underlying transport and
reaction principles, and thus not only to optimize process conditions but also
to consider alternate processing modes and equipment configurations. This
research will enhance the development of therapeutic proteins and other
important new drugs and also reduce the cost of producing them by providing
improved procedures for downstream processing, isolation, and purification from
fermentation broths or other crude sources. Downstream processing accounts for
50 to 80 percent of total production costs but has tended to be neglected by
engineers relative to other aspects of the production process. Attention is
focused here on adsorptive separations, such as chromatography, because these
are particularly effective for two critically important classes of therapeutic
agents: proteins and synthetic organics. Speeding commercial development is
necessary if we are to prevent competitors from capitalizing on the discoveries
of American medical and biological researchers.
