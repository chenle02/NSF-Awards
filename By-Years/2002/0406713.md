AST-0406713&lt;br/&gt;Gott&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make
definitive measurements of the topology of large-scale structure in the
Universe, using ground-based and space-based data to provide important tests of
inflation and galaxy formation models. Results from smaller samples are
consistent with the random phase distribution expected from inflation. However,
small but measurable deviations are expected due to nonlinear galaxy formation
processes, and a much larger sample should yield precise constraints on these
effects. Topology statistics will be used to test models for galaxy biasing. The
research team will use the powerful combination of new data, innovative
statistical techniques, and high-resolution simulations to address fundamental
questions about both cosmology and galaxy formation. This project will include
the development of material for public education, and will foster research by
women, international collaboration, and outreach to planetaria. The lead
investigator is very committed to promoting teaching, training and education,
and the maps from this work may provide the most exciting visualizations of
important surveys.
