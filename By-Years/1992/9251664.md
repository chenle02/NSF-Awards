The goal of this proposal is to bring modern spectroscopic methods into our
laboratory courses in physical chemistry. The specific aims of our proposal are:
1) to create five modern spectroscopic experiments based on a pulsed dye laser
system; 2) to specify an instrument package that is within the budgetary reach
of chemistry departments at most institutions; 3) to develop the experiments to
the point that they can be adopted by instructors who lack prior expertise in
laser spectroscopy; 4) to expose students in the introductory and advanced
physical chemistry laboratories to modern techniques in physical chemistry; and
5) to communicate the results of our program both regionally and nationally
through presentations at scientific meetings and publication.
