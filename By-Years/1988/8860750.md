The processing parameters, which govern the roughness of a surface generated by
waterjet and abrasive-waterjet cutting, will be studied experimentally and
theoretically. A theoretical model will be used interactively with experimental
analysis to suggest special turn key tests. A basic understanding of the
mechanism, which generate surface striation, should suggest techniques for
improving the surface finish of waterjet cutting.
