Theoretical linguistics has been hampered by the lack of adequate and easily
accessible grammatical information for a wide range of languages. This project
intends to address these problems as follows: (a) Adequacy: devise a detailed
descriptive framework, based on cross-linguistically valid analyses, in which
grammatical phenomena will be characterized in terms of both form and function.
(b) Accessibility: implement this framework in a flexible hypertext software
environment that will serve as a tool for the writing of grammars by field
linguists and as a source of cross-linguistic grammatical information for
theoretical linguists.
