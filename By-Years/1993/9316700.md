9316700 DeCelles Critical-wedge models provide useful generalization of the
gross geometry of fold-thrust belts and accretionary wedges, as well as specific
predictions for their internal kinematic development and rheologic behavior.
However, comparison of critical-wedge models to geologic examples has been
limited to static analysis of modern accretionary wedges and fold-thrust belts
and with only partial success in ancient foreland fold-thrust belts. Present
models remain largely untested in four area: wedge shape through time, internal
wedge structure, effect of erosion and foreland basin subsidence, and link
between material properties and the discrete internal structures such as
foreland-younging fold-thrusts. This project will address these issues by
focusing on quantitative incremental retrodeformation of wedge shape and
internal thrust geometry for a 36 million year period of hinterland basement
uplift and foreland thin-skinned thrust slip in the well-known Wyoming-Utah
Sevier Thrust Belt. Results are expected to test several important correlaries
of the critical-wedge theory, as well as help resolve regional questions
concerning the geometric and kinematic relationships between faults in this
thrust belt.
