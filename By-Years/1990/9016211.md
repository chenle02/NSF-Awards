The research will investigate the appearance of instabilities and performance
degradation in computer communication networks; in particular, in CSMA/CD (IEEE
802.3) local area networks. It will be primarily analytic, with a substantial
numerical component. The CSMA/CD model will incorporate extensive packet
buffering, retransmission counters,and bursty packet arrivals on each network
node. Criteria for network stability will be determined, and the first exit time
(the mean time to performance degradation in a heavily loaded network) will be
computed analytically as a function of network parameters. The research is quite
interdisciplinary, including circuit switched networks,and models of local
rather global bus contention. The mathematical methods are analytic rather than
numerical and allow precise determination of the transient behavior of unstable
systems. They are supplemented by numerical computation and comparison with the
results of network simulation.
