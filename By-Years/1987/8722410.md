This project is concerned with diagnostics of circulation and climate
anomalies, and statistical climate prediction for tropical regions. Specific
tasks to be tackled over the next three years are : (1) The development of
prediction methodology for selected tropical regions including Northeast Brazil,
sub- Saharan West Africa, Northwestern South America, and India- Indonesia
sector, (2) mechanisons of the seasonality of the Southern Oscillation, (3) long
term climate changes in Eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean over the past 130
years, (4) the relation of Indian summer and winter monsoons, and (5) the role
of Tibetan Plateau in tropical circulation anomalies. These studies will improve
our understanding of the important physical processes that link regional and
planetary-scale circulations in the tropics.
