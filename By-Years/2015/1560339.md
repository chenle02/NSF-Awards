This proposal supports the training of 30 undergraduate students in climate
science research. The proposal is for three years. Ten students each year during
the summer will have a choice of conducting research in multiple disciplines,
such as atmospheric science, oceanography, terrestrial ecology, chemistry and
biogeochemistry. The overall objective is to attract a diverse group of students
to climate science research by simulating the graduate research environment as
closely as possible. The program is a complete immersion in the research process
complemented with weekly activities to enhance students' professional
development through workshops on basic research skills and seminars on science
communication, ethics, graduate school, and career opportunities. Students will
report their research in the form of a peer-reviewed journal article and a talk
in the style of a scientific conference or a video for a general audience.
