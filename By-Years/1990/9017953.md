The PIs propose to develop a 2 course sequence on high performance scientific
computing for undergraduate students, together with a laboratory to support
these courses. They will develop text books, manuals, and software for both
courses and laboratory exercises and will attempt to disseminate these materials
to other institutions via summer workshops. Five institutions have agreed to
collaborate with Colorado and to offer similar courses to their own students.
Laboratory facilities will include high speed workstations, graphics
workstations, and an INTEL iPSC. Remote ascess to a Cray Y-MP will also be
provided. This proposal has the potential to produce badly needed computational
scientists to address the national needs in high performance computing.
