Lythotripsy has become a widely accepted method of noninvasively crushing kidney
and gall stones. This treatment, however, can result in short-term or long-term
injuries. The proposed work is to take a fundamental look at the propagation of
shock waves and their interaction with tissue in an attempt to allow the
eventual development of improved devices. Phase I research will develop
instrumentation to record shock waves from outside the patient's body, will take
measurements in a non-living experimental setup, and will compare the
experimental results from those predicted by theory. The effects of cavitation
and the information carried by the scattered waves will be also examined.
