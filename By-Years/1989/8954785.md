This project provides an opportunity for a select group of middle school
teachers of mathematics (grades 6-8) to learn the basic concepts of discrete
mathematics, probability, and mathematical modeling, and to write materials for
a curriculum guide for use in middle school classes. Two subgroups of 21
teachers will participate for three academic quarters. Each subgroup will spend
two academic quarters studying topics in discrete mathematics, probability, and
mathematical modeling. The third quarter will be devoted to the preparation of
supplementary curricular materials on these topics appropriate for middle school
students. During the summer quarters of 1990 and 1991, the University of
Cincinnati faculty associated with the project, assisted by a middle school
mathematics teacher, will edit the modules written by the participants, develop
additional modules, and add a bibliography, background material, and appropriate
computer software. It is anticipated that the curriculum guide will be
duplicated and distributed at the end of the summer, 1991. A six-hour workshop
for 30 additional middle school teachers is planned for autumn, 1991, to provide
a wider distribution of the curriculum guide. Non-NSF cost sharing for this
project is 5% of the award total.
