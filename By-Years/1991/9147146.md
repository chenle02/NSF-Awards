The Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center at Colorado School
of Mines is an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center engaged in
research related to the processing and performance of advanced steels. The
research program covers sheet, bar, plate and specialty steels. The Center also
provides an important forum for government laboratories like NIST, SERI, US
Army, etc., to interact with industrial laboratories and discuss new
technologies that might benefit producers and users of steel. This award for
$37,500 is part of a continuing award for three years totaling $117,500 for the
Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research Program initiation in the I/UCRC
program. The Program Director recommends an award.
