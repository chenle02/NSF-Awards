9305271 Rich This grant is focussed on increasing our understanding of RNA. The
major approach used in this work is x-ray diffraction studies of single crystals
of RNA components, as well as RNA binding proteins. X-ray diffraction studies
allows one to determine the three-dimensional structure of the molecule. The
major experimental challenge in this work is to obtain crystals that have
suitable degrees of regularity, so that the analysis can be carried out to
uncover fine details of molecular structure. %%% RNA plays a very important role
in biological systems. Not only does it act to convey information from DNA that
results in directing the synthesis of proteins, but it also forms a number of
structural elements that form part of the machinery of the cell. The goal of
this research is to crystallize segments of RNA that contain various structural
motifs. These elements determine the way that RNA folds upon itself or forms in
a number of different conformations. RNA has recently been shown to have
enzymatic activity. The structure of these "ribozymes" will also be studied. In
general, understanding the three-dimensional structure of the RNA may lead to an
enhanced awareness of how the molecule functions in its biological context.
Knowing the structure of proteins that bind to RNA and the manner in which they
specifically interact also enhances our understanding of its role. ***
