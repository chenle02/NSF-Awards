The focus is science and mathematics education for non-science majors. A team of
ten faculty members from the science and mathematics departments at DePaul
University will develop a three quarter, interdisciplinary science sequence,
with mathematics integrated throughout. In the sequence, students will explore
the basic principles underlying modern science and the growing degree to which
multidisciplinary approaches are needed to attack problems in health, ecology,
and the environment. The sequence will emphasize the scientific process, as well
as major themes in physics, chemistry, and biology. Although the sequence will
be developed for all non-science majors, the project will give special attention
to those preparing to be teachers. In collaboration with DePaul's Center for
Urban Education, the project will establish structured clinical experiences for
education majors in public elementary and middle schools in Chicago. Acting as
Scientists in Residence in these schools, students will adapt hands-on
activities from the course for the children and teachers.
