To design a high-performance, fine-grain parallel architecture, three main
problems must be addressed. They are: (i) the provision of an appropriate
operation issuing mechanism, (ii) the provision of an adequate resource
architecture and (iii) the provision of an adequate memory architecture. The
solutions to each of these problems is heavily influenced by the nature of
parallelism that exists in application programs. In this research, these
problems are investigated, and solutions are developed and evaluated. The major
difference between the effort and previous efforts will be the focus on
exposing, rather than hiding, data dependencies.
