Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) is an HBCU that graduates one of the highest
numbers of Black engineers in the nation. This project is focused on increasing
engineering education research at PVAMU using mixed reality (MR) as an active
learning tool. In MR experiences, digital elements are superimposed onto
physical environments and real-world objects and users interact with 3D digital
elements through headsets rather than via a screen, thus providing a truly
immersive experience. Mixed reality is an innovative and transformative
technology that has the potential to improve learning, both in the classroom and
in the laboratory, and offer students digital learning experiences that they
find engaging and valuable whether they are in the same setting as their lab
colleagues or participating remotely. MR technology is growing in importance and
is already being used in a plethora of applications: business, medicine, and
architecture to name a few. We will extend the use of MR by creating MR-based
instructional environments to provide first-person, immersive learning
experiences unavailable in traditional classroom formats and to measure their
impact on instruction and students.

Research has shown that students demonstrate better learning outcomes if their
learning encompasses a strong experiential component. This project is actively
seeking methods to implement a practical complement to classroom instruction.
Mixed reality technology a first-person, immersive experience relevant to the
learner which can bridge the gap between theory and practice without involving
risk and expensive expendables while eliminating practical limitations (e.g.,
accessing the inner workings of an active process or structure). This project
will create MR environments to advance Chemical Engineering as well as
Electrical and Computer Engineering courses for students who are predominantly
first generation and underrepresented minorities. The research planned will
address five questions using descriptive, quasi-experimental, and qualitative
methods. Descriptive elements include the degree to which specific forms of
learning are achieved and what are desired applications for MR. Application of
MR in engineering has the potential to increase accessibility for students by
meeting people where they are, thus addressing equity initiatives while
increasing opportunity for engagement and individualization of learning.
