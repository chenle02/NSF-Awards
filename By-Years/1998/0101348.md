Dr. Paul R. Sharp, Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri at Columbia,
is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work on the
organometallic chemistry at the edge of polycyclic aromatic carbon compounds.
Specifically, the chemistry of polycyclic aromatic yne and metallacycle
complexes will be developed as a means to construct carbon nanotubes by a step-
growth approach based on permetalated naphthalenes, coronenes, and
coroannulenes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbon nanotubes will be constructed by
special design at the molecular level. These nanotubes will provide other
researchers opportunities to explore novel electronic properties of one-
dimensional conducting systems. They will also find applications in such areas
as nanoscale electronic devices, field emitters, hydrogen storage, and non-
linear optics. Graduate students and post-doctoral associates will receive
enviable training from the molecular scale chemistry to the nanoscale dimension.
