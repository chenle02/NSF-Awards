9420086 Rowell This award supports a series of workshops by the Antarctic
Lithosphere Working Group (LWG). This group affords a broad conduit for exchange
of information between the earth sciences program within the US Antarctic
Program (USAP) and the diverse parts of the earth science community. As such it
is a forum for discussion of the future goals of Antarctic geology and
geophysics research and the future needs of researchers from the operational
portion of the USAP. More specifically, the group brings to the program, ideas
about new scientific and technical opportunities, programmatic needs, and
programmatic opportunities as perceived by the wider earth science community.
The LWG also serves to provide feedback to the program on logistical support
questions relating to the USAP. In providing this function, the LWG constitutes
a useful management tool to help integrate science goals with operational
portions of the US Antarctic Program. ***
