9727959 Jackson This proposal addresses the question of how plant cells
communicate with each other to coordinate their development. The PIs are
studying intercellular transport -- the movement of proteins and other molecules
from one plant cell into another. This process takes place through small
channels, celled plasmodesmata, that connect plant cells and allow them to
communicate with their neighbors. The PIs are focusing specifically on the
KNOTTED1 (KN1) protein in maize. This protein is in a class of transcription
factors called homeodomain proteins that are vital to orchestrating the
development of many organisms. In maize the kn1 related genes are expressed in
the meristem, the developmental heart of the flowering plant. The PIs found
previously that the KN1 protein is able to move or traffic between plant cells,
and this process may be important in coordinating the development of the plant.
The PIs will use fluorescent labels to observe KN1, as it moves from one cell to
the next; ultimately the PIs hope to elucidate the mechanisms and pathways
involved in its intercellular transport. This work holds great promise for
agricultural applications; the mechanisms of cell to cell trafficking that are
discovered will likely apply not only to cellular proteins like KN1, but also to
viral pathogens that cause considerable damage to farm crops each year.
