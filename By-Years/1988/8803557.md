This proposal requests support for continued research on laser interferometer
gravitational wave detectors. The goals of this program are: (1) to demonstrate
the technical feasibility of this concept through the construction of extremely
sensitive laboratory prototype receivers and, (2) to undertake preliminary
planning and cost analysis for full scale detectors which are 100 times larger.
This joint undertaking of the California Institute of Technology and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology is based on laser interferometer systems.
The ultimate goals of this program include definitive tests of Einstein's theory
of gravitation and the opening of a new observational window onto the universe.
