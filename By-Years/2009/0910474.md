The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports Professor Jason Coym of
the University of South Alabama to explore novel additives (e.g. cholesterol)
for varying selectivity and retention in reversed-phase liquid chromatography
(RPLC). Perhaps the most commonly used form of liquid chromatography, RPLC is a
key method for separating analytes in solution, and is used heavily in
pharmaceutical and biochemical settings. The work entails dynamically coating
cholesterol onto the stationary phase, as a simpler and more flexible
alternative to typical covalent linkage. A parallel aim is to use cholesterol-
enhanced and lipid-coated phases as membrane mimics for studies of
biopartitioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of unique chromatographic
selectivities, and the ability to easily modulate selectivity, is of broad
interest to analytical and bioanalytical chemists. Students working on this
project will gain knowledge and practice working with chromatography, physical
chemistry, and biochemistry, thereby coming to realize the interdependence of
the various disciplines of chemistry.
