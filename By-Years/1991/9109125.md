The cytoskeleton, the framework of the cell, is responsible for the shape of
neurons. The neuronal cytoskeleton is important for maintaining the structure
and function of mature nerve cells and is involved in making functional contacts
between these cells. This research project addresses events by which the process
of protein phosphorylation may affect the organization and function of the
neuronal cytoskeleton. Experiments utilizing a combination of in vivo and in
vitro protein phosphorylation analysis techniques such as two-dimensional
phosphopeptide mapping, isolation and sequencing of phosphopeptides and probes
of interaction between cytoskeletal proteins will be performed to define the
complex role of phosphorylation. Neuronal cytoskeletal proteins, fodrin and a
newly recognized protein, HPN-350, characterized by an high number of
phosphorylated groups, will be examined during subunit polymerization, axonal
entry, and incorporation into the axonal cytoskeleton. Results of this study
will provide additional information on neuronal cytoskeleton dynamics, pertinent
to basic neurobiological issues of developmental growth and neuronal plasticity.
