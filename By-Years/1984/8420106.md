This is a study of low-frequency noise in solid state devices such as Bipolar
Junction Transistors (BJTs), Heterojunction Bipolar Junction Transistors
(HBJTs), MESFETs, MODFETs, MOSFETs and Permeable Base Transistors (PBTs) in the
frequency range 10 Hz - 890 MHz and the temperature range 300 - 10 K. The aim is
to study frequency, bias, and temperature dependence of the noise to unravel the
low-frequency noise processes present. Freeze-out effects will be studied. In
BJTs and HBJTs, possible correlation effects between base and collector noise
and the nature of burst noise and its possible correlation with 1/f noise will
be considered.
