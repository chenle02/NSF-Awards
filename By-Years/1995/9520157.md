The focus of this research is the use of hypervalent iodine reagents in
synthesis. Iodonium ylides will be used to affect enantioselective
intramolecular cyclopropanation, aziridination and the generation of high energy
carbocation equivalents. Iodonium ylides containing I-I bonds will be
synthesized because of interest in iodine-iodine conjugation in connection with
conducting organic molecules. Finally, the use of hypervalent iodine substrates
in palladium catalysed carbon-carbon bond forming reactions will be persued.
With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Robert M. Moriarty of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois
at Chicago. Dr. Moriarty will focus his work on the use of hypervalent iodine
reagents in organic synthesis. Hypervalent iodine compounds form a class of
environmentally safe, versatile reagents which can be used in a variety of
useful synthetic transformations.
