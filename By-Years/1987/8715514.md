Aller will use the Hamilton echelle spectrograph at Lick Observatory to obtain
spectra of planetary nebulae at high dispersion and with a broad wavelength
coverage. The goal is to measure the intensities of spectral lines that
previously were too faint and/or too blended with other lines. This should yield
accurate chemical compositions for a small sample of bright nebulae for which
much complementary information has already been obtained in other wavelength
ranges. Planetary nebulae are gaseous nebulae that have been expelled from aging
stars. The nebulae contain the elements generated within the stars and thus
inform us of stellar nucleosynthesis during an important but otherwise
inaccessible phase of a star's life. Aller will use a new spectrograph at Lick
Observatory to observe selected planetary nebulae, specifically to measure
accurately much fainter spectrum lines than has been possible heretofore. This
will yield greatly improved stellar chemical abundances and, simultaneously,
much new atomic information not obtainable in the laboratory.
