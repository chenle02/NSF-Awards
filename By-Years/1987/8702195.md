This research is to develop an approach to modelling correlation over time by
means of auto-regressive moving average estimates rather than by means of the
traditional assumption of equicorrelated repeated measures. Traditional
statistical theory is restricted by the assumptions that (1) measurements taken
on experimental subjects are all taken serially at the same times, (2) the
series of measurements taken on each subject can be well represented by
polynomials of the same degree, (3) the polynomial coefficients have a
multivariate normal distribution across subjects and (4) the number of subjects
is greater than the sum of the degree of the polynomials and the number of
constants used to model the dependent variables in the multivariate analysis.
The proposed research aims to provide a theoretical framework that will
accommodate experiments where these assumptions are unrealistic and invalid. A
major tool to be used in determining algorithms for calculating the exact
likelihoods is the Kalman filter, by which serial correlations can be modeled
within each subject. This research is in the general area of time series
analysis, an area receiving an increasing amount of attention in statistics. The
attention is reflective of the push to free statistical methods from "classical"
assumptions which were largely imposed because of the traditionally high costs
of computation. The aim of this research is to provide sound statistical methods
for a common experimental situation; experiments in this class do not have
appropriate, i.e. meaningful, statistical tools available for assessing effects
and trends. The experimental situation which will be impacted by this research
occurs in many sciences and is characterized by the goal of assessing the
effects of some factors or treatments that may change over time, coupled with a
lack of experimenter control over exactly when and where measurements can be
taken.
