Dr. Dunkerton will conduct a series of investigations designed to improve
understanding of the structure of the tropical troposphere and lower
stratosphere, including its intraseasonal and interannual variations, effects of
tropical phenomena on the extratropical atmosphere and vice versa, coupling
between the troposphere and stratosphere, and stratosphere-troposphere exchange.
The research will consist of both observational analyses and theoretical
modeling. Particular emphasis will be given to the studies of the effect of
gravity-wave variation on the stratospheric quasi- biennial oscillation (QBO),
the evolution of the tropopause temperature and dynamical processes responsible
for its variation, and the effect of baroclinic waves on the Hadley circulation.
