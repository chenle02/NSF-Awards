This project analyzes the ways in which federal criminal defendants make use of
the right of allocution during sentencing hearings. When given the opportunity
to address the court, defendants often make some sort of apology to their
families, the court, or the government. Naturally occurring apologies provide a
rich forum for the study of affective meaning the communication of feelings,
attitudes, and relational dispositions of all types because the sincerity of an
apology is crucial to its successful performance in a way that does not seem to
hold for other speech acts. The investigator will identify the implicatures
generated by the choice of one apology form compared to others, and will link
these implicatures to the ideology of the hearing developed, in order to assess
the apology's relative goodness. The investigation will contribute to the
general understanding of the speech act of apologies, and to the specific ways
in which the constraints of this particular institutional setting affect the
forms of the apologies produced there. The project will thus inform both the
literature on apologies specifically and to speech acts more generally.
