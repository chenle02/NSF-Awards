This research involves the investigation of new designs in high-performance
reluctance machines. The design methodology, finite element analysis, and a
novel technique for studying energy conversion capabilities are proposed to be
investigated. A laboratory prototype model is proposed for testing. Vector
current decoupled control of the machine based on optimal current angles for
maximum power factor, maximum efficiency, and maximum transient torque
operations is proposed to be studied and implemented.
