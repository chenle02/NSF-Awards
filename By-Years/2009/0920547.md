The Gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta, is an unusual fish that excretes urea as its
primary nitrogen waste product in distinct pulses, measured by a sudden increase
in the appearance of urea in the surrounding water. A urea transporter has been
cloned from toadfish gill (tUT) that is similar in amino acid sequence to
mammalian urea transporters and the pulse of urea is believed to be due to the
periodic activation of tUT, allowing for the movement of urea from the blood,
across the gill, into the water. How tUT is turned on and off is not well
understood, however, but research to this point has determined that the stress
hormone, cortisol, and the neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT), are involved.
High levels of cortisol appear to prevent tUT activation while 5-HT stimulates
tUT function. The action of 5-HT appears to be mediated by a serotonin receptor
subtype with pharmacological characteristics similar to mammalian serotonin type
2A (5-HT2A) receptors. This project aims to further examine the regulation of
tUT by investigating how cortisol and 5-HT control tUT function and determine
whether the actions of cortisol and 5-HT influence each other. Molecular
techniques and in vitro tissue preparations will be used in parallel with whole
animal studies to test the hypothesis that tUT function is controlled directly
by 5-HT and indirectly by cortisol. These studies will also test the hypothesis
that toadfish 5-HT2A receptors in the gill are involved in tUT activation and
these receptors are not able to activate tUT when cortisol levels are high. The
findings of this project will expand our understanding of nitrogen waste
metabolism and excretion in fish and terrestrial organisms. In addition, results
of this research will provide insight into the interactions between 5HT and
cortisol, signals that are central to several human disorders. University of
Miami has a diverse student body and this project will provide research
experiences for students who are underrepresented in science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
