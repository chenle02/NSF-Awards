This research project is an experiment in the acquisition, use, and revision of
knowledge for expert systems. The system, named PROTOS, interacts with a human
expert to elicit knowledge. PROTOS then independently applies this knowledge to
perform the expert task. Our research addresses three fundamental issues in
concept formation and classification: First, PROTOS learns and uses naturally
occurring, partially undefined concepts. Second, PROTOS uses learned knowledge
in multiple ways, as people do, to generate examples of a concept, to predict
unseen features of an object, to interpret ambiguous examples, and to explain
its classification decisions. Third, PROTOS learns from teacher-supplied
explanations, so that human experts can facilitate knowledge transfer beyond
simply giving examples. Computer systems with intelligent behaviour must acquire
and reason with formidable amounts of knowledge. Because it improves the methods
by which computers can absorb knowledge, this research is vitally important. The
PROTOS system itself will first be applied, as a testbed example, to the task of
learning expert knowledge for clinical audiology.
