During embryonic development of the peripheral nervous system, migrating
neurons and their advancing growth cones must traverse and penetrate a variety
of extracellular impediments to reach their targets. The secretion of proteases,
including plasminogen activators, are thought to facilitate movement of neurons
and their growth cones by locally digesting impeding cell-cell and cell- matrix
components. To study this process, developmental changes in the genetic
expression of plasminogen activators will be studied in mouse sensory ganglia in
vivo and in cell culture. Molecular probes will be used to study the type of
cells synthesizing plasminogen activators as well as possible regulation of
plasminogen activator expression by various growth factors. The role of
plasminogen activators in axonal growth will be assessed by blocking synthesis
with antisense oligonucleotides. These studies are important not only for
increasing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying normal neuronal
development, but also those that may play a role during regeneration of
peripheral nerves in the mammal.
