The Oregon Institute of Technology is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a
56,000 bits per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level network. The
connection enables the school's faculty and students to communicate and
collaborate with the international scientific and educational community, and to
access network resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers. This
award funds part of the costs for two years.
