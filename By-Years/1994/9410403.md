9410403 Linderman This project is on research to study the relationship between
receptor number, ligand-receptor binding kinetics, G-protein number and cellular
responses. This involves the systematic manipulation of binding kinetics and the
quantitative characterization of complex intracellular responses. The neutrophil
cell responses to N-formyl peptides will be used as a model system for this
study. The specific objectives of the research are: (1) to examine the role of
N-formyl peptide receptors by varying the number participating in signal
transduction; (2) to examine the role of G-proteins by varying the number
participating in signal transduction; (3) to develop a mathematical model of
receptor binding and G-protein activation; and (4) to verify the model by
predicting cell responses when receptor and G-protein are manipulated. This
research could lead to both improved cell response and the design of
pharmaceuticals. ***
