This proposal requests NSF support to broaden participation in the International
Workshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing. This workshop covers
all aspects of languages, compiler techniques, run-time environments, and
architectures for parallel and high-performance computing. The organizers asked
for financial support in the amount of $2,500 to offset the registration fees
for US-based students.
