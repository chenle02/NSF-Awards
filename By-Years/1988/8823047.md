Atmospheric oxygen in the lower thermosphere is a major factor in the chemistry
of that region and in the variability of ozone, OH, O2, NO and a host of others.
In situ measurements of O in that region are difficult and controversial, large
variability and order of magnitude changes make modelling difficult. This
program is attempting to determine the relationship between atmospheric dynamics
and the variability of atomic oxygen through combined Fabry Perot optical and
incoherent scatter radar measurements. These data will be used to assess and
improve the various global atmospheric dynamic, chemical, and emission models
that exist.
