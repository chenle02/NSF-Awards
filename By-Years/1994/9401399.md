9401399 Thompson This award supports research on finite groups, discrete groups
and Galois groups. The principal investigator will determine if the trace
spectrum of a uniformizing group of a 4-punctured sphere is determined by the
punctures. Given a natural number n, he will see if SL(2,2^n) is the Galois
group of a regular extension of Q(T), where Q denotes the rationals, such that
at most 4 points of the T-line ramify. He will also consider for a given number
field K if there is a finite set S(K) of finite simple groups with the property
that every finite group G, all of whose irrecudible characters have values in K,
has all its composition factors alternating groups or in S(K). A group is an
algebraic structure with a single operation. It appears in many areas of
mathematics, as well as physics and chemistry. One of the major problems in
algebra is concerned with identifying those groups which can be represented as a
Galois group over the rationals. This involves a blend of algebra, number theory
and algebraic geometry.
