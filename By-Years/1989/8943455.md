The Engineering Research Center for Advanced Technology for Large Structural
Systems at Lehigh University conducts integrated research and education programs
in design, fabrication, construction, and in-service monitoring of structures.
Major efforts are focused on design of connections for automated construction,
creation of knowledge-based systems for computer integration of construction
processes, applicability and efficacy of novel structural materials for initial
construction and for structural rehabilitation, and sensing and instrumentation
for in-service monitoring of structure condition and performance. A large multi-
wall loading facility has been completed and is available for research
experimentation. This action is a five year renewal.
