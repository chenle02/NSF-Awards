9410164 Li The proposed research is concerned with mathematical modelling in
economics and the underlying mathematical problems by both theoretical and
numerical analysis. The project consists of two parts. The first part is on the
modelling of the so-called open-market operations and the second part on the
market uncertainty. For both parts of the research, it is proposed to refine
some existing models and develop some possible new models. Theoretical analyses
are proposed with the use of techniques such as nonlinear functional analysis,
probability, and dynamical systems erical blems. It is proposed to design
various numerical algorithms and analyze their convergence and stability, and
develop numerical codes to be used for simulation as well as for guiding the
proposed theoretical studies. ***
