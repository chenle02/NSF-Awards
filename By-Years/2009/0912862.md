This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to create a
content and delivery platform to facilitate interactive learning for career
education - addressing the application in support of teaching and/or learning
subtopic. The project will develop a prototype of the Career Simulation
Environment (CSE) - an engaging, exploratory and constructivist environment that
will better inform youth about the kind of opportunities that will be available
to them when they grow up. In addition, it will reinforce the habits, skills and
values that they should acquire in preparation for those opportunities. It is
hypothesized that students will be more motivated to explore careers in an
active manner and more motivated to pursue careers that they have been able to
'taste'.

Career simulations must be complex enough to gain credibility with students, be
comprehensive enough to model career skills and satisfy curriculum requirements,
and yet be highly usable. This project is uniquely suited to address this
problem by combining best practices and research from the fields of adolescent
career preparation, human computer interaction, gaming and e-learning. The
proposed research will substantially extend previous research and practice in
career exploration through an interdisciplinary approach to the development of
and evaluation of career explorations simulation tools.
