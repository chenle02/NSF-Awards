Proposal Number: ECS-9612634 Principal Investigator: Nader Engheta Title:
Theoretical study of applications of fractional calculus in electromagnetism In
this research, a theoretical investigation using the fractional calculus
approach to waves and geometries of interest will be developed. The fractional
calculus approach enables the study of waves and structures with an intermediate
character. It is an area which has been developed with major contributions from
the PI. Under the present study, the following topics will be investigated: (1)
"fractional" intermediate sources and (2) applications of fractional calculus in
electromagnetic scattering. Dual investigations of geometries and boundaries for
which an incident plane waves generates scattered waves with fractional
characteristics, and, conversely the scattering of incident waves with
fractional characteristics from various geometries will be carried out. In each
of these areas, a new corresponding development of the theory itself will be
investigated (1') extension of the concept of fractional order multipoles for
complex sources involving electric and magnetic fractional-order multipoles
and/or aperture fields and (2') the development of a "fractional" curl operator,
both for analysis of the electromagnetic scattering interactions as stated in
(2) and for investigation the basic concepts involved in the duality of the
fractional character of the waves and the geometries.
