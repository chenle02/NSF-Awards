The objective of the proposal is to study the regulation of the hbp gene in
Escherichia coli. The hbp gene product is very similar in amino sequence to a
hemoglobin-like protein from a Vitreoscilla sp. and like the Vitreoscilla
protein is regulated in response to environmental oxygen concentration. The
specific aims of the proposal are: 1. Physiological characterization of hbp gene
regulation in wild-type and mutant strains. 2. Genetic characterization of hbp
gene expression. 3. Identify and characterize the sequence required for hbp
regulation from the hbp promoter. The information obtained from this research
will contribute to the present knowledge on gene expression in response to
environmental factors, and will also contribute to the overall understanding of
gene regulation.
