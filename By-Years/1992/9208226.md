The mean lifetimes of metastable, low energy multi-charged ions are measured
using trapping techniques. The ions are obtained from a cyclotron source and the
intensity of decay photons measured against ion storage times. Spectroscopic
measurements of forbidden as well as electric dipole allowed transitions will be
carried out using the method of collinear laser-ion beam spectroscopy. Hyperfine
quenching will be studied using different isotopes of the same element. The data
will be compared with recent theoretical calculations using many-body
perturbations theory and multi-configuration Dirac-Fock theory.
