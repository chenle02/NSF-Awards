95-22134 Ritchie The proposed project is focused on developing a detailed
understanding and quantitative models of the physics and fundamental mechanisms
of cyclic fatigue damage and crack advance in monolithic ceramics at elevated
temperatures. The central aim of the present study is to characterize and model
the cyclic fatigue behavior of ceramics at high homologous temperatures to
examine the comparable damage and crack advance mechanisms in both air and
vacuum environments. The approach will utilize ultrahigh temperatures (up to
1800C) creep and fatigue -crack growth testing facilities to examine subcritical
cracking in a range of microstructures in monolithic alumina, silicon nitride
and silicon carbide ceramics, chosen to vary grain size and morphology, the
crystallinity of the grain-boundary phase, etc., together with detailed
microstructural characterization (using both in situ imaging and pre- and post-
failure electron microscopy) of the cycle-dependent degradation of shielding
mechanisms behind the crack tip and the accumulated microstructural damage by
intrinsic creep and fatigue mechanisms ahead of the tip. %%% With the scientific
understanding gained, this work is intended to provide guidelines for the design
of improved microstructures and compositions for flaw-tolerant ceramics with
optimal combinations of low-temperature toughness and elevated-temperature
resistance to subcritical fatigue-crack growth. ***
