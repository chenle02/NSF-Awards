Harizanov applies computability theoretic concepts and methods to study how
various algorithmic properties of mathematical structures interact with their
algebraic and topological properties. Harizanov focuses on the complexity of
countable structures, their isomorphisms, and natural relations on structures,
and connections between definability and algorithmic complexity. She
investigates both general structures in model theoretic setting, as well as
concrete algebraic models from well-known classes. Harizanov works on a broad
range of topics including effective categoricity of structures, Turing and
strong degree spectra of relations, computable structures of high Scott rank,
and degrees of the isomorphism types of geometric structures. The project also
involves new directions in computable mathematics with close connections with
universal algebra, such as the study of automorphism degree spectra and
effective Fraisse limits, and with close connections with low-dimensional
topology, such as the study of complexity of orders on certain torsion-free
groups.

Computable mathematics is currently a very active research area. It is of
importance in theoretical mathematics and computer science and in the philosophy
of mathematics. It combines ideas and techniques of computability theory with
methods of other areas of mathematics to solve important complexity and
classification problems. Many mathematical problems have algorithmic solutions.
For those problems that are fundamentally non-algorithmic, we use sophisticated
and often unique computability theoretic methods to further investigate their
computational content. Such methods include Turing and other degree theoretic
analysis of relative computational complexity of sets and problems they encode.
