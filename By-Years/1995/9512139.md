With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the MIT Economics
Department Computer Cluster will upgrade its computing facility. As a result of
an explosion in the role of computation in economic research, the Department has
reached the limits of existing hardware. To alleviate this situation, it will
undertake a three part program to upgrade its current instrumentation. This
includes: the purchase of a substantially upgraded departmental workstation and
fileserver; the upgrading of PC facilities and increased connectivity of PCs in
graduate student offices; purchase of an IBM RS/6000 workstation, a dedicated
file server, and 10 gigabytes of additional disc space. Three groups of faculty
members and their affiliated graduate students will be the primary beneficiaries
of this upgrade. Many of these researchers are working on data-intensive
empirical micro- and macro-economics questions; others employ simulation methods
to solve problems in economic theory while a third group is engaged in
developing new econometric tools. The expanded facilities will also benefit
numbers of both graduate and undergraduate students and serve to further
teaching as well as research.
