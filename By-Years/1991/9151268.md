High resolution FT-NMR mainly for use in organic chemistry will upgrade the
chemistry instructional program. Hands-on NMR exercises will introduce students
to structural concepts and the capabilities of the instrument in solving
structural problems. Students in the advanced laboratories for majors (organic,
organometallic, analytical, and physical) will use the instrument for more
sophisticated problems such as the determination of polymer structures,
examination of fluxional character including hindered rotation, the acquisition
of kinetic data for relaxation processes, and solvation numbers of metal ions.
The instrument will also be used by students in independent research
projects.The grantee will match the NSF award from non-federal sources.
