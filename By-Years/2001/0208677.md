The next generation of computers will be multi-threaded, allowing the
simultaneous execution of several programs. Most computer workloads are
difficult to recast into multi-threaded form, under-utilizing multi-threading
capabilities.

This research studies a new approach to program translation: Assist Threads.

An assist thread is a specialized version of an application program that, when
run as an independent thread, assists (and optimizes) the application. Roles for
assist threads include program profiling, monitoring, pre-execution, and memory
management.

Experiments show that assist threads can effectively implement garbage
collection. An assist thread mimics an application's execution, tracking memory
accesses and recycling unused memory as it is recognized. The main application
thread ignores memory management concerns, becoming simpler, faster and more
reliable.

Other varieties of assist threads execute slightly in advance of an application
program, precomputing and preloading needed data values.

This research makes both theoretical and practical contributions to compiler
technology. It explores how to generate the computations necessary to implement
assist threads. It also experiments with a variety of assist threads, evaluating
their effectiveness and efficiency.

In summary, this research opens new avenues of application for multi-threaded
processors, making them more effective in supporting the needs of a wide variety
of computer users.
