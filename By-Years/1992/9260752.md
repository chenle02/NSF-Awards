Conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processing of BaTiO3 thin films
requires temperatures that are incompatible with standard silicon processing
technology. Photo-enhanced CVD has not been attempted for BaTiO3 and has
significant potential for solving both the non-uniformity and temperature
problems. The feasibility of the photo-CVD deposition of BaTiO3 will be
determined. Key to this study will be a novel approach to the generation of
atomic oxygen and its study by on-line mass spectrometry which will lead to
enhanced understanding of the role of atomic oxygen in the formation of
perovskite ferroelectrics. These techniques have potential for commercialization
of both precursors and equipment for dielectric thin film fabrication for use in
the electronics industry.
