Recent technological advances have now made it possible to directly manipulate
the mammalian genome and observe the effects of these experimental manipulations
on the development of the nervous system. These advances include site-directed
mutagenesis, positional cloning, and the analysis of the sequence and expression
of genes. The mouse has become the mammalian model animal of choice in
experiments of this kind and this workshop is designed to bring together
investigators and students using this model system. The Jackson Laboratory, a
renowned center for genetic research, which will be the site of the workshop,
will provide a unique, "hands-on", learning environment. The organization of the
workshop will offer the opportunity for the participants to engage in
discussions concerning the latest technologies, their own work using these
methods, and the potential impact of mouse neurogenetics on the field of
Developmental Neuroscience.
