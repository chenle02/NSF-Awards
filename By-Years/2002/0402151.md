Experiments in meson spectroscopy test critical aspects of the
standard&lt;br/&gt;theory of the strong nuclear force. Although they only live
for a short&lt;br/&gt;time before they decay, mesons provide a unique laboratory
for the study&lt;br/&gt;of the strong force because they are the simplest quark
configuration,&lt;br/&gt;just a one quark and one antiquark. The GlueX
experiment is a major new&lt;br/&gt;initiative being undertaken at Jefferson Lab
in Newport News, Virginia&lt;br/&gt;using polarized photons from the CEBAF
electron accelerator to search&lt;br/&gt;for a new class of excitations known as
exotic mesons. Although exotics&lt;br/&gt;were predicted based upon the standard
theory over 20 years ago,&lt;br/&gt;conclusive experimental evidence for their
existence has not yet been&lt;br/&gt;established. The P.I. is a member of the
governing board of the GlueX&lt;br/&gt;experiment and has specific
responsibility in the design and&lt;br/&gt;construction of the polarized photon
source. A preliminary step towards&lt;br/&gt;the larger goals of GlueX was the
Radphi experiment was constructed&lt;br/&gt;study the decays of a known meson,
the phi(1020). The phi itself is not&lt;br/&gt;exotic, but some evidence pointed
to the possible exotic nature of two&lt;br/&gt;other mesons at around the same
mass, the a0(980) and the f0(980). &lt;br/&gt;Radiative decays of the phi to
these scalars provide an important test&lt;br/&gt;of this hypothesis. The
experiment collected its data during a 60-day&lt;br/&gt;run in summer 2000, and
is in the final stages of data analysis. The&lt;br/&gt;P.I. is also involved in
the Qweak experiment at Jefferson Lab, which&lt;br/&gt;undertakes a precise
measurement of the weak charge of the proton as a&lt;br/&gt;search for physics
beyond the Standard Model. In this project he has&lt;br/&gt;shared
responsibility for the Compton-backscatter electron
polarimeter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
