9411212 Tough The flow of superfluid helium is limited at high velocities by a
random tangle of quantized vortex lines that fills the fluid. In uniform flows,
when the tangle is homogeneous, this state of turbulence is well understood both
experimentally and theoretically. A fundamental microscopic theory, supported by
computer simulations, gives many properties of the tangle in excellent agreement
with experiments. It was therefore surprising when preliminary experiments on
weakly inhomogeneous superfluid turbulence gave results that cannot be
understood as a simple extension of the homogeneous case. This experimental
project extensive new data on the static and dynamic properties of superfluid
turbulence in nonuniform flows where the tangle is inhomogeneous. % % % %
Understanding and controlling turbulence in the flow of fluids is an important
and long-standing problem in science. From the behavior of aircracts and ships,
to predicting the weather and increasing the efficiency of flow through
pipelines, turbulence plays a critical role. Enormous progress has been made
recently in understanding a kind of turbulence in the simplest fluid: superfluid
turbulence in liquid helium. A fundamental theory gives results in excellent
agreement with experimental observations as long as the turbulence is the same
in every part of the fluid. When the turbulence is inhomogeneous however, there
are surprising discrepancies. The experimental project will produce extensive
new data on the properties of inhomogeneous superfluid turbulence, proving a
rigorous test of our theoretical; understanding. ***
