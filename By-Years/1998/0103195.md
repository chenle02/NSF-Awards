This project will utilize the data from the AMPTE/CCE satellite to do a
statistical analysis of the decay of the Earth's ring current after magnetic
storms. The decay of the ring current due to charge exchange will be compared
with global ring current decay rates estimated from the Dst index. The Polar Cap
(PC) index will be used to estimate the rate of continued injection of ions into
the ring current.
