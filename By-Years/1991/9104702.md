The Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics at Northwestern
University will purchase an IBM RISC System/6000 POWERstation 530 which will be
dedicated to support research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will
be used for several research projects including in particular: 1. Flame
propagation in closed vessels. 2. Stability of stretched flames. 3. Flame spread
over thin liquid films. 4. Coating of a liquid film along a plane. 5.
Microscopic free boundary problems in a porous media. These five projects
involve the numerical computation of free boundary problems in fluid mechanics
and combustion. They are all computationally intensive and are of mathematical
as well as of physical interest.
