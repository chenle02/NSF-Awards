The project aims to deliver a functioning expert system to practitioners.
Formalization of the knowledge base will enable expansion and modification of
the system in the future. The research includes knowledge acquisition following
the Delphi Method. Two decision making processes for ranking retaining wall
alternatives will be tested: a linear method and a multi- objective method using
fuzzy set theory. The project includes overall testing, evaluation of
performance, and identification of methods for automatic knowledge acquisition.
