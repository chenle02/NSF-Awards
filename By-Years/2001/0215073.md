This Small Business Innovation Research project proposes to develop novel
fluidization systems that are needed for synthesis of nano-encapsulated insulin
particles for pulmonary drug delivery applications. By coating the insulin
particle with very thin (10-50 nm) layer of biodegradable polymers such as
polylactic acid (PLA), the sustained release characteristics of insulin can be
significantly altered. The unique method has several advantages over
conventional methods including low polymer loading, and impurity-free
processing. The nano-encapsulation method involves using laser ablation thin
film deposition technique to coat drug particles which are fluidized in the gas
phase. This Phase I project will develop batch scale fluidization systems which
are capable of fluidizing up to 1 kg of particles at a time.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of pharmaceutical
drug delivery.
