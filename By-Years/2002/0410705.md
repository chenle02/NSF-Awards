Interdisciplinary (99) Faculty in a Mechanical, Materials Science, and Aerospace
Engineering Department are incorporating the use of Lego (TM) MindStorms
robotics kits into several courses to support a new robotics curriculum strand.
Principles of multidisciplinary design, feedback control systems, and
mechatronics that have typically been treated in a disconnected fashion are
being unified under this robotics theme. Modules developed for teaching robotics
at Drexel University and Case Western Reserve University are being adapted for
this new curriculum; and the approach is enhancing the learning of interrelated
concepts from mechanical, electrical and computational systems. Moreover,
students receive important tangible feedback from physically experiencing the
products of their own work. Finally, the impact of this project is being
extended to teachers and students from neighboring secondary schools in the form
of a workshop on implementing robotics concepts in their classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;
