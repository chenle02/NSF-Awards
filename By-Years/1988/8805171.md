This program will explore the structure and electronic properties of transition
metals in non-equilibrium crystal structures. These metastable structures will
be produced in the form of ultra-thin films using atomic layer epitaxial growth
techniques. Some of the metal film crystals are metastable because they adopt a
crystal structure through epitaxy which is not the preferred structure at room-
temperature. Other structures found in epitaxial growth are completely new, and
exist only as films stabilized by the choice of an appropriate substrate
template. One of the first unique metastable metal stuctures was BCC cobalt,
grown as film on a semiconductor substrate. BCC cobalt does not exist as a
stable bulk phase. Metastable film structures and growth modes will be studied
by a combination of techniques which will probe both long-range and short-range
order in the films. These techniques include electron diffraction and angle-
resolved x-ray photoelectron diffraction (ARXPD). The ARXPD technique has unique
characteristics, such as elemental specificity, which will allow them to
unambiguously identify the presence of new metastable film structures.
Electronic properties of this new class of materiasl will be studied using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation.
