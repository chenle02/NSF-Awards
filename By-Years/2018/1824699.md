This award provides support for the travel and conference registration fees of
students and young investigators as participants in the 2018 Gordon Research
Conference Signal Transduction by Engineered Extracellular Matrices, in Andover,
Maryland, from July 21-27, 2018. The meeting will allow young investigators to
network with establish researchers to discuss cutting edge research about how
cells respond to their environment and how materials can be developed to direct
this response. The overarching goal of this research is to develop models of
disease, with a focus on cancer, and support the design of engineered materials
for immunomodulation therapy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gordon Conference will
bring together researchers in biomedical engineering, materials science,
synthetic biology, genetics, and clinical medicine to discuss the cutting edge
of research in the area of cellular signal transduction and the development of
materials to drive and govern cellular response. This is a cross-disciplinary
conference, designed to build bridges between fields to advance science and
engineering in this area -- which is key to many areas of tissue engineering and
cellular therapeutics. In particular, the conference will focus on fundamental
understanding of the use of engineered materials to create disease models (with
a special emphasis on cancer), the application of synthetic scaffolds to guide
the morphogenesis of ex vivo tissues and organoids, and the design of engineered
materials for use in immunomodulation therapies. The small conference will
include a broad range of researchers, from graduate students and post-doctoral
trainees to world leaders in this area, to disseminate the latest advances and
develop connections to advance this key field of research moving forward. Award
funds will be used to support students and trainees so that they can present
their research and develop the research network necessary to advance both
science and their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
