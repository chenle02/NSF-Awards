An experimental and analytical program is conducted which will provide the key
elements of a data base for closed-cycle magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generators.
The emphasis is on the disk generator driven by helium. The experimental work
covers relaxation to nonequilibrium ionization, the understanding of the plasma
temperature, and of the generator performance. Emphasis is put on studies of the
disk generator with full-seed ionization in presence of strong magnetic fields.
The analytical modeling covers the relaxation region, the generator performance,
and closed-cycle MHD power system driven by helium. The test results are used to
determine their technical and cost impact on existing system models.
