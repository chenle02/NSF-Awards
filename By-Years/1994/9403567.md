9403567 Weitsman The research entails the symplectic geometry of moduli spaces
associated with Riemann surfaces. The focus will be on the use of methods from
the the theory of toric varieties to study moduli spaces of vector bundles and
certain conjectures concerning the moduli of curves. It is also planned to study
the relation between the symplectic geometry of the moduli space of vector
bundles and certain 3-manifold invariants. The research has potential
applications to other areas of mathematics and also to quantum gravity and
string theory in mathematical physics. ***
