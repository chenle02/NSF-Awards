This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support four research projects in the Laboratory for
Numerically Intensive Computations at the University of Houston: Numerical
Simulation of Contaminant Transport in Aquifers, directed by Mary Wheeler and
John Killough; Domain Decomposition Methods for Flow Problems and Their Parallel
Implementation, directed by Ronald Glowinski, John Killough, and Mary Wheeler;
Parallel Computational Approaches for the Numerical Simulation of Enhanced Oil
Recovery Processes, directed by Mary Wheeler and John Killough; and Parallel
Techniques for Stochastic Simulation of Reservoir Heterogeneities, directed by
John Killough and Mary Wheeler.
