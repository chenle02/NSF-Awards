The sensitivity of the three-telescope IOTA, a Michelson Stellar Interferometer
will be improved through the addition of a new high speed visible light tip/tilt
tracker, single-mode IR fiber optics, and an improved IR tip/tilt tracker, which
will be used to observe highly reddened object that are untrackable with the
visible sensor. These improvements will extend the limiting astronomical
magnitude for science measurements from the current 7.5 magnitude limit (R-band)
to a 9.0 magnitude limit (R-band). This new system will enable studies of
surface features and mass exchange interactions across the surface of the
photospheres of Herbig Ae/Be stars and T Tauri stars. . ***
