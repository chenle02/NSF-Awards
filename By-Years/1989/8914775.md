A new method of analysis will be utilized to study the response of horizontally
layered saturated soil to traveling surface pressure loads. This method accounts
for factors such as coupling between the soil-water system, the effects of
nonlinear soil properties, inertia, and damping of the soil. The proposed method
is computationally efficient and is based on an existing methodology for the
study of soil deposits subject to wave loading. The predictive capability of the
proposed model will be verified against existing finite element programs such as
SAP4 and also against field data from Frenchman Flat, Nevada.
