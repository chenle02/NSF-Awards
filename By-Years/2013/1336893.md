This project aims at creating, tuning, and exploiting a variety of anisotropic
interactions in colloidal particles by a combination that consists of varying
geometric, compositional, and interfacial properties of the particles and an
application of an external electric field. The objective is to use a
complementary experimental and theoretical approach to elucidate the fundamental
links between various types of microscopically anisotropic interactions and the
resulting mesoscopically assembled phases. This fundamental understanding will
also be used to develop a scalable process that integrates both electric and
convective flow fields to build macroscopic functional coatings that exhibit
novel optical properties.

In-situ manipulation of the anisotropic interactions and dynamic pathways will
typically lead to micro- and nano-structures with reduced symmetry and enhanced
directionality. These structures can interact with a broad range of
electromagnetic waves in unique ways and exhibit collective plasmonic, photonic,
optoelectronic, and magneto-optical properties that are not manifested at the
level of single particles. As a result, the scalable coating technique developed
in this project could lead to economical fabrication of next-generation
functional materials that have great potential in energy-related applications,
such as high-efficiency solar cells, photonic crystals, and energy-saving
displays. The research will be fully integrated with education and outreach
efforts that consist of training public school teachers in the Denver area,
developing the learning modules related to colloids, and participating in summer
research program for high school students.
