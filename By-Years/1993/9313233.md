9313233 Moran This research will develop nonlinear (both material and
geometric) and nonlocal finite element methods for the quantitative analysis of
solid-state phase transformations. A unified approach based on minimization, via
finite elements, of the Landau-Ginzburg free energy will be developed for
application to three-dimensional nucleation. The methods developed will provide
quantitative predictions of interfacial energies and lead to a deeper
understanding of the effects of nonlinearity and nolocality on solid-state
reactions involving change in crystal structure. ***
