This undergraduate facility will provide a modern approach to x- ray physics
for students in the physical sciences and engineering, and will provide them
with a basic understanding of research and analytical techniques they will
encounter in graduate school or in industry. Laboratory exercises will include
modern x-ray physics, traditional x-ray diffraction, x- ray spectroscopy and
x-ray optics. Equipment to be used includes x-ray sources and detectors,
elements of a Bragg spectrometer, NIM electronics and a control/data acquisition
computer.
