The teaching of animal physiology is being modernized and undergraduate research
capabilities improved by adding six highly versatile, inexpensive microcomputer
data acquisition stations and physiological instruments which interface with the
microcomputers. The physiology stations provide several curricular improvements,
which include: 1) adding new experiments; 2) students learning modern data
acquisition techniques; 3) the microcomputer, interfaced to an overhead
projector, used as a classroom teaching aid; 4) students gaining a better
understanding of the scientific method because they spend more time designing
and performing experiments; and 5) more undergraduates undertaking individual
research projects. The following instruments have been acquired for this
purpose: Macintosh LC microcomputers, printers, data acquisition hardware and
software (BIOPAC's Acknowledge), transducers, amplifiers, stimulators, equipment
for a microelectrode station and an epithelial voltage clamp. The new
experiments include: 1) membrane and synaptic physiology of frog neuromuscular
junction; 2) physiology and pharmacology studies of smooth muscle in crayfish
hindgut; 3) membrane physiology of clam heart, employing the sucrose gap
technique; 4) neurosensory physiology of cockroach leg nerve; 5) mechanism of
Na+ transport across voltage-clamped frog skin; and 6) cardiovascular physiology
stimulated with Cardiovascular Function Lab (CFL). CFL accompanies actual blood
pressure measurements made in anaesthetized rats.
