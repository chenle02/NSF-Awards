This work consists of the development of a scanning tunneling/atomic force
microscope which can be used to understand the process by which scanning
tunneling microscope image large aggregates of insulating molecules. Methods
will be developed for imaging molecules in electrochemically-controlled
environments for sequencing nucleic acids by metallic labelling of selected
basis, and for exploring nucleic acid structure as a function of sequence and
legend binding.//
