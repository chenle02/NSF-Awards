One may define a "time-constrained database" as a database that has strict
timing constraints in (a) responding to queries, (b) processing transactions,
and in (c) database maintenance. A "time-constrained query" has the form of "get
the information x in no more than t time units". This project deals with the
problem of processing arbitrary time-constrained queries in centralized and
single-user time-constrained databases. Various ways of revising a query into
one which has the most "informative" response and can be evaluated within the
given time constraint with a controlled risk of overspending are investigated.
Techniques for fragment selection and risk analysis are introduced. Semantic
query processing techniques to control the query processing times are
investigated. The expected outcome of this research is (i) a methodology to
process queries with time constraints, (ii) a prototype time- constrained
database management system and a performance evaluation using the prototype, and
(iii) heuristics about the use of various options under different data
characteristics. Potential applications of the research results are in those
areas where time-critical database processing is important, e.g., scientific
applications and manufacturing environments.
