The current COVID-19 pandemic prompts an urgent response including improved
bioinformatics tools to help the community analyze relevant datasets from
infected patients and their environments. This project will update the popular
QIIME pipeline for microbiome analysis, which is very widely used by people
studying bacteria and archaea in the microbiome, optimizing it for researchers
studying viruses. This will bring features such as data provenance tracking and
reproducibility of analysis workflows to the viral research community. Such
features enhance the reliability of bioinformatics work in a rapidly paced of
research environment such as emergency response to a pandemic, where processing
errors are more likely. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
work will be to move studies of viral communities from a nonphylogenetic to a
phylogenetic basis, accelerate time-to-result, and to make QIIME 2 far more
useful to the increasing number of researchers moving from bacterial community
analysis to viral community analysis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Specific enhancements to be implemented are to build a reference database of
viral sequences from diverse genome, metagenome, and metatranscriptome sources;
to enhance storage and compute to resolve limitations posed by large-scale
datasets generated for SARS-CoV-2; to extend computational pipelines to
accommodate the recombination and lack of recognizable common phylogenetic tree
roots characteristic of viruses; and to support genome assembly from reads
recruiting to viral databases. Results will be disseminated as new QIIME 2
plugins, for broad distribution to the community, including the development of
new educational materials and new workshop modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
