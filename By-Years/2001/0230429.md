Using a class of triggered-seismicity models, we have recently (i) classified
the different regimes of triggered seismicity, (ii) found that the numerous
small and intermediate-sized earthquakes may have a significantly larger effect
than large earthquakes on future seismicity, when taken together, (iii) showed
how cascades of triggered seismicity may lead to aftershock diffusion and
foreshock migration, (iv) discovered that the inverse Omori law may derive from
the direct Omori law as the most probable trajectory of seismicity leading to a
mainshock, and (v) explained a change of the Gutenberg-Richter law from a
concave to a convex shape for foreshocks.

Building on these empirical results and on our theoretical understanding of
models of triggered seismicity, we will: 1) investigate several physical
mechanisms underlying the local Omori's law to constrain the origins of its
observed variability and to understand better the physics of triggered
seismicity, 2) analyze in novel ways the data available from different catalogs,
both regional (such as SCEC) and worldwide (such as ISC) which careful attention
brought to their completeness and their quality; 3) perform careful and
systematic explorations of reported seismic patterns and analyze them in the
perspective offered by the parsimonious triggered-seismicity model; 4) develop a
new statistical method for inversion of the triggering seismicity model taking
into account the incompleteness of the catalogs for small earthquakes; 5) test
the validity and limits of stress-transfer models that neglect cascades of
triggered seismicity; and 6) develop a forecasting methodology using the
triggered seismicity model with its cascade of triggered events as a strong
null-hypothesis to test against other hypotheses and to develop accurate seismic
hazard assessment in southern California.
