Vertical Distribution of Phytoplankton &lt;br/&gt;Elena
Litchman&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech Research Corporation - GA Institute of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microscopic algae (phytoplankton) form the base
of the most aquatic food webs and affect water quality in both freshwater and
marine environments. Phytoplankton often are distributed non-uniformly in the
water: they can form surface scums and subsurface maxima. These non-uniform
distributions may significantly impact zooplankton and fish and cycling of
material and energy, thus potentially affecting water quality and ecosystem
functioning. This project will examine the mechanisms for the formation and
maintenance of non-uniform phytoplankton distributions using mathematical models
and laboratory experiments. Plankton tower experiments will allow them to test
the predictions of the new theory in highly controlled yet spatially resolved
environment. The research at the interface of experimental and theoretical
ecology will involve undergraduates from Georgia Tech as well as from the
historically black colleges in Atlanta area. Funding provided will also help
launch an independent career of a woman scientist. Freshwater ecosystems are
essential to human well-being and are heavily impacted by human activities. The
results obtained in this project will provide fundamental insights into their
dynamics, which will allow better management of lakes. &lt;br/&gt;
