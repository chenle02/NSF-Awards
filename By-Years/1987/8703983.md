This grant allows Dr. Grayson to prepare illustrations for inclusion in a
monograph to be published by The American Museum of Natural History. This volume
reports results of analysis of faunal materials from three deep stratified
rockshelters and caves excavated in the northern half of the U.S. Great Basin:
Danger Cave, Last Supper Cave and Hanging Rock Shelter. All these sites contain
sizeable vertebrate faunas which span over 10,000 years and which come from
areas for which little information on mammalian history and on interactions
between prehistoric peoples and animal communities are available. The monograph
is of significance for three reasons. First it provides information on the
changing environments in the American West and how different species of animals
responded to it. This helps to explain the distributions of small mammals which
one sees today. Secondly, the research sheds light on how prehistoric peoples
used this environment and obtained their subsistence from it. Finally, Dr.
Grayson and his colleagues have worked to test and develop new methods for
analyzing faunal materials. These techniques should be useful to a large number
of reseachers. This grant is important because it will allow full publication of
this NSF supported research. Such work only gains full value if it is widely
disseminated and the American Museum publication will make this possible.
