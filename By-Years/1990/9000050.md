This proposal seeks to demonstrate a technique for observing ocean currents by
electric field measurements using a towed instrument of recent design. The
measurements will be made in conjunction with a cruise across the Gulf Stream in
which several additional observational techniques will be employed. The several
data types will be intercompared to improve the accuracy of the methods.
