In many applications in the biomedical and environmental sciences, the
complexity of available data makes the selection of statistical models
challenging. The goal of this project is to advance basic scientific methodology
that will help improve the selection of models using state-of-the-art Bayesian
methods. For complex data with a large number of features, it is now routine to
entertain an enormous number of competing models. The Bayesian approach to model
uncertainty provides a natural solution to many problems in the sciences. In
particular, new algorithms for model selection and prediction in a Bayesian
framework will be developed. The research is motivated by applications ranging
from genetics to climate models. Software will be developed and made publicly
available so that the new methods are readily accessible. When the number of
features/predictors is large, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are
often used to identify promising models. For high-dimensional problems, these
algorithms exhibit slow convergence and have extremely long running times. This
project addresses the development of flexible models and algorithms for Bayesian
variable selection and prediction that scale well to high dimensions. The
assumption of normal errors for the linear regression model may not always be
appropriate. However, the validity of this assumption is often overlooked for
high-dimensional data, when the number of predictors exceeds the sample size. In
this project, Bayesian variable selection methods for robust error distributions
will be developed that adapt to unknown degrees of tail heaviness and sparsity.
Flexible hierarchical models will be considered for probabilistic prediction of
North Atlantic tropical cyclone activity.
