This proposal asks for support to conduct a high-resolution seismic
reflection/refraction survey of high-sedimentation-rate drift areas in the North
Atlantic south of Iceland. This work will elucidate the paleoceanography of this
high-latitude, sub-polar region in times prior to the most recent Northern
Hemisphere deglaciation, and assist in identifying drilling targets. Seismic
characterization of drift deposits will allow the recovery of high deposition
rate sediments (likely 3-10 cm/kiloyear) that hold the key to analysis and
interpretation of sub-orbital global change events. Recent stratigraphic
analyses from existing sediment and ice cores show that such events can have
extremely abrupt onsets. Proposed work is relevant to the Ocean Drilling
Program: drilling proposals (s) to sample North Atlantic sediment drifts have
been high-ranked by scientists working within the "thematic panel" management
review structure of that Program.
