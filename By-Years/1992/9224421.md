The objectives of this research are to explore the design, synthesis, and
properties of dendritic molecules as well as hybrid polymer structures
containing both linear and globular fragments. Main targets include the
preparation of regular dendritic molecules with functionalized chain-ends,
hyper-branched polymers prepared in a one-step polycondensation reaction, and
hybrid linear-globular copolymers in which the dendritic (globular) fragment
will contribute to modify drastically the properties of the linear polymer
fragment. In order to prepare regular, size monodisperse dendritic structures,
both stepwise and accelerated approaches involving new monomers will be used.
The chemical modification of functionalities located at the chain ends or within
the inner layers of the dendritic molecules will be used for a number of
purposes such as the creation of novel type of micellar structures. These
micellar structures are constituted of single molecules in which a hydrophobic
outer layer surrounds inner hydrophilic layers (reverse micelle) or vice-versa
(normal micelle). The unique control over architecture afforded by the
convergent method of synthesis of dendritic molecules will be used to create
unusual polymer topologies. The study of structure-properties relationships for
these molecules will contribute to the advancement of knowledge may provide
novel solutions to current technological problems. This research is directed
toward the production of a new form of matter: polymers with a globular shape
that cannot be made by any other known method. These globular polymers may be
uniquely engineered for applications in a broad array of emerging advanced
technologies such as molecular electronics, the design of microreactors that
will allow more efficient chemical processes to be carried out with significant
reduction in environmental problems, or the elimination of highly toxic
pollutants from water.
