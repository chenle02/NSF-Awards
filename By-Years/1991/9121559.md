The objective of this Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is
to evaluate brainstorming as a concept generation methodology in engineering
design. A personality instrument is used to formulate groups and performance is
measured by the number of concepts generated. Concept generation ability is
tested with a single problem providing the functional requirement and the
constraints. Statistical evaluation is to be conducted of the standardized
change data between pre- and post-test scenarios. This research has the
potential to develop ways of verifying design research in a manner that
addresses human and technical aspects and also introduces some aspects of
psychology and personality into the study of design.//
