0101353&lt;br/&gt;Sprigg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Executive Vice-President of
Northwest Science and Technology University of Agriculture and Forestry,
Professor Li Jing, has sent personal invitations to 11 U.S. scientists to help
China assess soil erosion and environmental problems in the Yellow River
watershed. Nine of the 11 scientists are employees of the U.S. government. The
two non-government scientists require support for international travel and
related expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed participation of two non-
governmental U.S. scientists broadens the range of scientific disciplines
represented on the team. The trip would expose U.S. scientists working on the
topic to programs under way and to field conditions in China and provide access
to data that can be used to develop a scientific understanding of the process
fundamentals in conditions more extreme than any found in the United States. All
housing and travel expenses inside China will be supported by the host country.
These funds would support international and incidental expenses for the two non-
government members of the delegation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A report of the
issues, observations, conclusions, and recommendations will be submitted to both
the host and the NSF sponsor. &lt;br/&gt;
