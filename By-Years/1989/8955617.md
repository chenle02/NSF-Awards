The New Jersey Institute of Technology will initiate a five-week, commuter,
Young Scholars project in Mathematics and Physics for 30 students in grades 7-9.
Entitled "Science and Mathematics Enrichment for the Disabled" (SMED), this
project provides students with physical disabilities -- including mobility
impairments, visual impairments, chronic illness, and profound deafness -- with
exposure to technical career options and the skills needed for success in
technological fields. Students selected for this program have superior academic
ability but most come from special schools, segregated by disability, where
technical courses are downgraded and there is little or no science. Follow-up
includes a Spring reunion at NJIT, sharing materials used in SMED with school
teachers and sending science activities and mathematics problems to the
students.
