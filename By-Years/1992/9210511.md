This research will explore the use of four different chemicals to covalently
immobilize biologically active peptides and proteins on orthopedic and dental
biomaterials. Six different orthopedic biomaterials will be used; namely, 316L
stainless steel, cp Ti, Ti- 6Al-4V, Co-Cr-Mo, hydroxyapatite, and alumina). Four
different immobilization chemistries will be tested; namely tresyl chloride, p-
nitrophenyl chloroformate, divinylsulfone, and bisepoxide. Alpha-amylase,
carbonic anhydrase, REDV and RGDS will be coupled to the substrate and the
amount, stability, and activity of the immobilized ligands will be ascertained.
This research could lead to new methods to create biologically active surfaces
for orthopaedic and other implant materials and could have applications in
related fields, such as tissue engineering.
