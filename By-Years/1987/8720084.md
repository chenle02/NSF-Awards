This proposal requests funds to support research to find principles of
organization that can account for experimental data on the cellular level and on
various higher levels. Specific objectives include: clarifying the dependence of
learning on synaptic modification, elucidating the principles that govern
synapse formation or modification, constructing a molecular model for synaptic
modificaton, constructing network models that can compute, learn, associate, and
reproduce such higher level cognitive acts as abstraction, language acquisition,
and speech recognition. By testing critical theories, the principal investigator
will attempt to obtain a better understanding of the basic biological mechanisms
by which the cental nervous system learns and organizes itself and acquires its
capacity for mental acts. The principal and coprincipal investigators are well
funded and well versed in a wide variety of techniques and theoretical
frameworks germane to the research proposed. They are well qualified to conduct
the research. The interaction of theoreticians and experimentalists will allow
the coupling of theory and experimentation, a major strength of this proposal.
Support is recommended.
