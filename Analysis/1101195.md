The investigator and his students plan to study the K-theory of operator
algebras and its applications to geometry and topology of manifolds. The
K-groups of certain operator algebras are receptacles of higher indices of
elliptic differential operators and have important applications to problems in
differential geometry and topology of manifolds. Examples of such applications
include the existence problem for Riemannian metrics with positive scalar
curvature and the Novikov conjecture on homotopy invariance of higher
signatures. The investigator also intends to apply noncommutative geometry
methods to study analysis on loop spaces of manifolds. The methods to be
employed in this project include group actions on Banach spaces, coarse
embedding into Banach spaces, geometry of expanders, and infinite dimensional
index theory of elliptic operators.

In classic geometry, one studies geometric objects whose coordinates commute.
Noncommutative geometry is a mathematical theory specifically designed to handle
"geometric objects" whose coordinates do not commute but which do occur
naturally in both mathematics and physics. In the last decade or so, with the
help of new ideas from noncommutative geometry, there have been a series of
advances towards the solutions of long standing problems in classic geometry and
topology. Higher index theory serves as a bridge between noncommutative geometry
and classic geometry and topology. The investigator and his students plan to
apply noncommutative geometry methods to study problems in differential geometry
and topology.
