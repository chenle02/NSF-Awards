In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Frieder Jaekle of Rutgers University at
Newark will apply recent advances in the activation of small molecules by
frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to polymer-supported catalysis. A multi-pronged
approach will be taken: (1) soluble polymers will be pursued that are
functionalized with strong Lewis acid (acceptor) and/or Lewis base (donor) sites
(amines, phosphines, carbenes), which are sterically encumbered to allow for
formation of "frustrated" Lewis pairs. (2) Innovative approaches to porous
polymers that contain catalytically active Lewis acid and Lewis base groups will
also be developed. The efficacy of these new materials in catalytic processes
will be examined. In addition to the societal benefits of developing sustainable
chemistry processes, the broader impacts of the project include the training of
undergraduate and graduate students in a highly interdisciplinary research
environment, involvement of students from groups underrepresented in chemistry
(e.g. ACS Project SEED high school students, minority undergraduate students),
and creating awareness of sustainability in chemistry through a Polymer and
Materials Chemistry Outreach Program. The Professor Jaekle will also organize
the "Boron in the Americas" meeting in 2014 at the Rutgers-Newark campus.

The proposed work addresses the need for new sustainable chemistry processes by
developing metal-free catalysts for accelerating chemical reactions. Successful
preparation of the proposed catalysts is expected to have an impact in many
areas that employ catalysis, such as fine chemical synthesis, refining, and
plastics manufacturing. Additionally, this research could lead to new processes
available that will reduce reliance on rare and costly metals, toxic byproducts,
as well as the amounts of chemical waste generated.
