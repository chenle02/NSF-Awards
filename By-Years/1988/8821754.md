This project concerns three problems in algebra. The first involves groups
acting on affine domains and the resulting dynamics for prime ideals. The new
notion of variant ideal will play a central role. Second, the principal
investigator will study the stable module theory of algebras with a Lazard
p-filtration, with the intent of settling the zero divisor problem for subgroups
of integer matrix groups. Finally an abstract theory of groups with norms and
expanding endomorphisms will be developed. The theory of groups arose in the
last century as a tool for studying operations that can be done and undone. They
have proved to be extremely useful in all mathematical fields including algebra,
analysis and topology. Linear algebra arose in the last century also, as a way
of describing high dimensional spaces and as a method of solving many equations
in many variables. This project in the theory of group rings combines these two
threads of modern algebra.
