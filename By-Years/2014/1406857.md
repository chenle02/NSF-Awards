Welding: Wisconsin's Ultimate Rural STEM Pathway is contextualizing math with
hands-on exercises applicable to welding in order to better prepare students--
both those at the high school and college level--for welding careers. Activities
include professional development for high school career and technical education
(CTE) and math instructors, educational materials development, welding lab
equipment upgrades, and industry exploration. It provides learning communities
among high school math and career and technical education instructors and
college math and welding faculty, which will strengthen the quality of teaching
in both the academic and technical courses. Innovative nature of integrating
workforce preparation with retention in STEM disciplines is the main
intellectual merit of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Wisconsin's number
one producer of welding graduates in the state, NWTC is well-positioned to build
a pipeline of students by intersecting math and welding curriculum. Upon
successful implementation of the project in the pilot year, the Welding project
aims to expand to additional rural high schools and disseminate best practices
to the State's technical schools and, potentially, broader regional and/or
national audiences for replication within the high-growth welding states. By the
end of three years, the project aims to impact 560 undergraduate students, 162
pre-college students taking undergraduate courses, 11 college faculty, and at
least 14 pre-college teachers. The contribution of the project towards workforce
preparation is the main focus in terms of broader impacts.
