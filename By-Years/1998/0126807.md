Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are integrating Raman spectroscopy, a
specialized tool commonly seen only in advanced research laboratories,
throughout all four years of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum and also
into some Physics and Life and Earth Science courses at Otterbein College. Our
immediate goal is to enhance our chemistry curriculum by including activities
that will carefully build students' understanding of vibrational spectroscopy
throughout their four years of training. To achieve our goal, we are adapting
and implementation inquiry- and project-based laboratory exercises that utilize
the Raman microscopy into the General, Organic, Analytical, Inorganic and
Physical chemistry courses. These activities draw on a variety of NSF-funded
projects on forensic chemistry, modern instrumentation, and Raman spectroscopy.
We are also using the Raman spectroscope in ongoing faculty-student research
projects. In addition to chemistry students, this instrument is also being used
by students in the Physics and Life and Earth Sciences departments. In total,
approximately 110 students annually are being impacted by this curricular reform
project. We anticipate the student outcomes of this project will include: (1) a
greater understanding of the fundamental theories and applications of
vibrational spectroscopy and (2) the further development of critical-thinking
and research skills. Our long term goals are to develop multidisciplinary
programs in the sciences and the development and dissemination of a national
model for the implementation of Raman spectroscopy throughout the undergraduate
science curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;
