9300075 Tzeng In a message-passing architecture, in the presence of faults, it
is desirable to retain as many workable nodes as possible during
reconfiguration, achieving maximum reconfiguration. This research investigates
the maximum reconfiguration of faulty hypercube, CCC, and mesh systems, and
explores challenging communication and performance related issues in incomplete
multicomputer systems. ***
