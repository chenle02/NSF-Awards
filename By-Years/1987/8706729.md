This research investigates the epidemiology of the respiratory viruses. These
viruses are the organisms that cause the common cold and the flu, and are an
important cause of illness in infants and young children. The epidemiology of
the respiratory viruses differs from that of childhood diseases such as measles
and chickenpox in that each person can become infected more than once with a
given respiratory virus, whereas in diseases like measles a single infection
induces a lifelong immunity to reinfection. The consequences of such repeated
infections have not been systematically studied, and that is the goal of this
research. Mathematical models and computer simulations will be used to achieve
this goal. The concept of a threshold host population size is important in
epidemiology. This threshold is the smallest host community in which the disease
can be maintained continuously--for example, measles cannot be maintained
continuously in communities smaller than roughly 300,000 individuals. The
existence of this threshold is one of the important predictions that has been
derived from the current models, and it has been exploited in various ways to
apply the current models to data. By contrast, a preliminary model investigated
by Dr. Pease has no threshold host population size. The lack of a threshold
seems to be related to the fact that repeated infections with the respiratory
viruses are possible. Studying these models that lack a threshold host
population size will challenge in a major way the existing theory.
