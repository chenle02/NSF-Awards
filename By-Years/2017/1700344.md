The driving force behind many exciting developments in mathematics and its
applications in recent years has been the dichotomy between structure (order,
rigidity, etc.) and randomness (lack of structure, disorder, coarseness). This
project concerns a powerful technique, called deformation-rigidity theory, to
study these opposing phenomena in the framework of von Neumann algebras, i.e.,
algebras of infinite matrices, where the product of two elements, A times B, may
be different from the product in reverse order, B times A, a fact that reflects
the laws of quantum mechanics in particle physics (Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle). Von Neumann algebras are also related to group theory and ergodic
theory, since transformations of spaces give rise to a special class of such
algebras called II1 factors. Rigidity in this context occurs when the group of
transformations can be recognized by merely knowing its associated II1 factor
(which is a very coarse object). The study of rigidity of factors is an
interdisciplinary endeavor and can be relevant to many areas of mathematics. It
also has applications to computer science, complexity theory, design computer
networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes. This research project aims
to deepen understanding in this important area.

The principal investigator recently added several new tools to this study,
namely an approximation/simulation technique, a representation theory, and a
cohomology. In this project, he intends to combine all these tools to further
study rigidity-versus-randomness phenomena in II1 factors and to tackle several
famous problems in this area: the Connes Approximate Embedding (CAE) conjecture,
the sofic group problem, the free group factor problem, the paving problem, and
calculations of invariants for group-like objects. It should be noted that the
CAE conjecture, which predicts that II1 factors can be "simulated" on a
computer, would have striking consequences in quantum information theory.
