Quantum field theories provide a conceptual framework for modern particle
physics. Conformal field theories are quantum field theories that that have
angle-preserving, or conformal, symmetries. Two dimensional conformal theories,
which have important applications to string theory, can be rigorously
constructed mathematically using what are known as vertex algebras. Over the the
last thirty years, deep and surprising connections have been discovered between
vertex algebras and other areas of mathematics. In this project, interactions
between vertex algebras and topics in algebra and number theory will be
investigated. The grant will also support the training of graduate students.

In more detail, this project will deepen our understanding of irrational vertex
algebras by investigating their representations, intertwining operators among
modules, and modular transformation properties of characters of their modules.
This will be done by using ideas coming from the theory of quantum groups and
the theory of modular forms. In one direction, a Kazhdan-Lusztig-type
correspondence between certain irrational W-algebras and certain quantum groups
at roots of unity will be studied. The non-standard quantum groups that appear
have recently been used to construct new powerful invariants of knots and
3-manifolds. In another direction, transformation properties of modular forms in
connection with characters of modules of irrational vertex algebras will be
investigated. In a third direction, a continuous version of the Verlinde formula
in irrational theories and construction of projective covers for vertex algebras
coming from kernels of screening operators will be studied. This project also
has implications for the study of logarithmic conformal field theory in physics.
