1125791&lt;br/&gt;Castner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to
design, build and commission a femtosecond SFG scattering instrument. Once
commissioned it will be used to examine the structure of molecules at interfaces
(liquid/solid, air/solid, air/liquid). The scattering patterns generated by this
instrument from particles in solution provide insight into the size and shape of
the particles. The spectra generated by this instrument provide information
about the structure of molecules bound to these particles. A femtosecond SFG
scattering instrument is ideal for in situ characterization of nanoparticles
(NPs) in complex solutions and will provide important, new information about
those NPs, molecules bound to the NPs, and solvent molecules interacting with
the NPs. This instrument will be integrated into the National ESCA and Surface
Analysis Center for Biomedical Problems (NESA/BIO), allowing a wide range of
researchers access to this novel instrument.
