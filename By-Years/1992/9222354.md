This US-Hungary research project on "N-Body Scattering Theory" is between Drs.
Colston Chandler and Archie G. Gibson of the University of New Mexico and Dr.
Gyula Bencze of the Research Institute for Nuclear & Particle Physics, Hungarian
Academy of Sciences. The researchers will continue examination of the Coulomb
interaction, a difficult, few-body problem in theoretical physics for which no
practical, mathematically rigorous theory exists. Work will emphasize code
development to evaluate scattering amplitudes numerically for proton- deuteron
scattering, treating the Coulomb interaction exactly. The researchers will
pursue work on a scattering theory to more accurately account for electron
correlations in atomic breakup reactions. Finally, they will study the Coulomb
reaction for three particles interacting with repulsive Coulomb interactions to
determine how to incorporate into the scattering theory a practical distorted
wave approximation for breakup wave functions. The inclusion of breakup channels
in scattering calculations is a topic of considerable interest at present in
both atomic and nuclear physics. The researchers also intend to continue their
theoretical and numerical work on breakup amplitudes in the context of the
Chandler-Gibson equations. The specific problem to be addressed is a simplified
model for neutron-deuteron scattering, though the techniques should be
applicable to more general problems. Study will also be initiated to develop a
practical N-body distorted wave approximation for three-cluster breakup wave
functions. Success in any of the proposed studies would have considerable
practical application in atomic or nuclear physics, or both. This project in
theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in Hungary and the United States to
combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
