This project enhances the computer science curriculum through the introduction
of an undergraduate concentration in parallel computing. The purchase of
parallel processing hardware permits the implementation of laboratory
experiences in the parallel computing courses, enables larger seminar projects
and facilitates independent study. The key equipment consists of a 64 processor,
parallel machine, a PARACOM Multicluster, based on the INMOS T800 Transputer.
The 64 nodes of this system can be partitioned into sub-clusters and allocated
to as many as 4 different users, simultaneously. Each user is able to request
allocation and to configure it by selecting a wide range of connection
topologies. The system can also be treated as a single 64 processor
supercomputer. All of these options are under software control, and the
Multicluster is accessible from the existing undergraduate network of Sun
Microsystems workstations. The equipment can be expanded as the demand for
parallel processing grows. The award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
