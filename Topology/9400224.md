9400224 Cochran Dr. Cochran will study invariants which characterize links and
graphs in n-dimensional space, particularly in 3-dimensional space. More
broadly, he will study the classification of 3-dimensional manifolds with large
fundamental group, modulo homology cobordism, and the related problems of
topological surgery on 4-dimensional manifolds and the classification of
4-dimensional manifolds. Dr. Cochran will study properties of shape associated
to configurations of circles and to graphs in three-dimensional space (knot
theory). These studies of properties of shape are important in many ways. For
example, one primary strategy for the development of new anti-viral drugs is as
follows. First, understand the topology or shape of the virus. Second, find a
protein with a "complementary" topology or shape which can thus be used to "plug
up" the active sites on the virus. Unfortunately, the vast numbers of possible
proteins assume largely unknown and complex, twisted and knotted shapes in
3-dimensional space. Therefore studies of properties of shape are needed to
assist this endeavour. Dr. Cochran will be in contact with scientists from the
Keck Institute for Computational Biology at Rice University. ***
