9631512 Kumar The objective of this research project is to determine the
underlying microscopic mechanism of the buffing-induced reorientation of polymer
chins in thin polyimide films of the type used for liquid crystal displays with
the goal of providing a scientific base for designing improvements in the
manufacturing efficiency of these displays. This research project is a
collaborative effort between the Pennsylvania State University and IBM Research
Division if Almaden Research Center. The research collaborators at IBM will
guide theses efforts towards direct impact on display manufacturing. The
research agreement between the Pennsylvania State University and IBM has clearly
specified the roles and responsibilities of collaborators on both sides.
Students will gain significant experiences in working with industry.
