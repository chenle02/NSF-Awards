Requests are made by the University of Washington for Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment (SSSE) on R/V Thompson, a 274-foot general purpose, global
class research vessel, and R/V Rachael Carson, a newly outfitted 72-foot coastal
research vessel, both operated as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF).
In 2022, Thompson completed 268 funded days with 176 (66%) of them for NSF. For
2023, the vessel is scheduled for 315 total days with 180 (57%) days for NSF.
Carson had 125 days in 2022 with 53 (42%) for NSF. For 2023, there are 68 days
scheduled, 27 (40%) of which are for NSF.

With this proposal, UW provides technical descriptions and rationale for the
acquisition of the following Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment: 1) Liquid
Nitrogen Generator for R/V Thomas G. Thompson $39,099 2) (2) new ⅜” line general
purpose winches for R/V Rachel Carson $127,650 3) Science water still for R/V
Thomas G. Thompson $19,453 $186,202 Broader Impacts The principal impact of the
present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines
(NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the
vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
