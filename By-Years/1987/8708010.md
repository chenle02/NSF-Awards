The Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary periods are critical times in the
history of the flowering plants. Information about evolutionary changes during
this period has come from the study of leaves, pollen, and most recently,
flowers, fruits, and seeds. Although fossil, petrified woods of flowering plants
occur throughout deposits in the United States, there have been few systematic
studies of their anatomy. Dr. Elisabeth Wheeler of North Carolina State
University will study the anatomy and taxonomic relationships of several
collections of Cretaceous and Tertiary woods, to extend our understanding of the
history of particular plant groups. Data on the structural characteristics of
the woods examined during the study and data from the literature will be
organized into a computer database. Changes in wood structure through time will
be tracked, and compared with changes in other plant parts. The success of this
project is dependent to a large degree on access to a database with information
on the wood anatomy of a large number of living species. Such a database has
been established at North Carolina State and will be expanded. This expansion
will facilitate the comparison of fossil woods to extant plants, and will be of
benefit to anyone needing to identify wood samples of both living and fossil
plants.
