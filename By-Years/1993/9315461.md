9315461 Winget Over the past seven years the PI and his collaborators have
developed a worldwide network of cooperating observers, dubbed the Whole Earth
Telescope or WET, to obtain uninterrupted time-series measurements of variable
white dwarfs and related stars. This allows the determination of the numerous
oscillation frequencies exhibited by these stars. These frequencies strongly
constrain models of white dwarfs and the implications include the evolution of
these stars, the application of white dwarfs to the study of the history of the
galaxy and the physics of materials at extreme densities and temperatures. The
study of materials under extreme conditions has applications in a variety of
areas of science and technology. ***
