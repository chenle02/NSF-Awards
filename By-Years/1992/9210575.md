The reunification of Germany is prompting the restructuring of the former East
German (GDR) legal system. In theory, East Germany's legal transformation was
sudden and total: on the day of Germany's reunification, the GDR's former
socialist legal system was replaced by the West German model of the rule of law.
But in practice, reunification could not bring about the immediate exchange of
one legal culture for its opposite. The German Unification Treaty, sensitive to
adjustment problems, therefore restricts the applicability of many West German
statutes in the eastern half of the country, extends the validity of East German
statutes for a limited period of time, and even allows for the temporary
survival of East German courts, and the continued employment of certain East
German judges. This project examines the effects of this historical clash of two
fundamentally opposed legal cultures in one specific locale: the Potsdam city
court district. It uses ethnographic methods, specifically court observations
and interviews with various participants in the legal process, including East
German judges and prosecutors, West German guest judges and guest prosecutors,
West and East German attorneys, East German lay assessors, and (predominately)
East German litigants. The project is significant in providing an in-depth
analysis of legal reform underway in Germany and a number of former socialist
states, focusing on how formerly socialist citizens and professionals adjust to
the rule of law, providing insights about what remnants of socialist legal
thought and behavior are most likely to surface under the new legal system, and
revealing how these remnants impact the reform effort. In addition, the project
advances the study of legal consciousness by revealing the role that the rule of
law plays in restructuring notions of social order and change when a society
abandons its ideological identity.
