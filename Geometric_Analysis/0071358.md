Abstract

Award: DMS-0071358 Principal Investigator: Steve Zelditch

We propose to apply quantum dynamical notions to problems in geometry, inverse
spectral theory and mathematical physics. First is the well-known problem, `Can
you hear the shape of an analytic drum?' We have constructed a `quantum Birkhoff
normal form' of the Laplacian around a bouncing ball orbit and have proved that
it is a spectral invariant. We will investigate the extent to which a bounded
simply connected analytic plane domain is determined by its normal forms at one
or more bouncing ball orbits. We will also investigate a new connection between
the spectrum and X-ray tomography of the domain. The second group of problems
involves applications of a recently developed probabalistic theory of
holomorphic sections of line bundles over Kahler manifolds. We have at this time
determined much of the local statistics of sections over small balls. We have
also generalized the results to symplectic manifolds. We now aim to apply these
results to determine hole probabilities, probabilities of transversality, and
other matters which arise in complex and symplectic geometry. The third group of
problems belongs to Quantum Chaos. We have introduced a new model of random
quantum maps, obtained by quantizing stochastic Hamiltonian flows. We propose to
investigate the main problems of Quantum Chaos for this model.

Much of physics of the twentieth century has revolved around the quantum
mechanics of particles and fields, in particular around the Schrodinger
equation, and the physics and engineering of the future will be even more
quantum mechanical. Quantum systems are quite un-intuitive and one of the best
ways to understand what they do is to compare them to the classical systems
which they quantize. For instance, a hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field
can be thought of as a small particle moving in a force field. As the magnetic
field gets stronger, the particle's motion becomes more complex and chaotic.
What does this say about the quantum particle? According to twenty years of
numerical studies, the behaviour of a chaotic quantum particle should be random,
with statistics similar to those for random matrices. Why should solutions of
the Schrodinger equation know anything about random matrices? Our approach is to
introduce a new model of chaotic quantum systems which allows one to consider
large families of systems at once. In a sense, we are trying to show that a
`random' quantum system behaves similarly to a `random' matrix, despite the
differences in these systems. Such a model should be able to explain
observations ranging from nuclear resonance levels to chemical reaction rates.
