9401275 Jech This research project will concentrate on set theory and on
applications of set theory in algebra. The major topics of research will include
left-distributive algebras, elementary embeddings, stationary sets, the theory
of large cardinals, applications of forcing, the singular cardinals problem and
the theory of possible cofinalities, countably complete filters and ideals,
infinitary combinatorics, and problems in Boolean algebras. This research deals
with the abstract mathematical discipline called SET THEORY. Set theory serves
as the foundation for other mathematical disciplines such as topology, measure
theory and functional analysis. Its study of abstract infinite sets provides an
invaluable insight into the expressive power of modern mathematics and its
limitations. In particular, modern set theory, with its emphasis on independence
proofs and the theory of large cardinals, enables one to establish provability
or unprovability and analyze the complexity of mathematical conjectures. ***
