&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9415965&lt;br/&gt;Nowlin&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative
study of deep and bottom water formation in the southern sector of the Indian
Ocean, as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean
Expedition (IOE). Six PIs from six institutions will complete the final segment
of the WOCE Hydrographic Program Line, S-4, along 60 degrees South from about 20
degrees East to about 120 degrees East. The program is designed to detect subtle
differences across the Kerguelen Plateau, an important hydrographic boundary for
bottom waters. In addition to hydrography, the section will include standard
tracer measurements, as well as CFCs, Helium, Tritium, and Carbon-14, all to
WOCE standards. In addition to the zonal line, two excursions to the shelf at
about 50 degrees East and 96 degrees East will be made to investigate the
Antarctic Slope Front and its associated westward current. Expendable current
moorings will also be deployed at several locations to measure, for one year,
the current along the slope and on the flanks of the Kerguelen Plateau. In this
component, the PIs will provide the overall scientific leadership, and the
current component in direct collaboration with Oregon State
University.&lt;br/&gt;
