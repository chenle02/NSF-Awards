This project establishes a multimedia signal processing laboratory that
introduces the field of digital signal processing through innovative hands-on
experiments involving real signals such as speech signals, biomedical signals,
and images. Classical concepts in signal processing are introduced within the
context of processing and interpretation of speech, biomedical signals, and
images. The establishment of such a laboratory enhances students education
through multimedia cooperative learning using state-of-the-art audio and video
equipment. *
