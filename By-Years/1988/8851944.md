Moorhead State University will implement an IBM micro-computer laboratory for
two elementary statistics courses requiring a background in algebra and courses
for pre-college teachers. With the use of the statistical package MINITAB,
eleven hundred students per year will do real world exploratory statistical
analysis, look for patterns and relationships, confirm or disprove the expected,
and discover new phenomena. Problems using real data from accounting,
agriculture, economics, management, marketing and medicine will be used. The
primary impact on the secondary mathematics majors and elementary education
majors at Moorhead State University will be development of computers skills
necessary for classroom teaching, concepts of probability and descriptive
statistics. The principal investigator is a biostatistician with publications in
computer assisted analysis. The grantee is providing an equal sum obtained from
non-Federal sources.
