9411477 Faber It is the intent of this proposed work to examine a novel approach
to toughening single phase materials without second phase addition by creation
of "single phase laminates." The prototype material for study is iron titanate
with an exceedingly low thermal expansion coefficient along one of its axes.
Textures in the ceramics can be developed through magnetic field assisted
techniques. The studies proposed consists of fundamental fracture studies of
iron titanate, both random and textured, monolithic and laminated, to gain an
understanding microstructure-processing relationships. Small angle microcracking
in situ. Finally the design criteria will be established for tough, single phase
ceramics through laminated microstructures. %%% The proposed work will examine a
novel approach to toughening single phase materials iron titanate without second
phase addition. The textured material will be processed with the assistance of
magnetic field processing. An understanding of microstructure- processing
relationship and the design criteria for tough, single phase ceramic through
laminated microstructure will be established. ***
