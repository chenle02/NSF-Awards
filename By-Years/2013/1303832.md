Central Maine Technical College and stakeholders from the manufacturing sector
of the New England region are creating a Regional Advanced Machining Partnership
(RAMP) to: 1) develop an advanced machining certificate; 2) provide faculty
development in advanced machining; and 3) disseminate proven practices for
student recruitment. The project builds on a successful prior ATE project in
which the PIs developed a Virtual Ideation Platform (VIP) that enables faculty
and their students to design and develop product concepts and the requisite
curricula virtually over the internet. The certificate being created is highly
modularized, transportable and meeting NIMS certification. This curriculum can
be nested within the Manufacturing Institute's Skill Standard Certification
endorsed by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). The program
supports multiple points of entry and exit, and creates additional pathways
through articulation with other technology programs.

The project contributes to the development of a competent workforce for the
manufacturing industry by providing the technical skills that the students need
to succeed and by creating a partnership model that can be replicated in other
parts of the country. The project has a strong focus on recruitment and
retention of underrepresented students including women, which contributes to the
diversity of the workforce.
