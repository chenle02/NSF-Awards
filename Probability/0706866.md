This project addresses several challenging problems about high-dimensional
probabilistic objects, that are related to the concentration phenomena. Part one
is devoted to the study of probability distributions on linear spaces under
certain convexity hypotheses of the Brunn-Minkowski kind. It focuses on general
dimension free geometric and analytic properties of measures with heavy tails,
expressed in terms of dilation, isoperimetric, and weighted Sobolev-type
inequalities. The uniform distribution of mass in a convex body and more general
log-concave distributions describe another important family in the hierarchy of
convex or hyperbolic measures. As a closely related direction, the PI is also
planning to consider some new aspects of the concentration phenomenon on product
spaces of a large dimension. Part two deals with applications of different
concentration phenomena to the randomized models, such as a partial summation of
data, spectrum of stochastic matrices, etc., under minimal assumptions on the
dependence of the observed random variables. Of a particular interest is an
asymptotic behavior of typical distributions, resulting in a given randomized
scheme. Part three is devoted to analysis of geometric characteristics of Markov
kernels and associated random walks on graphs and other discrete structures.
Discrete isoperimetric and modified forms of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities
are planned to be considered in connection with the problem on the rates of the
convergence of the Markov semi-groups.

The study of the concentration phenomena is strongly dictated by various
problems of Probability and Statistics on general global properties of
stochastic processes. The Asymptotic Convex Geometry is another field, where a
number of hard problems about high-dimensional convex bodies appeal to the
concentration results and techniques. This study is also stimulated by problems
in Combinatorics and Computer Science (such as computation of the volume) and in
Mathematical Economics (optimization of the transport costs). The present
proposal continues research in this direction and is aimed, in particular, to
explore the role of the weak dependence in concentration phenomena, as well as
its range of applicability in spaces of large dimensions.
