General Relativity and Geometric Hyperbolic PDEs

Abstract of Proposed Research Igor Rodnianski

The focus of this research project is the study of the local and global behavior
of solutions of geometric hyperbolic PDEs arising in General Relativity and
other equations arising in Quantum Field Theory and gauge theories. One project
is to study the solutions of the full nonlinear system of Einstein equations in
a weak gravitational wave regime. We will continue our work on the L2 curvature
conjecture, asserting that a solution, metric g, of the Einstein vacuum
equations Ric(g) = 0 can be locally extended whenever its curvature tensor is
bounded in L2 . We will also study problem of stability of Minkowski space for
models where gravity is coupled to matter fields. Another direction of
investigation is to continue rigorous mathematical study of linear and nonlinear
waves in the regime of strong gravitational fields. The project will also
investigate problems of stability of topological solitons in classical field
theories connected with models of Quantum Field Theory and Gauge Theory. We will
concentrate on development of robust analysis methods for these models without
requiring any complete integrability assumptions. We will investigate
connections between infinite dimensional dynamics, generated by the above
models, and geodesic motion induced on finite dimensional moduli spaces of
static solutions associated with these equations.

The Einstein equations of General Relativity provide the main classical
description of evolution of the physical space-time continuum. The study of
mathematical and physical phenomena arising in General Relativity is of
fundamental importance for cosmology. While the physical understanding of the
subject has made rapid advancement and generated a number of outstanding
conjectures; so far there have been relatively few rigorous mathematical
results. To a large extent, this is due to the highly nonlinear nature of the
Einstein equations and a lack of mathematical tools for analyzing them. This
project will pursue the development of such mathematical tools and results and
involves many mathematical issues at the interface of Analysis, Geometry and
Partial Differential Equations.
