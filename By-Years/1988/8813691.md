This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Ronald J. Prokopy
of the University of Massachusetts, and Dr. Brian Fletcher of the Entomology
Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Office,
Canberra, and Dr. R.A.I. Drew of the Queensland Department of Primary Industry,
Australia. The investigators will perform a comparative analysis of natural
sources of food and feeding behavior of apple maggot flies in the U.S., and
Queensland fruit flies in Australia, and use the information obtained to improve
food-lure baits and bait spray practices for fly management. The project
combines the expertise of the Australian investigators in the study of natural
sources of food and microorganisms ingested as food by fruit flies with the U.S.
expertise in the experimental analysis of the behavior of fruit flies in
foraging for food. This study will provide the foundation for a comprehensive
understanding of all facets of resource foraging behavior in the American and
Queensland fruit flies, and could serve as a model for future work on multiple-
resource-type foraging behavior in insects. The ultimate objective, of course,
is improved control of these obnoxious pests.
