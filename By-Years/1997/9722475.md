9722495 Reading This Americas Program award will give partial support to eight
US researchers, one post-doctoral scientist, and one undergraduate student to
participate in a joint Latin America seminar on atomic collisions, to be held in
Rosario, Argentina, on March, 1997. Organizers are Dr. John Reading, Texas A
&amp; M University, in collaboration with Dr. Roberto Rivarola, Universidad
Nacional de Rosario, Argentina. The seminar will focus on recent developments
and future directions of research in the field. The central objective of the
program will be to identify problems of mutual interest to US and Latin American
physicists, in order to delineate new ways in which recent advances, such as use
of storage rings and traps, relativistic collisions, biological applications,
and others, can be used to advance new science. Emphasis will be on areas in
which cooperative programs are being initiated or planned. The U.S. and
Argentinean participants have made important contributions to the physics of
atomico and molecular collisions. The topics for discussion at this workshop are
likely to have an impact not only on various areas of physics, but also in
biology and chemistry, and may lead to significant applications in weather
forecasting, forensic medicine, and other areas. ***
