9311975 Fetterman A study will be conducted to test at microwave and millimeter
wave frequencies several optomechanical media for use in four wave mixing
experiments. These media are three-dimensional arrays of spatially fixed,
electrically anisotropic particles that are small compared to the radiation
wavelength. The particles are mechanically supported by torsional spring on the
rigid supporting frame mounted with two microhinges and can undergo rotation due
to electrostrictive torques exerted by incident radiation. Electrostrictive
torques rotate the particles in such a way as to form orientational index
gratings which can control the attributes of microwave or millimeter wave
radiation. The susceptibility parameters of the optomechanical media will be
obtained from two- wave mixing experiments using low frequency high-power pump
beams and high frequency low-power probes. Four-wave mixing experiment will be
performed to achieve phase conjugation and to evaluate the theoretical
predictions of high nonlinear properties of optomechanical arrays. The thrust of
this effort will be to demonstrate the feasibility of using orientational
properties of mechanical structures as active elements to achieve phase
conjugation in free space at both microwave and millimeter wave frequencies.
Combining the concepts of micromachining and millimeter wave devices offers the
possibility of entirely new classes of devices and systems. These will have a
broad range of possible applications in future communication, power transmission
and novel tracking systems. X Ä± Z \ b ! F 9 9 ( Times New Roman Symbol &amp;
