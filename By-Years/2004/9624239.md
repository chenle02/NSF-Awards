This project focuses on the uses of randomization, with particular emphasis on
graph algorithms. In particular, the problems to be ``tackled''(but not
necessarily exactly solved) by the PI's randomized graphical optimization
techniques include: (1) The maximum flow and minimum cut problems can be solved
exactly, with the major objective being the design of faster, simpler and more
practical algorithms for arriving at a correct answer; (2) Graph coloring and
bisection, analysis of network reliability, and construction of low-cost high-
connectivity networks, are extremely hard to solve exactly, with the major
objective being to find efficient algorithms that give answers as close as
possible to the elusive optimum. Implementation and testing of the algorithmic
solutions is an integrated component of this project. The Integrated Educational
Plan of this CAREER Grant includes the teaching, improvement and development of
theoretical computer science courses, including: (1) Undergraduate algorithms
course; (2) Undergraduate discrete mathematics course; (3) Graduate randomized
algorithms course; (4) Undergraduate information retrieval and text databases.
