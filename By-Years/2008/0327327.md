This project has three overlapping seismological objectives that are motivated
by the principal scientific goal of characterizing the nature of mantle flow and
melt supply beneath the Reykjanes and Kolbeinsey Ridges and to determine the
influence of the Icelandic hotspot on the seafloor spreading system. Surface
wave analyses will be used to determine lithospheric thickness, thermal
structure and melt distribution. Seismic anisotropy will be used to determine
the nature of mantle upwelling. Fabric-induced anisotropy elsewhere will be
evaluated to determine the influence of Iceland on upwelling. Data sets from
broad-band seismic stations located on Iceland, other Atlantic islands, and
along the Atlantic margin will be used in addition to the ICEMELT and HOTSPOT
data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
