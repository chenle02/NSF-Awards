This project is targeted at the development of an undergraduate laboratory for
geographic and environmental simulations. The equipment is being used by
students enrolled in general education courses, by geography majors, and by
students from other programs taking courses in cultural geography, physical
geography, meteorology, climatology, urban planning, and field
techniques/geodata collection. The new equipment includes student computer
stations, simulation software, and Internet resources that grant network
accessibility to data. Implementation of this program is greatly increasing the
opportunities for undergraduates to conduct hands-on simulations of a wide
variety of geographic and environmental processes including climate change; the
effects of birth, death, and migration rates on population; mountain building
and continental movement processes; and surface water movement. Recently,
collected environmental data is being used to make simulations as real as
possible. The project is emphasizing the use of simulations as a means of
reinforcing connections across major disciplinary boundaries such as biology,
geology, and planning. In addition to providing a unique experience for both
general education students and undergraduates enrolled in nontechnical geography
courses, the equipment is being made available for undergraduate students to
participate in supervised research activities. *
