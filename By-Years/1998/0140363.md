This proposal requests support for a group at Vanderbilt University for a
program of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics
based on several heavy quark experiments. They are finishing up the FOCUS
experiment at Fermilab, preparing for BTeV, a second-generation B-factory
experiment, also at Fermilab and considering working on CLEO-c at Cornell. Heavy
flavor physics yields information about the strong and electroweak interactions,
quark mixing and CP asymmetry and may lead to hints concerning the source of the
matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, one of the most fundamental
questions in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOCUS is a fixed-target, charm
production experiment searching for D0`D0 mixing in semielectronic and hadronic
decays, searching for rare and forbidden charm decays, studying charm baryon
spectroscopy and semileptonic charm decays. BTeV is a Tevatron collider
experiment that will study charm and beauty decays in order to confront the
Standard Model explanation of CP violation in B0 and Bs mesons, Bs mixing and
rare b decays. The CLEO-c program includes precision measurements of charm and
QCD physics in the vs = 3-5 GeV CM energy range.&lt;br/&gt;
