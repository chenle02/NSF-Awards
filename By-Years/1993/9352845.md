9352845 Marlin An experience-based, application-driven, two-year calculus
sequence involving 50 faculty members, 50 graduate teaching assistants, and over
4,000 undergraduate mathematics, science and engineering majors each semester is
being developed.The three year plan includes to revitalizing undergraduate
calculus curricula and instructional techniques through curriculum enhancement,
experiential computer laboratories, and intensive faculty development. The aim
of the plan is to empower any capable and willing undergraduate student to
succeed in calculus and differential equations, and to encourage advanced study
in applied mathematics. A team-based approach to curriculum and assessment
development, involving faculty from client disciplines, is focusing on
applications of mathematics and the use of technology to illustrate the central
importance of calculus in engineering and science. The project demonstrates
innovative adaptations of small- scale models previously developed by others, in
addition to a new set of curriculum enhancements emphasizing applications in
other disciplines, which may be adopted or further adapted at institutions of
any size.
