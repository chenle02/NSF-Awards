Kesner 9511635 Memories are stored in the brain at several different locations.
Presumably, different brain regions are involved in storing different types or
attributes of memory. With this award Dr. Kesner will analyze the importance of
several different brain structures (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, parietal
cortex, visual cortex, temporal cortex) to tasks requiring different types of
memory storage. These studies will test the idea that each brain area has a
different involvement in memory that is related to specific attributes that each
region is specialized to store. This work will provide important baseline data
necessary for detailed physiological studies of the mechanisms of learning and
memory in different brain areas. ***
