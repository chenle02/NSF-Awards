Key experiments to characterize and reveal unconventional phases occurring in
strongly correlated electron metals in the neighborhood of a quantum critical
point are proposed. The goal is the direct observation of the critical magnetic
fluctuation spectrum by inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization
measurements on single crystalline Ce heavy fermion compounds and transition
metal oxides. Different tuning parameters such as pressure and magnetic field
are applied to characterize non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional
superconductivity close to an antiferromagnetic instability as well as to probe
the physics close to a metamagnetic transition. Revealing the underlying physics
of magnetic quantum critical points advances our knowledge on the nature of new
electronic phases in theses complex materials, which is of basic interest and
also relevant for advanced technologies. Graduate and undergraduate students are
dealing with a variety of critical techniques and cutting edge topics, crucial
for their careers. The proposed activities will in particular educate the next
generation neutron scatterers needed to harvest the full potential of the future
world leading Spallation Neutron Source in the U.S.

In order to understand the behavior of exotic electronic materials, the nature
of instabilities towards magnetic ordered phases applying pressure or magnetic
field will be investigated. The special technique neutron scattering is well
suited to observe the critical quantities in the neighborhood. The goal is to
characterize and reveal fundamental concepts and phases in physics such as the
nature of quantum critical points, non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional
superconductivity. Revealing the underlying physics of magnetic quantum critical
