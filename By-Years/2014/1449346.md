There are two main approaches to describing uncertainty about model parameters
and forecasts in empirical economics. The classical approach, which is also
known as the frequentist approach, evaluates inference and estimation procedures
in terms of how they perform on average over many possible datasets. In
contrast, the Bayesian approach focuses on a given dataset and performs
inference conditionally on this dataset. The desirability of both Bayesian
(conditional) and classical (frequentist) properties is well understood in
empirical economics and, more generally, in the statistics literature.

In a large class of standard estimation problems, the classical and Bayesian
approaches deliver approximately equivalent results. Thus, usual classical
estimation procedures have attractive frequentist and conditional properties. In
recent years, however, though, a lot of attention in empirical economics has
been devoted to non-standard estimation problems, where the equivalence between
the two approaches can fail. For instance, non-standard problems arise in models
for highly persistent time series. Many economic time series such as inflation
and interest rates are highly persistent. Another important class of non-
standard problems includes problems with partially or weakly identified
parameters, in other words, problems in which data contain only a relatively
small amount of information about a quantity of interest.

Uncertainty about model parameters and forecasts is usually described by set
estimators, which for given data provide a set of likely values for a quantity
of interest. Existing classical methods for construction of set estimators do
not necessarily provide compelling descriptions of uncertainty in non-standard
problems as they might have poor conditional properties. The first part of the
proposed research intends to develop a methodology for evaluation and
construction of set estimators in non-standard econometric problems. In this
framework, attractive set estimators possess both frequentist and conditional
properties. The proposed methodology includes theoretical results and numerical
algorithms. It will be illustrated on a number of non-standard problems that
routinely arise in economics applications.

Another important area where the relationship between the classical and Bayesian
approaches has not been completely understood is flexible models with high-
dimensional parameters. Such models are useful in economic applications as they
"let data speak" by imposing fewer a priori restrictions. The second part of the
proposed research seeks to contribute to the literature on how to construct
flexible models that posses both Bayesian and classical properties.
