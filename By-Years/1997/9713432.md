The basic understanding of energetic particle acceleration and modulation is
likely to be an integral component of future space weather forecasting. This
investigation addresses: (1) the acceleration of particles at coronal mass
ejection (CME)-driven shocks, (2) the interaction of galactic cosmic rays with
the CME complex, and (3) the transport of energetic particles to one
astronomical unit. The PI will develop theoretical models describing the
diffusive acceleration of energetic particles at fast CME associated shocks and
their subsequent propagation through the interplanetary medium to Earth. Based
on a multi-dimensional study, he will also determine a detailed understanding of
the time profiles and flux intensities of large proton events for a variety of
interplanetary magnetic field configurations. Project goals, then, will deploy a
unique blend of modeling, analysis and MHD simulations.
