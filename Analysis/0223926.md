A workshop would be organized and held at Princeton to celebrate the
introduction of quasiconvexity by C.B. Morrey 50 years earlier by surveying
recent developments and stimulating future applications. Quasiconvixity was
originally introduced as a condition to understand the closely related questions
of lower semicontinuity and existence in the calculus of variations. It is now
clear that quasiconvexity is fundamental in many other applications.
