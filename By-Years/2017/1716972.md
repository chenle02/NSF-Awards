This research improves the public well-being through development of critical
knowledge using the important crop maize and other plants to understand cell
division and its role in development. A critical aspect of cell division is the
orientation of the division plane or the axis at which division occurs. When and
where the cell positions the division plane has significant impact on the
overall organization of the plant. Although the importance of regulated division
plane orientation during plant and animal development is well known, the
mechanisms that controls this process are not well understood. Understanding how
plants regulate division plane orientation will make it possible to harness this
feature of plant development for next generation crop improvement. Broader
Impact activities will include providing a research experience to freshman
students along with research opportunities to underrepresented minority
students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Correct division plane orientation, or the
establishment of the axis on which a cell divides, is critical for development
and growth in many organisms. This research will determine the biochemical and
in vivo function of proteins responsible for controlling division plane
orientation in the monocot crop maize. The experimental approaches include
single-molecule protein and microtubule dynamics, live cell imaging, structure
versus function analysis, mathematical modeling, and reverse and forward
genetics. The expected outcome of this research is an understanding as to how a
protein essential for division plane orientation alters microtubule binding and
dynamics, identification of amino acids critical for this protein's function, as
well as quantification of the relative contributions of cell shape and local and
global interactions to division plane orientation. Finally, new proteins will be
identified that promote the proper division plane orientation. Understanding how
plants place their division planes may provide insight into controlling division
orientation to increase yield of valuable crop plant products.
