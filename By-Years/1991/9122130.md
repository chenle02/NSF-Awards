Chromaffin cells are the cells in the adrenal gland that secrete adrenalin and
noradrenalin (a neurohumor similar to adrenalin). The secretion of these
substances is part of the body's response to stress and other environmental
conditions requiring body function adjustments. Although adrenalin and
noradrenalin have similar actions adrenalin is more effective in raising blood
sugar levels while noradrenalin is more effective in raising blood pressure.
Until recently it was thought that all chromaffin cells were the same. There is
now evidence that cells that secrete adrenalin are quite different from those
that secrete noradrenalin. With the development of methods to isolate and
culture them separately it will be possible to study the detailed individual
differences from a biochemical perspective. These studies will provide a more
sophisticated understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which organisms
respond to a variety of environmental stresses.
