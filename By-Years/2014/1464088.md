As mobile phones become capable of performing increasingly complex and sensitive
tasks, the loss, theft or destruction of such devices represents one of the most
significant classes of security problems. This research improves the security of
data stored on and generated by these devices by breaking the mandatory binding
between mobile phones and hardware. In particular, this work limits the damage
associated with this class of vulnerabilities not to the value of the data they
transport but to the cost of the device itself. In this system, mobile phone
users can seamlessly migrate software images of their phone to any device at
their disposal, while data present on previously used devices is automatically
encrypted or securely deleted. Phone images themselves are efficiently pushed
into and pulled from the cloud, which also supports patching and the upgrade of
phone images to occur both over the air and within the cloud itself, increasing
the speed with which software vulnerabilities can be mitigated. In so doing,
this approach allows network providers and users to adopt highly dynamic
responses to security incidents.
