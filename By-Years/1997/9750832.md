Recent studies have indicated that the Nation will soon face a critical
shortage of microbiologists trained in industrial microbiology. In response to
this need, the Department of Biology and Microbiology is developing a new
industrial microbiology laboratory course to complement the existing lecture-
based Industrial and Fermentation Microbiology course. The department is
acquiring equipment to be used in this course and making significant
improvements to the laboratory component of the Bacterial Physiology course
required of microbiology majors. The improvements are providing microbiology
majors with a strong background in basic microbiological concepts. More
importantly, it is enabling them to gain hands-on experience in the application
of these concepts in the intricately related fields of bacterial physiology and
industrial microbiology. The department acquiring bench top fermenters, a large
shaker incubator, cell harvesting and disruption equipment, microtiter plate
readers, and a biochemistry analyzer. This equipment is enabling students to
gain experience in the use of the state-of-the-art equipment commonly found in
industrial settings and meeting the growing need for microbiologists trained in
traditional and industrial microbiology.
