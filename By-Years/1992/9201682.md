Kelp forests, dominant of subtidal temperate reefs worldwide, often undergo
relatively frequent and unpredictable local extinctions and recolonization. This
investigation is a continuation of long-term research on the causal mechanisms
producing widespread loss and regeneration of subtidal kelp communities. While
the causes for the rapid decline of kelp populations are becoming clear, the
mechanisms that allow for their rapid recovery following severe disturbance
remain poorly understood. The research will use laboratory and field experiments
to examine various aspects of propagule supply that promote recolonization
following widespread forest loss. The major areas of study will involve
determining patterns and environmental causes of variation in (1) the number of
spores produced by adult plants, (2) the timing of spore release, (3) spore
quality, and (4) the longevity of spore supply. The research will focus on two
species of kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora california) that form
much of the biogenic structure of subtidal reef communities of central and
southern California. The research is important because it explores the supply
side of the regenerative process which has largely been ignored in studies of
patch dynamics. It will fill an important gap in our knowledge of the
complicated processes leading to successful recruitment. Such a comprehensive
approach is a necessary (but rarely taken) step towards gaining a thorough
understanding of the mechanisms that regulate marine communities.
