A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings and
research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities of their
students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for
research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a
community and generational appreciation for the role of science and mathematics
in workforce preparation and addressing quality-of-life issues. This project
aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will provide a model for
undergraduate STEM student preparation and pre-college student
recruitment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) will
offer a multi-faceted outreach strategy in which undergraduate STEM students
lead community activities that highlight STEM as a potential line of study for
pre-college students in urban and rural environments. These activities will be
accomplished with materials developed by the team and a cultural consultant, and
will include an outdoor classroom and nature trail, and will also offer a mobile
maker space to provide isolated communities access to rarely-available
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
