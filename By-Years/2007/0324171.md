This project provides expanded support of an engineering and technology
scholarship program called Galveston Aggie Technology and Engineering
Scholarships (GATES) to support a minimum of 15 additional scholarships in
Marine Engineering Technology, Marine Engineering Technology with License Option
and Maritime Systems Engineering over four years. The program includes
specialized advising, diagnostic testing, learning communities, tutoring,
supplemental instruction, and early intervention programs. GATES scholars have
additional support with a no-cost summer math workshop and specialized tutoring.
Faculty mentors are assigned to each student to track their academic progress.
Career Planning and Placement takes an active role in student mentoring with
industry affiliations. Industry provides internship opportunities and
professional mentors for GATES scholars. Students participating in this program
are required to create a career search plan, attend career-oriented workshops
and job fairs. Student Life involves GATES scholars in activities to help
integrate them into campus life, and to develop leadership skills. This program
targets nine especially diverse high schools in the Houston-Galveston as well as
five community college districts and supports and tracks these students through
graduation. Selection of participants is based on an application process
reviewed by a selection committee based on standard criteria including financial
need and merit. Upon graduation, GATES scholars will be quickly absorbed into
the local economy. Many alumni are employed in the Houston/Galveston region with
international companies who have locations around the world.
