Rapid deforestation in the tropics is resulting in the extinction of many
species. This problem is compounded in the West Indies by the limited
distributions of species and an ever increasing human population. West Indian
amphibians and reptiles (&gt;570 sp.) are especially susceptible to extinction
because most species are restricted to small areas within each island. New
species continue to be discovered at a high rate indicating that our knowledge
of the actual species diversity is incomplete. Cuba and Hispaniola are the two
largest islands in the West Indies, harbor the greatest number of species, and
have the least known amphibian and reptile faunas. The first goal of this
research is to document the existing species diversity of amphibians and
reptiles by conducting exploratory field studies in poorly known regions of Cuba
and Hispaniola. This aspect involves the formal scientific description of new
species as well as studies that provide new or corrected information on
previously described species. The second goal is to use modern genetic
techniques to uncover the genealogical relationships of the species. This
information is valuable for testing existing theories and developing new ones in
the field of evolutionary biology. It will also help in understanding how the
many species of plants and animals inhabiting the islands of the West Indies
originated.
