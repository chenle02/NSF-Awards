For more than fifty years the amphibian visual system has been an important
source of knowledge concerning the neural basis of vision and visually guided
behaviors. Dr. Katherine Fite is continuing neuroanatomical experimentation on
various optic pathways in the brain of amphibians. Her work is very important as
we try to understand visuomotor orientation and optokinetic nystagmus, two
behaviors which occur in man. Her approach will give us a detailed analysis of
the neural circuits involved in vision and motor cell populations and how they
interact, information that is essential to further understand the functional
roles of these circuits.
