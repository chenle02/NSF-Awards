This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues the development
of the numerical codes necessary to simulate the merger of two neutron stars or
two black holes and the modeling of the gravitational waves generated by these
phenomena. In particular, the work concentrates of the study of more realistic
physics in the modeling of the neutron stars, including the effects of neutrino
radiation and the creation of initial data sets that will include neutron stars
with arbitrary spins (in magnitude and orientation). Research on black hole
mergers will continue, this time enhanced by a collaboration with the NINJA
Group: a large (more than 80 investigators) international effort dedicated to
ease the introduction of numerically generated gravitational waveforms into the
data analysis pipeline of LIGO and VIRGO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is
particularly important in the light of the advent of the new generation of
gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. The possibility of detecting
gravitational waves directly has created a new branch of astronomical sciences.
Direct detection of these waves will provide unique insights into some of the
most fascinating objects in the universe: black holes and neutron stars. Due to
the matter that clouds the mergers of neutron stars with black holes or other
neutron stars, gravitational waves and neutrino radiation are the only vehicles
that can convey information about the last few moments of a binary system, the
merger and the creation of a new object (most likely a black hole). Furthermore,
this project supports a recently-formed relativity group at a developing
research institution, Florida Atlantic University with a culturally diverse
student body.
