The goal of this work is to understand how flame stretch and flame curvature
affect premixed flame properties. A laminar vortex will be created in an
existing test apparatus and will be interacted with a laminar premixed flame.
Vortex conditions first will be chosen to represent a single eddy in a turbulent
flow to show how strain and flame curvature affect the local burning velocity,
the creation of pockets of unburned CO pollutants, flame extinction, and
deviations from the "laminar flamelet" profiles of temperature and OH
concentration. Secondly, vortex conditions later will be chosen to represent the
piston-generated vortex of an internal combustion engine and the vortex will be
interacted with a centrally ignited flame kernel in order to understand kernel
growth in a realistic strain field. Thirdly, the measurements will be used to
assess and improve a recent full Navier-Stokes CFD simulation of the laminar
flame-vortex interaction, which forms the "building block" of future models and
can provide a useful submodel for existing statistical models. Operational
diagnostics to be employed include Rayleigh scattering for temperature images
and profiles, OH and NO fluorescence imaging, and PIV to image the two-
dimensional strain field. This study should provide information useful to a
number of other research efforts in the area of turbulent premixed flame
structures. In particular, it should be of use in development of better
simulations of flame-vortex interactions, leading to better understanding and
modeling of critical processes affecting levels of production of carbon monoxide
and oxides of nitrogen in devices such as internal combustion engines, in which
flame-vortex interactions play a crucial role. This in turn will lead to
definition of design strategies for reduction of levels of these pollutants
produced by such engines, an important national need.
