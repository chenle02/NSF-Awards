The project aims at further extending the scope and applicability of boundary
value problems in domains with fractal boundaries, along three main lines of
investigation: boundary value and transmission problems, singular
homogenization, and variational fractals. The investigators extend the range of
applicability of their theory of singular boundary value and transmission
problems, by considering wider classes of 3-dimensional domains, with possibly
irregularly or randomly scaled fractal boundaries and layers. They give fractal
models more plausible physical ground, by approximating fractals with thin
fibers and fractal equations with partial differential operators, bringing
dynamical fractal theory into the more familiar realm of singular
homogenization. Finally, the investigators enhance connections with classical
effective properties of elliptic and sub-elliptic operators, by developing a
theory of variational fractals that replaces similarity with quasi-metric
scaling and provides a rigorous foundation to the power-law formalism, which is
widely used in physics and applications in the study of phenomena with no
characteristic length. The project, focused on constructive and metric methods,
opens new perspectives in applied boundary value problems in domains with
complicated and interacting boundaries and in homogenization theory with fractal
components.

Problems with large surfaces and interfaces confined in small volumes occur in
many applications, including material sciences (e.g., porous films and dendritic
structures grown by diffusion limited aggregation), physics (e.g., highly
fragmented electrical conductors, high voltage electric discharges, electrolytic
deposition and diffusion-limited-aggregation), chemistry (e.g., catalytic
converters), biology (e.g., cell membranes, biological tissues, bones), and
engineering (e.g., hydraulic fracturing in oil wells). The project is situated
at a crossroad of applied mathematics where analysis, numerical analysis, and
probability meet. The project develops new theoretical methods and approximation
tools specifically suited for these types of problems. The new constructive and
metric approach provides the flexibility and the parameter variety required by
prospective applications in physics, biology and engineering.
