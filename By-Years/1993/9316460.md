9316460 Kastner This award provides 72% of the funds required for the
acquisition of a heating and freezing stage for optical microscopy of fluid
inclusions in rock and mineral samples. The equipment will be installed and
operated in the Geological Research Division of the Scripps Institute of
Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. The institution is
committed to providing the remaining funds necessary to acquire the instrument
system. Research to be conducted with this apparatus includes the study of fluid
inclusions in rocks brought up from the mantle and in ancient oceanic
accretionary complexes. The interpretation of such fluid inclusions yields
information regarding the nature and origin of fluids trapped in the mantle and
on the evolution of the chemistry of ancient oceans. ***
