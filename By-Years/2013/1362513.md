The objective of this project is to develop new monitoring and control
strategies for enhancing wind turbine reliability so that operations and
maintenance costs of wind energy can be reduced. In wind power systems, the
"wind input"-to-"turbine response" relationship is nonstationary, due to both
internal (e.g., system's degradation) and external (e.g., surface contamination
on blades) changes. This nonstationary dependency causes significant
technological challenges in managing the health and performance of wind
turbines. This project will develop a new regularized learning method to
characterize the time-varying dependency among system variables so that changes
in a turbine system can be tracked and predicted. Subsequently, a statistical
monitoring method with adaptive control limits will be devised to signal the
occurrence of anomalies. Based on the results from the regularized learning
process, an adaptive control strategy will be developed to mitigate excessive
and undesired mechanical stresses on turbine subsystems in an effort to prevent
or slow the deterioration process. A new wireless structural health monitoring
(SHM) system supporting real-time, embedded data processing will be advanced to
track the behavior, performance and health of operational turbines.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of this research will facilitate the wind
industry's smooth transition from using rudimentary diagnosis and control
techniques to the use of sophisticated and integrative monitoring and control
technologies. The new monitoring method will enable timely detection of
anomalies while reducing the false alarms. Optimally determined control
parameters will balance between power production and stress levels in an effort
to extend a turbine?s service life. While using wind turbines as the primary
application target, the methodology is applicable to other engineering systems
subject to dynamic operating conditions including civil infrastructure systems.
This project will contribute toward the preparation of a future workforce in the
field of renewable energy and sustainability through an array of mechanisms
including the integration of under-represented students in the STEM field into
renewable energy research, opportunities for students to interact with national
laboratories, and to be engaged with other domestic and international research
groups.
