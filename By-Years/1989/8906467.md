Partial funding will be provided for purchase of advanced X-ray diffraction
equipment. The equipment will support research in several areas of materials
processing, including effects of processing parameters on the microstructure,
texture and residual stress states of structural ceramics and of high Tc
superconducting materials in both thin film and bulk configurations.
