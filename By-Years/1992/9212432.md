Under this Engineering Research Equipment Grant, the Electrical Engineering
Department of the University of California, Los Angeles, will purchase vacuum,
electronic, and diagnostic equipment which will be dedicated to support research
in engineering. The equipment will be used in a laboratory devoted to industrial
applications of low Temperature Plasma Physics. Projects benefiting from this
grant will include a) development of large-area plasma etching machines for
semiconductor chips and liquid crystal displays; b) development of dense plasma
columns for new particle accelerators add coherent light sources; c)
investigations on the behavior of dust and particulates in industrial and
astrophysical plasmas; and d) studies of wall materials used in fusion plasma
reactors.
