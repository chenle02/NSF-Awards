9453475 Agrawal This is a Presidential Faculty Fellow (PFF) Award. Under this
award, research related to modeling, simulation, optimization and control of
multi-degree-of-freedom electro-mechanical systems is pursued in order to
develop a fundamental understanding of the dynamic behavior of such systems. The
major emphasis of this research is on free-floating robotic assembly, and the
development of multi-segment small motion robotic vehicles which are useful for
applications such as inspection, exploration, manipulation, and locomotion in
restricted and hazardous narrow spaces typically inaccessible to human beings.
In addition, innovative techniques are developed for global optimization of
multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear electro-mechanical dynamic systems. ***
