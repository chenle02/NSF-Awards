This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops novel
techniques for applying the heterogeneous execution model, where a general-
purpose processor is accelerated by a special-purpose co-processor, to
optimization-based scientific computations. The result of this research is a
library of computational building blocks that perform fundamental operations
used in genome analysis, as well as a new design tool that uses this library to
systematically synthesize complete co-processor architectures that are optimized
for the characteristics of the input dataset of
interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional development methodologies for
heterogeneous computing have focused on computations that are based on data-
parallelized O(n) algorithms. This project demonstrates the use of heterogeneous
computing for non-O(n) algorithms, which have complex behavior, internal state,
temporal locality, and a high ratio of computation versus communication.
Adapting this class of computation to heterogeneous platforms provides high-
performance computing without the need for maintenance-intensive and power-
inefficient traditional shared-memory and cluster-based
supercomputers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project targets optimization-based
phylogeny reconstruction as a application case study. This application uses
combinatorial optimization for its search for optimal phylogenetic
(evolutionary) trees, as well as for its procedure for scoring candidate trees.
