DMS-9801304 P. Daskalopoulos The abstact follows : The major objectives of this
proposal are concerned with the study of certain quasilinear or fully-nonlinear
degenerate parabolic equations in connection with more complexproblems of
differential geometry, including the Ricci flow and the Gauss curvature flow.
These problems find physical applications in such areas as population dynamics,
diffusion in porous media, and thin liquid film dynamics. One specific area
which will be investigated is the regularity question in free-boundary problems
arising from the degeneracy of certain non-linear parabolic equations, including
the porous medium equation, the evolution p-laplacian equation and Gauss
Curvature flow with flat sides. Another specific area of the main objectives
concerns the study of ultra-fast diffusion parabolic equations, which have
received large attention because of their relationship to differential geometry
topics, such as the Ricci flow and the Yamabe flow. The solvability of the
Cauchy problem for these equations, the study of the blow up profile of
solutions, the nonradial structure solutions, and the uniqueness of solutions,
are among the problems which will be investigated in this specific area. The
still open question of the uniqueness of sign-solutions of the porous medium
equation, in connection with the continuity question for a class of linear
singular parabolic equations falls under the proposed major goals to be studied.
The non-linear equations to be studied under this proposal form the basic
concepts of many applications which deem to be important to technology and the
society at large. The purification of materials, from chemicals to petroleum and
even water, is often achieved by diffusion through filters. The purification
filters are the porous media described in the proposal. Thin film dynamics and
the Van der Waals forces operating between thin layers are described by singular
quasilinear equations of ultra-fast d iffusion. The dynamics of population
growth, polymer chain growth, including cross linking and high rate growth of
biomolecules, are also non-linear phenomena amiable to our basic studies. The
interesting problem of the expanding universe and other cosmological phenomena
seem to be goverened by nonlinear dynamics, which in certain cases are
applications of the more complex problems described here.
