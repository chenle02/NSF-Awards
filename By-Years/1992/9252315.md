A classroom with 25 workstations is being created to improve introductory
statistics instruction. Three changes are being made in introductory statistics
courses: Faculty are using an interactive classroom approach in teaching
statistical concepts; complex subtasks of an assignment are being developed at
the computer under the supervision of the professor; the full version of SPSS is
being used in all statistics courses in order to enable non-science majors to
actively use state-of- the-art computer equipment and software; this classroom
lab permits collaborative learning among the students, replacing the normal
note-taking in lecture courses.
