This project is for the support of undergraduate student participation in
ongoing research programs in the Department of Physics. Research areas for
students are high energy physics. The astrophysics, condensed matter physics and
nuclear physics. The primary activity of the undergraduates is their research in
a single laboratory; however, the student body is regarded as a unified group of
young scientists and will come together in weekly seminars for discussion and
for informal seminars by Penn faculty members. This project is supported under
the Program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an
adequate supply of scientists for the future.
