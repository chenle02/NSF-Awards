The project develops and compares cutting edge methods for the classification
and analysis of American scientific research and compares them to existing
manually generated approaches. The project examines the strengths and weaknesses
of four computational approaches: topic models, network-based partitioning
methods, Wikipedia-based labeling, and an active-learning approach. In
particular, the research examines whether or not the different approaches can
correctly classify established research areas and discover emerging fields
across a broad range of disciplines. Each approach is evaluated based on a set
of metrics measuring effectiveness, computational costs, human oversight costs,
and the need to retain consistency with existing classification frameworks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work directly responds to a number of National
Academies recommendations and National Center for Science and Engineering
Statistics (NCSES) reports that suggest using computational approaches to
classify scientific research fields. A longer-term impact is improvement in data
collection, processing, and reporting of key national statistics on science and
engineering.
