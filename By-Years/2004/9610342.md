The goals of this pilot project are to: 1) demonstrate the utility of a simple,
expandable, and cost-effective strategy in identifying a set of genetic markers
that are highly variable in several populations, and 2) develop a simple genetic
assay for such a set of markers. To achieve these goals, the allele frequencies
of one hundred and sixty common genetic markers in the three major
subpopulations in the United States (Caucasian, Hispanic, and African American)
will be estimated by automated DNA sequencing. A set of 40 markers that are
evenly distributed across the human genome and that are informative in all three
populations will be selected for high-throughput genetic assay development. This
approach can be expanded easily in parallel with the development of a high-
density genetic map of the human genome. With a large number of informative
genetic markers available, an appropriate subset of them can be tailored for use
in studying population history, mechanisms of evolution, disease resistance and
susceptibility, and many other questions being asked in the full-scale Human
Genome Diversity Project. Answers to these questions will not only provide
insights in anthropology and population biology, but also promote global unity
and health.
