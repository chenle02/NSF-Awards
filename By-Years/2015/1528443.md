General Summary

This project examines how basic pro-social orientations and victimhood influence
the public's support for potential outcomes of the ongoing peace negotiations.
Peace negotiators must agree on issues such as jail time, the truth,
demobilization, reparations, and socio-political re-integration. Public opinion
towards such outcomes is crucial since any eventual peace deal must ultimately
be ratified by the electorate. We measure pro-social orientations by observing
individuals' levels of (1) altruism, (2) trust, (3) reciprocity, (4) willingness
to uphold fairness norms even at some personal cost. We conceive of the nature
of victimhood in terms of who the perpetrator was and how recently and directly
one has been victimized. Pro-sociality and victimhood (and their interplay)
should help understand public opinion formation towards the negotiated peace
outcomes. Using negotiations between the Colombian government and the Fuerzas
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) guerrillas as the case of interest,
results of the study will hold lessons for political leaders and policymakers
who are tasked with both reaching a peace agreement and, subsequently, designing
post-conflict institutions to sustain peace and foster social cohesion.

Technical Summary

To study how social preferences and the nature of victimhood influence public
opinion formation surrounding aspects of negotiated peace, we embed game-
theoretic behavioral measures of social preferences in a large online survey
administered by a professional survey firm. Altruism is measured via dictator
games. Trust and reciprocity are measured in the context of a trust game. Costly
punishment, i.e. strong negative reciprocity, is gauged using a Third-Party
Punishment game. Subjects are randomly assigned to one role in each of these
games. Afterwards, they respond to question batteries tapping (1) preferences
for potential outcomes of the Colombian government-FARC peace talks and (2)
nature of victimhood. The order of these two batteries will be randomized to
permit a partial test of the exogeneity of social preferences to victimhood. To
explore this and other questions related to victimhood and opinion formation
towards the peace process more deeply, we will conduct 4 focus groups with
victims groups in Bogot√° and in the conflict zone. The project explores how pro-
sociality influence the politics of conflict resolution in contemporary
polities. At the same time, it will test the proposition that the effect of
social preferences on policy preferences towards peace and justice cannot be
divorced from the degree and nature victimhood in post-conflict societies.
