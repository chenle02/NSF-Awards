This research project investigates molecular level structure at the interface
between immiscible electrolyte solutions. With the support of the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Mark Schlossman in the Department of
Physics at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Professor Petr Vanysek in
the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Northern Illinois University,
use synchrotron x-ray scattering in combination with electrochemical methods to
probe the ordering of ions and solvent molecules at liquid-liquid interfaces.
This ordering and the transfer of ions between liquid phases is controlled by an
electrical potential imposed across the interface by a 4-electrode potentiostat.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is enabling structure at the interface
between aqueous and organic phases to be probed on the molecular length scale.
Results have broad application in areas related to separation processes, drug
transport, energy conversion, sensor responses, and phase transfer catalysis.
Studies advance fundamental understanding of interfacial structure and charge
transport. &lt;br/&gt;
