0240381&lt;br/&gt;Ameer&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will focus on understanding
how to control the strength, degradation, and elastomeric properties of a novel
copolymer of glycerol and sebacic acid and on testing the feasibility of using
this copolymer as a scaffold to grow ligament-like tissues in vitro under
dynamic culture conditions. The long term goal is to develop a model system for
replacing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the most commonly injured
ligament in the knee. It is hypothesized that a biodegradable scaffold with
elastomeric properties similar to those of ligament will promote ligament tissue
formation by facilitating cyclic stretching of the cell/scaffold construct and
inducing cellular and extracellular matrix alignment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific aims are to: 1) Synthesize and characterize biodegradable copolymer
scaffolds that are based on the condensation of glycerol and a diacid and 2)
evaluate fibroblast infiltration and the production of extracellular matrix
(collagen and elastin) on the scaffolds synthesized under Aim 1. Tools and
techniques to be used include chemical synthesis, standard chemical and
mechanical characterization of polymeric materials, time degradation studies,
cell adhesion and proliferation assays, biochemical assays of extracellular
matrix components and bioreactor design to effect cyclic stretching. &lt;br/&gt;
