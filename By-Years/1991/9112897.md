Professors Lindsay and Lombardi are funded by a grant from the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program to study the resonance Raman spectra of mass-selected
metal clusters in rare gas matrices. Neutral cluster species of Ag, Rh, Bi, Mo,
Nb and others will be interrogated by absorption, excitation, fluorescence, and
resonance Raman spectroscopy. The resonance Raman spectra will provide the
vibrational frequencies for structural assignment. The ability to mass-select
will allow the parentage of a set of observed spectra to be established and will
eliminate possible interferences by the spectra of other clusters. %%% Clusters
of metal atoms will be produced and deposited with rare gas atoms in very cold
samples. By preselecting clusters of specific mass, it will be possible to
observe the spectra, make assignments, and deduce the molecular structure
associated with a specific cluster. The properties of these groupings of atoms
which are between the single atom and the bulk metal may be important in ultra-
miniaturized electronic circuits, in nanostructures which are materials of
molecular size, and perhaps in quantum dot devices.
