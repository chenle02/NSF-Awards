Measuring similarity between geometric objects is a common task in many
applications: detecting change in a medical scan, recognizing and indexing
content in an image or video, comparing protein structures, or automatically
picking the right object from a conveyor belt. Input images, shapes, or models
come in different representations that have to be transformed to compare them to
a large database of possibilities. This project explores transformations of
certain classes (nearly affine transformations) using tools like limited Frechet
distance and small metric distortions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific proposed
problems include computing Frechet distances between terrains and between
polygons with holes. Both fixed parameter tractable exact algorithms and
polygonal time approximation algorithms will be studied for these problems. The
project will also consider the hardness of approximation. For the topic of
metric distortions, the proposed problems include computing metric distortions
between simple polygons and between discrete point sets. Both exact and
approximation algorithms will be studied. The goal is not only to understand the
mathematics behind exact transformations, but also to see if approximate
transformations will allow faster algorithms with some quality guarantees; most
application of similarity measure at present is heuristic, and does not come
with guarantees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measuring similarity between geometric
objects is a fundamental problem and has many applications, so this project, and
the students that it trains, will have potential impact on theory and practice
in many areas.
