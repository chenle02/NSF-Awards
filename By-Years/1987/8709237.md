Financial economists have identified a series of features which seem to be
puzzles for standard theory. For example, why do individual investors find
dividends attractive? Why are returns in January higher than in other months? Do
traders overreact to new information? Do stock prices exhibit excess volatility?
Why are the returns to managed funds so decidedly inferior to index funds? This
project uses behavioral theory to explain these puzzles. Behavioral economics
differs from standard neoclassical economics in its departure from the
particular assumptions which characterize the notion of rationality. The project
develops a general Arrow-Debreu framework which admits both behavioral theory
and standard neoclassical theory as special cases. The behavioral theory
consists of prospect theory; heuristics used to make judgments about
probabilities; and regret aversion. The corresponding neoclassical theory
consists of the standard expected utility, general equilibrium framework. The
analysis centers on the various uses of this framework in modern financial
economics: the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the arbitrage pricing theory
(APT), and the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). The originality and high
quality of the investigators' past research show that they have the ability to
do the work. The research agenda is based in part on papers by the investigators
on the payment of dividends to investors and on investors' disposition to
realize capital gains on stocks too early.
