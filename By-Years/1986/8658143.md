The number of solutions of a computational problem and their distribution have
fundamental implications upon its computational efficiency. When the solutions
are symmetrically located an algorithm that cannot distinguish between two
solutions cannot (by symmetry) converge to either answer. Randomization is often
effective precisely because it can break such symmetries. In joint work, the PI
has shown that an adversary source of randomness is sufficient to break
symmetries (thus showing RP = SRP). What is novel about this approach is that
identifying symmetry breaking as the essential task of randomization allows one
to ask more precisely how much randomness is really needed for efficient
computation. Two related questions now being addressed are: What are necessary
and sufficient conditions for a source of randomness to be a universal symmetry
breaker? How many random bits are necessary? A pseudo-random number generator is
quasi-perfect if its output satisfies universal symmetry breaking properties.
The PI has recently proposed a simple and efficient pseudo-random number
generator. An attempt is now being made to settle the associated conjecture that
this generator is quasi-perfect. Massively parallel computation provides another
context where the difficulty can lie in the task of selecting one solution among
many. In joint work the PI has given a general scheme for isolating one solution
in parallel (obtaining a parallel algorithm for the maximum matching problem).
Further applications of this isolating scheme are now being explored. The PI has
been judged to be an outstanding computer scientist by the Presidential Young
Investigators panel.
