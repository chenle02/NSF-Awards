Academic and industrial biotechnology researchers are continually seeking better
materials on which to culture cells. The proposed research will develop surfaces
which will; 1. Improve the attachment and growth of anchorage dependent cells
(e.g. epithelial cells), thus improving the efficiency of such microcarrier
cultures. 2. Allow non-anchorage dependent cells (i.e. HeLa, CHO) to grow
carrier-bound to facilitate separation of these cells and cell culture products.
The PIs have used radio-frequency, non-equilibrium plasma reactions to
chemically modify the surface of tissue culture plates, and found that their
modifications cause significantly improved growth of a variety of cells in
monolayer culture. The PIs proposed to test the hypothesis that they can perform
an analogous modification on microcarrier beads and achieve the same improvement
in cell growth on these beads. This would be a first step toward development of
a variety of surface modified tissue culture substrata which would support
growth of cells otherwise impossible to grow in vitro, and which would improve
the efficiency of large scale anchorage dependent cell culture.
