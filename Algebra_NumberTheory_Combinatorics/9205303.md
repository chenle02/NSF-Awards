This research is concerned with representation theory of infinite-dimensional
Lie algebras with applications to quantum field theory. A new approach to the
study of integrals of motion in deformations of two-dimensional conformal field
theories will be developed. The modular functor for affine Kac-Moody algebras at
the rational level will be pursued, using geometrical properties of the
corresponding representations. The Langlands-Drinfeld correspondence for complex
algebraic curves will be investigated. Topological field theories, associated to
affine algebras, will be studied from the cohomological point of view. The
quantum deformation of the Lie algebra of differential operators on the circle
will be studied in connection with the W-algebras. Finally, the formulas for
singular vectors in Verma modules over the Virasoro algebra will be applied to
the computation of the cohomologies of Lie algebras of vector fields. This
research is concerned with a mathematical object called a Lie algebra. Lie
algebras arise from another object called a Lie group. An example of a Lie group
is the rotations of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another. Lie
groups and Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of spherical
motion.
