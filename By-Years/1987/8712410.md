Programming highly parallel computers is an extremely complex task which will
necessitate the development of appropriate sets of support tools, including
graphics-oriented programming environments for MIMD, ensemble machines. We have
already implemented a rudimentary environment built as the front end to a
multiprocessor simulator. This environment will serve as the testbed for our
research in two areas: high-level languages and parallel debugging. In the area
of high-level languages, we investigate specifications of graph grammar, provide
mapping assistance through graph-grammar based mechanisms, and design heuristics
for aesthetic graph layout and placement. In the area of parallel debugging, we
would determine which kinds of information is most useful to debugging of
parallel programs.
