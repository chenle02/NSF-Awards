The use of electro-osmosis will be investigated to reduce bit balling oil well
drilling. Bit balling is a major problem when drilling in soft rocks, since the
soft rocks or clay are sticky, clog the bit, and reduce the rate of penetration.
Present means of reducing bit balling, by the use of oil-based or other muds,
are becoming increasingly environmental unsatisfactory. Electro- osmosis, the
application of an electrical current across the bit- clay interface, liberates
water and reduces the tendency of the drilled cuttings to stick to the bit.
