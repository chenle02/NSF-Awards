&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to the University of North Dakota for the
support of a three-year REU Site entitled, "Engaging Undergraduates in
Multidisciplinary Remote Sensing Image Acquisition and Analysis Research at the
University of North Dakota," under the direction of Dr. Richard R. Schultz. This
10-week summer program will provide eight undergraduate students and two
math/science middle/high schoolteachers with the opportunity to conduct research
on three remote sensing projects with the assistance of faculty mentors. The
students will participate in research group meetings, professional development
seminars, and a mini-conference at the end of the summer where they will be
required to individually prepare and deliver an oral presentation to Senior
Personnel and all other interested parties. Each participant will be required to
submit a research paper to her/his project mentors, which may be submitted by
the mentors to an undergraduate research conference or an international research
conference.&lt;br/&gt;
