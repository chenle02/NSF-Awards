This dissertation project analyzes the formation of dietary norms in the context
of scientific-political interaction in France (1750-1850), focusing on a number
of institutional sites, including hospitals, soup kitchens, the military, and
prisons. Three central issues anchor the study of these institutions: the
emergence of nutrition as a field of formalized and authoritative knowledge,
responding to social problems but rooted in chemical and physiological
experimentation; growing state intervention in dietary matters, as government
officials and scientists used each other to increase their own legitimacy; and
the participation and resistance of the general population and institutional
populations in matters of changing dietary practices and nutritional knowledge.
