This grant is to help support participation of researchers and students in the
4th AASHE Workshop on Research for Sustainability: Colloquium on the Food,
Energy, Water Systems Nexus. The workshop will be convened as a 1-day, pre-
meeting workshop in association with the annual conference of the Association
for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) in Baltimore,
MD on Sunday, 9 October 2016. The workshop will focus on presenting
opportunities for research across the FEWS nexus from the National Science
Foundation, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S.
Department of Agriculture for academic researchers.

The emphasis of this workshop on issues at the nexus of food, energy, and water
and opportunities for this research through programs of several federal agencies
will aid in expanding the audience of prospective researchers competing in these
programs. Assembling academic sustainability researchers at this workshop will
facilitate synergy between the sustainability research community and federal
agency programs providing resources for innovative and interdisciplinary
solutions across the FEWS nexus.
