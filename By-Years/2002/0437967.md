The purpose of the workshop is to bring together&lt;br/&gt;the leaders of the
fields of knot theory and 3-manifold topology to&lt;br/&gt;discuss the state of
the art of the subjects (currently in a state of&lt;br/&gt;rapid change). A
second purpose is to introduce young mathematicians,&lt;br/&gt;graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows to the subjects. The workshop&lt;br/&gt;will begin with
minicourses followed by individual lectures on the
later&lt;br/&gt;days.&lt;br/&gt; The mathematical theory of knots is currently a
very active area of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Knot theory has found application in
molecular biology, for&lt;br/&gt;example in testing models of the action of
certain recombination enzymes&lt;br/&gt;on DNA. The study of knotted orbits
gives a powerful tool in the theory&lt;br/&gt;of 3-dimensional dynamics. Knot
theory is connected intimately with&lt;br/&gt;questions such as "what is the
shape of our universe?" Our space, which&lt;br/&gt;appears 3-dimensional and
flat (or 4-dimensional with time) may be curved&lt;br/&gt;in on itself and form
what is known as a closed 3-manifold. The deep&lt;br/&gt;connection between the
theory of 3-manifolds (and 4-manifolds) with knot&lt;br/&gt;theory is the
special focus of this workshop. It is timely, as many&lt;br/&gt;long-standing
problems in the subjects have recently been solved, giving&lt;br/&gt;rise (of
course) to new and deeper problems.&lt;br/&gt;
