The recent discovery that traces of blood can be identified on ancient stone
implements has opened a new area of archaeological inquiry. It has allowed
archaeologists to determine the function of specific kinds of stone tools (a
subject of continuing debate) and in some instances to identify the actual
species. A number of analytic techniques have been tried but all have drawbacks.
In preliminary work, Dr. Anderson has demonstrated the potential of
nitrocellulose-binding enzyme immunoassay (EIA). He will now generate three
groups of species specific antibodies and apply them as a test case to
archaeological materials from two sites. If successful, this will permit the
development of additional antibodies and their application, in a routine manner,
to archaeological materials.
