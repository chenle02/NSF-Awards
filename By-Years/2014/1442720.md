This award provides student travel and subsistence for the 2014 Oregon
Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS). This summer school provides an
important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study theoretical
topics related to programming languages and methods/verification. The focus of
this year's school is "Types, Logics, Semantics, and Verification". The students
who attend are from a large number of countries. The NSF support ensures
participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups.
The broader impacts include building international community and cooperation in
foundational research areas, and enhancing education of students with exposure
to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers.
