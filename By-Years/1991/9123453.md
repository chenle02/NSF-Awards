The goal of this project is to continue to develop an experimental basis for
understanding the behavior of volatiles in submarine basaltic magmas. The
solubility of carbon dioxide will be measured over the range of pressures and
temperatures corresponding to those at which submarine magmas erupt. The
influence of water on the solubility of carbon dioxide in mid-ocean ridge basalt
liquids will also be measured. Experiments will also be conducted to study the
kinetics of bubble nucleation and growth in basaltic systems.
