Many critical workloads today, such as web-hosted services, are limited not by
raw CPU processing power but by interactions between the CPU cores, the memory
system, I/O devices such as disks and network interfaces, and the complex
software (applications, middleware, operating systems, virtual machines) that
ties all these components together. To improve the efficiency of these workloads
and systems, designers and developers need tools to identify the bottlenecks, so
that they can address them. However, existing performance analysis tools, such
as software profilers, cannot account for hardware bottlenecks or for situations
where software overheads are hidden due to overlap with other
operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As computer systems become ever more complex
networked aggregations of software and hardware from multiple vendors, the
ability to isolate and address inefficiencies that reduce throughput and waste
energy is daunting. The goal of the project is to address this problem by
developing an analysis methodology and tool set that identifies true bottlenecks
in complex systems spanning multiple software and hardware layers executing
concurrently across multiple CPU cores and dedicated hardware devices. This
research utilizes critical-path analysis to not only identify bottlenecks but
also quantify their contribution and estimate the speedup obtainable if a
particular set of bottlenecks is removed or reduced. Ultimately, this research
will lead to qualitative performance improvements in software and hardware
system designs as the methodology and tools produced aid designers and
developers in focusing their efforts on removing the true
bottlenecks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves both graduate and
undergraduate students as researchers. The results will be fed into appropriate
courses, including one on parallel architectures. The material and slides for
this course will be made available over the web.
