9712768 Bansil The 1997 International Conference on Spectroscopies in Novel
Superconductors (SNS'97) will devote one week to the research area of
superconductivity, with emphasis on spectroscopic measurements relevant to High
Tc Cuprate and related materials. The topics of primary interest include
Tunneling, Superconducting Quantum Interference, NMR, Photoemission, Raman and
Optical, and Neutron Scattering. Other topics will be discussed, the
participants will include world leaders in this area. NSF support will provide
financial assistance to young investigators. %%% The 1997 International
