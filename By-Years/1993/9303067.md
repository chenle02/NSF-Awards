The Human Capital Initiative coordinating committee will organize working
groups to prepare specific research initiatives in six areas of broad national
concern. These areas are productivity in the workplace, schooling and literacy,
the aging society, drug and alcohol abuse, health, and violence in America. The
overall plan to focus basic and applied psychological research attention on
these significant problem areas was developed over the past two years through
summit meetings of representatives of over 50 behavioral and psychological
science organizations. Each initiative will define tangible problems in the real
world, describe current knowledge and provide examples of successful
psychological research relevant to the problems, identify key issues that can
feasibly be investigated and ameliorated within the next decade, and summarize
the potential benefits of the proposed research.
