This action is to allow the investigator, Dr. Joaquin Fuster, to purchase
computer equipment to support an innovative focus of his research. The overall
objective of his research is to gain understanding of the neural foundation of
perception and memory. It is designed to provide new data concerning the
processes by which the brain of the primate encodes, retains, and utilizes
information acquired by active touch. The principal and most innovative aspects
of this research is the in-depth computational analysis of temporal patterns of
neuron discharge during haptic discrimination and short-term memory. This work
is important because it builds on previous models of memory and pushes it to the
cutting edge by the addition of computational methodology.
