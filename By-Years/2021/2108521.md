Automated reasoning programs allow computers to apply methods based on
mathematical logic to evaluate the correctness and security of hardware and
software. They overcome the limitations of human reasoning with greater
capacity, rigor, and reliability. Unfortunately, like all complex software
systems, these programs may contain errors in the core algorithms or their
implementations, causing them to produce incorrect results. This risk can be
eliminated by having the program generate a checkable proof: a detailed account
of its reasoning process in a formal, logical notation. This proof can then be
checked by a much simpler checking program, quickly detecting any erroneous
steps. This project extends the scope of automated reasoning programs for which
checkable proofs can be generated, enabling more advanced forms of analysis to
be performed in a trustworthy manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proof generation has
become a common feature of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers, greatly
improving their reliability and trustworthiness. This project aims to improve
the ability of other automated reasoning programs to generate checkable proofs
of their results. It extends the proof rules used by existing logical frameworks
to enable additional reasoning capabilities. Formally verified checkers that
support these rules are implemented and made available. In terms of automated
reasoning, the project devises new formulations of quantified Boolean formulas
(QBF), dependency QBF (DQBF), model counting, and model checking that can
generate proofs in existing and new logical frameworks. Reduced Ordered Binary
Decisions Diagrams (BDDs) are used as the underlying mechanism for implementing
the reasoning programs. BDDs have a proven track record for solving the problems
of interest, and the reasoning behind many underlying algorithms can readily be
expressed in simple logical frameworks. Preliminary work on proof generation by
a BDD-based SAT solver demonstrate that other automated reasoning tasks are
amenable to this approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
