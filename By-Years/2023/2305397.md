The project focusses on two nonlinear partial differential equations that arise
in a number of different disciplines in science and engineering, as well as from
within mathematics. These equations describe the motion of a curved surface or
curved object which evolves so as to simply its shape as efficiently as possible
over time. An important feature of the motion is the formation of singularities
that enable the solutions to model situations where topology changes, for
example when a soap bubble elongates and splits into two bubbles. On the one
hand, this flexibility leads to numerous profound applications; on the other, it
creates great intellectual challenges. The PI will build on recent progress to
address some of the main open problems in this area. The second part of the
project applies ideas from geometry and analysis to study the structure of rough
objects, including fractals. This area has been developing very rapidly in the
last 25 years, due to new connections between different parts of mathematics,
and applications to problems from computer science. Graduate students will be
trained in this project. The proposed research studies geometric evolution
equations and analysis on metric spaces. The evolution equations in the proposal
are mean curvature flow and Ricci flow, and the projects focus on different
aspects of regularity. The projects in analysis on metric spaces are concerned
with geometric mappings such as bilipschitz, quasi-conformal, Sobolev mappings
in the sub-Riemannian setting. The project will make progress in solving
longstanding problems at the interface of geometric group theory and geometric
mapping theory, and analysis of PDE, especially the regularity of weak solutions
to the contact system in Carnot group groups.
