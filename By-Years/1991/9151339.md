Hampshire College, although a relatively new institution, has a reputation for
excellence in the teaching of science. Introductory courses for both science
majors and nonmajors focus on inquiry methods and often involve students in
independent projects in the laboratory. These relatively sophisticated student
projects for beginners have become the hallmark of Hampshire's innovative
science education. Modern research laboratories often incorporate networked
computers and analytical instruments which allow distributed data acquisition,
analysis and control. To allow our students to develop skills needed for working
in up-to-date research labs, the department proposes to update and expand our
equipment for computerized data acquisition. The unit will provide enough work
stations to make teaching of introductory courses feasible and expand our use of
graphics and statistical analysis software to encourage students to acquire
better quantitative skills. Specific courses affected will be "How People Move"
and "Cardiovascular Fitness and Disease." Our goal is to increase the
quantitative and analytical skills of our students through direct contact with
modern computer-based experimental methods, design and analysis.
