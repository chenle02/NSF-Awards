The objective of this proposal is to expose bright and motivated undergraduates
who aspire to pursue advanced careers in Computer Science to active research
experience early in their careers. This proposal seeks to develop an REU site to
broaden the intellectual horizon of participants through exposure to
opportunities available in university research. Students will be involved in
research projects in deep learning and its applications, in particular, natural
language processing, bioinformatics and computational medicine. Students will be
exposed to the fundamentals as well as latest advances in deep learning and its
applications via lectures and personalized readings. They will perform hands-on
research on novel problems, conduct experiments, and communicate their results
through written papers and presentations. &lt;br/&gt;The REU students will be
involved in research natural language processing and deep learning and its
applications, alongside faculty mentors and graduate students in a university
environment. The project will involve undergraduate students in cutting-edge
research where they will write software to solve interesting and timely problems
and write papers for publication. &lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks to increase the
number of American citizens and permanent resident undergraduates who are
attracted to careers in research and advanced studies in Computer Science.
Training in theoretical and empirical deep learning and its applications will
enable participants to contribute to ubiquitous software-based technologies at
the highest levels in innovative ways. The proposal will also focus on training
future computer scientists from institutions with limited research opportunities
including community colleges, women and under-represented minorities. The
research experience will encourage these students to be productive researchers
in academic and non-academic environments during their future
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
