The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the University of
Central Florida (UCF) has recently constructed a new large-scale structural
testing facility. The new lab will allow Structures and Geotechnical engineering
faculty members and students to conduct static, fatigue, ad pseudo-dynamic tests
on large-scale structural components and subassemblies. This award will enable
CEE/UCF to purchase a 128-channel data acquisition system to supplement
structural testing equipment that has already been acquired. The data
acquisition system will be used to collect measurements of strains,
displacements, forces, and temperature in the tests that will be conducted in
the new facility.
