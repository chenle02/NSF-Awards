Flame growth of diamond films is controlled by nucleation on the substrate, and
diffusion of the growth species through the boundary layer formed by the jet of
hot gas. It is proposed to monitor these effects by in situ long focal distance
microscopy using a Questar microscope. Edge-on observation of the impinging gas
jet with this microscope, which provides 2 micron resolution at 15 cm, will
allow us to map out the variation in the boundary layer thickness across the
deposition area. This information will be used to study the effects of gas flow
on the heat and mass transfer to the growing film. Direct high resolution
observation of the substrate will allow one to make a real-time video of the
growing film, and will help clarify the steps in the nucleation process. Work on
electrochemical deposition will be more qualitative and exploratory, since no
electrochemical diamond deposition process has yet been demonstrated. The search
for a useful process will attempt to exploit analogies with electrodeposition of
silicon, germanium and other refractory semiconductors. There has recently been
an intense international research effort in the field of low pressure, low
temperature diamond film growth. Because of the superlative properties of
diamond, including hardness, thermal conductivity and chemical inertness, the
potential impact of low cost diamond in many areas of technology would be very
great. The goal of this research project is to investigate experimentally the
kinetics of several promising diamond film growth techniques, including chemical
combustion flame growth, plasma flame growth, and electrochemical deposition.
