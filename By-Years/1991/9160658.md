The objective of this project is to use plasma induced polymerization for the
preparation of new High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) supports.
Monomers will be polymerized on silica surfaces to form thin, pin hole free
chromatographic supports whose silanol sites are deactivated by the polymer
coating. Other rigid supports, such as alumina, will be evaluated with the
objective to prepare alkali stable chromatographic supports. Chromatographic
evaluations will be performed using both small molecule and large molecule
standard probes. The above process, unlike conventional silane bonding, does not
require a large chemical facility, or the use of large quantities of reactants
and wash solvents, or long reaction times. In addition, the resulting novel
chromatographic supports should have better separation efficiencies with
improved stability, reproducibility, and be scaleable from analytical to
preparative separation modes.
