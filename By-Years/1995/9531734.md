This award will support the participation of 10 undergraduate students each year
in the Undergraduate Research in Neuroscience program offered by Ohio
University. The program is a self-contained ten week introduction to research in
neuroscience that is constructed around four main ideas. First, through lectures
from scientific workers including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,
college and university faculty, grant administrators, and researchers in private
industry, the participants acquire a general knowledge of the rewards,
requirements, and structure of a research career. Second, they achieve a basic
understanding of neuroscience through 42 hrs. of structured classroom
instruction. Third, in order to directly experience the joys and frustrations of
research, they work with a faculty mentor of their choice to study a particular
research topic, analyze their results, and present their findings in written
form and orally at a colloquium at the end of the program. Fourth, in order to
gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a research scientist, each
student is assigned a graduate student mentor and is also exposed to a variety
of professional, academic, and social settings where the students can interact
with research scientists at all levels from graduate students to professors.
Particular care has been taken to structure the program so that the students
continually advance to greater independence as their knowledge and skills
develop; funds are provided for particularly qualified students to attend
scientific conferences to present their results and experience even greater
exposure to the culture of science. This award will foster the continued
education and training of individuals who will be part of the next generation of
basic researchers in the diverse aspects of neuroscience.
