This research project is concerned with the match of algorithms for signal
processing with architectures to solve complex large-scale problems in a variety
of engineering applications. Modern signal processing algorithms are normally
described in terms of linear algebra and signal processors employ matrix-vector
techniques suitable for various linear algebra computations. Both architectures
and algorithms are inherently parallel in nature. Parallel architectures and
algorithms in linear algebra for signal processing forms the basis of this
research. This research describes a new type of optical linear algebra processor
(OLAP) that uses optical elements to achieve high speed performance and
parallelism. A novel digital OLAP architecture is proposed which operates on
digital binary-encoded numbers for high-accuracy. The new architecture achieves
digital multiplication by optical convolution. Specific problems will be
examined to determine quantitative performance, error analysis, and optimum
algorithm development. The applications to be addressed include: the solution of
partial differential equations by finite differencing methods, the solution of
structural mechanics problems using finite element methods, and computational
fluid mechanics problems.
