Interval methods and software have been developed over the years for a wide
range of problems in scientific computing. However, in order to be able to apply
these methods, which give results of guaranteed accuracy, one needs to find ways
to improve the efficiency of the computations. For ill-conditioned problems
variable precision interval computation is often effective. The two main
approaches investigated in this project involve improving the efficiency of
variable precision computing and parallelizing the interval algorithms for
speed-up using distributed networks of computers. Preliminary studies indicate
the possibility of very significant speed-up times when the methods can be
parallelized for a network of computers. The investigator has obtained some
results for a problem from chemical engineering and for a problem involving the
onset of turbulence in wind shears. As algorithmic progress is made, it will
become possible to solve other important real world problems with guaranteed
accuracy. Such guarantees are crucial in many engineering problems involving
safety and environmental issues.
