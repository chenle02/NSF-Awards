The principal investigators will continue their investigation of a broad range
of problems in differential geometry and global analysis. The problems will
focus on the relationship between geometric invariants and topological
invariants. In particular they will study knots and linking, structures on four
manifolds, quantum groups, and Chern-Simons path integrals. This award will
support research in the general area of differential geometry and global
analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship between the
geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis
is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a space by
piecing together local information. Applications of these areas of mathematics
in other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas
boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe.
