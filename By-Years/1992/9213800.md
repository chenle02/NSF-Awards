Over a three year period, Dr. Curt Beck will continue his analysis of organic
artifacts recovered in European Paleolithic and Neolithic archaeological sites.
The research is designed not only to increase understanding of European
prehistory - especially patterns of trade - but also to involve Vassar
undergraduates in scientific research. Dr. Beck will focus on three areas: 1.
the provenience analysis of archaeological artifacts of amber and related fossil
resins in European prehistory, principally by infrared spectroscopy; 2. the
analysis and identification of non-fossil resinous and fatty residues and
coatings in archaeological ceramics, principally by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry; 3. the application of computers to spectra classification, data
management and simulation of mathematical models of prehistoric exchange
systems. The research is important because it will increase understanding of how
complex societies developed, It will also encourage undergraduates to pursue
careers in science.
