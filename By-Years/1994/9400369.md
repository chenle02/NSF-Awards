9400369 O'Brien Several methods to polymerize supramolecular assemblies were
introduced in the last decade. Many of these assemblies, e.g. monolayers,
liposomes, and multilayers, are two-dimensional arrays of amphiphiles. Success
in the design and reproducible preperation of new materials from these
assemblies requires a clear understanding of the polymerization processes. The
previous studies suppported by NSF-DMR have successfully provided a basic
understanding of the nature of linear polymerizations of amphiphiles in the
supramolecular fast-diffusion regime. The new research to be carried over will
characterize crosslinking polymerizations as well as polymerizations in the
slow-diffusion regime. Methods developed in this laboratory will be used to
characterize the efficiency of crosslinking in two-dimensional assemblies with
newly designed bifunctional molecules. The rate and degree of polymerization in
bilayers will be compared at temperatures above (fast diffusion) and below (slow
diffusion) the main-phase transition temperature of the bilayer assembly. These
results of these studies on bilayers will be used to design new monomers for the
polymerization of other supramolecular, e.g. discotic liquid crystals. %%% The
polymerization of supramolecular assemblies provides an effective means to
modify their chemical and physical properties to prepare novel materials with
particular properties of interest to both biological and material sciences. The
research to date indicates that polymerized supramolecular assemblies are likely
to find utility in diagnostics, in the controlled delivery of reagents and
drugs, in the design and preparation of stable assemblies for the efficient
transduction of light energy, in surface modification, and for the stabilization
of organic zeolites. ***
