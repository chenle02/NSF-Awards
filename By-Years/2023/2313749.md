The conference grant will enable students to attend the Logic Mentoring Workshop
(LMW 2023) which will be co-located with Computer Science Logic (CSL) conference
to be held in February in Warsaw, Poland. CSL is the annual conference of the
European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL). LMW seeks to introduce
and mentor students who have already shown interest in logic and semantics
research by bringing them to CSL so they can learn about current research
problems, make connections with their contemporaries, and interact with leaders
in the field.

Funded students will benefit greatly from the opportunity to engage in the
critical technical, professional, and social exchanges that both the conference
and the workshop foster. The LMW workshop will focus on mentoring and career
advice to enable undergraduate and graduate students, and especially women, and
underrepresented minorities to pursue and thrive in research careers both in
logic/semantics specifically and in computer science generally. This travel
grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based
and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important
component of graduate school education for our society's future computer science
researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with
world-class researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring
relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
