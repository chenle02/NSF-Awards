The objective of this work is to enhance the understanding of the risks and
catastrophic natural and manmade events. The project will develop the
mathematical bases where three concepts/issues will be integrated: a) the return
period of the maximum probable flood (PMF); b) the statistics of the extreme and
the choice of probability distribution function; and c) the conditional expected
damage as derived from the partitioned multiobjective risk method (PMRM) that
corresponds to low frequency/high impact events. This work will increase and
improve our understanding of the stochastic processes associated with extreme
natural events. Five tasks will be carried out, and they are: 1) develop a
cogent and definite mathematical relationship between the a-priori assumptions
on the return period of the PMF and their effects on dam safety problems; 2)
expand findings to the dynamics of the return period of PMF in general; 3)
broaden the relationship between PMRM and the statistics of extremes from
certain densities to a larger class of distributions; 4) link the concept of
conditional expectation of extreme events to the concept of return period; and
5) integrate tasks 3 and 4, so as to create the envisioned mathematical model.
