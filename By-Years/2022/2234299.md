Geometric group theory is active area at the interface of geometry, algebra, and
dynamical systems, which has seen many break-through results over the past
decades, with many applications especially to low-dimensional topology. This
award provides funding for the first Riverside Workshop on Geometric Group
Theory, which is to be held March 27-31 2023 at the University of California
Riverside. This workshop will feature four minicourses given by early-career
mathematicians working in the field. The topic of each minicourse will be a
cutting-edge technique or idea developed by the speaker, with an audience of
graduate students and postdocs in mind. Each speaker will also produce an
expository paper on the topic of their minicourse, and these papers will be
compiled into a book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the machinery in geometric
group theory is highly technical, and so graduate students looking to enter the
field will benefit from careful exposition of the big ideas of the field in
lecture series that elaborate extensively on background and examples. The
invited minicourse speakers are: Matthew Durham (University of California,
Riverside), who will speak on the hierarchical geometry of mapping class groups
and surface bundles; Anne Lonjou (Universit√© Paris-Saclay), who will speak on
applications of geometric group theory to algebraic geometry; Marissa Kawehi
Loving (University of Wisconsin-Madison), who will speak on the geometry of
mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces and their mapping tori; and Jean-
Pierre Mutanguha (Institute for Advanced Study), who will speak on the geometry
of mapping tori of free group automorphisms. For more information, please see
