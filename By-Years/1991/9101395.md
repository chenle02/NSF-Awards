The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will receive support for shipboard
technician activities associated with the three major research vessels that are
operated by the Institution. A significant portion of the ships' operating
schedules in recent years and again in 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored
research projects. The Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-
sea component and an ashore component. The at-sea component consists of
instructing scientific personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;
maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific instrumentation; instruction
and supervision of deck operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-
coming and off-going scientific parties. On shore activities include the
maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and
assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field work on the vessel.
Shipboard technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities for
providing the coordination and assistance needed for the successful completion
of research projects at sea. The level of activity and amount of support are
closely related to the size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific
outfit and capability.
