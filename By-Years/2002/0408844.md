Abstract

0408844 P.I.: Laura Ray Dartmouth University

This project develops methods that increase the sensitivity of electromagnetic
(EM) NDE sensors by enhanced sensitivity control (ESC), which exploits the
relation between feedback control gains and parameters that characterize system
damage geometry. These sensors will be used to detect incipient flaws of civil
and mechanical systems and track flaw growth under random loads.

Research tasks will focus on developing SEC for EM NDE sensors such as eddy
current and giant magnetostrictive sensors. Distributed parameter models of
feedback control sensors and structure systems will be developed and used in
concert with computational efficient inverse methods for damage geometry
identification, and numerical and experimental evaluation of SEC for eddy
current NDE.

This a goal proposal involving collaboration with General Electric Corporation
and includes an innovative component of educating all level of students through
research.
