9311234 Mathews This is an award to support acquisition of a High Performance
Liquid Chromatograph system. The investigator plans to use the system in
conducting analyses of environmental samples in research on processes to remove
organic contaminants from water and wastewaters and to concentrate chemical
compounds of potential value from waste materials produced during processing of
agricultural products and from industrial operations. The costs of bringing
water up to desired quality standards and in treatment of wastewater to minimize
undesirable environmental impact can be reduced by removal of organic compounds
and recovering their resource values. The equipment purchased under this award
will also contribute to the education of students. The proposal leading to this
award was submitted in accord with conditions contained in the Program
Announcement and Guidelines, "Research Equipment Grant Program," NSF 90- 146.
