This award funds the development of a new method for inferring the choices
people will make in possible situations from a variety of 'non-choice' data.
Many practical problems in microeconomics call for the researcher to predict the
distribution of households' choices in not-yet-observed situations. Economists
prefer to draw such inferences from actual choices in a closely related domain.
However, this approach is sometimes problematic in practice because of the
practical limitations of choice data. For example, we may not have data about
closely related choices, or we may have serious concerns about uncontrolled
factors, selections, and the endogeneity of opportunity
sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new method uses non-choice data. This method goes
beyond current 'non-choice' methods such as the use of survey responses to
include possible measures of passive physiological and neurological responses
that have been widely studied in behavioral science. The new approach has
several features beyond the use of non-choice data. The researchers focus on
non-choice responses that are likely to have context-independent meanings over
large collections of choice problems. The researchers treat the decision problem
as the unit of observation, and they treat the problem as one of optimal
statistical prediction. Finally, they want to determine whether and when these
new methods are better than the standard method using imperfect choice
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts are substantial. The research could
result in a new valuation method that could be used in addition to or instead of
such methods as contingent valuation. The result would be improvements in how
microeconomics is used to analyze a broad array of practical questions.
