The objective of the proposed work is to apply radiation transport methods
developed to study controlled fusion to simulate the reflection of light in
computer graphics. View factor methods have recently been applied to the study
of time dependent radiation transport in enclosures at KMS Fusion Inc. The
techniques used in such codes parallel to a surprising degree developments in
the field of computer graphics, where view factor methods have been
independently applied to obtain realistic images. It is proposed that view
factor techniques developed to study radiation transport be "transplanted" to
the field of computer graphics. This mating of radiation transport theory with
computer graphics will help provide images of unprecedented quality.
