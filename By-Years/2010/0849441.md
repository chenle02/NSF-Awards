The UW-Stout Applied Science Program, composed of three departments, biology,
physics and chemistry with concentrations in biotechnology, nanotechnology,
materials science and environmental science, is experiencing unprecedented
growth. The goal of this project, Polytechnic Mission, Applied Science Vision,
is to capitalize on this growth and enhance the successful Applied Science
Community, infrastructure already in place to initiate an innovative model for
the recruitment, retention and career success of academically able but
financially disadvantaged and underrepresented STEM students. In this model (10)
$10,000 renewable recruitment scholarships are awarded to incoming STEM students
and (20) $5,000 nonrenewable retention scholarships are awarded to current and
future applied science students over four years. The model incorporates a
holistic approach to STEM education, including a summer bridge program,
intensive advising, faculty and peer mentors, participation in a learning
community that encompasses students living on campus and off, undergraduate
research experiences, and opportunities to present on research experiences.
