This award will facilitate the attendance of graduate students to the
International&lt;br/&gt;Conference of Fluvial Hydraulics (River Flow) 2016 being
held at Saint Louis University. Increased graduate student participation will
infuse the perspectives of early career scientists into the conference and
provide them with networking opportunities. This conference enhances the
infrastructure for research and education by bringing together groups from
industry and academia. It also promotes international collaboration among
scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Conference of Fluvial
Hydraulics was established in 2002 by the International Association for Hydro-
Environment Engineering and Research. It covers a range of topics in fluvial
research. These topics are relevant to both the NSF Geomorphology and Land-use
Dynamics Program and the Hydrological Sciences Program. Promoting the attendance
of early career scientists to this conference will advance the goal of these
programs to recruit and train the next generation of geomorphologists and
hydrologists.
