Few practicing engineers and scientists, educators, and students have a working
understanding of the principles of pollution prevention. The objective of this
seminar is to both present a course and develop a problem workbook on pollution
prevention in order to address this need and resolve this technology gap. The
workbook, problems and solutions will be generated by an environmental, but
interdisciplinary, team of engineering and applied science faculty. Topics
include: Regulations, Process Plant Fundamentals and Applications, Project
Analysis and Economics, Audit Principles, Source Reduction Approaches, Recycling
Approaches, Other Control Options, Industrial Applications, and Case Studies.
The first draft of the problem workbook will be prepared in the summer of 1992.
The 1992-93 academic year will provide an opportunity to classroom-test the
effectiveness of the problems in the workbook. A three-day follow-up session in
late June of 1993 is also scheduled to provide an opportunity to revise, update,
edit, etc., the workbook.
