9402145 Ogilby University of New Mexico The events that result in the photo- and
electric current-induced degradation of polymer-based electroluminescent light
emitting diodes (LED's) will be studied and then controlled. Spectroscopic and
chemical analysis will be performed to determine if oxygen is involved in the
degradation. In a second project, oxygen-induced deactivation of excited states
of organic molecules and the concomitant production of singlet oxygen will be
studied. Factors that influence the fraction of b1Sg+ excited state oxygen in
solution and the a1Dg excited state in solid polymers will be examined. In a
third study, the removal of O2 (b1Sg+) by reaction with an organic substrate
will be examined in solution. This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program
supports the work of Professor Peter R. Ogilby at the University of New Mexico.
Excited states of light emitting diodes (LED's) will be produced by application
of an electric current in the presence of oxygen. Energy will be transferred
from the excited state LED to oxygen with the concomitant production of two
different excited state oxygen species. The unique reactions of these two
excited state oxygen species will be studied and the results will form the basis
of a method to protect LED's from degradation. These reactions will also be
studied in solution with other organic molecules. The production of these two
excited states of oxygen by energy transfer from other organic molecules and
subsequent reactions in solution will be studied.
