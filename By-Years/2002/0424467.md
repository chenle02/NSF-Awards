We will conduct an ongoing annual symposium entitled, "Recent Developments in
Neurobiology (RDN)," to be presented at the annual meetings of the Society for
Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB). The RDN symposia uses a novel form
of presentation-"piggy-back" talks, in which the head of the invited laboratory
provides the first twenty-five minutes of a sixty-minute talk to discuss the
general area of significance of the laboratory's research. The next twenty-five
minute block is presented by a junior member of the laboratory, usually an
advanced graduate student or post-doc, who gives specific information about the
laboratory's current activities. The final ten minutes are devoted to a common
question/answer period. The symposium papers will be published in the Society's
journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the
goals of the "piggy-back" format is to provide experience to in-training members
of the profession, in terms of symposium presentation/participation at a
national meeting. Another is to expose these individuals, and their work, to
potential employers. The symposium also seeks to provide a set of recent printed
review papers to the Neuroscience community through the journal
papers.&lt;br/&gt;
