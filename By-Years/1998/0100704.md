It is intended to provide a theoretical framework and numerical tools for
solving the three body recombination problem and other related processes. This
is the situation in which three atoms simultaneously collide, forming an atom
and a diatomic molecule, with some of the energy liberated transferred to the
rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule, the remainder to
translational kinetic energy. An important application occurs in Bose-Einstein
condensation, where losses from the trap due to three body recombination limit
the density achievable in condensates.
