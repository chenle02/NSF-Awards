This objective of this research is to develop a computational framework for
behavior modeling adapted to the problem of creating complex scenarios in large-
scale virtual environments. The project will develop a modeling system based on
hierarchical, concurrent state machines that supports the control of reactive
behaviors and provides mechanisms for coordinating behaviors to create critical
situations and events. A second research thrust is to create authoring tools to
facilitate the design of virtual environments and the definition of scenarios in
which computer generated agents play central roles. This technology has
application in interactive, real-time simulation environments such as vehicle
simulation for driver training, virtual prototyping, and experimental studies of
driving safety that require dynamic situations and circumstances to be
reproduced across trials without overly restricting subject's actions and while
maintaining diversity, responsiveness, and spontaneity in agent behaviors.
