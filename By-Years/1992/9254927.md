The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is publishing
and disseminating two booklets, Find Your Future and You're in Charge, for
precollege and undergraduate students with disabilities to motivate them towards
education and careers in science and engineering. The booklets include a
rationale for choosing a science- based career and encouragement to seek out
postsecondary institutions that offer science and engineering curricula. The
booklets include much practical advice on admissions, orientation, establishing
support services, interaction with faculty, asssistive technology, and pre-
career science work experiences. The booklets were developed in 1987-89 as part
of an NSF-funded research project conducted by American Institutes of Research
(AIR) and AAAS on critical factors contributing to entry and advancement by
persons with disabilities in science, mathematics, and engineering fields. In
the course of the study, 280 working scientists and engineers and students with
disabilities were interviewed. The content of the booklets was developed from
these interviews. AAAS will design and publish the booklets in an attractive
format and will do some editing so that the legislative information and language
meet 1992 standards. Announcements about the availability of the booklets will
be placed in both the science education and disability press and announced in
electronic networks. Single copies will be distributed with a cover
letter/return sheet to obtain feedback. Multiple copies will be distributed at
appropriate meetings.
