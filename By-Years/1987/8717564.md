Diverse taxa of freshwater zooplankton can use chemical cues to discriminate
between particles which differ in food value. Thus, many planktonic grazers may
be more specialized in theirdiets than previously suspected. This research will
use foodselection experiments, gut analysis, and field enclosureexperiments to
investigate patterns and strategies of chemically.mediated selection, and to
evaluate the importance of thisphenomenon in a natural community. Foraging
theory predicts that decision-based selection behavior should be sensitive to
nutritional quality, the abundance of alternative foods, and hunger. These
predictions will be tested with copepods feeding in natural seston. Enclosure
experiments will be used to test for differences between taste-sensitive
(Diaptomus) and nondiscriminating (Daphnia) grazers in their impacts on natural
phytoplankton, bacteria, and detritus. In addition to these basic research
objectives, undergraduate involvement through the Crooked Lake Biological
Station is a major asset of the project.
