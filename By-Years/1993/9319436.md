9319436 Rous A comprehensive theoretical description of resonance electron
scattering by molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces will be developed and applied
to understand the fundamental physics of negative ion formation at surfaces. The
computational methodology will be based upon the layer-Kohn-Korringa-Rostoker
theory which will fully incorporate the multiple scattering of the trapped
electron by the substrate and surface barrier. Thus the influence of the
unoccupied electronic structure of the substrate on the molecular resonance will
be modelled. The dependence of resonance lifetime and energy upon the molecular
adsorption height (above the surface), adsorption site and molecular orientation
will be explored in order to elucidate the link between the adsorption geometry
of a molecule and the behavior of the transient (resonance) state. %%% In a
variety of electron and photon stimulated surface dynamical processes, short
lived "resonance" electronic states localized mainly upon the adsorbed molecule
are known to be important. The proposed work concerns itself with characterizing
both the energy of these states and their lifetime via computationally intensive
methodologies. The work will concentrate on how the presence of the nearby
surface affects the resonance states of the free-space molecule and, further,
how these states vary as a function of the location and orientation of the
molecule relative to the surface. ***
