Abstract

Learning & Develoment Across Cultures: A Workshop

Patricia M. Greenfield

A series of two workshops (a planning meeting and a larger conference) will
bring together international scholars to formulate a research agenda and a
program of research activities. The cultural construction of learning and its
relation to development is the rationale for the workshop. A developmental
perspective will guide the organization of the workshop topics: (1) Learning in
infancy across cultures; (2) Learning in childhood across cultures; (3)
Adolescent learning across cultures; (4) Adulthood learning across cultures; and
(5) Learning and aging across cultures. The objective will be to scrutinize
learning similarities and differences as a way of understanding development. The
multiphase approach will help learning scientists understand the developmental
precursors and learning phenomena, as well as developmental consequences.

The results of the workshop will include a reseach agenda to guide the
development of future research projects about children's learning in varying
cultural contexts. Another anticipated outcome will be a book that can serve as
an international textbook on the role of cultural differences and universal
stages in human development.
