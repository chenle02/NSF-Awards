9352828 Wattenberg Being continued is the development, dissemination, and
assessment of an integrated two-year sequence to replace five courses-- Calculus
I, II, and III, Linear Algebra, and Ordinary Differential Equations. The
motivating idea driving and project is that these subjects should be taught in
the context of real and engaging problems. By studying these subjects in
context, students are better able to understand them and to use them outside the
mathematics classroom. Pedagogically, the most important feature of this
sequence is the participation of students at a higher level than is typical of
traditional courses. Emphasized are very substantial and realistic problems that
require the application of a combination of mathematical techniques and that are
open-ended, often without clean, simple solutions. Computers and writing are
essential parts of the approach. Computers make it possible to deal with more
realistic applications and facilitate the experimental approach that is
emphasized. There is a synergy between writing and meaningful problems that
engages on a high intellectual plane requiring them to understand and articulate
the mathematics, the applications, and the connections between them.
