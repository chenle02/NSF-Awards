Abstract

Award: DMS-0505968 Principal Investigator: Helmut H. Hofer and Dusa McDuff

This instructional workshop, co-sponsored by the DFG (the German equivalent of
the NSF) will bring together junior and senior researchers in the field of
symplectic geometry. The field has its origins in Hamiltonian dynamics and
geometric optics and has many fundamental applications. For example, numerical
methods based on symplectic ideas (symplectic integrators) are used to compute
the orbits of satellites and other celestial bodies. Historic highlights are
KAM-Theory (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser), which leads to a proof of the stability of
our solar system, and the theory of infinite-dimensional integrable systems,
which is the mathematical underpinning of fiber optics, a technology that lies
at the heart of all of our communication networks. More recently, the rapidly
developing theory of pseudoholomorphic curves has led to deep new insights into
the structure of three and four-dimensional space, and to unexpected new
connections between geometry and physics. It is a surprising fact that the same
underlying ideas apply to geometric optics, to dynamics and to the most abstract
physics (i.e. string theory).

It is the purpose of this instructional workshop to describe the construction of
symplectic field theory (SFT) in detail. SFT is a comprehensive theory of
symplectic invariants, including such well-known theories as Floer theory,
Gromov-Witten theory and contact homology. It is constructed by measuring moduli
spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves. The richness of its structure comes from the
fact that the moduli spaces have boundaries and singularities and that
infinitely many moduli spaces interact with each other. These structures can be
captured by a novel nonlinear Fredholm theory which is distinguished by two
facts. The ambient spaces do not carry smooth structures in the usual sense and
even have locally varying dimensions. However there is a notion of
transversality (or regularity), and at regular points the solution sets are
smooth orbifolds with boundaries and corners. Moreover the theory makes precise
what it means for infinitely many Fredholm operators to interact with each
other, which leads to a so-called "Fredholm Theory with Operations". This
abstract Fredholm Theory is developed and illustrated by its application to SFT.
The issues addressed are pertinent to a variety of important problems, and one
can expect that the ideas presented at the workshop will have implications in a
number of mathematical fields and their applications.
