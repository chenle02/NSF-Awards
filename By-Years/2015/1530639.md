A central goal of democracy is to achieve a disburse distribution of power.
Participatory and representative institutions of government are designed with
that goal in mind. And yet, a major theme of political discourse is the high and
persistent degree of concentrated political power that emerges in democratic
governments across space and time. The tendency for political power to
concentrate is evidently difficult to control. This research investigates why
political power concentrates. The investigators shall develop a framework and
tools that offer clear strategic intuitions for how key players capture and
control political processes, exploiting information about who has power in the
future, and offering amendments contingent on previous voting decisions. Their
framework launches a broader research agenda on identifying when information,
transparency, and flexibility exacerbate the inequality of political and
economic power.

The investigators propose two models of dynamic political institutions. The
first is a framework of negotiations and policymaking where players have
information about which players have agenda-setting power in the future. They
find that transparency can exacerbate inequality and inefficiency. The second
project is a framework of a flexible agenda-setter who cannot vote on outcomes
but can make proposals to a voting body. The investigators find that even when
voters are far-sighted and sophisticated, an agenda setter can manipulate the
voting body by flexibly offering amendments that are contingent on the voting
outcome.
