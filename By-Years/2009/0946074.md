This SBIR Phase I project will develop a relatively simple and economical method
to separate heavy metals from acidic streams in industry and environmental
operations. The project will use techniques for bonding chemicals to an
activated carbon carrier to create a metal-ion binding material. These metal
ions can be removed by using strong acid solutions while regenerating the
material for reuse.

The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be the substitution
of an inexpensive ion-exchange material for the more costly ion-exchange resins
based on polymeric organic compounds. Success in this Phase I project will lead
to products that can serve specific applications in the nuclear, industrial, and
environmental fields.
