As the technology for modern flexible manufacturing systems has evolved, so has
the need for advances in control strategies and signal processing. Throughout
the world, there are groups working on the problems of integrating and
controlling the diverse equipment that must be linked to create a flexible
manufacturing system. This travel grant will allow the group working at the
University of California at Berkeley to travel to Japan to work cooperatively
with the group at the University of Tokyo.
