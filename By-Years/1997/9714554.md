The MARGINS initiative seeks to understand the complex interplay of processes
that govern continental margin evolution globally, particularly targeting
multidisciplinary research programs involving field experiments, numerical
simulations, and laboratory analyses. Support is provided for a coordinating
office at the University of Hawaii for the MARGINS initiative over the next two
years to provide the planning, organization, and communication necessary to
further develop MARGINS research efforts that include focused studies in 4
areas: (1) Subduction/Mass Balance Study; (2) SEIZE Experiments; (3) Rifting
Focused Study; and (4) Sediment Dynamics of Continental Margins.
