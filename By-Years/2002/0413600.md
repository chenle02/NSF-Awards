The city of Brazzaville, Congo, is home to a population of immigrants from
Mali, which has been a part of that city for over 100 years. While these
immigrants have a high degree of economic integration in Congo (most are
merchants and entrepreneurs), they nonetheless maintain a community that is in
nearly all respects separate from that of the cultural majority: they avoid
intermarriage and limit their social contacts with Congolese. More importantly,
these Malians remain intimately involved in the affairs of their country of
origin, despite the fact that it is thousands of miles away. This dissertation
research by a student of cultural anthropology will study how and why members of
this immigrant group preserve these significant transnational ties over several
generations. It will use an array of methods, including participant observation,
in-depth interviews, a sample survey, and a case study of migrants from a single
village, to focus special attention on three core areas of life which are
fundamental in keeping a distinct cultural identity for Malians in this setting:
childrearing practices, Islam, and commerce. It will also explore the question
of how migration, in addition to being a result of macro-level social, economic,
and political forces, might be understood as an undertaking of individual agents
who find in it not only economic livelihoods but deep cultural meaning.

In terms of its broader impact, this study will contribute to the education of a
young social scientist, and the new knowledge to be created will be of interest
to policy makers concerned with immigration and local community life in many
parts of the world.
