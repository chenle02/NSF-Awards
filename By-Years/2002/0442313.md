The IEEE is partnering with the Colorado School of Mines and DeVry University -
New Brunswick to produce a small suite of case studies illustrating the
application of standards in the design and development of products, processes,
and services. They are linking these cases to web-based tutorials and reference
guides on standards and to applications in design and development. These
materials are helping students and their faculty mentors understand how
standards are repositories of the knowledge and wisdom of their professional
predecessors and are an essential resource in design and development. To assess
the effectiveness of these resources in increasing the students' understanding
and application of standards, they are using surveys, focus groups, and think-
aloud techniques. Dissemination plans include papers at regional and national
engineering education conferences, publication in ASEE and IEEE journals, and
hosting the material on the IEEE web site, eventually leading to the web-based
IEEE Standards Learning Library.
