A 2-1/2 days workshop on "Research Needs for Applications of System Reliability
Concepts and Techniques in Structural Analysis, Design and Optimization" will be
conducted September 5-7, 1988, in Boulder, Colorado. This workshop will provide
a forum to an international group of researchers and practitioners to (a)
exchange their experiences in the field of applications of structural systems
reliability concepts and techniques, (b) discuss the theoretical and practical
applications of system reliability in analysis, design and optimization of
structures, and (c) identify and prioritize opportunities for high-risk, high-
cost research investment in bringing theoretical advances in the field of
systems reliability within the grasp of engineering practice. The proceedings of
this workshop will be widely distributed to researchers, practicing engineers,
and structural design code writers.
