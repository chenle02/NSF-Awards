9612506 Stephanopoulos The objective of this conference is to provide a
consensus definition of the field of Metabolic Engineering, organize the
mathematical, computational and experimental tools presently available for the
analysis of metabolic networks, and review the diverse applications of the
field. There is no other forum for this at the present time and there is much to
be gained by catalyzing interactions among different disciplines of Metabolic
Engineering. Specifically, sessions on the following topics have been planed to
cover current research activity: (1) metabolic engineering for the production of
novel products (biopolymers, polyketides), (2) metabolic engineering
applications in fuels, chemical and materials production, (3) metabolic
engineering in plants, (4) genomics and metabolic engineering, (5) metabolic
engineering of intracellular protein trafficking and cell cycle analysis, (6)
environmental applications, and (7) metabolic engineering of organ function and
therapy design. ***
