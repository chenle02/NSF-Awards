The overall focus of the research and education components of this work is on
the integration of cell biology and molecular engineering. Within the research
component, integration of these disciplines will be utilized in the development
of a generalized approach for the sensing and characterization of RNA molecules
in the cellular milieu, based on previously published single RNA sensitive
imaging probes. This approach will then be applied to the study of
megakaryocytes, which recently were discovered to sort RNAs to sites of platelet
formation. In the education portion of this proposal, the goal is to create
education modules, utilizing active learning experiences, at both the
undergraduate and secondary school level, that facilitate the ability of
students to integrate engineering principles and biology, and new assessment
strategies will be employed in order to gauge their utility.

This proposal is targeted to have broad impact at both the scientific level and
within society. From a scientific perspective, given the role of RNA in almost
every biological problem, new tools that allow for its thorough characterization
will impact the science of many researchers. On a societal level, by improving
the ability of students to integrate engineering approaches with cellular
biology, we?ll be able to improve their general ability to think critically and
solve problems using all the tools they have been exposed to during their
education.
