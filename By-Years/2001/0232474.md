This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will identify
materials with desirable properties and performance standards. Rapid advances in
communication technology, flight-based transportation, medical components and
military strategy due to rapidly changing global alliances is pushing a need for
materials that goes beyond current capabilities. This project will use advanced
3D fabrication techniques to produce innovative materials that mimic bio-based
shell structures. The commercial and broader impacts of this technology could
lead to a commercial product with unique properties. The project will expand the
capabilities of digital and rapid manufacturing, two areas that this country
must push forward in, if the country is to maintain any sort of dominance in
worldwide manufacturing.
