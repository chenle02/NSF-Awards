This grant from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will support
Professor Marshall's efforts to develop two new techniques involving Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT/ICR/MS. The first method
is a new two dimensional approach that should give tandem in time MS/MS to
provide immediate identification of all the coupled ion-molecule reactions
occuring in a complex mixtures. The second technique involves the determination
of the structure of gas-phase ions trapped in the ICR cell by using infrared
spectroscopy. This research will extend Professor Marshall's extensive
investigations of the very powerful method of FT/ICR/MS for the characterization
of small amounts of material which can be selected and studied according to
their mass. Advances in this area will allow a better understanding of the
fundamental chemistry that occurs between ions and molecules in the gas phase.
This will allow for improved methods of analysis of trace contaminants in a wide
variety of sample types.
