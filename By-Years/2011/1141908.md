This two year renewal effort has two community directed aims: 1) continued
collection, quality control and distribution of the Antarctic AWS network
meteorological data sets; and 2) the continued production of Antarctic composite
infrared satellite imagery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By making the AWS networked
data readily available to a wide, even global, community of researchers and
observational forecasters, the AMRC archive provides a necessary and useful
compilation. On the value of this activity alone, the broader impacts of these
activities continues to be a prime reason for continuing the records activities
in one form or another. A legacy of the University of Wisconsin efforts in this
arena enables continuity of the data collection and archival efforts. Outreach
activities to the (Wisconsin) public and efforts to engage (Wisconsin) K-12
school children and their teachers will also be continued.
