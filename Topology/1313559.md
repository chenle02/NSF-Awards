The objective of the proposed research is to investigate the interplay between
topological/geometric properties of groups and algorithms for solving the word,
conjugacy, and related problems. Major directions for this research include: (1)
Applications of autostackable structures to 3-manifold groups, Thompson's group
F, and metabelian groups; these structures are characterized using a combination
of topological and formal language theory properties of the Cayley graph, and
provide algorithms for solving the word problem and for building Dehn diagrams
for the group. (2) A study of the asymptotic growth of conjugacy classes and of
geodesic words and elements (up to conjugacy) of groups. (3) Improving
understanding of filling invariants, by studying refinements of the isodiametric
(i.e. intrinsic diameter) inequality and its extrinsic analog. (4) Applications
of group invariants to problems in knot theory; local moves, in combination with
the standard Reidemeister operations, will be studied to determine when these
local moves are (or are not) unknotting or unlinking operations.

The proposed work is centered around mathematical problems at the interface
between group theory, geometry, and computer science. Group theory is the
mathematical study of symmetries of objects; this research area has its
beginnings in the study of crystal structures in chemistry, but now has wide
applications across many disparate areas of mathematics and the sciences. Knot
theory also has seen wide application in recent years, and in particular the
study of unknotting via local moves is used to model enzyme actions on DNA
molecules. The methods proposed make essential use of tools from one or more of
these fields to shed light on important problems in another field. In particular
geometric methods are used in the pursuit of computationally effective and
efficient algorithms for groups, and algorithmic methods are used to determine
geometric properties of groups, including applications to knot theory. This
project includes mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics
research.
