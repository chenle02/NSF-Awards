Partial support is requested for exploratory work to evaluate the feasibility
of atomic physics experiments at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility's ion
storage ring. The author is a member of an international collaboration formed to
carry out the first approved atomic physics experiment to use a U.S. ion storage
ring. The experiment involves a search for (beam-energy resonant) electron
capture occurring when cooled, singly-charged helium ions collide with co-moving
electrons.
