9308839 Merickel The goal of this project is to use a knowledge based method to
extract contours and surfaces from medical images, such as magnetic resonance
images. The approach that is proposed is a "top down" one that could be compared
with the mental processes used by radiologists instead of the more traditional
"bottom up" approach used in image segmentation. The use of adaptive contours
will be extended to 3-D volumes. The investigators will study two specific
cases; namely, vessel walls and brain regions. This research will address a
fundamental problem in image processing and computer vision research. For
example, in the biomedical area, image segmentation is important for the
quantitative and noninvasive analysis of tissue and structure volumes, such as
might be needed for the evaluation of vessel integrity due to atherosclerosis
and brain structures for surgical planning. ***
