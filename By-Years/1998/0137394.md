Karen Goldberg, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for her
studies on the selective activation and functionalization of the C-H bonds of
alkanes. She will conduct studies of the mechanisms, energetics, requirements
and scopes of reaction steps involved in platinum catalyzed alkane oxidation.
Reactions to be investigated include the oxidative addition/reductive
elimination of C-H and C-O bonds at platinum centers and reactions of platinum
complexes with dioxygen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The selective activation and
functionalization of alkanes is a major goal in organometallic chemistry. The
production of useful chemicals directly from natural gas and other alkane
reserves would have significant economic and environmental advantages over
current processes. Students and postdoctoral associates will also be trained in
important skills of synthesis, characterization, kinetics and mechanistic
studies.&lt;br/&gt;
