Abstract: Conference on The Feynman Integral and Related Topics In Mathematics
and Physics, University of Nebraska, Lincoln May 12-14th, 2006.

The proposal is for partial support of a 3 day conference on the mathematical
theory of Feynman integrals and related topics in mathematical physics.

The primary objective of the meeting is to bring together researchers and young
investigators studying, or using, Feynman integrals in their work. The 11
plenary lectures will be given by well-known experts. The funding will be used
for the travel and living expenses of some of the principal speakers and to
support the participation of students and junior researchers.
