The properties of intense electromagnetic pulses propagating through magnetized
plasmas are investigated. These pulses, observed to propagate as solitary
whistlers in a large, dense laboratory magneto-plasma, are of intrinsic interest
as non- linear wave phenomena, and of possible significance to particle
acceleration and heating in space, and to fusion plasmas. The investigation
focusses on (i) the self-consistent field configurations of the pulses ranging
from the linear to the non- linear regime; (ii) the propagation, dispersion, and
conservation of energy and magnetic helicity; (iii) the interaction of two
solitary non-linear whistler pulses; and (iv) wave-particle interactions.
