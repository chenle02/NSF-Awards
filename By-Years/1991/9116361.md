This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports
collaborative research in neuroendocrinology to be conducted by Professor Bruce
S. McEwen of the Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology at the Rockefeller University
and Dr. Alejandro F. De Nicola of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of
Buenos Aires, Argentina. The focus of the project is to study the mechanism of
action of aldosterone in the brain. The research will investigate the
distribution within the brain and regulation by glucocorticoids and
mineralocorticoids of mRNA's for the three subtypes of the alpha subunit of Na,
K ATPase. In situ hybridization histochemistry will be used to localize and map
mRNA's in various brain regions and to study their regional regulation by
glutocorticoids and mineralocorticoids in male and female rat brains where there
may also be sex differences and estrogen affects. The award will foster
continuation of a fruitful U.S.-Argentina collaboration.
