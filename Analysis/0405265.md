A Conference on the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function

Abstract

Abstract:

The m-function was originally introduced by Weyl. Its implications for the
spectral theory of the underlying differential operator were first investigated
by Titchmarsh. In the intervening 50 years the scope of the m-function and also
its analogies for other mathematical systems have been developed extensively. A
meeting on the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function is planned for July 2004 in Cardiff,
Wales, to bring together experts in the subject as well as scientists outside of
mathematics who may exploit its use to develop new results in their own work.

The goal of this proposal is to make it possible for American scientists (mostly
graduate students and recent Ph.D.s) to participate. Monies obtained through
this proposal will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by
exposing particularly young scientists and graduate students to a very active
current research area. In selecting participants the proposer will give careful
consideration to those groups which are underrepresented in mathematics.
