This project examines voting in multi-candidate elections. The principal
investigators seek to understand the conditions under which voters are willing
to not vote for their most preferred alternative, and to instead consider
casting a "strategic" ballot in order to help a second-choice alternative defeat
a third-choice alternative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In democracies using single-
member-district plurality electoral laws, voters only rarely choose among three
candidates in the general election. The PIs propose to conduct multi-wave
telephone surveys both before and after elections in six states where public
opinion polling has indicated that three candidates are viable. The PIs are thus
equipped to probe the conditions under which voters might opt to abandon their
most-preferred candidate, and to vote instead for a second-best candidate in
hopes of defeating their least preferred alternative. This survey thus permits
an unmatched opportunity to examine strategic voting in different races and
contexts within the same electoral cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
makes several contributions. The project will enhance understanding of voter
decision-making not only in multi-way races but more broadly as well.
Comprehending the behavior of voters in turn stands as a central concern of
political science and contributes to a deeper knowledge of the workings of
democratic processes and institutions. The PIs aim to maximize leverage from the
grant through their use of interactive voice response (IVR) surveys, where
respondents note their answers to questions by pressing buttons on their keypad.
IVR telephone surveys deliver high-quality data, are extremely cost-effective,
and yet are not widely used in political science research. The data generated by
the project will be made available to scholars and policymakers. Findings from
the project will be of interest to policymakers and to political scientists
specializing in public opinion and in electoral and party politics.
