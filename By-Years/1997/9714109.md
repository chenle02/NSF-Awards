The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) will purchase and install of a
replacement emergency power generator set in the Whitman Laboratory Building.
The current generator set and distribution system, which is 38 years old,
provides emergency electrical power to the MBL's main summer laboratory
(Whitman), to the MBL's main year-round laboratory (the Lillie Laboratory
Building), and to the MBL's sole seawater pumping station, which supplies these
two laboratories, the Loeb Laboratory Building (research and research training),
and the Marine Resources Center with a constant supply of seawater throughout
the year. These improvements will assist the MBL in its ability to support
integrated research and educational activities by MBL investigators who need
all-weather access to modern laboratory services, who require dependable (and
sometimes long-term) refrigeration to preserve their reagents, preparations, and
organisms, and who require flowing seawater in their laboratories and to support
the MBL's extensive research animal collections.
