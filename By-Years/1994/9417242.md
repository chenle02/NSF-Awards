Baron, Edward 9417242 Baron will model the spectra and light-curves of both Type
II and Type I supernovae. He will calculate detailed models of both light curves
and synthetic spectra of supernovae in order to compare with observations from
the ultraviolet to the infrared in order to predict velocities, abundances, and
distances to supernovae, as well as to constrain theoretical models for the
explosion mechanism, progenitor system, and yield of radioactive Ni and Ti.
Baron has refined the expanding photosphere method into an accurate tool for
determining calibration independent distances to supernovae. His models give
accurate values of the total emitted flux of supernova and thus should give
accurate results for the Hubble constant. ***
