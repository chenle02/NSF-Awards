In order to build domain-specific web-scale video digital libraries on the Web,
it is critical to be able to identify and extract certain information of
interest (termed information segments) efficiently and automatically. For
instance, by collecting only so-called academic videos and their information
segments from the Web, one can build a next-generation digital library similar
to CiteSeer or Google Scholar. However, that only archives and indexes academic
videos (instead of academic papers). Toward this goal, we conduct a preliminary
study to develop such identification and extraction of latent information
segments from domain-specific videos on the Web. Key emphasis is on how to
unearth diverse metadata and associated data from video contents and web pages
from which videos are downloaded. Techniques from machine learning (e.g., LDA),
data extraction and integration (e.g., wrapper/mediator), natural language
processing (e.g., named entity recognition and extraction), and multimedia
processing (e.g., near-duplicate detection) are evaluated, applied, and extended
appropriately. Scalability of such techniques over large volumes of video data
is also being explored.
