In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Gould will study the mechanisms of oxidation-reduction
reactions in solution. Emphasis will be placed on the participation of less
usual oxidation states. One of the important foundations of chemical thinking is
a broad knowledge of the behavior of the oxidation states of the elements. Three
general areas will be investigated: 1) intramolecular ligand-to-metal hydride
migrations, resulting in two-electron reductions of the metal center; 2) redox
chemistry of stabilized chromium(IV), particularly the noncomplementary
reactions in which chromium(III) is formed through the use of two-electron
reducing agents; and 3) redox chemistry of molybdenum(III) and -(IV). Attempts
will be made to differentiate one- and two-electron oxidations of these states;
evidence for ligand bridging will be sought. The data obtained should allow
estimates for rates of electron self-exchange pertaining to these systems.
