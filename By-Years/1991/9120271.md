This award supports visits over a two year period by Dr. Dale L. Whalen of the
University of Maryland, Baltimore County to the Laboratory of Dr. James M.
Coxon, University of Canterbury, in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Ministry of
Research, Science and Technology is supporting the reciprocal visits by Dr.
Coxon to the U.S. This collaborative research activity is designed to
investigate Lewis acid-catalyzed rearrangement of substituted epoxides. The
project will attempt to determine the rearrangement pathways and the
stereoselectivity of hydrogen migration in epoxides. Semi-empirical and initial
calculations will be performed by both research groups. Exchange visits are
designed to facilitate formulation of the computational approach to profiling
the rearrangement process. By combining the talents of these complementary
researchers, Whalen the experimentalist and Coxon the theoretician, a
significant contribution in the field of organic chemical dynamics toward
understanding the intermediate states in stereospecific epoxide rearrangements
should occur. At present such rearrangement mechanisms are not well understood.
