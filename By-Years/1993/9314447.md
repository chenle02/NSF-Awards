9314447 Olson In this project, the PIs will deploy approximately 210 Lagrangian
surface drifters in the Indian Ocean as part of the Indian Ocean Expedition
(IOE), a U.S. component of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
Drifters provide both surface currents and surface temperature measurements. In
addition to contributing to measuring temperature measurements. In addition to
contributing to measuring near-surface variability during the IOE, these data
will fill a major gap in providing a surface layer data set of Lagrangian
current measurements over the entire globe during WOCE, a major objective of
that program. ***
