Although best known for their role in photosynthesis, plastids perform several
essential functions, which include synthesis of hormones, amino acids, fatty
acids, lipids, vitamins, nucleotides and secondary metabolites. Despite their
essential role, little is known of the developmental signals that help drive the
process of plastid differentiation.. To address this important agricultural and
biological problem, we will take advantage of new tools that have been developed
for genomic and proteomic studies. The availability of extensive plant genome
sequences has enabled us to identify a set of approximately 1500 maize EST
sequences that encode chloroplast targeted proteins. Through array profiling, we
will examine the expression of these genes in the two photosynthetic cell types
in maize, the bundle sheath and mesophyll. In parallel, we will initiate a broad
survey of the estimated 3,000 proteins predicted to accumulate in plastids using
highly sensitive mass spectroscopy techniques. The bioinformatic integration of
proteomic and expression profiling data will provide a detailed picture of
transcription and translational control mechanisms utilized by the maize
photosynthetic plastids. Finally, transgenic plants carrying bundle sheath and
mesophyll cell-specific markers will be constructed to help monitor the
differentiation process. These GFP constructs will permit a detailed analysis of
bundle sheath and mesophyll cell biology and facilitate the analysis of a series
of maize plastid mutants. Several results are expected from this project, such
as an improved understanding of the biochemical functions of the different
plastid types and novel insights into the differentiation process. As several
chloroplast functions are directly related to the agronomic performance of the
maize plant, these studies will greatly improve our understanding and ability to
engineer this important crop plant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
