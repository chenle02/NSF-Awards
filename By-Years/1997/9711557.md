Webb OPP 9711557 Abstract The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)
Antarctic Offshore Stratigraphy Program (ANTOSTRAT) committee will convene a
workshop at Hobart, Australia, during July, 1997, with the principal objective
of writing a document that outlines important topics that the Antarctic
geoscience community should address during the next decade. This document, or
strategic plan, will focus on significant events and processes associated with
changing environmental conditions over the last 100 million years; and will
consider the types of geological sampling, including drilling and coring,
required to attain these geological objectives. The document produced at the
Hobart 1997 workshop will be used by SCAR at its 1998 meeting, to consider
instituting a new Group of Specialists that is tasked with implement the
recommendations of the workshop. This award provides participant support costs
so that the US geoscience community may be represented at this workshop.
