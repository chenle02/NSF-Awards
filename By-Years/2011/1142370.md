The 11th Conference on the Intersections of Particle and Nuclear Physics (CIPANP
2012), will be held in St. Petersburg, FL, May 29 - June 3, 2012. The CIPANP is
a triennial series that focuses on topics of interest to elementary particle
physicists, nuclear physicists and physicists with interests in particle/nuclear
astrophysics. As this conference series has developed since 1984, the overlap of
these areas has markedly increased. For example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
is exploring both elementary particle physics and heavy ion physics, with the
ALICE Detector particularly focusing on studies of lead-ion collisions.
Explorations of the neutrino sector have attracted both traditional nuclear and
traditional particle physicists for measurements of solar neutrinos, reactor
neutrinos, long baseline neutrinos and double beta decay. There is also
extensive overlap between particle physics and nuclear physics in both
theoretical ideas and experimental methods. The CIPANP series has facilitated
both formal and informal exchanges of information among physicists working in
the particle physics, nuclear physics and nuclear/particle astrophysics sectors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for junior scientists,
especially members of underrepresented groups, who otherwise have no means to
attend the conference. Participation in CIPANP 2012 by younger scientists will
stimulate their interest and enthusiasm, increase their knowledge and broaden
their network of contacts.
