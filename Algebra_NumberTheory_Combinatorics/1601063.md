The mathematical concept of a group, a set together with an operation for
combining two elements to produce another element, plays a central role in
mathematics and its applications. The classification of the finite simple groups
is one of the premier achievements of modern mathematics, providing the
algebraic foundation for the study of symmetry of finite objects. The proof of
the classification theorem, however, is very long and complicated, consisting of
as many as ten thousand pages spread among hundreds of articles. There are at
least two books, aimed at a lay audience, describing the human aspects of this
effort. An emerging area of mathematics, studying objects called fusion systems,
offers hope of simplifying the proof of the classification using an innovative
approach that the investigator aims to implement.

The research focuses on two projects. First, the work aims to extend the current
description of the subgroup structure of the finite simple groups, and to use
that information to establish a negative answer to an important question in
universal algebra, open for over 35 years: Is each finite lattice an interval in
the lattice of subgroups of some finite group? The second project aims to
classify a large subclass of the class of simple saturated 2-fusion systems of
component type. One consequence of the second project should be a simplification
of the proof of the theorem classifying the finite simple groups.
