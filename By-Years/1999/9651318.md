This project provides assistance in improving laboratory instruction in
introductory physics courses. Faculty believe that many students in these
courses fail to develop adequate understanding of the basic concepts presented.
Therefore, this project addresses the identified reasons for this failure:
students are not (l) actively involved in the design of experiments; (2)
sufficiently engaged in small group, collaborative learning; (3) receiving
feedback on the results of many experiments; or (4) using their laboratory time
efficiently and for laboratory-dependent activities. This project is making
improvements in laboratory instruction by revising the curricula of two
introductory physics courses and integrating the use of microcomputer-based
laboratory tools into the laboratory component of those courses. Students taking
the physics courses improved by this project are in majors that prepare them for
work as technicians in manufacturing, engineering, or technical service
environments. This project can serve as a model for the instruction of physics
to college students in technical programs. Evaluation of both program
improvements and student outcomes can be conducted as part of the project.
