The goal of thei exploratory research is to assess the potential for the
development of a well documented quality controlled global data set of
subsurface temperatures and ancillary data relevant to the analysis of recent
climate change. Subsurface temperatures stored worldwide in the rocks ofthe
Earth's continental crust record several centureies of surface temperature
excursions, but great care must be taken to seperate local anthropogenic effects
such as urbanization, deforestation and wetland destruction, and microclimatic
effects associated with topography and vegetation patterns, from true regional
climatological changes. The feasibility of assembling a global data set will be
determined in discussions with members of the international geothermal community
the through examination of unpublished data archives. This research is important
because it has the potential to full critical gaps in long-term terrestrial
surface temperature records, and hence help resolve issues of climate change
detections.
