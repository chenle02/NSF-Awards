Introduction: The focal problem of the proposal is significant and a matter of
broad interest: how to bring second order beliefs (beliefs about beliefs) to
bear on first order beliefs. Such issues arise, for example, in the context of
legal assessments of evidence where jurists are called on to consider general
considerations of reliability when adjudicating specific eye witness evidence.

Intellectual Merit: Although probabilistic approaches to rational belief have
become very popular, there is no standard way of using these models to represent
the first-order/second-order interactions such as the one mentioned above. A
successful account of these interactions would represent a major achievement in
probabilistic understanding of rational belief. The project promises to provide
a formula for how second order beliefs affect first order beliefs.

Broader Impact: Among the potential broader impacts of the results of this
project is a potential for providing a basis for a view of science that is
neither dogmatic nor skeptical, which could mitigate the polarization of opinion
exemplified in the so-called "science wars". These results might also be used to
understand how jurors can take proper account of their own fallibility in doing
their job thereby providing the project with obvious social importance. Other
broader impacts may result from the publication of a planned book whose audience
includes students in courses in criminology and philosophy of science. Insofar
as the book will be studied by college students in various majors, its impact
will reach well beyond professionals in the investigator's field. The project
may also have a significant effect beyond the usual academic circles through the
production of pamphlets that are addressed to policymakers, jurors, and the
public at large that address the public perception of science (for example, how
to reconcile the reliability of science with its fallibility), the dynamics of
group decision-making by juries, and the proper way to evaluate forensic
evidence, expert testimony, and eyewitness reports. For a project in philosophy,
the proposed project has unusually broad impact.
