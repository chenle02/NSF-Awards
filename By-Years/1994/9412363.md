Project Summary Nagy/ATM-9412363 This continuation of an ongoing grant will
support ionosphere- plasmasphere studies. The project will explore the role of
the ring current as a major source of energy for the subauroral to low latitude
ionosphere. One focus of the program will be on the decay of the ring current as
a result of pitch-angle scattering and energy diffusion and the associated
aeronomical consequences. In addition, the investigators will continue to
explore the Coulomb interaction between the ring current and plasmaspheric
particles . Another important element of the proposed program will be an
investigation of the ionospheric response to energetic inputs from the ring
current and electrodynamic coupling processes in the subauroral region.
