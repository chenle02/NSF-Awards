The objective of this research is the analysis and interpretation of radar and
electrical observations made near Darwin, Australia during a recent field
experiment. The interpretive work includes the testing of a number of hypotheses
designed to explain the relationships between convective structure, the
existence and type of lightning over land and sea. Additional work will be
devoted to a search for warm cloud lightning and the traditional problem of the
diurnal variation in the global electrical circuit.
