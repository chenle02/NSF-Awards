This award supports Dr. Jim Douglas, Jr., of Purdue University for two research
visits to Brazil and incidental expenses of his collaboration with Dr. Paulo
Paes Leme of the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. Their research involves
the application of numerical methods to simulate the immiscible displacement of
one fluid by another in a naturally fractured porous medium. Particular
attention will be given to the proper boundary conditions for the partial
differential equations describing the rock matrix. Their modelling approach
should improve the approximation of various aspects of fluid flow which have
been treated inadequately in current models, such as the interaction between the
fluids in the fractures and those in the porous rock. The numerical methods will
be based on both theoretical and experimental studies, and the algorithms will
be formulated in such ways as to facilitate processing on vector and parallel
computers. Both investigators have strong records in computational fluid
dynamics; their collaboration has been very productive and has applications in
oil reservoir simulation which could ultimately improve oil recovery.
