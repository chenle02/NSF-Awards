The purpose of the project is to provide instrumentation in support of a newly
organized senior-level course in experimental mechanics. Topics covered include
strain-gage measurements, photoelastic modeling and strain measurements using
photoelastic coatings, transmission two-dimensional models and three-dimensional
model slice analysis. Acquisition of a transmission polariscope and supporting
instrumentation supplement existing instrumentation for the strain-gage and
photoelastic coating portion of the course. The addition of this instrumentation
permits the students to become familiar with the concepts of birefringence,
retardation, polarization, isoclinics and isochromatics compensation, and the
roles of both white light and monochromatic light. Three-dimensional stress-
freezing and slice analysis are performed by students utilizing the
instrumentation.
