Long-term Research: Regulation of the Chalcone Synthase Gene by Ultraviolet
Light This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and Medium-
Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is designed to
enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research abroad
at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide opportunities for
the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. The
award will support Dr. Gregory Armstrong, University of California, Berkeley,
for a 15-month research visit with Prof. Dr. Klaus Hahlbrock, Max Planck
Institute, Cologne, West Germany. The award recommendation provides funds to
cover, as appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend,
dependents allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative allowance of
$250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
