Professor Frank Bright of the State University of New York at Buffalo is
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop and
evaluate the performance of molecularly-imprinted xerogels (MIXs) for sensor
array development. The goal is to improve the selectivity and stability of
sensors. The team will study a wide range of synthesis space using array
methodologies in a highly parallel approach. In this fashion, they will be able
to prepare and screen many different xerogels in an attempt to rapidly optimize
the system. The use of well-designed fluorescent probes will provide for
information about the molecular dynamics at the site of analyte binding.
Finally, these sensor materials will be implemented into arrays and used in
conjuction with a CMOS array detector towards the development of a portable and
inexpensive integrated sensor device.

The development of chemical sensors and biosensors continues to receive
substantial support from industry and federal government agencies. The sensors
field has enormous market potential, and would revolutionize many analytical
methodologies if various limitations could be solved. Among these limitations
are the availability of 'receptors', stability of such selective reagents,
convenience and cost of assembly of sensors, and ability to multiplex to improve
reliability and provide for broadened screening for multiple targets
concurrently. Professor Bright brings all these elements into this work,
enabling students to be trained in this relevant and cross-disciplinary area.
