0448840&lt;br/&gt;Lazar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing a comprehensive
description of all protein components in a cell present during the various
stages of the cell lifecycle is currently a major challenge. The primary goals
of this career development plan are to address the fundamental technological
limitations that prevent fast proteomic investigations, to resolve the
difficulties that impede the implementation of microfluidic devices with mass
spectrometric detection, and to demonstrate the applicability of these devices
for the analysis of complex biological samples. The development of microfluidic
devices with mass spectrometric detection (MS) detection for the handling of a
large variety of bioanalytical processes will be pursued. Microfabrication
offers process integration, high-speed analysis, multiplexing, automation, and
high-throughput processing of small sample amounts. The specific objectives are:
(1) to develop stand-alone microfluidic platforms that comprise the functional
elements necessary to perform essential sample processing steps prior to MS
detection; (2) to implement an entire bio-analytical processing scheme on the
chip and to design architectures with a multiplexed configuration that enable
high-throughput analysis; and (3) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel
microfluidic platform for the proteomic characterization of complex cellular
extracts. This work should lead to the development of unique micro-analytical
systems and detection strategies with broad applicability in the areas of
biomedical research, medicine, agriculture, biodefense, and other areas that
benefit from proteomic investigations. Additionally, the interdisciplinary
training of students will occur, and the research will be integrated into the
development of a new course and a textbook.&lt;br/&gt;
