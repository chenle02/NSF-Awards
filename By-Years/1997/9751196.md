This residential college for women is acquiring, through this project, an HP-GCD
high performance gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS) system. Chemistry
students at all levels can use the instrument to discover and learn the
principles and techniques of chromatographic separation and analysis by mass
spectrometry. Specific applications for the GC-MS throughout the curriculum
include use in student-designed research projects in the general chemistry
course; general introduction to the principles of operation of a GC-MS and its
application to reaction product analysis in the organic chemistry laboratory;
theory, operation, and optimization of a GC-MS and its analytical applications
in the instrumental analysis laboratory; use as a substance identification tool
in the analysis of water and soil samples in the environmental chemistry and
biology laboratories; correlation of theoretically predicted fragmentation
patterns with experimental MS data in the physical chemistry laboratory; and
essential laboratory instrument for independent study and summer research
projects, especially for those projects involving environmental and synthetic
organic chemistry. *
