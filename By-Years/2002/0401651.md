Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0401651&lt;br/&gt;M. Louge, Gordon Research
Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal solicits NSF funding
to help young investigators (Graduate Students,&lt;br/&gt;Post-Doctoral
Associates, Assistant Professors) attend the 2004 Gordon Research Conference
(GRC) on Granular and Granular-Fluid Flow to be held at Colby College from June
27 to July 2, 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of Granular and Granular-
Fluid Flows is experiencing fast progress that is driven by the Mathematics,
Physics, Engineering and Geophysics communities. The 2004 meeting will be the
second GRC on this subject. Its purpose is to discuss cutting-edge research in
this rapidly advancing field, and to encourage new collaborations from
scientists in disciplines that normally do not
intersect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRC meetings are deliberately structured to
foster open discussions on cutting-edge research. The 2004 organization
committee has developed a program with 26 speakers talking about recent
developments, 9 discussion leaders, and up to 80 posters. The PI will invite
between 100 and 135 participants and, with NSF's help, encourage the
participation of emerging researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the PI will
also invite industrial participants. Merck, Procter and Gamble, and Exxon Mobil
will send scientists who are active in the field. The flow of granular solids,
their mixing behavior, the nature of colloidal suspensions, and the transport of
gas-solid mixtures are examples of phenomena that are of considerable importance
to industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
