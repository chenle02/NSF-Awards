The Vermont Elementary Science Project is based on the recommendations from the
National Center for Improving Science Education's recent reports on assessment;
curriculum and technology; and teacher development in elementary science. The
project will develop a regional staff development and training model for
improving elementary science education. This model for instructional change will
be developed through extensive work with existing state structures such as the
Vermont State Education Department, the Vermont Science Teachers' Association,
the Vermont Higher Education Consortium, Middlebury College and local school
districts. Teams of teachers and administrators from the selected school
districts will be trained in the following areas: science content (physical
science) and teaching methods for "hands-on-minds-on"; ideas related to the
conditions in schools which support science education and change; and
implementation plans for the improvement of science teaching at the elementary
school level. The project will then provide continuous support for the changes
necessary in order to implement and sustain good science teaching and good
science programs in these districts. The evaluation of the program will include
addressing the issue of student change, and will be based on the State's new
assessment program which will involve the evaluation of the products produced
for student portfolios. The cost sharing for the project will be 35% of the NSF
portion.
