Presidential advisers play a central role in controlling the flow of information
to the chief executive, defining problems, and persuading the president to
embark on specific courses of action. Few studies, however, have examined
systematically the patterns of communication between a president and his
advisers, and fewer still have explored how these patterns change over time.
This research uses archival data, in particular the president's daily diary
schedules, to examine the communication patterns between the president and other
executive branch officials in the Nixon and Carter administrations. The research
considers how institutional, interpersonal, and environmental factors contribute
to the initial development and subsequent evolution of these patterns. In doing
so, the project employs social network concepts and techniques. Ultimately, the
research will clarify and test some of the fundamental behavioral and
institutional assumptions that underlie current theories of communication within
advisory networks.
