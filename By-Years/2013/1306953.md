This award provides support for the University of Kansas Particle Physics group
to conduct research with the CMS experiment at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland and to
complete ongoing efforts in Particle Astrophysics at several locations
worldwide. The group is making significant contributions to CMS both
analytically and technically. In analysis, the group is focusing its efforts on
studies of Higgs bosons, top quarks, electroweak processes and new phenomena.
Technical contributions include responsibilities for supporting the existing CMS
tracker and the building the new "Phase I" pixel detector. Toward a future high
energy electron collider, the group is developing improved methods of jet energy
reconstruction using particle-flow based techniques. In the area of particle
astrophysics, the group is completing a number of technically challenging
efforts based upon radio detection and located in Antarctica, Utah and Siberia.
In the area of broader impacts, the group has an exceptionally strong outreach
program including a QuarkNet Center, the Quarked! Project that engages young
children in the excitement of science and scientific questions, and significant
engagement of undergraduates at all levels of the program.
