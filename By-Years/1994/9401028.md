9401028 Brydges The proposal is to study problems in the following related
areas: (1)Models of polymers with attractive self interactions. (2) Infrared
behavior of weakly perturbed Gaussian measures arising in statistical mechanics
of systems that are near a second order phase transition. (3) Epsilon expansions
for models with nearly Gaussian fixed points for the renormalization group. (4)
a perturbative study of the renormalization group evolution of the extrinsic
geometry of target manifolds in the nonlinear sigma model. (5) Non-perturbative
renormalization group for strong coupling problems such as the non-linear sigma
model. The theory of elementary particles, the prediction of the size and shape
of long chain molecules in solution, and the study of phase transitions are
related problems from the view of mathematics; they require a calculus for the
approximate evaluation of integrals over spaces of infinite dimension. In the
1970's the Nobel Laureate K. Wilson, made fundamental progress in this calculus,
which is called the renormalization group. He left mathematicians with the
challenge of filling in his many leaps of faith and creating a systematic
theory. The first three parts ofthis proposal hope to achieve this for a class
of integrals that are almost close to Gaussian integrals - a special class that
can be evaluated exactly. The last two parts are more speculative attempts to
create the same theory for integrals that are much further from being equal to
Gaussian integrals. ***
