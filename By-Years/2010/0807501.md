The long term goal of this research project is to develop the mathematical tools
needed for a robust and statistical description of multiple scale phenomena.
Synthesizing ideas first developed for dynamical systems and methods for
variational problems (Gamma-convergence), this project studies (1) elasticity of
thin sheets, (2) stripe patterns in Rayleigh-Benard convection, (3) two-
dimensional electrostatics and connections to Hele-Shaw flow and diffusion-
limited aggregation, and (4) pattern formation in extended, periodically-forced
systems. The insights gleaned from studying these particular problems will be
used to address the general questions motivating this
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant problem in nonlinear partial
differential equations and in the physics of extended systems is to understand
and analyze phenomena on multiple spatial and temporal scales. This project is
part of a long term research program to understand multiple scale behaviors with
particular emphasis on non-convex variational problems (energy driven pattern
formation). A simple example is the behavior of a crumpled sheet. All crumpled
sheets "look" the same "statistically", but it is impossible to crumple two
sheets of paper into identical configurations. This suggests many natural
questions, including "What are the statistics that describe the global behavior
of the system?" and "Is there a theory for these statistics?" Important
questions of this type arise repeatedly in the study of physical, geophysical,
and biological systems. This project aims to develop tools needed to answer such
questions.
