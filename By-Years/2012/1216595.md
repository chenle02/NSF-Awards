A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V
Savannah. The R/V Savannah is a 92 foot coastal research vessel operated by
Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since put into service in the fall of 2001, this
92-foot coastal/local class research vessel has proven to be a capable and cost-
effective platform for a range of research and education projects. The primary
working area for the vessel has been the continental shelf, coastal and
estuarine environments of the Southeastern United States. The ship has also
conducted cruises that have crossed the Gulf Stream into the western Sargasso
Sea and as far as Curacao in the SE Caribbean. In 2011, the R/V Savannah
completed 140 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 62% of the total
sailing schedule. In 2012, R/V Savannah is scheduled for 161 days with NSF days
accounting for 61% of the total sailing
schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this
proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) Multibeam data collection and
analysis system $24,375&lt;br/&gt;2) Portable clean water system
$11,369&lt;br/&gt; TOTAL $35,744&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under
criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel
and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-
use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
