Recognizing the potential of better design principles to improve the
manufacturability and market responsiveness of designed products, the National
Science Foundation (NSF) has made this subject the focus of its research program
in engineering design theory and methodology. The National Research Council,
through its Manufacturing Studies Board, proposes to establish a Committee on
Engineering Design Theory and Methodology to provide advice regarding the future
directions of this program. The committee will study engineering design in the
United States, focusing on the role of design in U.S. economic, education,
manufacturing, and research support systems. Within this study, the committee
will: (a) outline a long-range national strategy for graduate and undergraduate
education in engineering design, including suggestions for balancing the current
academic emphasis on analytical science with practical design synthesis,
implementing change despite the high cost of engineering design education, and
attracting and educating qualified engineering design faculty despite the
current shortage, and (b) outline a strategy for conducting research necessary
to develop a fundamental theory of engineering design, including identifying the
basic and applied research topics that need to be addressed and suggesting which
of those topics are appropriate for federal funding or consortia of industry and
academia.
