9510728 Cole This award will provide requests infrastructure support for an
interdisciplinary team working on a broad array of theoretical and applied
problems in nonlinear optics. The group consists of applied mathematicians,
physicists, and industrial scientists, and the problems being researched are
closely connected with applications such as laser technology, fiber-optics
communications, all-optical data transmission systems, and composite nonlinear
optical materials. The infrastructure support will provide for an intensive
series of seminars, mini courses, and workshops on nonlinear optics, for
graduate research assistants, postdoctoral fellows, and long-term visitors. The
proposed projects cover a wide range of problems, such as dynamics and operation
of gas lasers and fiber lasers, nonlinear optics of pulses in standard and
erbium-doped fibers, dynamics of light in second-harmonia generating media,
optical properties of composite materials, and light propagation in periodic
media The tools to be used in the formulation and analysis of these problems
include asymptotic expansions and perturbation theory, accurate numerical
computations, soliton and inverse-scattering techniques, nonlinear analytical
estimates, and dynamical systems methods. The diverse expertise of its members
will enable the group to successfully complete the investigations of the
proposed projects, and shed light on nonlinear optical problems from new angles
that could only come from such unique interdisciplinary connections.
