The E-Scholars program provides financial, academic, and professional
development support for engineering students interested in energy-related
careers, especially in renewable energy. The cohort is being drawn from a target
population of engineering students with energy interests and from at-risk
groups, with an emphasis on 1st-generation college students. The project goals
are achieved through a combination of scholarship support, academic and personal
counseling, and cohort building using a three-pronged approach: cohort building,
cohort focusing, and bridging activities.

The project builds on existed TRiO, McNair, and Upward Bound projects. Students
are primarily being recruited through existing channels (e.g., Upward Bound) and
new ones such as the program web site and engineering outreach. Twenty students
are receiving four year scholarships averaging $6500 annually.
