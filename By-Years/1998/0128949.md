In 1997, the National Science Foundation support created the Center for
Learning&lt;br/&gt;Technologies in Urban Schools (LeTUS); a unique partnership
focused on improving&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for challenging learning for urban
children. LeTUS brings together two&lt;br/&gt;urban school districts, Detroit
and Chicago, and research groups from the University of&lt;br/&gt;Michigan and
Northwestern University. This partnership has created an infrastructure
for&lt;br/&gt;developing and sustaining broad-based collaboration among
professionals from public&lt;br/&gt;schools and university contexts, committed
to improving teaching and learning in urban&lt;br/&gt;schools. This ABR proposal
summarizes LeTUS' four years of accomplishments and&lt;br/&gt;charts plans for
an additional eighteen months of work.
