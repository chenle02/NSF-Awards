Werner Heisenberg was at the center of theoretical physics in Germany during
much of the 20th century. He was the creator of quantum mechanics and the
inventor of the uncertainty principle. He was a major contributor to the
development of matrix mechanics, quantum field theory, and S-matrix formalism.
Further, his life and activities touched some of the most turbulent events of
recent German and World history. He was enlisted by various political regimes in
Germany, from the Weimar Republic through the Third Reich and into the post-war
Federal Republic of Germany. During World War II, he headed the Nazi sponsored
atomic bomb project. Under this grant, Dr. Cassidy will complete his biography
of Werner Heisenberg. This study will cover all phases of Heisenberg's life and
work, integrating them to wider issues in history, science, philosophy, culture,
and politics. He will examine primary sources in extensive archival records and
hitherto unexamined private papers. This study promises greatly to enhance our
understanding of the development of contemporary physics, the training of German
elite scientists, and the role of physics in the government of Germany over a
half century period.
