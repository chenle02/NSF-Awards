It is proposed to study the stationary and dynamic properties of far-from-
equilibrium nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems. It is intended to elucidate
the mathematical structure of these complex systems while studying specific
physical problems in fluid dynamics, non equilibrium statistical physics and
quantum field theory. Reaction diffusion equations for the kinetic and
stationary states of chemical reactions will be investigated starting from their
infinite dimensional hydrodynamic formulation.
