The proposed work is aimed at identification of implementable drive schemes and
control strategies for electrically commutated motors that optimize performance
and efficiency. The high efficiency drive schemes will be designed using
nonlinear control techniques for optimization. The drive scheme will be built in
the laboratory and the control algorithms implemented in digital hardware.
