The motion of energetic particles in the geospace environment depends
sensitivety upon solarwind changes. This grant is to assess the long-term solar
cycle affects on the characteristics of energetic particles in the near-earth
space and the contributions from the escape of magnetospheric particles to
upstream ion events near the Earth's bow shock. It is also planned to
investigate energetic particle processes during substorms through participation
of CDAW-9 and by comparison between substorm intensifications and particle
bursts. An additional project will be to examine the stability of the neutral
sheet in the so-called current disruption region in the magnetotail. *** //
