This research is in the emerging area of microelectromechanical devices. It
proposes directed research to fabricate and characterize microstructures under
the action of given forces. Research emphasis includes the fabrication,
characterization, and modelling of linear and rotating devices under dynamic
conditions. In particular, this work is concerned with developing an
understanding of friction, wear, surface modification and fatigue at the
microscopic level, dealing with mechanical structures in the micron size range.
To probe these phenomena, a recently developed high spatial resolution, time-
resolved scanning Auger microprobe will be used. Knowledge gained through this
research will be used to design and fabricate a pair of micro- tweezers.
