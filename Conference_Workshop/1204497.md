This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "Ninth
AIMS International Conference on Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations, and
Applications" conference that will be held from July 1--5, 2012, at the
conference center Hyatt Grand Cypress in Orlando, Florida.

This conference will cover a variety of topics in analysis (e.g., dynamical
systems, partial differential equations, bifurcation theory, etc), with the
interplay of dynamical systems and differential equations in both pure and
applied settings as a unifying theme. All of the conference topics are central
to analysis and are active subjects of current research. The format of the
meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be
otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.
