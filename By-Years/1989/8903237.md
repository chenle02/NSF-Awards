The principal investigator will study the geometry of submanifolds of R^n with
simple local invariants, taut embeddings under Lie sphere transformations, and
the geometry of the space of isometric immersions of hyperbolic n-space into
odd- dimensional Euclidean space. Submanifolds are mathematician's
generalizations of surfaces which lie in ordinary three-dimensional space.
Examples of two- dimensional submanifolds are spheres, the skin of an inner
tube, and infinitely-long cylinders. The three-dimensional space in which we
live is a submanifold of Einstein's four-dimensional space-time. The principal
investigator will study several deep problems which concern the way these
submanifolds lie in their ambient spaces.
