Building a Pipeline to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Careers
in South Central Los Angeles is an effort use computational skill development as
a catalyst for broader academic achievement. The work develops a year long
computing seminar that serves as a complement to the Exploring Computer Science
course in a high school in Los Angeles. The seminar is robust in its attempt to
address the factors that impede academic achievement of a subset of boys of
color in the lower quartile of performance in
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study operationalizes computing education
as a means of igniting broader academic achievement. The premise of the work
focuses on infusing into computing instruction established techniques from the
learning sciences that are effective in addressing the broader social and
institutional factors that often hinder students' academic achievement. The
deployment of more Exploring Computer Science (ECS) courses has not by itself
mitigated some of the academic achievement gaps correlated with race and gender.
This work is an attempt to develop a complement to ECS and courses like it, to
serve students operating under difficult academic circumstances.
