9219245 WEIDNER, Donald J. This project is to examine the phase equilibria for
the olivine system at the pressures and temperatures of the 400 km
discontinuity. The experiments will be carried out with SAM-85, a cubic anvil
high pressure system used in conjunction with the NSLS synchrotron. The major
advantage of this system is that the pressure in the sample cell is continuously
monitored. This is essential to directly associate a seismic discontinuity at a
depth in the earth with a phase transition observed in the lab where the
pressure scale may be precise but inaccurate. In addition, univariant reactions
can be reversed in a single experimental run and bounds on the equilibrium
pressure and temperature determined directly.
