The international transfer of capital for investment purposes has had a profound
effect in determining the direction and profile of world economic development
and political change. Historically, critics on the left have equated the export
of capital with financial imperialism, while in recent years critics on the
right have accused the American government of selling the nation's birthright to
the Japanese. It is also the case that in the last century the rapid development
of Australia, Canada, and the United States were at least partially underwritten
by massive capital transfers from Britain, and in this century the reemergence
of Germany and Japan from the devastation of the Second World War can be
attributed in some important measure to capital transfers from the U.S. There is
little doubt that the existing global distribution of economic activity has been
affected by almost two centuries of international capital transfers. Yet,
despite those two hundred years of history and rhetoric, very little is actually
known about the exact relationship among international capital transfers, the
transfer of institutional technology, and the diffusion of economic growth. The
purpose of this project is to develop a basis for analyzing these relationships.
This is important because it will give us a better understanding of the role of
foreign and domestic capital markets in promoting economic growth and
development. Specifically, the research will focus on the role of British
international capital flows in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
in promoting development in Australia, Canada, the United States, and Argentina.
The study will be concerned with the mechanisms of international capital
transfers, the diffusion of financial institutional forms from Britain to the
other four countries, and adaptations of these institutional forms to local
conditions and requirements. Finally, it will analyze the distribution of
British capital among sectors and organizational forms, and it will attempt to
assess the impact of British capital on local development.
