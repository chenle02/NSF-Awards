A simple numerical model, i.e, a 1.5 layer shallow water model, will be used to
study the dynamics of western boundary currents at low latitudes (near the
equator) and how they separate and interact with the interior flow. Of
particular interest to this study are the effects of coastal geometry on the
behavior of the western boundary current and associated eddies and the nature of
the unsteadiness that results in transient eddy generation.
