This experimental research program capitalizes on the emerging capability to
investigate a semiconductor nanosystem (cavity/dot) where individual quanta play
a decisive role. The plan is to see the effects of quantum Rabi oscillations
much clearer. Even though the level transitions of a single quantum dot are
similar to an atom's, Coulomb effects are ever present in a semiconductor; they
are likely to provide interesting twists, as they have in the quantum well
microcavity. The observation of photon/dot entanglement will be important.
Proposed are both resonant and nonresonant excitation by both femtosecond pulses
and continuous-wave beams. In short, this new structure will be excited and its
response detected in all possible ways: changing the power and looking for the
transition from the quantum to the semiclassical regimes, measuring
correlations, decoherence time, lasing threshold, and optical bistability
fluctuations. The broader impact of the program involves education as well as
applications in the nanophotonics industry.
