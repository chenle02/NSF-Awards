Dr. Ohnishi has previously determined the unique ligand structure of the Rieske
iron-sulfur cluster, using Q-band 15N-ENDOR analysis of genetically amplified R.
capsulatus bc1 complex (in collaboration with Dr. B. Hoffman). She has also
assigned possible coordinating amino acid residues based on EPR studies of a set
of site-directed capsulatus mutants (with Dr. F. Daldal). She now plans to
consolidate this assignment and extend it to test the proposed role of histidine
ligands as hydrogen-bonding sites of the ubiquinone in the "Qo" pocket.
Previously she proposed a unique electron gating mechanism of the paired, edge
to edge, Qs species in the mammalian succinate-Q oxidoreductase system. Now she
proposes to investigate the molecular mechanism and protein architecture in the
"Qs" domain, utilizing well-developed site- directed mutagenesis systems of E.
coli and B. subtilis succinate-Q oxidoreductase (with Drs. R. Gennis and Dr. L.
Heterstedt), and E coli fumarate-QH2 oxidoreductase (with Dr. G. Cecchini).
These three types of enzyme differ in their association with heme b. She will
use advanced EPR, ENDOR and genetic engineering techniques. This project will
enhance our understanding of the electron and proton transfer mechanism in
energy transducing membranes.
