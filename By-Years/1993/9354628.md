9354628 Benford This pilot project develops a module for use in general biology
for majors courses. The neuroscience based module-Mind, Brain, Behavior-includes
hands-on and readings-based activities on such topics as The Jogger's High,
Modification of Brine Shrimp Behavior, Mapping the Brain, Neurotransmitters and
Disorders, Drugs and Brain Synapses, Ethics of Using Tissues from Aborted
Fetuses, Legalization of Psychotropic Drugs. In the hands-on activities,
students collect, graph and analyze data; propose further hypotheses; and search
the literature. The scientific approach to solving questions is emphasized.
Readings based activities focus on developing skill in critical reading. Working
individually and as teams, students identify hypotheses, analyze supporting
evidence, convert words into visual images and models, propose alternate
hypotheses/conclusions, and debate ethical, economic or political implications.
The module is self-standing and includes an Instructor's Manual, a Student Study
Guide, a Readings Set, and examinations to assess existing knowledge and
misconceptions in pre-test/post-test format. ***y
