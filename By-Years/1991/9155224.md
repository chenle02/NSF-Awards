This program provides opportunity for high school biology teachers to spend a
summer doing research, full-time, in the laboratory of a member of the American
Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB). This nationwide program
emphasizes the identification and selection of highly motivated teachers who
will return to their home schools and have a continuing impact on the quality of
science education through the implementation of innovative topics and hands-on
exercises. Emphasis is placed on the recruitment of teachers from schools that
serve large numbers of minority students. On the basis of previous experience,
it is anticipated that this program will have an impact on science education at
the secondary level and have at least an indirect impact on career choices made
by some secondary students. Cost sharing equals 180 % of the NSF award.
