Support is provided for the acquisition of side-looking sonar imagery to study
one of the world's most important subsea "drainage systems" situated directly in
front of the outlet of the Pleistocene Laurentide icecap in the Hudson Strait
and extending to the slopes and basins of the Labrador Sea. The proposed
research is a multi-year collaborative effort between McGill University,
Montreal, Canada, Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO)/ Atlantic Geoscience
Centre (AGC), Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, the Geological Observatory (L-DGO) of
Columbia University. The scientific objectives to be addressed are three fold.
(1) To define depositional and morphological elements of the Northwest Atlantic
Mid-Ocean Canyon (NAMOC), as a type example of non-classical fan turbidite
system without shifting distributary channels and terminal lobes and to acquire
a quantitative hydrodynamic understanding of the sediment-laden flows that have
passed through the channels. (2) To identify the principle sedimentological
processes active on an ice-marginal slope and to explain variation in
continental slope dynamics in terms of ice sheet expansion and rapid melting.
(3) To use data collected in the program to advance the techniques of remote
acoustic characterization of the sedimentary substrate.
