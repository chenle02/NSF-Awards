The FLoridA Multi-object Imaging Near-Infrared Grism Observational Spectrometer
(FLAMINGOS) is an instrument built by the University of Florida and operated at
various sites, including telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory
(KPNO), part of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO). The FLAMINGOS
Extragalactic Survey is a deep near infrared imaging study located within the
regions of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS). This project will yield the
first large sample of galaxy clusters at redshifts beyond one. The properties of
this cluster population will enable a precision constraint on the mean matter
density of the Universe, and on the cosmological constant. All of the data will
be made public.

Continued support of FLAMINGOS will benefit all users of the instrument. Because
of the NDWFS, those regions of the sky will soon have available unprecedented
multi-wavelength coverage, from radio to X-rays, of which this survey is a vital
part. In addition to the specific cosmological goals of this project, the survey
will therefore assist a wide range of other science, on topics ranging from
brown dwarves to active galactic nuclei.
