This project addresses the Distributed Element Method (DEM) for modeling dynamic
systems. It attempts to remedy difficulties associated with the classical
methods of modal analysis and eigenfunction expansion. The modal analysis
technique models only a finite number of modes, whereas the eigenfunction
expansion method has disadvantages in numerical simulations. The DEM method uses
the transfer function concept, and is easily adapted for control problems. It is
particularly suitable for symbolic computation and allows direct evaluation of
the dynamic characteristics of complex systems including system spectrum and
mode shapes, response and stability. Although vibration problems will be
stressed in this project, the methodology has potential applications in other
disciplines, including heat conduction and diffusion.
