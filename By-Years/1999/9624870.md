Optimization methods based on ideas from statistical physics have been developed
to tackle a diverse set of hard problems including image segmentation, data
clustering, and graph partitioning. These problems involve the assignment of
elements viewed as ``data'' to one of a set of classes, so as to minimize the
resulting cost. This project develops a novel extension of physics-based
approaches to tackle the important, challenging sub-class of structurally-
constrained data association problems, wherein assignments are constrained to
agree with a parameterized classification rule such as that of a neural network
or decision tree model. Central to the project is supervised learning, including
statistical classification and regression/function approximation. Physics-based
learning approaches have the potential to address fundamental learning problems
such as convergence to non-global optima, parsimonious modelling, and
generalization. Preliminary classification work already suggests that there is
great promise for these new methods in outperforming existing learning
algorithms. The specific project objectives are of both practical and
theoretical significance, as they include development of learning algorithms for
widely used classifier structures, investigating parsimonious modelling in part
via phase transition analysis, tackling application areas such as speech
recognition and condition-based maintenance, and extending the methods to
address regression/function approximation and missing data problems.
