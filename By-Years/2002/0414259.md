0414259 Eheart The focus of the proposed project is on developing a community
consensus plan for the functioning and needs of the Engineering Analysis Network
(the EAN portion of CLEANER). The EAN would implement the CLEANER vision through
a system of instrumentation, data, and computational resources, shared by
geographically-distributed investigators and supported by cyberinfrastructure.
(a system of computers, digital data, networks, algorithms, and collaboration
tools that supports geographically distributed teams of researchers and
educators). This project will define the EAN, including the cyberinfrastruture
and management plans necessary to bring the CLEANER vision into fruition, using
a collaborative, community-based process supported by state-of-the-art
information technology.
