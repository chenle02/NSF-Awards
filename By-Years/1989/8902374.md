This grant provides funds for the support of a Gordon Conference on the
Population Biology and Evolution of Microorganisms, to be held in Plymouth, New
Hampshire, July 24- 28, 1989. The field of microbial population and evolution is
a growing field of research. It is an interdisciplinary field in which the power
of the techniques of microbial genetics and molecular biology combined with
increased emphasis on hypothesis testing in evolutionary biology has brought
microorganisms into the mainstream of the fields of population genetics and
evolutionary biology. In fact, microorganisms with their large populations,
short generation times and biochemically defined genetics provide the only
practical systems for experimental testing of some kinds of evolutionary
mechanisms. Funds will be used to help cover expenses of speakers and
discussants and to permit a modest number graduate students, post-doctoral
fellows, and younger scientists whose resources are limited to attend the
conference.
