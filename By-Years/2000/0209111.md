This project will develop a comprehensive framework for security management
using access control models for distributed applications in a heterogeneous
multidomain environment. Such systems are expected to play a critical role in a
broad range of Web-based applications. The proposed framework will be built upon
role-based access control (RBAC) models. The use of roles for security
management has several well-recognized advantages. Noted among them is their
flexibility in representing key organizational functions while directly
supporting the security policies of an organization. Due to the dynamic nature
of distributed applications and the heterogeneity aspects of the underlying
multidomain environment, development of the proposed framework poses several
daunting challenges. The main challenges addressed in this proposal
include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-the development of a Petri-net based dynamic RBAC
model that incorporates time constraints. This task also includes modeling a
variety of security policies and developing efficient analytical techniques for
evaluating the correctness criteria for this model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-the
development of an RBAC formalism that ensures secure interoperability in a
heterogeneous multidomain environment for supporting distributed applications.
This task also includes designing optimal mediation policies to manage conflicts
among domain roles and tasks belonging to
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
