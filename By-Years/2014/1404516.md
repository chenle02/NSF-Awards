This award supports travel for 18 participants from U.S. institutions in the
2014 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences Summer School in
Probability to be held at the University of British Columbia from June 2-27,
2014. The School provides an opportunity for advanced U.S. Ph.D. students and
recent graduates to interact directly with top researchers in the field. The
participants will learn current techniques in the most significant areas of
probability theory, including noise stability, random walks on random fractals,
stochastic models of evolution, phase transitions for random constraint
satisfaction problems, correlated Gaussian fields, and branching random walks.
It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some
topics covered by the main courses and related areas.

The 2014 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences Summer School in
Probability will be an excellent opportunity for Ph.D. students and junior
researchers to learn some of the most significant modern probability theory from
the top experts in the field and to interact with them directly. The junior
participants are often current and future academic faculty, able to spread the
knowledge of the modern techniques further in the research community.
