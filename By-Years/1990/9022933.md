The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology supports a broad range of interactive and interdisciplinary materials
research in four primary thrust areas. Research on transition metal oxides
addresses high-temperature superconducting materials and mechanisms, focussing
primarily on the magnetic structure and transport properties of pure and doped
single crystal cuprate superconductors. Researchers in the phases and phase
transitions group are examining phase transitions in structured fluids and the
development of statistical mechanical models for their theoretical description.
The thrust area on synthesis, properties and morphology of novel polymers
addresses the molecular structure and microscopic morphology of polymers and
their associated electrical, optical and mechanical properties. A new thrust on
structure and transport properties of grain boundaries and interfaces aims to
determine the intrinsic structure and properties of high-angle grain boundaries
in ionic compounds and oxide ceramics. The MIT MRL also supports the
development, operation and maintenance of major central research facilities
including a surface science facility operated in conjunction with the Harvard
MRL. It also provides seed funding for exploratory research and supports
educational activities that include the provision of research experience for
undergraduates. The program currently involves about 29 faculty members and
senior personnel from seven academic departments, 10 postdoctoral research
associates, 41 graduate students and 20 undergraduates, and supporting
scientific and clerical staff. The MIT MRL is directed by Professor Bernhardt J.
Wuensch.
