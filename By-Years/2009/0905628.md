The PI proposes to study various problems in the field of geometric partial
&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. For example, he would like to study the
qualitative behavior of the Ricci flow on manifolds with positive isotropic
&lt;br/&gt;curvature. In particular, the PI would like to analyze what kinds of
singularities can occur along the flow. In another project, the PI intends to
study &lt;br/&gt;the Yamabe problem on manifolds with boundary. The goal here is
&lt;br/&gt;to construct conformal metrics that have constant scalar curvature in
&lt;br/&gt;the interior and zero mean curvature along the boundary. The PI also
intends&lt;br/&gt;to study ancient solutions to the Yamabe flow on the
n-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;sphere. This question is motivated by a classification
result, due to &lt;br/&gt;Hamilton, Daskalopoulos, and Sesum, for ancient
solutions to the Ricci &lt;br/&gt;flow on the two-sphere. &lt;br/&gt;This
project is concerned with questions at the crossroads of analysis &lt;br/&gt;and
differential geometry. The use of analytical techniques in geometry
&lt;br/&gt;has been extremely successful in recent years. In particular,
Hamilton's &lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow plays a key role in Perelman's solution of the
Poincare conjecture, &lt;br/&gt;as well as in the proof of the Differentiable
Sphere Theorem &lt;br/&gt;by Richard Schoen and myself. The goal of the project
is to gain a &lt;br/&gt;better understanding of these geometric evolution
equations, and their &lt;br/&gt;qualitative properties.&lt;br/&gt;
