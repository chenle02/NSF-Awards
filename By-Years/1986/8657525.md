The understanding of the behavior of structural systems during earthquakes is
important to life safety and the preservation of capital investment. This
fundamental understanding bears directly on the ability of engineers to be able
to design efficient and economical structures. The research which will be
undertaken by the investigator will be focused in the areas of understanding and
modeling the behavior of structures during earthquakes, and new and innovative
schemes of earthquake resistant design. The important concept of accounting for
and taking advantage of the contribution of non-structural and architectural
components in the design process will be investigated. This can lead to
significant advances in earthquake resistant design methodologies. Integrated
into this research will be the application of computers to the structural design
process where it is expected that a high degree of automation will be able to be
achieved in certain design cases. This research will provide the base support to
Dr. Filippou for a Presidential Young Investigator Award.
