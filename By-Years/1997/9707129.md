9707129 Casson This is an award to provide support for a conference and workshop
to discuss progress that has been made in assessing the survival of the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) when subjected to environmental stress in
wastewater collection systems and treatment processes and to identify any
further research needs associated with this matter. Investigators and co-
investigators who have conducted and are conducting research on this and related
topics with support from the National Science Foundation and others will present
their findings for the purpose of discussion, critical review and identification
of any further research needs on issues associated with the survival of the HIV
when subjected to environmental stress beyond those addressed by current and
past awards. Results of this conference and workshop are expected to provide
guidance for conduct of further research on issues involving survival and fate
of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) under various environmental
conditions. Conference participation is expected to include research personnel
from the National Institutes of Health, the United States Public Health Service,
the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies. The conference
and workshop will be held at the University of Pittsburgh. ***
