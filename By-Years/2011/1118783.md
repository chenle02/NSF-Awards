One of the fundamental processes that generates biodiversity on our planet is
the interaction between species. This project focuses on antagonistic
interactions between plants and the insects that attack them to understand the
diversity that has arisen within a single genus of milkweeds in the new world.
Over 130 milkweed species differ in the abundance, distribution, and diversity
of plant defense strategies expressed, and this species diversity is
hypothesized to have arisen in response to predation by Monarch butterflies.
Using an integrated approach that combines modern methods in chemical analysis
of plant hormones and toxins, greenhouse studies, and cutting edge genome
manipulation, the investigators will determine the function of multiple plant
defense traits and their contribution to the diversification of the milkweeds.

Research results will significantly advance understanding of one of the major
unresolved questions in ecology and evolution: the origin and maintenance of
species diversity. They also will inform management strategies; for example, the
study of plant resistance in wild species can provide a basis for novel pest
control strategies in agriculture. Plans for education and training encompass
K-12 students, undergraduates, graduate students, and the general public, and
are particularly convincing because the study involves the popular Monarch
butterflies. K-12 education on biodiversity and species interactions will be
facilitated by support of a graduate outreach assistant through an established
program at Cornell. Thus, this project will support local educational efforts by
engaging educators and students at all levels and in diverse ways. Finally, the
PI strongly supports open access to published data, and will continue to make
raw data available.
