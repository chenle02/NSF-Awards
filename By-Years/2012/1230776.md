Datacenters have enriched the planet, making services like e-commerce and web
search available to billions. However, the growing carbon footprint of
datacenters adds to climate change and, in the long term, could harm society's
perception of the whole field. Our ongoing work builds mechanisms for
sustainable datacenters, i.e., datacenters that profit while maintaining low
carbon footprints. Intellectually, the work contributes new analytic models that
relate a datacenter's carbon footprint to its utilization and energy costs.
These models must consider complicated issues like solar- and wind-energy
outages, heavy-tail and diurnal e-commerce workloads, and workload and energy
balancing within datacenters (e.g., dynamically powering servers off and DVFS).
Further, the models must be holistic, explaining these factors in terms of
profit. In terms of broad impacts, this work will improve the economic
competitiveness and sustainability of datacenter-driven computing.
