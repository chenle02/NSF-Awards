This provides partial funding for a joint NSF/USGS workshop, held at Morro Bay,
CA on 18-22 March, 1990. Workshop participants included scientists from academia
and from government, from the U.S., Japan, Australia, and England. The objective
of the workshop was to bring together scientists making ultra-precise
measurements of crustal movement with those developing sophisticated models of
earthquake-related deformation in order to review current knowledge and to
define promising new research directions.
