9351309 Mantena This project will improve the structures and dynamics laboratory
by expanding the laboratory's capabilities to include characterization of the
mechanical properties of advanced materials (such as composites) and frequency
domain testing. Specifically, a Fast Fourier Transform based impulse-frequency
response vibration technique and modal analysis experiments will provide the
seniors with a "hands on" experience for evaluating the dynamic characteristics
of advanced materials and structures.
