1134222&lt;br/&gt;Roper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This NSF award
by the Biosensing /CBET program supports work by Professors D. Keith Roper and
Shannon Servoss at University of Arkansas is to self assemble a novel platform
to detect and analyze membrane proteins. The platform consists of
electromagnetically active arrays of nanorings in which lipid bilayers are
stabilized by novel linkers to stabilize and test membrane proteins better than
existing lipid vesicles. Electromagnetism interacting with concentrated
electrons localized to the nanoring interface provides increased sensitivity
relative to existing optical or electronic sensors. Supporting this study
develops a sensitive, highthroughput platform to detect biomarkers to diagnose
disease, test efficacy for therapeutic targets, and advance understanding of
cell function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study will educate two
graduate students in active bio/nano photonics and peptidomimetics in an
integrative multidisciplinary environment to fabricate and analyze nano scale
devices and biomaterials. Its social impact includes introducing
underrepresented undergraduates to STEM research in NSF REU programs. Results
will incorporated into workshops to introduce K-12 students to engineering in
interactive, hands; on experiments as part of a program sponsored by the College
of Engineering. Its economic impact arises from possible applications of self;
assembled electromagnetic biomaterials that enhance single; molecule microscopy
and biosensing and become next generation opto electronic elements in
microarrays and near; field optical microscopy.
