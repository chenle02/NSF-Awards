[HRD 0811561] Lawson State Community College?s HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project
supports the addition of advanced robotics technology to the College?s programs
in electrical/electronics engineering and industrial electronics/systems. The
Advanced Robotics Center (ARC) creates a new concentration for these programs of
study. It also provides real-time learning for a broad spectrum of
underrepresented students interested in technology and engineering careers.

Alabama manufacturers are seeking a diverse workforce with the skills required
to configure, upgrade, utilize, and maintain the hundreds of robotic arms on
their production lines. These jobs require technicians and engineers who have
hands-on experience with industry standard robots. Lawson State Community
College is uniquely qualified to recruit and educate a diverse workforce due to
its historical mission and because it is located in the Birmingham metropolitan
area. Students in the program can easily move to the workforce with an associate
degree, or continue at a four-year institution to earn a baccalaureate degree.
The College is purchasing two robots with training systems, and five specialized
robotic simulation software cells to initiate establishing the Advanced Robotics
Center.
