The overall objective of this project is to find and define the processes in
the evolution of the nervous system and to determine the relationship between
the evolutionary history of a structure or system to normal and abnormal
development. The hope is that insights into the evolutionary mechanisms will
also elucidate interspecific variability of brain organization, which in turn
may provide structure-function correlation. More importantly, the studies may
elucidate what evolutionary and ontogenetic constraints determine what synapses
are possible between neurons and which are not. Since evidence about the
evolution of circuitry cannot be obtained from fossils, Dr. Ebbesson designed an
approach to study brain evolution 20 years ago that involves a systematic
examination of a given neural system in the broadest possible spectrum of
vertebrates with the hope that principles of evolution would emerge from the
pattern of the data. The initial objectives have now been reached in that the
basic organization and variability of several sensory systems, including the
ascending spinal and the visual systems in representative samples of most major
vertebrate groups, are now known. The many pathways discovered and described
during the last 20 years by a number of investigations point to several
operational evolutionary strategies. One of these has been described as the
parcellation theory which states that diffuse, undifferentiated, overlapping
neural systems existed in the beginning of vertebrate evolution and that during
evolution of complex behaviors, and analytical capacities related to these
behaviors, a range of neural systems evolved, not by de novo appearance or one
system invading another, but by a process of segregation and isolation
(parcellation) that involves the formation of more isolated subcircuits by the
selective loss of connections. The resultant daughter systems individually lack
one or more connections of their ancestors. The evolutionary process is thought
to be reflected in the normal ontogenetic development of a given system where a
similar segregation- isolation process take place. The objective of Dr. Ebbesson
for the next three years is to test and define this theory by defining
connections more precisely in the sensory pathways in species from three
vertebrate classes that are likely to have extensive overlap of systems; i.e.,
unparcellated systems. These animals include the bowfin, the nurse shark, and
the tiger salamander.
