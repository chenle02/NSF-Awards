This workshop will bring together physicists and biologists to discuss basic
questions of aging and will be an excellent forum for interdisciplinary
research. The participants will explore how, and which, basic questions that
define the subject of aging will benefit from theoretical first-principles
approaches aimed, for example, at identifying upper bounds to life spans that
derive from physical theory. The proposed meeting gathers together leaders from
diverse perspectives on aging with the intent of mapping out whether, and how,
systems biology, complexity mindset might change the questions and methods that
shape theoretical, experimental and clinical aging research.
