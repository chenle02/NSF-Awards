Graphs and hypergraphs are mathematical structures that model relations among
objects, such as the friendship relation in a society. The study of these
structures has numerous applications in various branches of mathematics,
computer science and engineering. Consequently, understanding these and other
related mathematical structures is important. One of the techniques in the study
of these structures, probabilistic reasoning, has been crucial in the
development of modern algorithms and the design of robust, efficient, and
economical communication networks. Another application of probabilistic
reasoning in discrete mathematics is based on the fact that one can decompose
deterministic objects into pieces that share many properties with randomly
generated objects. This general approach, pioneered by E. Szemeredi, has been
generalized and enriched in the last couple of decades, and is now one of the
central methods in the investigation of large graphs and hypergraphs.

The PI plans to work on Turan-, Dirac-, and Ramsey-type questions for graphs and
hypergraphs. A considerable part of the research proposed by the PI will employ,
among others, the methodology mentioned above. A prime example is the
investigation of Turan densities. Most of the other problems also fall within
the theory of hypergraphs and are focused on questions in Ramsey theory and
extremal combinatorics. Several of the problems considered here can be traced
back to classical research of Paul Erdos, whose work, as well as many problems,
shaped these branches of discrete mathematics.
