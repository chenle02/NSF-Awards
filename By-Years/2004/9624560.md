NOTE: This CAREER award is a companion project to the CAREER award
CCR-96-24439, ``Cryptography, Proof Checking and Approximation'', University of
California, San Diego. This project focuses on the new area of provable
security. Provable security is achieved for a problem, when one provides (i) a
definition of security for the problem, (ii) a protocol, and (iii) a proof that
the protocol meets its definition, assuming, for example, the intractability of
factoring. Instead of just producing triples (definition, protocol, proof), the
goal of the project is to utilize reductions as a technique for making precise
statements about the security of concrete cryptographic schemes; for example,
``if you can break authentication protocol P with resources X, then you can
break the Data Encryption Standard with resources Y''. In particular,
applications of these techniques have already lead to a treatment of asymmetric
encryption, message authentication, entity authentication, and key distribution.
Protocols designed employing practice oriented provable security have resulted
in protocols used in products of IBM and Microsoft, and in a proposed
International Standard. The Integrated Educational Plan of this CAREER Grant
includes developing (a) a new graduate course in modern cryptography; (b)
undergraduate security projects which are difficult, open-ended, and design
oriented; (c) course and course materials for a new undergraduate course in
graphs, games and coloring.***
