Swelling rocks are relatively soft rocks that swell when given access to water.
The resulting movements cause problems in tunnels and open excavations, in slope
stability problems, and with shallow foundations for buildings. The techniques
that have been used to estimate movements have been found to be quite inaccurate
and, as a result, designs are usually empirical, with numerous resulting
problems. This proposal involves a preliminary effort to develop experimental
techniques to be used in developing general three-dimensional constitutive
models to describe the swelling behavior of these rocks. Subsequent research
will involve application of the apparatus with actual swelling rocks and,
hopefully, full scale field case histories.
