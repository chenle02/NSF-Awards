Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are designed to dynamically adjust
the radio frequency (RF) environment to improve signal quality and coverage. It
will be a critical component of the next generation (Next G) millimeter-wave
(mmWave) wireless communication. However, RISs can also be conveniently
manipulated by an attacker for malicious purposes such as gaining eavesdropping
advantages, degrading wireless link quality, or poisoning channel estimation.
These attacks will severely impact the availability, integrity, and security of
Next G communication systems. Since the attackers can potentially alter the RF
propagation environment at physical layer, conventional data encryption or
authentication mechanisms at the data layer are not useful. To defeat these
attacks, the project will carry out four tightly connected research thrusts at
the physical layer: (i) to investigate and create RIS signal watermark embedding
and signature appending to enable efficient and robust RIS signal/propagation
path authentication, (ii) to localize malicious RISs through collaborative
sensing for spectrum enforcement, (iii) to leverage neural network-based
beamforming for low-probability-of-intercept and resilient RIS-assisted
communication, and (iv) to build a mmWave testbed including the fabrication of a
RIS and carry out experimental evaluation.

This projectâ€™s novelty is on creating physical layer security building blocks to
protect RIS-assisted mmWave communication. The broader significance and
importance are: (i) to lay the secure foundations of RIS-assisted communication,
(ii) to securing RF communication in different frequency bands and paradigms,
including backscatter and symbiotic communications, (iii) to contribute to the
roadmap and standardization efforts of Next G Alliance, and (iv) to broaden the
participation of underrepresented groups through various internship and outreach
programs offered at participating universities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
