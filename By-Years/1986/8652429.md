This project consists of two activities: 1)An award program for teachers in
Native American school in two parts: a)Exemplary Science Teaching Awards in a
program called Research for Renewal. An award of $2,500 will be given to a
teacher recommended by the NASEA Awards Committee in each of five geographical
regions each year. NSF will support eight such awards over a period of two
years. b)Outstanding Awards are made to successful nominees for a Field Research
Expedition. Six awards of $2,000 each are to be made to teachers in the
Northwest region. 2)Production of a Promising Practices and Practitioners
Publication. This will be a compilation of successful science lessons that
teachers in Native American schools have developed. The grant will cover the
cost of assembling the material, preparing a 174-page booklet, and distributing
1000 copies to teachers in Native American schools.
