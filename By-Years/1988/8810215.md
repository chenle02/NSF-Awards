A theory encompassing steric exclusion and surface heterogeneity will be
formulated for mixed gas adsorption on microporous solids such as zeolites and
activated carbon. The theory contains experimentally determined fractional
exclusion constants. Besides the theory, three additional studies based on the
theory are undertaken: (1) characterization of microporous solids; (2) extension
of the theory to adsorption of liquid mixtures; and (3) development of a simple,
rapid gravimetric technique for measuring mixture adsorption. Successful
conclusion of the study would lead to a major advance in adsorption theory.
