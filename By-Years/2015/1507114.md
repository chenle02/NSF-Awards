Rosetta is the best-overall-performance molecular modeling and design software
toolkit, and is best-in-class both for predicting new protein structures and for
designing new proteins for industrial and medical applications. Rosetta is
currently licensed to enterprise and has gained some traction, but the top 3
identified pain points are: Difficult to use, offers almost no user support and
requires immense amounts of computational resources. This project aims to build
an enterprise version of the Rosetta molecular modeling and design software
package, and will accelerate the development of small-molecule and biological
drugs in Pharma and Biotech firms, and allow for the creation of entirely new
biological drugs, diagnostics, and biological tools at those firms through
computational protein design.

This proposal will solve these problems with a clean 3D Graphical User Interface
(GUI), workflow pipelining, and a cloud compute engine. The proposed software,
Cyrus, is a wrapper around Rosetta. It provides a GUI front-end, automation of
standard user procedures and compute on the cloud. The GUI is all-new, and will
be built inside a web browser for maximum compatibility and ease of interface
with the cloud. Automation and standardization of procedures consists of
benchmarking and scripting of existing protocols to remove human interaction
steps, and incorporate expert know-how. The cloud Implementation of Cyrus will
be built from scratch using cutting edge open source tools such as Redis and
OpenStack to provide power (1000?s of CPUs) and ease of use (graphic interface
with cloud resources for the end user).
