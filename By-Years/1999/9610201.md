KIRILLOV This research is concerned with the representation theory of quantum
groups and its relation with combinatorics and mathematical physics. The
principal investigator will work on two problems. The first problem concerns a
geometric realization of Lusztig's canonical basis, using the identification of
modules over a quantum group with the homology of a certain local system on the
configuration space, which is due to Schechtman and Varchenko. Such a
realization would reveal a new deep relation between combinatorics and the
geometric structures of mathematical physics. The second continues the study of
special functions appearing in representation theory and related combinatorial
identities. In particular, the principal investigator will work on the
generalization of the inner product identities for Macdonald's polynomials to
affine root systems, and on on further properties of this inner product, such as
positivity and its relation with the inner product on the space of conformal
blocks in conformal field theory. This study is in the general area of
representation theory of Lie algebras and related objects, and is important both
for mathematics and physics.
