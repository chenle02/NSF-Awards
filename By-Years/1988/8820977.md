Research will be conducted on fundamental problems in nuclear reactions at the
major nuclear physics accelerators in this country and abroad. These include
LAMPF, in Los Alamos, New Mexico, TRIUMF, in Vancouver, Canada, SATURNE II, in
Saclay, France, and LEAR, in Geneva, Switzerland. Their recent work has shown
that the nucleus is unexpectedly receptive to being excited by the transfer of
spin from the projectile when the projectile loses more than about 20 MeV in the
scattering process. They will continue this work to determine whether this
collective action of many nucleons is truly a general feature of nuclei over the
entire periodic table. They will pursue their investigations of pion absorption
mechanisms in nuclei. The pion is the basic carrier of the nuclear force; when
it combines with a neutron or proton, it can form another particle, the delta.
The researchers will also explore reactions in which nuclear correlations seem
to change the mass of the delta inside nuclei.
