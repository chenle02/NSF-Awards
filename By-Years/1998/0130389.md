This project will continue the operation of the Submillimeter Polarimeter for
Antarctic Remote Observations (SPARO) at the South Pole for the next three
winter seasons. The SPARO instrument is operated on the Viper 2-meter telescope,
and has recently been upgraded following its first year of observations. In the
exceptionally transmissive and stable winter-time skies over the Antarctic
plateau, SPARO provides a powerful probe of magnetic fields in interstellar
regions.&lt;br/&gt; Measurements at submillimeter wavelengths provide a method
for mapping magnetic fields in the denser interstellar regions of the galaxy by
measuring the linear polarization of thermal emission from magnetically aligned
interstellar dust grains. Interstellar magnetic fields are generally difficult
to observe, but they can contribute to our understanding of two general problems
in which interstellar gas (and thus probably also magnetic fields) play
important roles: the study of the galactic center, and star
formation.&lt;br/&gt; The galactic center is a highly radiationally active
region. In some centers, known as "active galactic nuclei" (AGN), the nucleus or
central core produces more radiation than the entire rest of the galaxy. The
size of an AGN can be smaller than the size of our solar system, and current
theory suggests that there is a supermassive black hole at the center of an
AGN.&lt;br/&gt; Observations proposed here are aimed at (a) confirming SPARO's
recent discovery of a large-scale toroidal magnetic field at the galactic
center, (b) testing a magnetic outflow model for the "Galactic Center Lobe" - a
radio structure possibly tracing gas that has been ejected from the galactic
nucleus, and (c) mapping large-scale magnetic fields in a sample of star forming
clouds in order to study the relationship between the elongated shapes of these
clouds and their magnetic fields.&lt;br/&gt;
