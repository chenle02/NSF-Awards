This workshop familiarizes engineering undergraduate faculty with the importance
and recent developments in the design of new products through Concurrent
Engineering (CE) and Design for Manufacture (DFM). Several tools and methods,
including customer driven engineering, product rating for assembly based on
geometry or assembly motions, reverse engineering, and the use of the process
capability for setting the quality and tolerance limits for new parts are
presented and discussed with classroom and laboratory exercises. The workshop is
followed- up by a quarterly newsletter and the exchange of software and video
tapes of classroom implementation.
