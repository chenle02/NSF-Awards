Although it is known that obesity results from a combination of both genetic and
environmental causes, it is now becoming apparent that the perinatal period
(i.e., pregnancy and the period immediately following birth) is crucial in the
development of the brain regions responsible for the control of food intake. By
using electrophysiological recording techniques to study the properties and
behavior of nerve cells in brain regions associated with the regulation of
feeding, this project will investigate the concept that exposure to a diet high
in fat during the critical perinatal period permanently alters the properties of
neurons in these brain regions, making them less responsive to signals that
would normally terminate feeding. The results of these studies will help explain
how nutrition affects the development of particular brain regions and may
provide a means by which we can understand how the perinatal environment affects
the likelihood of developing obesity later in life. This project will also allow
graduate students at Penn State College of Medicine to learn a wide variety of
different experimental techniques, particularly complex electrophysiological
investigations into nerve cell behavior, to answer the far-reaching questions
being asked.
