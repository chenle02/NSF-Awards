9555678 Goddard This three year project will provide enhancement activities for
32 teachers of psychology each summer for three years beginning in 1997. The
purpose of the project is to increase the scientific literacy of students
enrolled in high school psychology courses. The project will do this by updating
and expanding the teachers' knowledge of psychological science, and by immersing
these teachers in the use of inquiry-based student initiated projects as the
base for improving scientific understanding. The teachers will have an intensive
four week session designed for them to be immersed in a small research activity
conducted during the workshop. Each group of eight participants will have two
experienced teachers to assist them in their work. The teachers will also be
involved in two three hour time blocks during the day. There will be evening
sessions of unreported duration. The teachers will be drawn mostly from the
Appalachian Region. It is further expected that most of the participants will
come from the southeastern portion of Indiana, the southwestern portion of Ohio
and the northeastern region of Kentucky. Teacher are also welcome from the
states of Tennessee, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and
Pennsylvania. The cost share represents 29% of the award amount from the
Foundation.
