The overarching goal of this research project is to advance the current state of
knowledge of mid-latitude storm dynamics and predictability. The work will
consist of three distinct yet congruous areas of investigation: (i) a better
understanding of the physical processes involved in storm genesis and
intensification, including those involving latent heating due to condensation of
water vapor, (ii) an evaluation of the skill of today's forecast models to
predict storm genesis, evolution and larger-scale impacts, and (iii) a critical
test of research findings using observational field campaign
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A suite of research tools will be utilized to
accomplish research objectives. Fundamental storm dynamics and their role in
high impact weather will be examined primarily via the use of a set of carefully
designed, idealized numerical model simulations and model-based case study
analyses. Predictability will be investigated using the unique, multi-model
ensemble forecast data provided by the Observing System Research and
Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble. Finally,
data from the THORPEX Pacific Asian Regional Campaign will provide important in
situ data to test research findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts
include the fact that all scientific collaborators, including a number of
military graduate students at the Naval Postgraduate School, will gain unique
experience as part of a dynamic research team. The novel research findings will
be incorporated into a wide range of academic courses at the school and be
disseminated to the larger scientific community via peer reviewed publications
and scientific conferences.
