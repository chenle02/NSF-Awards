Development is a precise and reproducible process that is insensitive (or
robust) to both individual differences and environmental variations. How such
robustness is achieved remains an intriguing but fundamental problem in
developmental biology. Dr. Ma proposes to use the fruit fly Drosophila as a
model organism to study developmental robustness. Since the fundamental
principles that guide developmental processes are conserved in all animals, the
findings of this study will be directly relevant to the understanding of
ourselves. This study will focus on a gradient protein called Bicoid that
instructs the embryo to develop the anterior structures including the head and
thorax. Dr. Ma will investigate the processes of both Bicoid gradient formation
and gradient action in embryos, with a focus on the robustness of the system. He
has assembled an interdisciplinary team to tackle this problem and will take
advantage of tools in genetics, molecular biology, mathematics, computer science
and physics. Dr. Ma aims to obtain experimental data to build a mathematical
model that describes developmental robustness. The information revealed in this
study will be useful not only to developmental and systems biologists but also
to physicists and mathematicians working on living systems. The
interdisciplinary nature of the proposed work will help train a new generation
of scientists that can traverse between distinct scientific fields.
