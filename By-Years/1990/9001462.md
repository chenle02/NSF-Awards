In this project ("Cyclic and Polycyclic Organostannanes") in the Organic
Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Lawrence R. Sita in the
Chemistry Department at Carneige Mellon University will study the bonding,
physical, and structural properties of cyclic and polycyclic compounds of tin.
Some of the results from this study will lead to new insights concerning the
design of new materials for solid state applications. This study of "Cyclic and
Polycyclic Organostannanes" will bridge the curent gap in knowledge concerning
the structure, bonding, and physical properties of cyclic and polycyclic
compounds of tin. The nature of bonding available to Group 14 elements within
ring-strained systems, the development of new synthetic methodology which will
facilitate the construction of a desired cyclic or polycyclic organostannane
framework, the refinement of structure/bonding/physical property relationships
for tin, and the development of new spectroscopic techniques such as Sn-119 NMR,
electrochemistry, and electron spin resonance (ESR) for investigating the
molecular and electronic structure of cyclic and polycyclic organostannanes are
being studied
