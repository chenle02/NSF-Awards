0923433&lt;br/&gt;Losh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will support the acquisition
of a powder x-ray diffractometer for the Chemistry and Geology Departments at
Minnesota State University, Mankato (MSU). The new XRD will serve research and
research training need of this undergraduate institution in rural southern, MN.
Research requiring mineral phase characterization with applications to
understanding sediment diagenesis, ore deposit genesis, the transport and fate
of alkali and alkaline Earth metals in regional groundwater systems, and the
behavior and properties of novel concrete mixtures and superconducting materials
will all benefit from this acquisition. MSU plays an important role in the
training of scientifically literate undergraduates, students who are job
competitive in the technology sectors. This award will support the research of
an early career new investigator and provide partial salary support for a
laboratory technician.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
