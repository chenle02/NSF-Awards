This project would seek improved estimates of the solar wind polytropic index
at the bow shock to be obtained by analyzing shock crossing data with improved
MHD-based models for the bow shock. The project will additionally seek analytic
solutions for the magnetosheath thickness and related parameters and determine
their dependence on solar wind and magnetopause parameters. The results of these
investigations will be compared with MHD simulations with the goal to improve
the understanding of the large scale physics of the magnetosheath and the size
and shape of the bow shock.
