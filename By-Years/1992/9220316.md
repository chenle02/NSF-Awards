This grant provides partial support for long-duration balloon (LDB) balloon
flights and analysis of passive cosmic ray composition measurements. The
experiment will be done by a collaboration known as JACEE (Japanese American
Cosmic-ray Emulsion-chamber Experiment) which includes nearly 35 senior
scientists at 11 institutions from the U.S., Japan and Poland. The experimental
aims are to measure the cosmic ray energy spectrum and composition at ultra high
energies (approaching 1015 eV) and also to study nuclear interactions at these
energies, beyond the capabilities of any accelerator. No other known technique
can make similar measurements. It is the expectation of the JACEE group to make
20 such LDB flights over the next 10 years. This project is jointly supported by
NSF, NASA and sister agencies in Japan and Poland.
