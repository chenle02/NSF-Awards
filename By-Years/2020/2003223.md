Groups typically arise as the symmetries of some given object. The concept of a
groupoid allows for more general symmetries, acting on a collection of objects
rather than just a single one. The concept of a Lie groupoid, as well as its
infinitesimal counterpart, the notion of a Lie algebroid, have played an
increasing important role in various branches of mathematics, as well as its
applications. For example, one can now find them in the formulation of dynamics
in field theory in High Energy Physics, in various models for populations
dynamics in Biology, or in evolutionary dynamics in Game Theory. Over the last
two decades, the theory of Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids has undergone
several exciting developments and this project aims to develop further both
foundational aspects and significant new applications of the theory. This
project includes collaborations with various researchers in the field working in
Europe and South America and the training of 3 PhD students. The PI will be
involved in the organization of several international meetings, workshops and
summer courses in the field, as well as a weekly seminar at
UIUC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is organized into 4 main tasks. The first
task continues the PI study of Poisson manifolds of compact type, which are
central objects in Poisson Geometry, playing a role analogous to compact Lie
algebras in Lie Theory. The second task is dedicated to multiplicity free
fibrations, a.k.a. non-commutative integrable systems, and initiates the study
of its generic singularities. The third task concerns the study of strict (non-
formal) deformation quantization and aims to establish the first known
obstructions to the existence of strict deformation quantizations of a Poisson
manifold. The fourth task concerns Cartanâ€™s realization problem underlying many
classification problems in geometry, namely the ones that can be formulated in
terms of (finite dimensional) families of G-structures. It aims to establish a
theory of such realization problems, based on Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids,
as well as to give a complete solution to the classification problem. All these
tasks rely heavily on Lie groupoid techniques, many of which have yet to be
developed. Some of these ideas extend and expand results and techniques
previously developed by the PI and collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
