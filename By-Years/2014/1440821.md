Broward County Public Schools will bring together researchers, teachers,
administrators, and an evaluator to develop a research plan that examines how
computational thinking skills taught with a rigorous computing curriculum will
increase not only exposure to computing and engagement in school of students,
especially girls and underrepresented minorities, but also their academic
achievement in science and mathematics courses. This planning project will adapt
a structured computing curriculum to be integrated into the K-5 core curriculum
in 14 diverse elementary schools and measure the effect of the interventions on
achievement in literacy, mathematics and science. The planning project will
develop plans for gathering longitudinal data as students matriculate to middle
school.
