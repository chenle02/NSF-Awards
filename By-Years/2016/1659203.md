The University of Michigan-Dearborn REU Site in Mathematical Analysis is an
eight-week program that will take place during the summers of 2017, 2018, and
2019. The program will host eight undergraduate students from a diverse
background, including underrepresented groups, women, first-generation college
students and students from two-year college programs. The program will educate
and train students to become contributing members and ambassadors of the
mathematics community. Students will work in groups on projects that contain all
the phases of a scientific discovery. Students will experiment, conjecture,
provide rigorous solutions and present results in different formats. The program
will introduce participants to a large network of mentors and peers, which will
assist them in career planning and in commitment to the scientific community.
The program organizers will help students to find appropriate venues to present
and publish their results. Additionally, students will learn more about the
graduate school application process and career opportunities in academia and in
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of the program will be
mathematical analysis and the research projects will be related to Fourier
analysis, linear algebra, differential equations, dynamical systems, complex
analysis, operator theory, spectral theory, and mathematical music theory.
Students will have unique interaction with experienced faculty mentors in a rich
intellectual environment, where they will learn how to use mathematical ideas to
solve real life problems.
