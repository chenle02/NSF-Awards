ABSTRACT OPP-9708997 SMITH UNIV. CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES This project is
designed to achieve a better understanding of the timing, volume, and
biogeochemistry of freshwater runoff from the land surface to the Arctic Ocean.
Rivers, deltas, and estuaries experience or influence a variety of processes
that are relevant to problems of global change, such as greenhouse gas
emissions, the surface energy balance, and biogeochemical cycling, and the
delivery of freshwater, sediment, and nutrients to the Arctic shelf environment.
The proposed study would use multi-temporal high resolution synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) and visible/near-infrared satellite data in combination with Russian
ground station observations to assess: (1) the timing and volume of freshwater
delivery to the Arctic Ocean; (2) the timing and magnitude of seasonal
inundation of the land surface, and the indentification of those rivers that
actively exchange water, sediment, and nutrients with surrounding aquatic
ecosystems; and (3) the relationship between temperature, river outflows, and
freeze-up/break-up of river, estuary, and shelf ice.
