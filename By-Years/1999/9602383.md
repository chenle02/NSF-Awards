Broward Community College (BCC) will lead a consortium composed of the U. of
Miami, Broward County Schools, N. Broward Hospital District, Hewlett Packard,
Advantage Medical Electronics, Motorola, ABC Computers, Asea Brown Boveri Corp.,
and the Biomedical Engineering Technology (BMET) Advisory Board in developing a
program in BMET. BCC offers a well-established Electronics Engineering
Technology program, in existence for more than 28 years, supported by industry,
and very highly recognized throughout the state of Florida and nationally. BCC's
electronics program is accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of
the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, and received the
Secretary of Education's Award for the best technical program in the
southeastern U. S. in 1992 The target audience will be students from public and
private high schools, employees of Biomedical Engineering companies, and other
persons seeking technical training/retraining. The goal of the project is to
produce qualified Biomedical Engineering technicians who will provide a critical
link between the clinical application and the electronic technology of today's
medical equipment. Laboratories and laboratory practices will be developed to
give the students state-of-the-art experiences with a wide range of biomedical
equipment. The female principal investigator will serve as a role model as she
promotes the program in the high schools and in industry. A `2+2+2` model will
be created that could be replicated on a nationwide basis. The first two years
will prepare the students at the high school level for a smooth transition to
the community college program. The second two years will provide students with
Associate of Science degree components with the necessary skills to enter the
workplace. In addition, interested students will have access to a parallel track
with higher levels of mathematics and science for a bridge to the final two
years of a bachelor's degree program at the U. of Miami.
