NSF/CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences-"Mathematical
Epidemiology with Applications"-July 18-22, 2011

The criticality of mathematical tools applied to better understand transmission,
spread and control of infectious diseases is assuming new importance, in light
of recent epidemics, such as those caused by SARS and H1N1 viruses. Up-to-date
epidemic analyses incorporate cultural, political, and social factors along side
with international travel. The NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conference
"Mathematical Epidemiology with Applications" will introduce a new generation of
mathematical scientists to this exciting area, while setting in place
collaborations and working groups that will generate much more research in the
years to come.

The conference will feature ten keynote lectures by two leading experts in the
field of mathematical epidemiology, Professor Fred Brauer of the University of
British Columbia, and Professor Carlos Castillo-Chavez of Arizona State
University.
