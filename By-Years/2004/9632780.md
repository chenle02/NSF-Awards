w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9632780 First The goal of this project is to
understand spin-dependent electron transmission and scattering in metallic
multilayers composed of alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic materials. The
experiments use successive magnetic layers as "polarizer" and "analyzer", with
an external magnetic field controlling their relative orientation. Using a
cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope, different spectroscopies detect either
the ballistic electron current transmitted through the polarizer/analyzer pairs,
or the field-dependent density of states in the multilayer. These are among the
first detailed studies of spin-dependent scattering in metals and at subsurface
interfaces for electron energies within +5 electron volt of the Fermi energy.
They address issues of importance for understanding both the oscillatory
exchange coupling and the giant magnetoresistance ratios that have been observed
in magnetic multilayers. %%% This project addresses issues of importance for
understanding the properties of "magnetic multilayers". These are thin films
with alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic layers, each typically two nanometer
thick. Because these man-made materials exhibit a "giant" magnetoresistance
ratio, they have already found applications in ultrasmall and sensitive magnetic
field sensors (in computer disk drives, for instance). Still, the fundamental
basis for the observed magnetic effects is not fully understood. These
experiments use the spectroscopic capabilities of a low- temperature scanning
tunneling microscope to derive information about the properties of magnetic
multilayers on a nanometer length scale. ***
