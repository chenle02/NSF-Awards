&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 0220630&lt;br/&gt;PI: R.
Farley&lt;br/&gt;Institution: VCU&lt;br/&gt;Title: Computer Science, Engineering
and Mathematics Scholarship Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
the program is to extend the NSF CSEM scholarship opportunities to beginning
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) students while extending the
opportunities to J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC) students. These
new scholarships enable undergraduate students in CSEM majors to complete their
degree programs within the normal time frame and subsequently enter the work
force in CSEM occupations. The program provides 29 scholarships of $3,125 per
year per student over four years to students majoring in computer science,
engineering, and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comprehensive support
structure, which has undergone minor refinements over the two-year span of the
current program, is extended to the new scholars. The opportunity to offer CSEMS
awards to beginning VCU students presents an exciting possibility to the VCU
Director of Admissions who is committed to using these awards to help recruit
more students into CSEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
