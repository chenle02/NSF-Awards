Collision physics is entering an incredibly exciting time as a result of recent
new experimental advances. One of these advances is the COLTRIMS (cold-target
recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy) method. With this method, one can obtain full
three-dimensional absolute cross sections for ionization of atoms and molecules
by an arbitrarily charged particle. The most detailed information is contained
in the fully differential cross section (FDCS) measurements in which the energy
and angular location of all the final state particles are measured. Prior to
COLTRIMS, FDCS measurements were made only for electron impact, normally only in
the scattering plane, and the data were typically not absolute. With COLTRIMS,
FDCS measurements are possible for any particle, any anti-particle, or
arbitrarily charged ion. Now that these data are available to be compared with
theory, there are surprises; the best theories are not in agreement with the
experimental data. This research will investigate these open theoretical
questions using a variety of different theoretical approaches ranging from
first-order perturbation theory using the most accurate possible initial- and
final state wavefunctions, to second-order distorted-wave approaches, to many-
body perturbation theory. It is anticipated that different approaches will
provide different insights into the physics of the collisions.
