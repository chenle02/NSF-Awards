This U.S.- Brazil Program award provides support for cooperative research
between Dr. Ronald E. Olson, University of Missouri-Rolla and Drs. Geraldo M.
Sigaud and Eduardo C. Montenegro of Pontificia University of Rio de Janeiro in
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in an international study on the dynamics of ionizing
collisions. This collaborative research project combines the theoretical
expertise of Dr. Olson and the experimental expertise and resources of Drs.
Sigaud and Montenegro to develop a better understanding of the fundamental
subtleties of electron-electron and electron-ion interactions in fast heavy
particle collisions. They will develop momentum spectroscopy techniques that are
needed to understand the relative importance of interactions in atomic collision
studies. The results of this research will allow the interpretation of very
difficult charge exchange measurements and increase our understanding of many
collision processes in nature, such as energy deposition processes in biological
tissue, in health-related applications, in fusion energy development and in
material science applications.
