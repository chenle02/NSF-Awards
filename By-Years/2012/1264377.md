1264377&lt;br/&gt;Cunningham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smartphone biosensor will
utilize the internal camera as a spectrometer, and the internal LED as a
broadband light source. Demonstrated applications will include detection of
biomarker proteins that are used to indicate the nutritional status of children,
detection of a toxic chemical that can contaminate harvested corn, detection of
mRNA sequences used to identify a bacterial pathogen, and detection of an HIV
viral antibody. The wide availability of a low-cost, robust, and multimode
biosensor detection capability will spur accelerated development of sensing
applications in myriad settings where laboratory capabilities are lacking, or
where current ?closed? platforms are aimed at only a very specific commercial
market. Smartphone-based detection systems are expected to find applications in
situations where laboratory facilities are not available such as point-of-care
analysis in the home, clinic, farm, or remote locations. The data-sharing
capabilities of smartphone-based sensors will enable distributed networks of
sensors to be deployed across large physical areas, but with cloud-based systems
that can collate and map data. Such systems can aid in the interpretation of
sensor data, or make data readily available to clinicians who are not at the
same location as the patient.
