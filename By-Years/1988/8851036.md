Using minority and female junior and senior high school students to work with
elementary teachers in presenting science activities in their elementary
classes--"Teaching by New Techniques"--, "Double TNT" will both seek to interest
the elementary students, particularly minorities and females, in science and to
interest the older students in the possibility of careers in teaching--Targeting
New Teachers. The junior and senior high school students will come from The
Science Academy of Austin, a unit of the Austin (TX) Independent School District
sponsored by the District and a consortium of local industries. They will work
with teachers at both levels to develop science teaching units that they can
present at the elementary level, both in person and via videotape, thereby
serving as role models. They will also serve as mentors to sixth grade students
who visit the Science Academy. The Science Academy will also work directly with
elementary teachers in teacher enhancement programs and will actively seek to
interest minority and female elementary students to apply for the Science
Academy. Cost sharing by the partners is estimated to total at least 75% of the
NSF funding.
