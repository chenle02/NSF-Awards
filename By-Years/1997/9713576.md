The PI will reexamine the National Solar Observatory/Kitt Peak (NSF/KP) high-
resolution daily and synoptic rotation helium 1083 nanometer spectroheliograms,
and nearly simultaneous magnetograms, to produce a finalized set of coronal hole
maps. In making these maps, she will measure several properties of each
identified coronal hole, such as the magnetic flux, area, position, average
helium equivalent width, and heliographic position of coronal hole boundaries.
Resultant maps and information will be published through the NSO/KP anonymous
archive and atlas. Moreover, she will use these data to investigate the
variation of coronal holes' properties on time-scales of days to the solar
cycle, coronal holes' relation to the emergence and evolution of active regions
and the occurrence to coronal mass ejections. This research will provide
important clues to understanding short- and long-term evolution of the solar
magnetic fields, their extension into interplanetary space, and eventual effects
on Earth.
