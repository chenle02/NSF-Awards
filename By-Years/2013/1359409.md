This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas A&amp;M
University - Commerce provides opportunities to eight students from community
colleges each summer for ten weeks of research on topics in astrophysics,
astronomy, computational physics, engineering physics, optics, material sciences
and nuclear physics. In addition to participating in research with an
experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure
not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging
collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student
will have written a research report and presented the results of their work in a
talk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts
with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help
prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
careers. Additionally, the site focuses on providing research opportunities to
students from community colleges and assists them with the transition to a four-
year college. The site has put strategies in place to ensure that non-
traditional students, many of whom have families, are able to participate in a
summer research experience.
