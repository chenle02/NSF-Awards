Likelihood Methods in Statistics Abstract: This research considers several
problems regarding likelihood-based statistical inference. These problems
naturally fall into two areas. The first area is inference based on the
likelihood ratio statistic. The research considers the development of an
adjustment to the square-root likelihood ratio statistic that improves the
accuracy of the usual normal approximation and is easily calculated in a wide
range of models. This leads to improved methods of inference in models where the
accuracy of first-order asymptotic approximations is questionable. The research
also studies analogues of the likelihood ratio statistic that are based on a
quasi-likelihood function. The second area of research is statistical prediction
analysis. The specific problems being considered include the development of
general methods of prediction based on predictive pivots and conditional
inference, and the analysis and comparison of predictive likelihood methods,
including the predictive density based on a prior distribution. This research is
concerned with the development of accurate and useful methods for drawing
conclusions and making predictions based on observational data. Many statistical
methods are based on approximations; in many cases, the accuracy of these
approximations is questionable. One aspect of this research is the development
of more accurate and reliable approximations of this type. Statistical
prediction analysis is concerned with the problem of predicting future events
based on currently available data. Predictive methods have applications in a
wide array of fields, including medical diagnosis, environment and global
change, manufacturing, and economic forecasting. This research develops general
methods of constructing pre dictions and studies the relationships among the
various methods of prediction.
