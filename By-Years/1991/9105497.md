This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at Madison acquire
upgrades to their single crystal x-ray diffractometers and computer. Among the
areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the
following: Mechanistic Organometallic Chemistry, Silicon Chemistry, Small-to-
Giant Transition Metal Clusters, Radical Cation and Electron Transfer Chemistry
and Organic Photochemistry. Single crystal x-ray crystallography coupled with a
computer system is the most powerful analytical method for structure
determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioorganic and
organometallic chemistry, single x-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool for
characterizing molecular structure. The information gained from the knowledge of
the molecular composition and structure helps to develop new reactions of
potentially general interest in catalysis or synthesis.
