This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the Louisiana
State University entitled, "LaRET Site: Linking Teachers with Researchers to
Improve Engineering Education", under the direction of Dr. Warren N.
Waggenspack. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)
in Engineering Site involves a six-week summer research schedule of active
learning activities and academic year follow-on activities for a total of 30
high school science teachers from several regional public school districts and
community college faculty, 10 each year for three years at LSU's Center for
BioModular Multi-Scale Systems (CBM2), Center for Advanced Microstructures and
Devices (CAMD), Office of Strategic Initiatives and the Gordon A. Cain Center
for Scientific, Technological, Engineering and Mathematical (STEM) Literacy. The
primary purpose of the LaRET is to build an infrastructure of knowledge and
understanding so that all participants develop expertise and strategies in
promoting and strengthening STEM education practices with an empahsis in
engineering and developing collaborative connections among researchers and high
school/community college practitioners.
