The mechanism and consequences of rapid electron transfer reactions will be
investigated using a picosecond laser flash photolysis system designed to record
the absorption of transient intermediates on the order of a few picoseconds. The
cycloaddition reactions to be investigated include: (1) the addition of olefins
to stilbene; (2) the Paterno-Buchi reaction between benzophenone and a variety
of alkenes and selected alkynes; and (3) an evaluation of the mechanism for
photoreduction of aryl ketones with metal hydrides. All of the reactions to be
investigated involve cycloaddition reactions which proceed via short lived
intermediates. In the context of the electron transfer processes which occur in
these reactions, the crucial differences between contact and solvent separated
ion-pairs will be clearly delineated for the first time. %%% This grant from the
Organic Dynamics Program to Professor Kevin Peters at the University of Colorado
will involve the study of very fast chemical reactions which are complete in
less than a billionth of a second. Reactions called cycloadditions, which are
promoted by the transfer and redistribution of electrons from one molecule to
another, will be monitored by a laser system capable of recording the existence
of short-lived intermediate species which only exist for a few trillionths of a
second. The need to understand the properties of these transient species is
critical to defining the role of electron transfer in a variety of reactions of
importance in biological and technological processes.
