A computerized three dimensional (3D) atlas of the rat brain will be developed
to enable users to visualize the complex spatial relationships among brain
structures. The systems developed will serve as a basis for quantitating
morphometric measurements in three dimensions and understanding the spatial
relationships between structure and function. In addition these studies will aid
subsequent researchers using steriotaxic methodologies to study neural function.
