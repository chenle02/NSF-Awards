>>B%>B%>B%>B%>>> >B%>B%>B%>B%>>> >. J H. Dr. Thunnel is awarded funds to
continue his research with Dr. Corliss (Duke University) in the investigation of
the Quaternary paleoceanography of the Sulu and South China Seas. Sediment
deposition in these two basins is controlled by intervening sills that greatly
inhibit the exhange of bottom water. During a cruise in 1988 Drs. Thunell and
Corliss collected transects of cores along these sills to document changing
paleoceanographic conditions during glacial/interglacial cycles of the late
Pleistocene. With their present award they will complete their core analyses and
extend them to include studies of living benthic foraminifera collected in their
box cores. The ecologic and isotopic information derived in this manner will be
used to reconstruct the history of changes of the late Quaternary
paleoenvironments of the region. Their data will also be used to reconstruct the
late Quaternary history of monsoonal circulation of the western equatorial
Pacific; they intend to compare this history with results derived from other
studies of the NW Indian Ocean.
