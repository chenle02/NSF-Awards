This is a novel electrical/computer engineering approach to the difficult
problem of determining the physical condition of the heart by a non-invasive
voltage measurement, ie., EKG. A new era is emerging, namely, non-invasive
detection of incipient heart failure. This proposal suggests a new means for
accomplishing this goal. It is clear that the PI has presented a direct means to
obtaining her goals. There are many obstacles to overcome, but that is the
nature of fundamental engineering research. This type of research could
revolutionize diagnosis of heart disease.
