Chemical and structural defenses of the gorgonian coral Briareum asbestinum
vary among different sites in the Caribbean and between depths at a single site.
High site.specific variation in types of secondary terpenoid compounds of
Briareum asbestinum may be environmentally induced. DR. Harvell will determine
whether the observed variation in chemical and structural defenses of Briareum
is genetic or environmentally induced and whether it is caused by selection by
biotic agents. Briareum is distinguished not only by a diverse complement of
briareins (compounds) in adult colonies, but also a high investment in chemical
defense of the oocytes, embryos, and larvae, affording the opportunity to
investigate the ontogeny of chemical defense in the life cycle. Despite a decade
of intense research by chemists on bioactive compounds from gorgonians, no
studies have explored quantitative or qualitative of the life cycle. In the
first phase of the project the PI will (1) reciprocally transplant clonal
replicates of shallow and deep adult colonies to measure genetic and
environmental components of defense, (2) determine sources of natural mortality
of embryo and larval stages, and (3) quantify the timing of switches in
synthesis of major briarein compounds in colony development. In the second phase
of the project she will (1) collect and analyze (growth and defenses) the adult
transplant, (2) establish juvenile transplants and selection experiments, and
(3) investigate the palatability of briareins to predators using bioassays with
artificial foods.
