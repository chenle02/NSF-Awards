The principal investigator will continue to investigate questions of integral
geometry and related problems in geometric analysis. He will investigate Radon
transformations along submanifolds of symmetric spaces, finite analogues of
Radon transformations, and further geometric inequalities for convex bodies and
the Busemann-Petty problem. In a separate vein, he will investigate group-
invariant function theory on Hermitian symmetric domains. A microcomputer will
be used to perform experiments in geometric inequalities for finite Radon
transformations. Convex three dimensional polyhedra include the cube, pyramid,
and other classic solids of Euclidean geometry. In the theory of integral
geometry, one might compute the probability that an arbitrary line in three
dimensional space intersects both the origin and one of these polyhedra. Using a
computer to motivate his mode of attack, the principal investigator will solve
deep generalizations of such problems.
