0402231 Seppalainen This project studies stochastic processes that model
complex, interacting behavior, such as interacting particle systems and
interface models. The goal is to obtain mathematical results that describe
behavior over large space and time scales in terms of limit theorems, and
roughness of interfaces or fluctuations in particle flow by order-of-magnitude
exponents, limit distributions, and large deviation rate functions. The emphasis
is on finding new phenomena, and on capturing the overall picture of connections
between different classes of microscopic rules and the associated large-scale
behavior. One particular problem of interest in the context of asymmetric
systems is the fluctuations of the current across a characteristic of the
partial differential equation that describes the macroscopic evolution of the
system. The objective of this research is precise mathematical understanding of
certain kinds of macroscopic phenomena that result from interactions among a
large number of microscopic components. The project studies mathematical models
that include randomness in the behavior of the individual components. These
models are abstractions of basic principles of organization and behavior common
to many types of complex systems. The goal is to describe the typical large
scale behavior of the model, and also to quantify the chances of deviations from
the typical behavior. Complex interactions occur all around us in natural and
man-made processes. Examples include cars on a freeway, customers in a queue,
packets making their way through a communication network, or fluid particles in
a tube. Consequently understanding the mathematics of complex interactions has
potentially wide implications for science and engineering. Models of the types
described in the proposal and others related to them are concurrently studied by
mathematicians, natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers.
