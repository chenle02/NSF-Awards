The primary objective of this Dissertation Improvement proposal is to
investigate the proportions and size of the upper body in Neandertals, early
modern humans and modern human groups. The question of the relationship of
Neandertals to early modern humans and of both to modern humans is very much
open to discussion. This research will investigate aspects of those
relationships as seen in the body size, robusticity and shape in the skeletal
remains from each group. Using statistics the PIs hope to elucidate
constellations of features in the morphology of the upper body that set each of
these groups off from the others. The study will contribute to the understanding
of the place of Neandertals in human evolution and the nature of their
adaptations.
