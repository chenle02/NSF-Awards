This project deals with the organization of the Fifth Annual Workshop on
Aerospace Computational Control. The major objectives of this workshop are to
provide NSF and NASA an assessment of current computational control research and
development; to identify future needs in important research areas such as
computer-aided control design and multibody simulation tools which can be built
with the combined efforts of government, industrial and university personnel;
and to strengthen the link between tool developers and end-users. Another
important goal of the workshop is to strengthen cooperation between the industry
and university researchers thereby aiding in the transfer of technology from the
research level to the end-users. The issues discussed at the workshop include
multibody dynamics, computational techniques, model reduction, real-time
simulation, symbolic manipulation and concurrent processing.*** //
