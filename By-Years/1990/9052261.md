SUNY Brockport is acquiring an AIR Inc. ADAS multisonde/tethersonde system along
with an optical theodolite. This equipment bolsters the meteorology program's
emphasis on atmospheric observations and field research methods. The system
provides vertical profiles of temperature, pressure, humidity and wind by means
of expendable radiosondes or tethered balloon sounding packages. This sounding
equipment allows students in introductory synptics, weather forecasting, air
pollution, and micrometeorology classes to obtain a more complete three-
dimensional understanding of atmospheric processes. The equipment is used in a
new course in field methods as well, which is the cornerstone of the program
emphasis on observational research. Students gain valuable experience working
with state-of-the-art field research equipment, gaining knowledge in
observational methods which will serve them well in future graduate studies or
career pursuits. The college will contribute 112% of the award.
