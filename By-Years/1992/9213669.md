Atomic structures and chemical reactions in solid surfaces will be investigated
with a variety of techniques that utilize pulsed beams of ions with kinetic
energies from 1 to 15 keV. The composition and atomic geometry of the surfaces
will be determined as a result of these measurements. Calculations of the
scattering cross sections from models of the surfaces will augment geometrical
considerations in determining the correct surface structures. The films of
interest will be supported primarily on silicon(111) surfaces. The interactions
between adsorbed species such as silver and gold, silver and gallium, and silver
and phosphorus will be determined in initial experiments; more complex films
will be investigated later. Another study will follow the course of a chemical
reaction, the gold catalyzed oxidation of silicon at low temperatures, as it
occurs on the surface. Ion scattering techniques will be evaluated to see if
they can be generally useful for studies of gas-surface kinetics.
