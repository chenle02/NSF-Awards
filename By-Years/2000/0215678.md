With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Dorota
Abramovitch and Thomas Kozel of Anderson College will acquire a gas
chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection that will be used to support the
integration of research and courses in environmental/analytical chemistry into
the undergraduate curriculum. Anderson College is an undergraduate institution.
The PIs will establish a research effort in analytical biochemistry that will
involve undergraduates and emphasize environmental and green chemistry. One
project involves monitoring the chemistry, flora and fauna of a local creek
acquatic ecosystem. Eventually, they plan to carry out water, sludge and soil
analyses for organic contaminants and heavy metals. The instrument will also be
used in a number of courses.
