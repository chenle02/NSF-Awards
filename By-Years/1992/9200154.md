The FAMU/FSU College of Engineering is providing mechanical engineering juniors
with training in the conduct of research and participation in active faculty
research projects. The major objective is to increase student motivation to
pursue and succeed in the mechanical engineering profession. Research
experiences are used 1) to demonstrate the relevance and professional
applications of basic and advanced course work, 2) to provide experiences in the
challenges and rewards of research and, thus, encouragement to pursue graduate
degrees; and 3) to build mentoring bonds between faculty and undergraduates
which encourage retention and graduation of members of underrepresented groups.
