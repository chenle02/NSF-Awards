This award provides support for a portion of the work of the Arcadia project.
Arcadia is a major, joint research effort, the aim of which is to gain
fundamental understandings about desirable architectures for the integration of
software tools into environments and particularly in support of software
testing, analysis and evaluation. Arcadia is an experimental research project
which aims to gain these understandings through the creation and experimental
evaluation of an actual environment prototype--Arcadia-1. A key innovative
feature of the approach being taken by Arcadia is to consider software processes
to be items of software themselves and to view an environment as a mechanism for
specifying, compiling and interpreting these processes, using software tools and
software workers as interpretation primitives. Work at the university of
California at Irvine on the Arcadia project will focus on the interrelated areas
of software environment architectures, user interface management systems, and
techniques for aiding in the development of reliable concurrent and real-time
software. The architecture component is concerned with the formalization and
automation of software development and maintenance activities (supporting both
product-oriented and process- oriented views), principles underlying the
management of persistent data objects, tool activation management (including
exploitation of parallelism), and tool integration. Work in the user interface
management systems area is aimed at determining appropriate abstractions and
designs such that concurrency within the system is maximized, environment
extensibility is effectively supported, and integration with the environment's
object management system is achieved.
