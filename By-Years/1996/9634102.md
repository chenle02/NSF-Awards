The traditional approach to building and maintaining a system is to build an
initial system and then deploy it. Over time, end users identify certain
performance `inadequacies` or `inconveniences` in the initial system. These
problems are reported back to the system designer, who collects them, regularly
rebuilding the system with `improved` performance. A problem is that the design
of the system never exactly fits the task environment. The reason for this is in
large part due to the pragmatic relations between system, data, and user. In the
standard adapted system, information is being gathered about the user which is
used to modify the interface. The goal of this research is to develop a
methodology for building systems that evolve based on the particulars of a
specific data set. A method of system adaptation will be explored that is based
on the history of usage of the system for a given task. With each transaction,
the system acquires information about the interaction between the user and the
system that is subsequently used to adjust the problem-solving behavior of the
user/system as it applies to that particular data set. These ideas will be
developed as they apply to the construction and evolution of an online manual
system. The results of the study will be incorporated into a methodology for
building systems that automatically evolve to the specifics of their task
environment after they are deployed.
