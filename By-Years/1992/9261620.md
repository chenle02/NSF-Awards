This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
multi-media software product for the teaching of modern statistics, one of the
most widely studied subjects in the undergraduate business and social science
curricula. The product will employ full-motion video, animation, and simulation
integrating these with data analysis into a work-station based environment. The
software will permit personalized instruction and will rely heavily on
visualization methodology to make statistical concepts and methods easier to
learn and understand. Effective training of students in methods of statistics
and data analysis is crucial to the continual improvement of quality and
productivity upon which the competitiveness of U.S. industry depends.
