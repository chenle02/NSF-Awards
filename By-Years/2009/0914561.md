This proposal introduces a class of novel inverse problems with applications to,
and motivated by anti-terrorism efforts, such as surveillance and discovery of
harmful comtamination sources in unknown battle fields as well as urban regions.
Unlike the typical settings of a large class of inverse problems, the research
involves inverting Radon transforms from very sparse samples and constraints
involving parttial differential equations. These considerations present
interesting challenges in both mathematical analysis and modeling as well as in
the design and implementation of appropriate computational methods. In addition,
this proposal introduces novel strategies which greatly reduce the complexity
for the inversion. State-of-the-art numerical techniques that have been in
development by the PI and his collaborators, such as the use of Bregman
iteration in imaging and compressed sensing and inverse problem applications
will be central in meeting these challenges.

This research has immediate and direct implications for anti- terrorism
efforts, such as surveillance and discovery of harmful contamination sources in
unknown battlefields as well as urban regions. A desired capability is to
reconstruct and predict the whereabouts and the extent of an offending chemical
and/or biological cloud from passive, remote measurements from an array of
sensors. A very limited number of stationary or moving sensors receive and
record infrared radiation from the scene containing the cloud (plume) in
addition to the radiation from other elements in the scene, such as the
background and intervening atmosphere. The sensors are assumed to be able to
resolve the spectrum of the receivedtotal radiation and the spectral signatures
of chemicals of interest may be known. This research will help to move the
sensors to optimal locations, to detect the locations and contents of
thesources, to predict the plumes' behavior and ultimately to minimize the
damage caused by such events.
