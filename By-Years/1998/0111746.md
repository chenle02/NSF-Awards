This dissertation project examines the legal activities of a native people in
New Spain (now, Mexico) called Tlaxcalans between 1580 and 1640 and the
consequences of their litigiousness. During this time, the native population
fell to its nadir, the Spanish and casta (mixed race) population increased
dramatically, and the period of conquest and expansion was being supplanted by a
period of administrative consolidation. This researcher hypothesizes that
Tlaxcalans responded to these changes and adjusted their legal strategies
accordingly. Consequently, by accommodating to the changing political
environment, Tlaxcalans accessed new legal tools that were offered by the system
and, in turn, shaped the political and demographic shifts within their
community, and influenced the evolving legal system of the Spanish Empire.
Building on the current literature in both Spanish and native history, two
bodies of literature that rarely speak to each other, this project contributes
to research that investigates native people's agency in historical processes and
to literature that recasts the administration of the Spanish Empire as social
phenomena. For this project, the researcher examines documents pertaining to the
litigiousness of Tlaxcalans and to Spanish legal thought, which are found in
archives in Mexico and Spain.
