The Pennsylvania State University will conduct a three-year project to empower
300 middle and high school mathematics teachers in computer-intensive
environments and to prepare teachers for implementing computer intensive
curricula in general and computer-intensive algebra in particular. The project
will engage participants through four components: a computer-intensive
mathematics course, a mathematics education course in understanding student
understanding, a practicum involving teaches as researchers, and classroom
implementation addressing issues in the teaching and learning of mathematics in
computer-intensive environments. These components will be accomplished through
four-week intensive summer courses, follow-up activities during the school year,
a year-long practicum for a subset of the teachers implementing computer-
intensive algebra, and support for all teachers during their first year of
implementation. In addition, this teacher enhancement model will study the
effects of teacher- implemented, task-based interviews and computer-active
testing on their understanding of student understanding. Participants will be
recruited nationwide, with targeted areas of Washington, DC, Chicago and San
Francisco. Participants may elect to receive eight graduate credits. In addition
to the first-wave participants, an additional 900 second-wave participants will
be effected through enactment of roles as computer-intensive facilitators,
bringing the total numbers of teachers enhanced to 1200. In working in a
computer-intensive environment, participants will learn new teaching roles --
roles that will deemphasize training in routine skills and emphasize computer-
based exploration of mathematical concepts. They will develop new strategies for
assessing student learning and for assigning grades. Pennsylvania State and
participating schools' cost- sharing accounts for 8% of the NSF budget.
