&lt;br/&gt;The Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) is
adapting and implementing the Career Transcript System (CTS) in 16 high school,
college, and industry sites across the state. The primary goal is to create a
state-wide system and national model focused on improving the technical
education provided for Kentucky's current and future workforce in the
Information Technology (IT), Engineering Technology (ET) and Manufacturing
Technology (MT) sectors. Adaptation of this material will strengthen science,
mathematics, engineering, and technical learning as well as improve the career
skills of students and workers participating in the program. The CTS was created
by the SCANS 2000 Center at Johns Hopkins University with funding from NSF/ATE
over the past eight years. It combines professional development, teaching tools,
assessments, and verified documentation in the form of a Career Transcript (CT).
Two campuses of KCTCS, Central Kentucky Technical College and Bowling Green
Technical College, had previously pilot tested the CTS in IT and MT classrooms.
This project is implementing the CTS at additional college sites, high schools,
and industries across the state. By fostering partnerships with high schools and
industry, KCTCS is creating a pipeline for future employees and enhancing skills
development for current employees in the Kentucky IT, ET and MT sectors. Over
the course of two years, 835 students and workers are receiving Career
Transcripts, 32 KCTCS faculty and staff are being trained to use the CTS, 12
faculty are being certified to train other faculty, KCTCS is hosting a two-day
state wide conference to disseminate results, and a CTS committee is working to
institutionalize the system across the state.&lt;br/&gt;
