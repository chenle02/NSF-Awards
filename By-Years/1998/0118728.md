This study will examine the ways in which Information and Communication
Technologies (ICTs) enable the development of collaborative, boundary-spanning
networks between academic and industry scientists working in three disciplinary
areas, 1) oceanography, 2) marine biology and 3) astronomy. The methodology
combines survey techniques with semi-structured interviews, in-depth case
studies, and network analysis to provide a detailed view of how these scientists
use ICTs to gather data, store and share information, and communicate with one
another. The results of this research will provide a better understanding of the
use of ICTs in inter-organizational scientific collaborations, and the ways in
which these collaborations may enable economic development, technological
innovation, and advances in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
