Twenty secondary school science teachers will carry out an undersea research
project using deep-diving submersibles and other state-of-the-art equipment
provided by the National Undersea Research Center (NURC). Project Oceanology, a
marine education center, will supply research vessels, oceanographic equipment,
computers and a waterfront marine laboratory. With the guidance of oceanographic
and science educators, teachers will gain first-hand experience doing scientific
research and will strengthen their understanding of the nature of science. The
program will also help teachers transfer their experience into teaching methods
which will engage their own students in scientific inquiry. This three-year
program will begin in March 1990, with the first year devoted to experimental
design, laboratory investigations and field studies. The second year will
include data analysis, presentation of research results, and the design of a
student research program. During the third year, ending in June 1992, teachers
will implement this program in their schools with the mutual support of their
colleagues and the supervision of program staff. An amount equivalent to 61.73%
of the NSF award is being contributed as cost-sharing.
