Liouville quantum gravity is a model for producing a random two-dimensional
surface. The model was introduced by Polyakov 30 years ago in the context of
string theory and is now a centerpiece of a branch of physics called conformal
field theory. Liouville quantum gravity is a continuum theory, but it has
discrete analogs. Just as there are discrete ways to create random paths (by
drawing them on grids) there are also discrete ways to produce random surfaces
(by gluing together identical unit squares along their edges). The PI will study
both discrete and continuum random surfaces: their relationship to each other,
their relationship to gauge theories and other aspects of theoretical physics,
and their relationship to conformal random geometry and random curves such as
the Schramm-Loewner evolution. In particular, the PI aims to show that, in some
sense, if one builds a discrete random surface out of a large number of very
small squares, it looks very much like the continuum random surfaces studied in
Liouville quantum gravity. Moreover, when additional statistical physical
structure (Ising or Potts models) is associated with the discrete models, this
structure corresponds to continuum random geometric objects (conformal loop
ensemble) on the continuum random surfaces. The PI will work closely with
undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, on these
and related problems in probability, analysis, and statistical physics.
