The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research Phase I project is to mitigate the global freshwater crisis. Water
supplies are under stress in many areas of the world. Securing a supply of fresh
water to meet the needs of population growth and increased industrialization is
a global challenge. The proposed technology in this SBIR project will offer an
opportunity to produce large scale high performance RO membranes in a continuous
format at low cost to facilitate lower cost water purification. Phase I of this
program will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach in a batch
format and lay a solid foundation for large through-put continuous production.
This program will also enable further scientific/technological understanding on
zeolite nanocrystal synthesis, self-assembly based on static charge interaction
and chemical reaction. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives in this
Phase I research project are to develop a commercially viable spray based layer
by layer (LbL) deposition approach to fabricate thin film nanocomposite (TFN) RO
membranes with more process control. Current RO purification systems require a
high driving pressure mainly because of low water flux and fouling of the
membranes. The proposed approach allows fabrication of highly cross-linked
polyamide (PA) nanocomposite membranes with nanometer control over the film
thickness, minimal roughness, uniform nanoparticle distribution, and defined
local chemical and polymer composition. Compared with traditional reverse
osmosis PA membranes, significant benefits can be expected from the proposed
membrane including 2 to 3 times improvement in water flux, lower driving
pressure, and less fouling and ease for cleaning. This SBIR program aims to
develop a spray assembly technology to fabricate highly cross-linked TFN
membranes on a porous support.
