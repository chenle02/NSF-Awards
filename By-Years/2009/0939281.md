This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled "NUE: Nanophotonics Modules for Diverse Curricular Incorporation", at
SUNY at Buffalo under the direction of Dr. Albert H. Titus, focuses on the
development of nanophotonics educational modules with an emphasis on how the
resulting technologies apply to sustainability and quality of life: e.g., solar
cells, high efficiency lighting, environmental sensing, and other lower powered
optoelectronic devices. The nanophotonics Knowledge Modules (KM) will explain
the necessary basic fundamental scientific knowledge and the Application Modules
(AM) will allow students to acquire hands-on experience while simultaneously
providing the critical link to how technology can contribute to sustainability.
In addition, these modules will be designed to be easily tailored to different
levels of academic preparation. The developed modules will be used within SUNY
at Buffalo's outreach program to students within high needs inner-city schools
in the Buffalo Public Schools system.&lt;br/&gt;
