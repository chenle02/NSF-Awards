This workshop is bringing together experts from different disciplines, including
computer scientists, computational chemists and atmospheric chemists to discuss
protocols that may lead to development of an artificial organic chemist capable
of accurately predicting complex environmental chemistry in non-ideal multiphase
systems. The goal of the workshop is to identify strategies that capitalize on
computational approaches to solve complex chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
participants of the workshop include 20-25 researchers, representing a cross-
section across multiphase chemistry and computation, to identify critical open
questions in computational chemistry for multiphase systems, as well as to
formulate protocols for answering those questions. Topics to be included include
discussions on the best combination of experiments involving theory, numerical
simulations (e.g. modeling of statistical mechanics and density functional
theory), and laboratory and field experimentation to test deep learning
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
