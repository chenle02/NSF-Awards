The process of animal domestication often causes profound changes in fear-
related behaviors, with domesticated populations becoming substantially less
fearful than their wild ancestors. The evolution of reduced fearfulness occurs
in numerous domesticated vertebrates, including birds, mammals, and fish, but
very little is known about the genetic changes that drive this process. Are the
genetic changes that occur during domestication always the same, or are there
many different genetic paths leading to the same behavioral outcome? To address
this question, researchers must first identify the genes that regulate fear
related behaviors in vertebrates. The proposed research uses genetic techniques
to identify the genes that are responsible for differences in fear-related
behaviors among wild and domesticated populations of zebrafish. In addition to
being an important biomedical model, the zebrafish is also emerging as a
powerful model in behavior genetics. The results of this research will be
important in many contexts, including the study of molecular mechanisms of
behavioral evolution, the genetic basis of complex behaviors, and the effective
conservation of captively reared species. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The issue
of captive rearing is particularly relevant to the Native American tribes of
Idaho and the Northwest because of the Tribe's close economic and cultural ties
to salmon fisheries. To increase participation of Native American Students in
the sciences, this research program will host two Native American high school
students in the lab each summer.
