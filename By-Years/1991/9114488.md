This proposal requests funding for an international workshop to be held in Maine
in October 1991. The workshop will bring together natural and social scientists
from the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom with a common
interest in studying past human use of terrestrial and marine resources, and
adaptation to the changing climate in the North Atlantic region. This workshop
will provide an opportunity for addressing methodological and integrative
research problems involving cooperative work by zooarchaeologists,
ethnographers, paleobotanists and landscape archaeologists.
