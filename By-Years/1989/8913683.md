The classification of stars according to their optical spectra is an important
and time honored part of astronomical research. The spectra give information
about the stars' temperatures, compositions, evolutionary stages, absolute
brightnesses, and distances. Much of what we know about stellar evolution and
Galactic dynamics is based on the information contained in spectral catalogues
of stars. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue with her work,
currently funded by NSF, on the two-dimensional classification of stars from
Harvard's Henry Draper (HD) Catalogue. To date, 130,000 stars have been
classified and their spectral types published under the title Michigan Spectral
Catalogue. In the current proposal, the PI intends to classify stars for Volume
5 of the catalogue, all of which lie in the Southern Hemisphere; and to start
the classification of stars for Volume 6. Undergraduate and graduate students
will participate, though the crucial task of classifying the stars according to
their spectra will be done exclusively by the PI in order to maintain
uniformity.
