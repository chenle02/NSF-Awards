This research examines the causes and consequences of military practices in
contact-era highland New Guinea. Drawing on data from 180 societies, the project
will use a regional comparative methodology to examine how military practices
are affected by physical, demographic, social and cultural conditions, and how
military practice influences settlement patterns, social structure, local
community formation, gender ideology, clan structure, art and ritual production.
The investigator, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Maine, will
consult archival materials in Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Papua New
Guinea, and the U.S. The project represents a major synthesis of our knowledge
of the peoples and cultures of this area of the world. The research will result
in a computerized textual database of 180 New Guinea societies, and two
computerized, coded databases, usable by other researchers, of quantitative and
qualitative information for about 1,500 local communities. This research is
important because it will advance our understanding of how tribal warfare
differs from modern or `civilized` war. The knowledge created by this research
will be a valuable resource for commentators who wish to discuss the role of
warfare and the nature of humankind.
