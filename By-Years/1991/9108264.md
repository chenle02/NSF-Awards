David Waldeck is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to study solvent-solute interactions and their influence on
solute reorientation in solution. Waldeck will employ a number of unique non-
linear spectroscopic techniques to measure the rotational correlation function
of the solute. These experiments will be used to gain important inights into the
orientation and temporal evolution of the solute-solvent complex, and the
frictional forces which a solute molecule experiences in solution. %%%
Successful completion of these studies will result in an improved molecular
level understanding of solute-solvent friction, the motion of solute molecules
in solution, and the effects of solute-solvent interactions on chemical
reactivity.
