The primary goal of this research program is to provide the evidence needed to
develop a mean field theory that will have strong predictive power throughout
the nuclear landscape from stable to the limits of stability. The research will
exploit the premier new radioactive beam facilities, namely ATLAS-CARIBU at
Argonne, ReA3/NSCL at Michigan State University, TRIUMF/ISAC2 and CERN/ISOLDE in
Geneva in order to probe unusual nuclear structure phenomena in unexplored
regions of nuclei far from stability. Electromagnetic excitation (Coulomb
excitation) and nucleon transfer reactions will be the experimental probes
emphasized in the research. The program will open new research opportunities as
well as provide a foundation enabling full exploitation of the FRIB facility now
under construction at Michigan State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group
will continue making important technical contributions to nuclear science. Prior
examples such as heavy-ion detectors CHICO and Bambino, as well as contributions
to the gamma-ray detector arrays Gammasphere, GRETINA/GRETA, and the techniques
of Coulomb excitation, heavy-ion induced transfer, and fission-fragment
spectroscopy, are the culmination of many years of effort at Rochester. A new
generation heavy-ion detector, CHICO2 will be developed in order to achieve the
ultimate resolution with the next generation high-resolution gamma-ray tracking
detector systems GRETINA/GRETA and TIGRESS. Such detector systems will provide a
resolving power that is orders of magnitude better than currently available,
enabling studies that at present are inaccessible to nuclear science. Besides
having an enormous impact on nuclear science, the potential impact of such
gamma-ray tracking and imaging detectors has a wide range of applications to
science, medicine, industry, and nuclear safeguards. The proposed research and
detector development programs are an ideal environment for graduate and post-
doctoral education.
