9523113 Espinosa The proposed research deals with a combined experimental and
theoretical approach using impact loading to study the influence of
microstructural features on failure of ceramics. The experimental approach uses
novel plate and impact experiments where the magnitude and duration of stress
pulses can be selected so that the damage event is stable and its evolution can
be monitored under well defined deformation histories. As a result, damage
evolution rather than final accumulated damage can be identified. These results
will form the basis for comprehensive understanding of the processes occurring
during inelastic deformation and formulation of physically based constitutive
equations. Interferometrically measured velocity histories will be used in the
examination of formulated models. Correlation between measured and numerically
computed velocity histories will be accomplished by performing numerical
simulations of the experiments with inelastic models accounting for the observed
failure mechanisms. ***
