Travagli, Alberto 0235741&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vagus nerve plays a major
role in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility and secretion as well as
pancreatic secretory functions such as insulin and proteins. Previous studies
suggest that, apart from nutritional factors, the control of insulin and protein
secretion might be controlled by different neuronal factors. Recent studies have
reported diverse morphological and electrophysiological features of the
brainstem neurons that originate the vagus nerve. These features appear to be
associated with specific gastrointestinal functions. Preliminary data suggest
that also brainstem neurons projecting to the pancreas might comprise
populations that can be distinguished by their pharmacological features. In
addition, electrophysiological and morphological differences also exist within
those neurons projecting to the pancreas. Until now, these pharmacological,
morphological and electrophysiological features have not been correlated with
specific pancreatic functions. In order to provide a more thorough understanding
of the role of this nucleus in the control and regulation of pancreatic
function, the pharmacological properties of DMV neurons with their morphological
and membrane properties will be examined. &lt;br/&gt;These experiments will
combine state-of-the-art electrophysiological recording from pancreas-projecting
identified neurons in brainstem slices with pharmacological tests and
morphological reconstructions. The results of these studies will provide new
insights into the processing of information directed at the control of
pancreatic functions and contribute to our understanding of the
neurophysiological substrates of the control of pancreatic function.&lt;br/&gt;
