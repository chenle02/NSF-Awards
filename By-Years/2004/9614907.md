ABSTRACT OPP-9614927 OPP-9614907 ALLEY, RICHARD FAWCETT, PETER PENNSYLVANIA
STATE UNIVERSITY NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY This research project uses a
mesoscale climate model in conjunction with a General Circulation Model (GCM) to
examine the cause of two extremely rapid coolings that have been found in
paleoclimate records of the Northern Hemisphere. Those coolings cannot be
explained by the same mechanisms that account for the major glacial episodes and
represent an important clue to the way that climate change occurs. The modeling
effort will be validated using the paleoclimate record recovered recently from
the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two ice cores taken near the summit of the
Greenland ice cap. The results of this study will enhance the knowledge of
climate system feedback mechanisms that could produce a rapid, dramatic shift in
Northern Hemisphere temperatures and a drop in global sealevel that would affect
human activities around the world.
