This award supports the Workshop on Model Reduction for Reactive Flows held at
the University of Notre Dame on March 30-April 2, 2009. The principal theme of
the workshop is mode reduction for combustion modeling in the presence of
advection and diffusion. Development of rationally deduced models of low
dimension for this situation would be of transformational importance for the
direct numerical simulation of most practical engineering combustion devices
(such as gas turbine combustors and internal combustion engines) and predictive
modeling of critical engineering systems. The goal of the workshop is to promote
interactions among a diverse group of researchers, including applied
mathematicians, scientists and engineers.

The workshop encourages and supports broad participation by students, postdocs,
and junior faculty.
