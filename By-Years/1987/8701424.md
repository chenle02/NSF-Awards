A multisource sputtering system with in-situ characterization capabilities
useful for the preparation of thin films and superlattices will be acquired.
Some of the problems to be studied with this apparatus are; basic processes
important in thin films growth including the study of the effect of growth
parameters on the structure and physical properties of thin films and
superlattices; effects of controlled roughness on the structure of thin films
and superlattices; a variety of superconducting problems, including dimensional
studies and development of ultrahigh critical field materials; magnetism,
especially studies related to magnetic anisotropy, DC magnetization and
ferromagnetic resonance; transport properties both in the perpendicular and
parallel direction and development and study of the optical properties of
multilayers in the soft x-ray range. This type of an instrument is a must for
any of the studies here. The principal investigator is well known for his
research in the preparation of thin films and multilayered materials while at
Argonne National Laboratory
