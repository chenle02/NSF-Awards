This is an award to provide partial support for a comprehensive study of issues
in waste management that impact on the environmental quality of the urban
coastal waters of the United States. Issues to be addressed by the Water Science
Technology Board of the National Research Council in this study, include the
effects on coastal water quality produced both by point discharges of wastes and
pollutants from diffuse, non-point sources. Effects to be considered include
biostimulation of nuisance organisms and aquatic plants, the excessive growth
and presence of which degrades coastal water quality and factors that directly
impact on environmental quality and public health. Additional support for this
project is expected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state and
local governmental agencies, and from the National Academy of Engineering. This
project is expected to provide a basis for determining research needed for more
appropriate utilization of coastal waters in management of waste discharges.
This is likely to include a search for innovative processes and systems to
prepare wastes for ocean placement; better models of diffusion, dispersion and
pollutant interactions as they are affected by physical, chemical and biological
processes to determine their environmental effects; for determining the
placement of pollution abatement facilities and their engineering design; and
engineering systems for response to normal and accidental discharge of
pollutants from marine vessels.
