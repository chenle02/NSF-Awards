Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists and biologists who are carrying out frontier research. The
Department of Chemistry at the University of South Carolina at Columbia will use
this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation and
Instrument Development Program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.
The areas of research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1)
Multinuclear magnetic resonance studies of Group 14 organometallic compounds 2)
Synthesis of natural products 3) Interactions between cytochrome P-450-CAM and
camphor derivatives 4) Conformational dynamics of selected binary and ternary
complexes of thymidylate synthase 5) Studies of proton spin lattice relaxation
times as a definitive method of distinguishing classical from nonclassical
structures in transition-metal hydrides 6) Synthesis of macrocycles.
