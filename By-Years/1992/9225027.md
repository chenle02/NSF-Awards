Theoretical research will explore the physical properties of strongly
interacting many-electron systems. The problems of superconductivity near a
metal-insulator transition and the competition between various types of
correlations will be studied. A common feature of these problems is the need for
non-perturbative procedures such as numerical simulation or infinite-order
diagrammatic approximations. The research aims at combining numerical
simulations and analytic many-body techniques with the goal of providing
quantitative results as well as physical understanding of strongly correlated
electron materials. %%% The research will combine sophisticated numerical
techniques with advanced analytical ones to address the underlying physics of
strongly interacting electron systems such as are found in high temperature
superconductors. The group of the principal investigator is one of the leading
ones in the world for computational physics.
