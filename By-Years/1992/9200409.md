A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site involving six students will be
supported by this award. Their work will focus on carefully selected problems in
applied probability. Students will be expected to combine collaborative and
individual efforts in their research. At the end of the summer, the group will
travel to a professional meeting such as the Institute for Mathematical
Statistics/American Statistical Association joint meetings. Students are
expected to prepare written reports summarizing their work, many of which should
lead to publishable papers. They will be encouraged to present their findings
either at meetings or at their home institutions. The theme of the research is
that of discrete probability structures such as occurrence patterns and runs,
competition models or occupancy problems. Principal focus will be on the
application of the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation, but students will
also consider Gaussian limits and other non- Poisson approximations.
