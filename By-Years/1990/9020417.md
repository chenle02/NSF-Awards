Practically all plants and animals show seasonal breeding, wherein young are
produced at defined periods of the year. Much is known about the physiology that
initiates seasonal reproduction, but relatively little is known about the
ecological forces that cause animals to restrict breeding to a particular time
of the year. It has long been assumed that animals time production of young so
that they meet a favorable environment for growth and survival. Information on a
wide variety of birds, however, suggest that young produced early in the season
have substantially greater success than young produced later in the season. This
calls to question the traditional view that breeding seasons for birds are timed
so that young hatch at the optimal time of the year. In particular, why
production of young does not occur earlier in the season is of interest. This
research is designed to answer that question by altering the date of hatch in
two colonial waterbirds, Herring Gulls and Forster's Terns. To interpret
experiments that alter hatch dates, the effects of reduced incubation periods
must be understood. Information on the influence of shortened incubation can be
of immediate value to conservation biologists and managers working on threatened
birds. Colonial waterbirds are a particularly vulnerable group because coastal
islands are one of their preferred nesting habitats, yet these are favored sites
for human recreation and development. Egg manipulations that shorten incubation
periods and reduce a vulnerable phase of the nesting cycle are one form of
intensive management that have great potential for increasing production from
wild populations.
