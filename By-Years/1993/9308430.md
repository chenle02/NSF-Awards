9308430 Sinha In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Prof. A. Sinha of the University of California at San Diego will
conduct a research program to study the influence of molecular vibrations on the
chemical reactivity of polyatomic molecules. The effect of specific vibrational
modes in bimolecular reactions will be investigated by exciting vibrational
states of reagent molecules having similar energy, and observing the
consequences of this initial state selection on the reaction rate, the product
quantum state distributions, and the product branching ratios. This will be
accomplished by using several different laser excitation schemes to prepare
vibrational states corresponding to a wide range of nuclear motion in small
polyatomic molecules and then monitoring their subsequent reactions with various
radicals by detecting the reaction products using laser spectroscopy. %%% The
study of chemical reactions and their associated reaction dynamics stands at the
forefront of contemporary physical chemistry. The goal of the present study is
to understand how various molecular vibrations having similar total energy but
corresponding to different intramolecular distribution of the excitation
influence chemical reactivity. Measurements in which the excited states are
fully resolved yield data which allow detailed comparisons with current
theoretical models and promise to provide new insights into the factors that
influence selectivity in chemical reactions. ***
