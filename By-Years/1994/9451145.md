9451145 Edmunds This project supports an upper division laboratory-based
physiological ecology course in the life sciences. Major goals are emphasized,
including a unifying of the diversity of organismic adaptations with focus on
energy budgets and resource acquisition; the linking between genes, enzymes,
proteins, organisms, populations and the environment; providing hypothesis
driven laboratory exercises, experimental design and analysis, as well as an
introduction to contemporary instrumentation. The project has expanded the
laboratory component of the course, is disseminating the results of the program
through a laboratory manual, provides pre-service and in-service teacher
training workshops, undergraduate research, and local scientific conferences.
