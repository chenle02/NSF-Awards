Dr. Fuller is examining the attempts by the social sciences to establish their
professional standards and disciplinary boundaries. Dr. Fuller argues that the
social sciences did this by consciously imitating the examples of the natural
sciences. In order to establish this position, Dr. Fuller will examine
historical accounts of the debates over the scientific status of the social
sciences, especially anthropology, sociology, political science, economics and
psychology. He will use as sources the so-called canonical histories, namely,
ones written by disciplinary practitioners with an eye toward justifying the
course that the discipline's development has taken. The success of such
histories necessarily involves the persuasive reconstruction of the past that is
the purview of the rhetorician. He will sample canonical histories of each of
the disciplines from different periods in the last 100 years. Dr. Fuller will
undertake this study under the guidance of Dr. Donald McCloskey, an economist
who has pioneered the study of the role of rhetoric in the development of the
social sciences.
