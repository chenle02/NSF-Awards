The Board of Mathematical Sciences provides a locus of activity at the National
Research Council for issues affecting the mathematical sciences. It represents
the mathematical sciences to the National Academy of Sciences, and provides it,
government agencies, and the mathematical sciences community a forum for
discussion of important issues. The Board itself consists of fifteen members
representing the broad spectrum of mathematics. Operationally, the Board
undertakes studies and produces reports and recommendations involving
mathematical sciences, and in general plays an active, crucial role in policy
formation and in the scientific life of the field.
