A variety of problems in both medical diagnostics and nondestructive testing of
materials requires the reconstruction of a portion or cross section of an object
without directly viewing its interior. Tomographic imaging techniques allow
noninvasive/nondestructive studies which minimize patient trauma and cost in the
medical domain, and reduce manufacturing and maintenance expenses for many
industries by transforming external measurements into images of the interior of
the patient or object. The established methods for computing tomographic images
in common examples such as x-ray CT scanning are inadequate for difficult cases
involving a shortage of data or great uncertainty in their precise values due to
inherent error in measurements. For these problems, algorithms are needed which
explicitly take into account the characteristics of the measurement errors as
well as common behavior of the tissue or materials under study. Much improvement
has resulted from statistical methods such as Bayesian tomographic estimation,
but conventional estimation techniques, based on homogeneous random field models
and fixed optimization strategies, seem to be approaching their limits of
improvement. This project is developing three principal innovations to improve
the capabilities of tomographic systems, with particular focus on three-
dimensional applications: (1) nonhomogeneous image cross section models which
allow spatially varying image characteristics to be accurately estimated using a
simple multiscale estimation procedure; (2) fast nonlinear optimization
algorithms for minimizing the nonquadratic functions that result from MAP
estimation with nonGaussian prior models; (3) a novel approach to tomographic
reconstruction based on nonlinear, non-iterative estimation from back projection
data. This research is applicable to the full range of emission and transmission
tomographic problems, with particular experimental focus on 3D medical emission
tomography.
