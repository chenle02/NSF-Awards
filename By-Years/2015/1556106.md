Adopting a new way to address an existing question often yields new insights or
answers. This project focuses on hemiparasites - plants that obtain resources
both by making their own via photosynthesis and by stealing resources from the
roots of other plants - to understand direct and indirect effects between plants
and their herbivores. The novel twist here is that plants mediate interactions
among different trophic levels, determining how a plant parasite affects a plant
predator and vice versa. The research will have direct application to the
management and recovery of two rare species: the hemiparasite is federally
listed as threatened and the herbivore is an endangered butterfly. The
investigators will partner with federal and state agencies to restore both
species. This research will also provide research training to a post-doctoral
research associate, a graduate student, and an undergraduate student. All will
be actively mentored in responsible conduct of research, field and lab data
collection, analysis, and outreach.

The organisms used in this study co-occur in grasslands of the Pacific Northwest
US. Experimental mesocosms will be assembled that contain host plants,
hemiparasites, and herbivores. Mesocosms will contain high or low numbers of
plant species that can serve as hosts for hemiparasites. Hemiparasitism will be
manipulated among plants, and herbivores will be allowed to feed on the
hemiparasites in a subset of the mesocosms. Hemiparasite survival, biomass, and
secondary chemistry will be measured to determine how they are affected by host
community composition, and herbivore performance will be related to host plant
community and to hemiparasite resources. Stable isotopes will be used to track
fluxes of carbon and nitrogen from the host plant community to the
hemiparasites, and through the hemiparasites to their herbivores. The research
will exploit an ecologically understudied situation in which plants function
both as producers and as consumers to provide new insights into how multi-
trophic interactions structure ecosystems.
