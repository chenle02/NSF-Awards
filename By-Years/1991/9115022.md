This award will support a Topical Conference on Time-Dependent Positioning:
Modeling Crustal Motion. Topical conferences are sponsored by the American
Geophysical Union and are designed to promote opportunities not normally
available through the format of large meetings. The topic to time-dependent
positioning spreads into a variety of disciplines, including geophysics,
seismology, tectonophysics, geodesy, volcanology, hydrology, and global climate
change. The conference objective is to bring these disciplines, together to
discuss new modeling techniques used in the geosciences, and to review and
evaluate concrete results from these related fields.
