The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) Working Group on
Women in Physics is undertaking an international benchmarking effort to learn
about the status and trends relating to women in physics internationally and it
is organizing an International Conference on Women in Physics to be held in
Paris, France in March 2002. Funds from the National Science Foundation will
support part of the benchmarking effort, the analysis and publication of its
results, the participation of US physicists - especially students and early-
career physicists - in the conference, the publication and dissemination of the
conference proceedings and action plan, and some follow up. These NSF funds will
be supplemented by other grants and in-kind contributions from other Federal
agencies, scientific organizations, international sources, and industry.
Essentially this same proposal is being sent to the US Department of Energy
(DOE) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), with
complementary but not overlapping budget requests. The National Academy of
Sciences has already committed to provide $25K in general, unrestricted support,
and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has committed
$10K.
