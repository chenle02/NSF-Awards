Multi-rate control systems (digital control systems with more than one sample or
hold rate) appear often. Their practical importance as well as their complexity
mandate the use of computers in the design process. We have developed a lifting
isomorphism theory for multi-rate systems. We have shown that it is
comprehensive in application and perfectly suited to computer aided control
design by convex optimization (Q'-Design'). The objective of research is to
continue research toward a complete robustness theory and Q- Design methodology
that will supplement and eventually replace many currently used heuristic multi-
rate design techniques.
