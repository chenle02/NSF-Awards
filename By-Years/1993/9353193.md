9353193 Lamb The purpose of this proposal is to expand and enhance the research
capabilities in the Department of Chemistry through the use of nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) technology. A superconducting, multinuclear, 300 MHz NMR
instrument with two-dimensional, variable temperature, and solid-state
capabilities is requested and will provide a base for long-term cooperative
research with Greensboro Consortium Institutes (Bennett College, Guilford
College, and University of North Carolina at Greensboro) and industries in the
Greensboro area. The 300 MHz NMR will be an integral research instrument for
determining structural elucidation and structural conformation of synthetic
organic molecules, synthetic ligands, organometallic complexes (hemocyanin
models and molybdenum complexes), and protein (phospholipases). Kinetic studies
of molybdenum complex formation, keto-enol equilibria and the catalytic activity
of the human placental phospholipase A2 isoenzyme will also be conducted. ***
