This research involves numerical simulation of two-phase flows, in order to gain
insight into the details of the interaction between phases. The two phases are
liquid and gas, in particular the interaction between bubbles and the
surrounding liquid, the interaction between bubbles, and the interaction between
bubbles and bounding walls. The technique will be full numerical simulation in
three-dimensions of the governing partial differential equations, combined the
with special techniques to track and model interface configurations. The
investigation will provide essential information on fundamental mechanisms in
multi-phase flows, which is necessary for modeling of such flows as commonly
encountered in various engineering systems.
