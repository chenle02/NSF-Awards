This project is a continuation of a series of studies that focuses on the phase
equilibria and thermodynamics of important mineral systems. The current project
emphasizes studies on biotite, ferrosilite, esseneite, Fe-Ti oxides, ternary
feldspars, and Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates using reversed phase equilibrium experiments
followed by thermodynamic solution modelling of the results. This research will
ultimately have application in constraining the intensive parameters (e.g.,
temperature and pressure) under which igneous and metamorphic rocks
crystallized.
