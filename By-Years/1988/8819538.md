The National Academy of Sciences will establish a Panel on model-assimilated
data sets for atmospheric and oceanic research that would operate under the
auspices of the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate. The task of the Panel
will be to prepare a report that covers the following: 1. Objectives for an
integrated national program for the production and dissemination of research-
quality model- assimilated data sets. 2. Strategies for improving operational
capabilities for production and dissemination of research-quality data sets.
This work is important because it seeks to provide researchers with the kind of
information necessary to study the complicated processes that control and
regulate the earth system.
