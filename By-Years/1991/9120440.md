The characteristics of most metal surfaces are known to display strong
deviations from the bulk. The interlayer spacing, the periodicity of atoms in a
layer, the localized vibrational modes, and anisotropy and enhanced
anharmonicity in the vibrational amplitudes are some attributes which may
distinguish the surface atoms from those in the bulk crystal. The main objective
of this theoretical grant is to isolate the effects of surface anharmonicity on
the structure and dynamics of several technologically and fundamentally
important clean metals and metal- on-metal systems. The study will consist of
computer simulations using the molecular dynamics technique and interatomic
potentials from the embedded atom method. %%% The research will explore
properties of metal surfaces and of metal-metal interfaces to distinguish the
effects of surface anharmonicities on surface and bulk properties. Close
interaction will be maintained with experimental groups. The research results
will be of importance to many applications where metal surfaces are important,
i.e., electronics, corrosion, etc.
