This purpose of this project is to investigate the influence of Federal R&D on
both the level of private R&D spending in industrial R&D laboratories and the
composition of their R&D output. Using firm level data, the authors test
empirically the theoretical propositions that 1) the more a company must share
its R&D-produced technical knowledge, the smaller is the benefit to the company
of self-financed R&D (i.e., the appropriability question); 2) Federal R&D
complements private R&D; 3) an increase in company-financed R&D, with fixed
levels of Government industr- ial R&D funding, results in a decrease in the
level of public sharing of the R&D-produced knowledge; and 4) the degree to
which firms share their technical knowledge depends to some extent on
Government's criteria for funding industrial R&D. The results should provide
further understanding of the Federal role in promoting industrial R&D activities
and economic growth. The project thereby will contribute to the Foundation's
responsibility to provide a source of information for policy formulation in the
area of science and technology.
