Advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between
computers and human society. Yet as socio-technical systems have grown in
complexity, their underlying computational models have become increasingly
difficult for people to express, manipulate, and understand. For example, when
users put data into a system, they may not be able to anticipate or control how
their data will be used by other people or by software in the system. Similarly,
when software developers create a new system that is designed to be secure, it
is difficult for them to foresee all the ways that attackers will try to
compromise that system. Such problems are complicated by the fact that a
system's software often contains defects and that different users or agents
might simultaneously take actions toward different goals. The research community
has provided numerous methods, models, and tools to help users understand,
create, and manipulate socio-technical systems. At an even deeper level, other
research aims to develop new theories sufficient for understanding the
complicated, unstable, and sometimes emergent behavior that results when large
numbers of diverse, unpredictable humans are coupled to unreliable software.

This award aims to advance knowledge and understanding of solutions to these
problems by supporting the Graduate Consortium at this year's IEEE Conference on
Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC). VL/HCC is the premier
international forum for research on the design, theory, application, and
evaluation of computing technologies and programming languages that are easy for
people to learn, use, and understand. The conference focuses on enabling more
people to apply the tools of programming in a variety of domains, which makes it
an important context to explore adaptable and customizable socio-technical
systems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
