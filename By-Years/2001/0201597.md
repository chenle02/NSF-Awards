AST-0201597 Markoff, Sera

Dr. Markoff is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at MIT's Center for
Space Research. She will conduct a theoretical and observational study of
astrophysical jets, twin outflows of relativistic plasma formed and expelled
near the event horizons of accreting black holes. She will develop models for
predicting the contribution of jets to the broadband spectra of stellar X-ray
binaries and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, which are orders of
magnitude apart in mass, but close in scaled power. Her participation in
observational campaigns will provide data for testing these predictions and the
underlying similarities between the engines that drive jets of stellar and
galactic scale. Her program of research will address fundamental outstanding
questions pertaining to jets, such as their formation and matter content. She
will incorporate her research into a new educational unit for classrooms
participating in Project Astro and for an exhibit for the Boston Museum of
Science, Current Science and Technology Center. She also plans to teach
associated courses at the Museum and at local teachers' professional development
workshops. ***
