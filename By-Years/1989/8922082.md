This award will support detailed studies of contemporary climate, hydrology,
limnology, and sedimentology in high arctic meromictic lakes in order to
characterize the nature of modern sediment influx and deposition in relation to
contemporary climate. These process studies will be conducted in coordination
with recovering cores of laminated lake sediments from the meromictic lakes. The
sediments will be studied to determine if the laminations represent annual
increments and if they can be related to recent climatic conditions in the area.
If so, longer sedimentary records will be used to reconstruct past climate in
the region. Since there are few sources of paleoclimatic data with annual
resolution from the high arctic, this study will evaluate the potential of using
laminated lake sediments for high resolution paleoclimatic reconstruction.
