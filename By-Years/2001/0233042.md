This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess the
technical and commercial feasibility of SoftPDA, a wireless software platform
for enterprise applications. The platform is focused on modeling business
processes and automating business critical tasks for wireless device users. As a
result of this approach, the platform addresses some of the well-known
deficiencies of wireless devices. Such deficiencies have made wireless devices
clumsy or inappropriate for compute-intensive tasks. The result of this research
will be detailed design of that platform along with the algorithms necessary to
enable it. The results of have applicability to a wide base of mobile
professionals utilizing wireless devices to conduct business, including sales
personnel, executives, consultant, attorneys, and finanical personnel engaged in
any business enterprise. The results are also relevant to mobile workers in
vertical markets such as field service and medicine.
