9313038 Enright The main thrust of this research is to explore the properties
of a type of working short-term memory involved in sensorimotor processing.
Motor responses such as redirecting the eyes or pointing with a finger can be
made not only toward objects actually seen, but also toward rememberd object
locations. Dr. Enright's experiments will uncover details of how these two kinds
of movements are performed. These studies will help deteremine the validity of
our current understanding, derived from neurophysiological studies, of how the
visual world is mapped within the brain and how information in visual maps is
held for a time to be used in guiding behavior. This work will have direct
bearing on our knowledge of human sensory perception and motor planning -- both
of which are essential for attempts to optimize human interaction with the
environment. ***
