This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project's objective is to
overcome the drawbacks of existing imaging sensor designs, and to demonstrate a
novel video camera design concept. Named the Super-Eye, this camera is able to
provide simultaneously both large depth of field the dynamic scene and selective
high-resolution video images for the object of interest. The unique advantages
of the proposed Super-Eye concept include: (a) achieving simultaneous high image
resolution and large depth of field; (b) Intelligent guidance of the high-
resolution image channel; and (c) 3D Modeling Capability.

The requirements for high image resolution, large depth of field, and wide field
of view are applicable to both the commercial and military markets. The security
surveillance market has experience near double-digit growth and is expected to
maintain this growth in light of the events of 9/11. Security cameras are
roughly 30 percent of the $100 billion global security industry.
