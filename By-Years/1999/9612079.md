This research projects deals with control of the start-up and shut-down of
boilers in uncertain time-varying systems such as power plants using robust
predictive control techniques and localized time-frequency concepts.
Specifically, it develops strategies for synthesis of suboptimal robust
controllers of reduced computational complexity. Such control algorithms serves
as enabling technologies for the next generation operating regimes for power
plants as well as a guide for the future control-driven power plant designing
and other complex mechanical systems. The approach utilizes an extension of
H-infinity productive control methodology, and a method of evaluation and
representation of unmodeled plant dynamics to time varying case. On this basis
it develops a new time-frequency localized framework for robust predictive
control of time-varying plants which utilizes the wavelet-based complexity
reduction o the computation of control laws, and reduction in controller
conservativeness due to the time-frequency localized representation of model
uncertainty.
