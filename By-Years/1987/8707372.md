This is a Research Planning Grant in the Research Opportunities for Women
Program. The objective of the proposed research is to use photo-hall effect
analysis and electric field profiling techniques to study the time-,
temperature-, and field- dependence of transport in high electrical resistivity
semiconductors. This analysis is expected to provide a more fundamental
understanding of transport behavior in these materials, and allow the effects of
space charge relaxation, persistent photoconductivity, and deep level trapping
to be distinguished. This work will advance the effort to properly analyze high
resistivity material semiconductors, and will provide experimental data that can
be compared to existing theoretical predictions. Important implications for
electrical contacts to these high resistivity semicondctors can be expected,
since space charge effects are always present in the near contact region.
