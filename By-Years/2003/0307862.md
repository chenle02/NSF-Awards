Each month, the American Institute of Physics (AIP) will produce twelve,
90-second television news reports that demonstrate the relevance of research to
society, including animated descriptions of the underlying science principles.
The peer-reviewed reports are offered for sale on an exclusive basis to one
station in each of the 211 principal television markets. The service currently
has 84 subscribers with the potential to reach approximately 62% of the total US
television households. AIP is actively seeking additional stations that will
purchase the service. They have plans for the service to become self-sustaining
when 170 stations become subscribers. AIP has a working coalition with numerous
scientific societies including American Geological Institute, American
Mathematical Society, American Meteorological Society, American Society for
Mechanical Engineers, and Universities Research Association. The television
production staff relies on story ideas provided by the range of scientists
represented in these societies as well as from journal articles, university
press releases, and other findings from research institutions. Once a treatment
is developed for a story, outside science experts are asked to review it for
accuracy and to comment on its validity and reliability. A "Know More" web
component offers audiences an opportunity to find out more information about a
science story.
