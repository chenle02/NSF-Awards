9614558 Wang The PI proposes to experimentally determine rock poroelastic
properties by utilizing existing and newly developed laboratory techniques. The
laboratory data are needed for studying coupled stress-pore pressure processes
in rocks, which are important in applications in geophysics, hydrology, and
petroleum engineering. An experimental database will be developed to address the
Biot theory premise that pore pressure is not coupled with shear strain, and
experiments will investigate the dependence of poroelastic moduli on pore
pressure and confining pressure, the general variations of poroelastic moduli
with rock type, and the relationships between poroelastic moduli and
micromechanical properties. The research should provide a solid experimental
basis for poroelastic modeling of geophysical phenomena in the earth's upper
crust. ***
