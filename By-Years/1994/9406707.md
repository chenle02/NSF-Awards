9406707 Sheridan It is well known that the pancreas produces hormones that
regulate such critical processes as metabolism, development, and growth. The
best known pancreatic hormones are insulin and glucagon. Recent studies have
shown the existence of multiple forms of somatostatin, a peptide hormone
originally isolated from the brain and found to inhibit growth hormone release
from the pituitary gland, but subsequently found to be located in the pancreas,
gastrointestinal tract, and elsewhere of many animals. The special significance
of the multiple forms of somatostatin and the roles these factors play in
coordinating aspects of metabolism, growth, and development remain to be
determined. With this project, Dr. Sheridan will evaluate how somatostatin
influences, directly and/or indirectly (via interactions with other pancreatic
factors such as insulin), lipid metabolism in fish. Specifically, he will
determine in what tissues and through what specific cellular processes
somatostatin influences fat uptake and breakdown. In addition, he will
distinguish the actions of two pancreatic somatostatin forms (the co- existence
of which is unique to fish). These results will contribute significantly to the
overall understanding of how metabolism is regulated and provide important
insight into the evolution of somatostatin action. ***
