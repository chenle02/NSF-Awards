The new Electric Energy Systems (EES) Laboratory brings modern digital concepts,
presented the most electrical engineering students in only a signal or
information processing context, into an electric energy/power laboratory.
Personal computer and special purpose microprocessors are used for recording,
processing, and displaying on-line data taken from systems controlling and
utilizing electric power. In addition, these computers are also used to actually
control power electronic interface circuits. This new state-of-the-art
laboratory is needed to sustain the energy/power subdiscipline in electrical
engineering education. In particular, the laboratory will deal with three major
areas: 1. Digitally-based power measurements, including signal conditioning,
isolation, and computer manipulation and display of data. 2. Power electronic
devices and interface circuits with control signals derived through both analog
and digital information processing. 3. Electric energy-transferring, consuming,
and conversion devices including transducers and rotating electromechanical
converters. Student acquire a strong background in electric energy-related
areas, pertaining to such application as robotics, machine tool control, and
electric drives for transportation and manufacturing processes. This laboratory
provides this background, though a hardware experience with flow-control, mode-
conversion, and utilization of electric energy using modern digitally-based
instrumentation and modern power-related instructional components.
