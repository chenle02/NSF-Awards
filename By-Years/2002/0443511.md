With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities -
Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at
Washington University will acquire a cluster of dual-processor computer servers;
a file server; workstations for interactive use; and a comprehensive suite of
software to be installed both on the requested hardware plus on machines at the
Washington University Center for Scientific Parallel Computing. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including a) parallel implementation
of Bayesian probability theory applied to NMR data analysis; b) multi-scale
modeling of sol-gel materials; c) chemical-shift computations in solid-state
NMR; d) computational studies to support experiments on isostructural doping of
molecular semiconductors; e) computational studies of molecular electronic
circuit components and in support of surface chemical analyses; and f) molecular
modeling of polymer chain structure and dynamics in the bulk and within domains
of shell crosslinked nanoparticles, also in support of experimental studies.

This equipment will enhance undergraduate and graduate education in the
Chemistry Department through instruction in the theory and practice of modern
computational chemistry. Access to a state-of-the-art computational facility
with a complete range of chemistry software will encourage graduate and
undergraduate researchers to develop expertise with modern computational
methods, which will both enhance their mastery of chemical concepts and
contribute synergistically to their experimental research programs. Two of the
major users will develop cluster-optimized parallel versions of software of
great utility in the analysis of NMR data. These codes will be broadly
disseminated and could make major impacts, given the economy of modern cluster
hardware. Lastly, the investigators' experiences configuring the system and all
workshop and tutorial materials will be posted on the web; this will assist
chemists at other sites in the acquisition and use of similar facilities.
