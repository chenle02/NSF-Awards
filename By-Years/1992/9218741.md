In a number of compressional orogens clognate tabular or sheet-like plutons are
common, yet their tectonic significance or mechanism of emplacement is not well
understood. The crystalline core of the North Cascades (part of the Cretaceous
Coast Plutonic Complex) are dominated by sheet-like plutons and their deformed
wall rocks. This project will evaluate the relationship between emplacement of
these bodies and the regional tectonics in order to understand the links between
magmatism and emplacement mechanisms. Results should be applicable to several
orogens in which sheet-like plutons also are an important part.
