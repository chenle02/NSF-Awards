CBET 1151220/ Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF CAREER award by the
Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program supports the
development of a novel containment strategy for engineered organisms based on
synthetic auxotrophy. Synthetic auxotrophs provide a strategy for mitigating the
risks of accidental environmental release of novel organisms developed using the
tools of synthetic biology. The synthetic auxotrophs developed in this study
will be engineered such that their viability is dependent upon a chemical not
found in nature. Therefore these organisms cannot survive outside the contained
environments to which the synthetic compound has been added. The process for
generating these synthetic auxotrophs involves a novel protein engineering
strategy. It takes a protein critical to the growth of the organism encoded by
an essential gene and rewires its interactions with the cell such that it can
only grows in the presence of the synthetic compound. Along with the development
of containment strategies, the PI will develop an interactive website that
provides context and navigation through the diverse training resources available
on the internet. Based around the idea of a Trail, or a series of related
electronic content, the site will guide students through tutorials, quizzes, and
multimedia content towards mastery of specific subject areas. These subjects
include the technical implementation of synthetic biology, as well as design
theory, basic science, and issues of human practice. Together these efforts
address key unresolved issues of biosafety and training in this field.
