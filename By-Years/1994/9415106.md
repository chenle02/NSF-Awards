The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is the recipient of funds, from the National
Science Foundation, for the renovation of Chase Hall. The Departments of
Biological Systems Engineering and Agricultural Meteorology reside and conduct
research and research training in the 75 year old facility. Critical research
needs, in the areas of global climate change, micrometeorological measurements,
soil and water quality, waste management, and sensing and controls from spatial
and temporal variability, necessitate the renovation of research space for the
departments. Research activities are currently located in dispersed and
inadequate facilities throughout Chase Hall, as well as in the adjacent
Biological Systems Engineering Laboratories. Funding received from the State of
Nebraska and the ARI Program will be used to consolidate and renovate space for
these related research activities in one modern facility. This effort will
foster improved research interaction and facilitate the use of shared equipment
for various interrelated research activities. Five research laboratories slated
to be renovated in this project include: Climate Dynamic Research, Environmental
Instrumentation Research, Sensors and Controls, Bioremediation and Pollution
Prevention, and Advanced Integrated Data Management. Seventeen faculty members,
19 support personnel, 3 post doctoral students, 106 graduate students, and 41
undergraduate students will be the direct beneficiaries of the modernized
facility once completed. In addition, collaborators from other departments
including Geography, Geology, Biological Sciences, Civil Engineering,
Horticulture Science and Entomology, and international colleagues will conduct
research in these laboratories on specific projects. The renovated laboratories
will contribute to increase interdisciplinary research both nationally and
internationally, a major goal of the university.
