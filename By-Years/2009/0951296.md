RNA interference (RNAi) technologies utilize a specific sequence of double-
stranded RNA in order to silence the expression of a particular gene. The term
RNAi also refers to a broad set of conserved mechanisms that allow cells from
most organisms to respond to double-stranded RNA. These mechanisms have vital
endogenous roles in cells, including roles that affect chromatin function. For
example, RNAi mechanisms help establish heterochromatin, a function that is
important in preventing mobilization of transposons. ABC transporters are
transmembrane proteins that act as pumps to transport small molecules across a
membrane bilayer. Many ABC transporter genes are found in most organisms, and
they collectively harbor diverse functions associated with substrate
trafficking. Some transporters alleviate cellular stress by exporting toxic
substances, whereas other transporters traffic specific substrates that are
vital to normal health and development. The substrates trafficked by many
transporters, and their precise functions in cells, have yet to be identified.
During the course of our analysis of RNAi-defective strains of the nematode worm
Caenorhabditis elegans, we observed that some ABC transporter genes are required
for an efficient RNAi response to double-stranded RNA as well as for endogenous
RNAi activities that affect chromatin function. The current project will enable
us to determine how ABC transporters influence RNAi mechanisms. Our work delves
into a novel and as yet unexplored area that links two of the most conserved
mechanisms in biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Intrinsic to our
research goals are projects that will allow for scientific training and career
development of undergraduate and graduate students; students will also be
engaged in outreach opportunities directed toward enhancing scientific literacy
at the K-12 level.&lt;br/&gt;
