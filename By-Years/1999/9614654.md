9614654 Isaak and Anderson The PIs propose to use Resonant Ultrasonic
Spectroscopy (RUS) to study the high temperature elasticity of a suite of
geophysically important minerals synthesized at high pressure. The measurments
will require further development to adapt the RUS technique for high temperature
studies on small samples. Measurements of single-crysals of silicate perovskite
or beta-spinel will be made at room and high temperature, and the high
temperature properties of hematite and magnesiowustite, for which larger samples
are readily attained, will also be completed. The results will be used to
constrain the composition of the earth's mantle. ***
