The Seventh International Conference on Wind Engineering Research will be held
in Aachen, West Germany, July 6-10, 1987. A U.S. team of researchers will
participate in this quadrennial conference by presenting papers and chairing
sessions with the purpose of stimulating and enhancing the quality of the
research conducted in the United States. The Wind Engineering Research Council,
a non profit professional organization, will take the responsibility of
selecting from among applicants, the individuals that will be supported by this
grant. The selection will be based on the quality and level of participation in
the conference. The funds will be administered by Texas Tech University that
will co-share by not imposing overhead charge. The P.I. is highly capable of
carrying out the project, thus an award is recommended.
