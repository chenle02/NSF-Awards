9723679 Williamson The gene Meu1 confers resistance to the potato aphid in
tomato. It is tightly linked to Mi, a single, dominant locus that mediates
resistance to root-knot nemotodes. The projects starts from the recognition that
the two genes are close, but separated by about 300 kb. The project will isolate
Meu1 and characterize the gene product genetically and through transgenic plant
analysis in a multidisciplinary approach. The gene will be obtained by
positional cloning. Action of the gene will be analyzed through assessment of
the aphid response to resistant plants and the response of resistant plants to
aphid feeding. Included is an analysis of the effect of Meu1-mediated resistance
on virus transmission by aphids. This approach unites two laboratories with
emphasis on aphid biology and molecular biology.
