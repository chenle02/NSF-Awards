The proposal is concerned with randomness in number theory .Randomness appears
in many forms when studying diophantine problems and it is sometimes transparent
,with the burden being to establish the expected randomness, while in other
cases discovering the randomness is already a major issue . The specific
settings in which we seek to continue to investigate this phenomenon include
diophantine problems connected with orbits of groups of integral affine
morphisms ,the randomness in the such sequences as the Mobius function and
especially its connection to low complexity dynamical systems ,the randomness in
zeros of families of automorphic L-functions and in the zero sets (nodal lines)
of the corresponding automorphic forms. Understanding the randomness issue is at
the heart of many applications to number theory and arithmetic quantum chaos
.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interplay between number theory and other
areas within mathematics has a long tradition.Many fields within mathematics
were developed in part to solve problems concerning whole numbers and prime
numbers. Naturally these areas continue to play a central role in the theory of
numbers . More recent is the interplay between mathematical physics ,theoretical
computer science and information theory .This cross fertilization is at the
heart of this proposal .For example the modular surface gives perhaps the unique
example of a classically chaotic hamiltonian for which the fine points of its
quantization can be studied.Techniques from statistical physics and especially
random matrix ensembles model precisely the zeros of families of central objects
in number theory called "zeta functions" .Ideas from combinatorics and
theoretical computer science ,notably "expander graphs", play a central role in
understanding some classical number theoretical problems.
