This proposal is for development of an effective hp-adaptive First-Order System
Least-Squares (FOSLS) method for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs)
that may exhibit singularities and other non-smoothness properties. The general
FOSLS methodology is already a powerful tool for the solution of PDE-based
problems in science and engineering. One of its main advantages is that it can
be used to transform a given set of equations into a loosely coupled system of
scalar equations that can be treated easily by multilevel finite elements. The
reformulation is done by recasting the equations as a least-squares principle
associated with a carefully derived first-order system. Another advantage of
FOSLS is that the associated functional itself provides a natural sharp local
error estimator, which can be employed for effective adaptive refinement. In
previous work, the FOSLS methodology was developed and analyzed for problems
that include linear elasticity, linear transport, and incompressible fluid
dynamics. Under standard H2-type smoothness assumptions on the original PDE,
FOSLS has been proved theoretically and numerically to exhibit optimal finite
element and multigrid convergence properties. However, two principal
difficulties currently prevent FOSLS from being applied effectively to more
complicated problems: nonsmooth solutions and nonlinearity. The project aim is
to develop an adaptive weighted-functional coupled with adaptive nested
iteration schemes to treat these difficulties. The goal is to obtain a scheme
that can solve complex nonlinear PDE systems with a total cost equivalent to a
small number of relaxation steps on the finest grid.

Successful completion of this project will enhance our ability to model complex
physical processes on high-end computing platforms. In particular, this project
addresses computational models of coupled fluid/structure interactions that
occur, for example, in biomechanical systems such as blood flow in compliant
vessels. Other areas that could potentially benefit from this project are
aerodynamics, astrophysics, geophysics and meteorology. As modern computer
architectures become more complex, harnessing 10s of thousands of processors
working together on a single, complex problem, it becomes even more important to
develop optimal numerical algorithms. Successful completion of this project will
widen the class of problems for which optimal algorithms exist.
