This research comprises an experimental and analytical investigation of semi
active dampers, a special class of nonlinear, controllable damping actuators for
vibration isolation and disturbance rejection applications. The potential
application areas for semi active damping technology include rotating and impact
machinery, manipulators, bearing dampers, vehicle suspensions, prosthetics,
space structures, and reaction mass devices. Dampers can be one of three types,
active, passive, or semi active. The first is characterized by power input
devices activated by a feedback signal and by power dissipation, the second by
power dissipation only, and the third by power dissipation but also by some of
the same active features as the active damper. Preliminary studies show that the
semi active class performs nearly as well as the more complex, more expensive,
higher power, and higher response time fully active dampers. The research is a
three phase effort, including a theoretical analysis of the nonlinear dynamics
of the damper actuator, the development of control concepts for various
vibration applications of this class of dampers, and design, fabrication and
study of a prototype damper.
