Ludwik Adamowicz is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to develop a state-selective multireference coupled-cluster
approach to electron correlation in quantum chemistry. This method produces
accurate potential energy surfaces of both ground and excited states, including
bond making and breaking processes. This method will handle complete-active-
space reference functions, incorporate spin adaptation and first-order response,
and execute via an efficient production code. Additionally, several applications
of the new methodology will be pursued, including the photophysics of nucleic
acid bases, carbon clusters, and silicon clusters. One of the major goals of
theoretical chemisty is the computation of potential energy surfaces of
molecular excited states, of sufficient accuracy to describe the dynamics of
transformations such as bond breakage and formation. Excited state processes
play a major role in photochemistry, and thus have relevance in astrophysics as
well as ultraviolet-induced reactions of nucleic acids.
