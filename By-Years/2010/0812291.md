Because of the growing recognition of the role that emotion and motivation play
in learning, affective computing has become the subject of increasing attention
in research on interactive learning environments. Narrative-centered learning
environments, which are game-based learning environments where learning
activities play out in dynamically generated interactive narratives, afford
great opportunity for exploring computational models of student affect. The
project will explore student affect modeling through the design, implementation,
and evaluation of affect models for game-based learning environments. It will
develop 1) affect recognition technologies to predict students' affect states,
recognize engagement and flow, and detect frustration, and 2) affect expression
technologies to customize pedagogical activities and dynamically plan the
empathetic responses of the virtual agents in the learning environment. All
design, implementation, and evaluation activities will be carried out in Crystal
Island, a narrative-centered game-based learning environment for
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will determine precisely which affect
modeling techniques best close the 'affective loop' and contribute most
effectively to student learning effectiveness and motivation. It is expected
that the project will have a significant impact on the theory and practice of
educational technology. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the research
objectives, the project will produce significant advances in computational
models of affect recognition and affect expression. It is anticipated that the
resulting computational models of student affect and the cognitive account of
affect-informed interaction in game-based learning environments will create new
learning environment technologies that promote high levels of achievement and
find broad application in science education.
