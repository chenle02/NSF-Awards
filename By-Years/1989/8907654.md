The purpose of this investigation is to continue work on the development of
effective computational methods for nonlinear, parameter dependent equations.
The equations involve a state variable, which is usually infinite dimensional, a
finite dimensional parameter vector. Under appropriate conditions, the solutions
of the state space and the parameter space. Problems of this type arise in
numerous, practically important equilibrium studies in physics and engineering.
For example, the equation may describe the equilibrium positions of a mechanical
structure, in which case the state variable characterizes, say, the deformations
while the parameter vector incorporates information about the load points, load
directions, material properties, geometrical data, etc. In this, as in most
applications of this type, interest centers rarely on the computation of a few
solutions for fixed choices of the parameters, but instead one has to address,
what is often called, the sensitivity problem. This concerns the question of the
change of the solutions under variation of the parameters. In particular, one
needs to determine those values of the parameters where the character of the
solution changes, for instance, where stability is lost. Thus, in essence, the
sensitivity problem requires a computational study of the shape and properties
of the solution manifold. The assumption of the existence of the solution
manifold presumes that the problem has been suitably unfolded. This turns out to
be a very natural assumption in most applications and to have considerable
advantages for the numerical solution of parametrized equation. Up to now, the
numerical analysis literature has paid little attention to this differential-
geometric aspect of multi-parameter nonlinear equations. But a consistent
utilization of differential-geometric concepts and results can provide a
powerful tool in the development of effective computational methods for a
unified analysis of the solution properties of the parametrized equation.
