The past decade has seen tremendous advances in the theory and practice of
software verification, and several success stories in the transition of
verification techniques from the research lab to development tools. However,
despite these advances, much work remains in several directions. These include
determining the best ways to applying these advances to broader, higher-level
issues like reliability, and privacy in new domains like cyber-physical systems
and medicine; in finding the best ways to reach out to practitioners, and to
train engineers to use formal methods principles, methodologies and tools; and
in finding ways for to multiply the effectiveness of researchers through the use
of shared platforms and infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
workshop is to identify the future directions in research in formal methods and
its transition to industrial practice. The workshop will bring together
researchers from academia, industry, and government research labs working in the
area of formal methods and verification, and identify primary challenges in the
field, both foundational, infrastructural, and in transitioning ideas from
research labs to developer tools.
