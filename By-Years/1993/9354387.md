9354387 McNeill A non-science majors course in the biology of aging features a
curriculum which: 1. develops scientific literacy by integrating current
research findings by key investigators in biogerontology; 2. challenges students
to think for themselves; and 3. includes a program of open-ended field and
laboratory exercises that offers students the opportunity to work with older
adults and learn about the heterogeneity of the aging process. A set of
educational materials, including a quarterly newsletter, is being developed to
help instructors at other institutions update their curricular materials as well
as to provide a means to exchange information on innovative approaches to
education in gerontology.
