DMS-9623008 PI: Albert Sheu University of Kansas The proposer will continue his
research on the interaction between C*-algebras and geometry, with emphasis on
the groupoid C*-algebra approach to quantum groups and deformation quantization.
Topics to be studied include the realization of quantum groups as groupoid
C*-algebras, leaf-preserving and group-preserving deformation quantizations of
concrete Poisson Lie groups, holomorphic foliation and deformation quantization,
and the cancellation problem for group C*-algebras. The main tools to be used in
this research will be from various mathematical branches like C*-algebras, Lie
groups, differential geometry, and pseudodifferential operators. This research
is motivated by the recent worldwide interest in the noncommutative aspect of
geometry originated from the concept of quantization which links together
several branches of mathematics and quantum physics. In the physical sciences,
it is important to study the invariance of quantities under various symmetry
group actions. The theory of quantum groups generalizes the classical theory of
symmetry groups and provides new and promising directions in the study of
quantum physics. By studying the structure of quantum groups in a new way and by
exploring related questions, the proposer hopes to contribute to the
understanding of this relatively new and exciting area of mathematics.
