The Department is purchasing a 4.5 meter radio antenna and motors, to be used in
an instructional radio telescope. Electronics and test equipment from a recently
decommissioned radio telescope are being used to complete the system. The
telescope is capable of a wide variety of radiometric and spectrometric
observations. Projects include measurements of the flux density and spectra of
extragalactic radio sources and galactic H II regions, observations of neutral
hydrogen in the galaxy, and study of the effects of the atmosphere on radio wave
propagation. This instrument benefits the education of a wide variety of
undergraduate students. It is used as a demonstration device in a large
introductory course for nonscience students. Students in the freshman course for
physics and astronomy majors use the telescope in several laboratory
experiments. Finally, the radio telescope is the centerpiece of a laboratory for
upper level undergraduate and graduate students in astronomy, physics, and
engineering. In this course students are taught the rudiments of instrumentation
in radio astronomy and radiophysics.
