This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of organometallic surface chemistry. Professor Robert Madix will study
the chemical reactions of hydrocarbon and alcohol molecules with well defined
single crystal active metal surfaces (e.g. iron and silver). The classes of
reactions under study are important models for complex homogeneous metal
catalyzed organic chemistry. These studies will provide information about the
reaction rates and structures of the reactants, intermediates and products
formed during model reactions. Fundamental information about the role of
molecular structure and metal surface chemistry will help provide general
principles of catalytic reactions. The carbon monoxide promoted hydrogenation of
alkenes over iron catalysts and Ä±4+2! cycloadditions catalyzed on silver
surfaces will be the two systems under study. Vibrational spectroscopy, thermal
desorption reaction mass spectrometry, work function and photoelectron
spectroscopy will be used to study structure and kinetics of carbon monoxide-
ethylene coadsorbed on iron (100) and butadiene reactions on silver (110),
copper (110) and palladium (111) surfaces. The effects of orientational changes
of reactants on their reactivity will be examined by vibrational spectroscopy
and near edge x-ray absorption fine structure.
