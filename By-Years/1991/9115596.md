This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder to acquire an
upgrade of a 250 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in research
investigations in the following areas of chemistry: 1. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Studies of Enzyme-Substrate Complexes 2. Redox Chemistry of Quinones
3. Chemistry of Ä±n! Staffanes 4. Studies of Cyclo and Linear Borophosphazane
Oligomers and Polymers 5. Topological Stereochemistry and Design and Synthesis
of New Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals %%% Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the
eludication of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in such areas
as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
