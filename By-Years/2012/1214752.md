This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of developing a next-generation neurological training tool for
medical schools and teaching hospitals. Traditional medical school teaching has
relied on a period of book learning, followed by an apprenticeship with graded
responsibility in performing procedures. The desire to reduce health care costs
and improve patient safety has created a need for better training tools. The
Neurosyntec cerebrospinal physiology trainer is a realistic rendition of the
cerebrospinal axis that combines both virtual and physical elements for an
unprecedented level of simulation realism and user interactivity. This Phase I
will produce a prototype of this robotic trainer for testing at local medical
schools and hospitals. This work will guide further development toward
commercialization in this growing niche area.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a
safe and cost-effective training platform that facilitates the development of
the cognitive and psychomotor skills necessary for neurological diagnosis and
treatment. The technology will also allow the development of new and more
efficient ways of standardizing assessment and certification of practitioners,
which will be of benefit to society. Finally, company hopes to stimulate local
economic growth through job creation.
