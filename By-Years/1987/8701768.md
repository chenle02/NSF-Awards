The objective of this research is to use the notions and methods of non-smooth
analysis to establish a new type of connection between optimal stochastic
control problems and the Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman equation irrespective of the
possible degeneracy properties of the underlying processes. This would provide a
new insight into the interrelation between variational problems and certain
nonlinear partial differential equations as well as a unified approach to both
deterministic and stochastic optimal control theory. The core of the research is
the investigation of the regularity of properties of the optimal value function
in terms of its subdifferentials, Clarke derivatives and the finding of a class
of non-smooth functions in which the Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman equation is
uniquely solvable. Accumulation of computational and modeling experience on
application problems are also parts of the project.
