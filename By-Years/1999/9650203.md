Department of Environmental Science administers the B.S. degree in Environmental
Science. One of the course requirements for the degree is Geoscience, a course
designed to integrate the study of physical science principles with the
technology used to investigate and depict them. The College will expand the
course and add laboratory and field exercises through acquistion of equipment to
allow students to acquire and interpret field data via map, stereoscope, current
meter, sieve shaker, weather station, and ArcView software. The project will
allow the development of an integrated course in the physical sciences. The
course's laboratory experience will place emphasis on data acquisition and
analysis rather than strictly on observations. Modern mapping and image
interpretation will constitute a major portion of the laboratory and will permit
the students to utilize methods and technology rarely available to
undergraduates, particularly in smaller institutions. By being open to non-
majors, Environmental Science majors, and working professionals, the course also
will provide the opportunity for students having different career paths to
interact.
