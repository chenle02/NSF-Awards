9625087 One of the greatest needs of in situ remediation technologies is the
development of systems that will overcome the commonly poor rates of contaminant
extraction from highly sorptive and low permeability zones. In most common
remediation technology, "pump and treat," fluid extraction rates are high but
the contaminant removal rates are largely controlled by the relatively slow
processes of diffusion and desorption from heterogeneous zones. This research is
devoted to two of the most important heterogeneity types: contaminated clay
lenses in a productive aquifer, and a sandy layer or fractured zone in a
relatively impermeable media. Two emerging strategies will be investigated:
electroosmotic enhancements applied to a clay lens; and a novel, safe, abiotic
reagent chemistry that can be injected into fractures and sandy zones. While the
fundamentals of each technology are well-defined, this work will demonstrate how
the two technologies can be integrated to obtain electroosmotic enhancement with
in situ abiotic degradation. The chief educational objective is to develop and
integrate the common scientific and engineering fundamentals that are important
for a wide array of geoenvironmental problems. The PI will develop
geoenvironmental curriculum strategies, broaden the exposure of new research
methods, and work to strengthen the analytical training of students.
Collaborations with industry and government agencies will greatly enhance these
educational and research plans. ***
