The Langlands Program is a mathematical framework that unifies questions in many
different areas of mathematics, especially number theory and representation
theory, in a web of deep and as yet only partially understood connections
between number theory, representation theory, geometry, and mathematical
physics. The classical Langlands program has been studied for more than fifty
years, and has found significant applications to solving classical Diophantine
equations, such as the solution of Fermat's last theorem. The geometric
Langlands program, which is relatively new, is under rapid development as it is
also connected with other subjects such as geometry and physics, from where one
can draw intuition. In the geometric Langlands program, the number fields in the
classical Langlands program are replaced by curves and their function fields,
and the web of connections in number theory is replaced by concisely formulated
equivalences, or correspondences. This project will extend and develop geometric
Langlands correspondences in different settings and provide research training
opportunities for graduate students.

In more detail, one project will establish the Fundamental Local Equivalence,
which is an equivalence between the Whittaker category of the affine
Grassmannian for a reductive group and the Kazhdan-Lusztig category for its
Langlands dual, as factorization categories. This equivalence could be
considered as the starting point for the local geometric Langlands program. The
project will establish the required equivalence by equating both sides to a
combinatorial object that is directly expressible in terms of the root data and
the quantum parameter (the so-called factorization algebra Omega). Another
project will directly relate the geometric and classical Langlands theories (in
the case of function fields) by realizing the space of automorphic functions as
the categorical trace of the Frobenius on the category of automorphic sheaves
with nilpotent singular support. In the process of doing so, one naturally re-
derives V. Lafforgue's decomposition of the space of automorphic functions over
the course moduli space of Langlands parameters via shtukas.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
