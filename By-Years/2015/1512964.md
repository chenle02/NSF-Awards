Online systems are, to a growing degree, economic systems designed for a large
population of users, each with their own motivations. Economic design is more
likely to be effective when it is based on accurate models of the agent
population toward which it is targeted. A growing literature, however, suggests
that people do not quite behave like standard economic agents in a variety of
settings, both online and offline. What consequences might such differences in
behavior have for the optimal design of these
environments?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lay the groundwork for a
theory of behavioral mechanism design, with the aim of both introducing new
theoretical problems and impacting the design of online systems in practice. The
diversity of the literature that this research draws upon, and can potentially
impact, makes it particularly suitable for bringing awareness of theoretical
research to communities that are otherwise largely dissociated from mathematical
methods. The PIs hope to achieve this via new courses for graduate students with
little or no exposure to mathematics, as well as hands-on learning experiences
for middle-school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will address
questions based on three families of behavioral phenomena well-documented in
experimental work, and will investigate how they impact the design of a range of
online systems, such as social computing and crowdsourcing platforms, matching
markets, and ranking and recommendation systems. The project will consider
mechanism design for "simple" agents who strategize about their participation
decision but not about their input (conditional on participating) to a system;
pricing and menu design for agents whose decisions may suffer from "choice
overload;" and designing learning algorithms whose input comes from
behaviorally-biased agents rather than from stationary random sampling
processes.
