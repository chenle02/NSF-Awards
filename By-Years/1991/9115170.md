Dr. Kenneth Tenore is the Director of the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory,
which is one of three campuses of the University of Maryland's Center for
Environmental and Estuarine Research. The Lab is located along the western shore
of the Chesapeake at the mouth of the Patuxent River, and the facility is used
by resident and visiting scientists for research in ecology, environmental
chemistry, the biology and geochemistry of estuarine sediments, and fisheries
biology. Dr. Tenore proposes to establish a new facility at the Lab for research
that employs techniques from molecular biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology.
The new facility will allow researchers to prepare and store samples for
analysis, culture cells in the laboratory, and perform a variety of molecular
and biochemical analyses. Making these new techniques available to investigators
at the Lab will significantly enhance a substantial number of environmental
research projects.
