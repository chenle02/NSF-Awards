Proposal #: 93-21540 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V CAPE HATTERAS, a 135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and
operated by the University. Instrumentation requested includes computer hardware
for the shipboard computer, 10 liter and 30 liter Niskin bottles, an upgrade for
the CTD, an underwater video camera, and an air compressor for seismic studies.
The instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-funded cruises
aboard the CAPE HATTERAS during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability
of the vessel in the future.
