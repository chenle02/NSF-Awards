The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was established in FY
1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the research capabilities of
the strongest and most productive predominantly minority institutions. This
planning grant project lays the foundation for a plan that will increase the
institution's quality of research and research-related training. Specifically,
support for this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory
committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial
representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its current and
future potential for performing meritorious research during the next five years.
New Mexico Highlands University is under new administrative leadership that will
address research, educational enrichment and faculty development. The
institution will study barriers to the entry of minorities into science and
engineering in public schools, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Under
the new NMHU administration, this institution's assessment of its research
capabilities is timely and warranted. The Foundation has supported this project
because of the institution's opportunity to provide quality research to minority
faculty and students.
