ASM Materials Camp for Teachers (MCT) is a program that provides education and
training to in-service educators enabling them to incorporate material science
lessons, labs and activities into their existing curricula. Teachers from high
school science, math and technology departments spend one week in a program that
introduces them to hands-on interactive activities that instill a deeper
appreciation and understanding of common materials that students encounter on a
daily basis. Using low-cost, no-cost, easily obtainable supplies, teachers learn
to effectively demonstrate applied science principles as they teach and
investigate a variety of materials. Integrating materials science and technology
(MS&amp;T) into the curriculum provides a tapestry of relevant real world
learning for students.
