EIA-0130822&lt;br/&gt;Boahen, Kwabena&lt;br/&gt;Univ. of
Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BITS: Epigenetic Computers: An in vitro, in
abstractio, and in silico study&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, nanotechnology
will enable us to design programmable information processors (computers) from
the ground up, growing them from molecules. The brain is built in this fashion
through the power of epigenesis multicellular differentiation triggered by
environmental signals. Despite impressive progress in our understanding of this
process (Sanes, Reh et al. 2000), no one has attempted to design a computer that
learns by growing based on insights from neurobiology. Using information derived
from in vitro and in abstractio studies of diffusible neurotrophic factor
mediated neuronal pathfinding (growth-cone chemotaxis) and synaptogenesis, we
will develop a self-configurable computer that reprograms itself at the level of
individual connections by merging custom, very large scale integration, in
silico microtechnology with growing virtual wires. With the insights gained in
this project, we will be poised to take advantage of real anatomical plasticity
made possible by rapid progress in nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;
