Ecologists are being challenged to use their accumulated data and insights to
solve large-scale problems of resource management and to predict effects of
stresses on ecosystems. To meet these challenges we must incorporate knowledge
from a wide variety of ecosystems into syntheses that will produce general
principles and models. These efforts in comparative ecology will require
cooperation among ecologists with a range of perspectives including those
specializing in physiological, population, community and ecosystem ecology.
Another problem is to develop ways by which ecological data collected at the
scale of a square meter or a hectare can be scaled up to describe ecological
phenomena for larger areas - landscapes, regions and ultimately the globe. A
workshop is proposed that will collect the thought of the scientific community
on how to: 1) foster synthesis based on comparative ecology; and 2) address
issues of scale. One idea to be considered is a national center for the study of
comparative ecology and scale. Ecologists representing population, community and
ecosystem ecology will attend the meeting and attempt to reach a consensus about
the proposed topic. A series of position paper will be presented and a consensus
document will represent the views of the ecological research community. The
organizer of workshop are well qualified to run the meeting and write a summary
document from the meeting.
