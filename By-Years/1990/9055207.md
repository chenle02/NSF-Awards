For the fifth summer, Del Mar College will be hosting the Corpus Christi
Prefreshman Engineering Program (PREP). This eight-week, commuter program has
been a Young Scholars site since the summer of 1989. 120 new students and 30
returnees will be admitted to the program. These students will be entering 8th
and 9th graders who are interested in studying Mathematics, Engineering and
Computer Science. Participants will attend classes/labs for four days a week and
will have field trips most Fridays to local industries and R&amp;D centers. A
typical class day begins with a scientist/engineer speaker for the purpose of
career orientation. This hour is followed by an hour each in Logic, Computer
Science (Pascal), Engineering (with an emphasis on projects to teach physical
principles) and Problem Solving.
