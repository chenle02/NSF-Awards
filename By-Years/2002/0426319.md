Working closely with chemists, physicists, educators and nanoscientists, SRI
generates NanoSense -- nanoscience activities that build on their ChemSense
activities. That curricular framework is extended to include five or six
nanosense activities -- created, classroom tested and disseminated -- to help
high school students understand the underlying principles, applications and
implications of nanoscale science. These units help students visualize physical,
chemical and biological principles that govern the behavior of particles at
nanoscales. Some of the activities are simple, one-day enrichment activities,
while others span several class periods. The work introduces an
interdisciplinary element into the disjoint high school curriculum and provides
real world examples of science and technology in action. Research along with the
development determines how students improve their understanding of nanoscience
concepts and technological applications improve over time and how teachers use
these tools and activities to support student discourse and understanding. An
invitational workshop of science educators and researchers and nanoscience
researchers is to identify and prioritize a coherent set of concepts and
potential ideas that underlie an understanding of the scale continuum between
nanoscale and macroscale on which instructional materials research and
certificate programs can be built.
