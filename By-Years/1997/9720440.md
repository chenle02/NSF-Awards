This award supports Dr. Gergely Zimanyi and a graduate student from the
University of California-Davis in a collaboration with Gerd Sch`n of the
Department of Solid State Physics at the University of Karlsruhe. The
collaboration will study three topics: 1) electron tunneling through junctions
and quantum dots with high tunneling conductance, 2) quantum phase slips and
transport in ultra-thin superconducting wires, and 3) collective properties of
arrays of Josephson junctions and granular materials. Each group brings separate
and complementary expertise in the topics to be studied, and exchange of
students is a high priority during the two-year award period. All three topics
are of great interest to both the theoretical and experimental physics
communities, and may have implications for future technological advances in
high-speed electronic devices.
