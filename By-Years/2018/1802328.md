This is a project in Lie theory and geometry. Named after the mathematician
Sophus Lie, Lie theory may be described as the study of symmetries of spaces of
solutions of systems of differential equations. Especially important are systems
of equations that model classical and quantum mechanics. Geometric properties of
solution spaces encode properties of the physical systems being modeled by the
differential equations. This project will develop the connections between the
geometric properties and symmetries of these solution spaces, using mainly
algebraic techniques.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on four
specific projects. The first project will find a twisted analog of conformal
blocks and the Verlinde formula, the second project is to determine an
irredundant set of Inequalities for the saturated tensor cone of a Kac-Moody Lie
algebra, the third project will generalize the classical Jacobson-Morozov
Theorem to symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie Algebras, and the fourth project is to
develop a general topological analog of Fulton's Conjecture for group
restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
