No: CBET- 0926160 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this award is to
support U.S. students and researchers to participate in the 15th Gordon Research
Conference on Laser Diagnostics in Combustion, to be held August 16-21, 2009, at
the Waterville Valley Resort, Waterville Valley, NH. This biennial conference,
first held in 1981, has served as the off-the-record forum for scientists from
all over the world interested in using laser light to understand combustion
problems. Each meeting has been essentially a workshop, and the
interdisciplinary discussions of major research issues are a highlight of the
meeting. The Gordon Research Conference format brings together approximately 135
scientists for a week of intense interaction and scientific
discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2009 Gordon Conference on Laser Diagnostics
for Combustion features twenty presentations that provide updates on the latest
advances in laser-based diagnostics and sensor activities important in
combustion efficiency and emissions for combustion systems relevant to the NSF
mission. Many different laser-based techniques have been and continue to be at
the focus of our investigations to meet these demands, including Raman and
Rayleigh scattering, non-linear Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence,
multi-photon and pump-probe approaches, four-wave mixing and holographic grating
techniques, and advanced laser absorption schemes. New techniques will be
discussed such as high-speed laser imaging, coherent X-rays, surface-enhanced
Raman scattering, and other surface diagnostics such as XPS. The design and
application of laser-based diagnostics and the interpretation of the obtained
data requires a thorough fundamental knowledge of laser physics, of
spectroscopy, and of combustion chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concepts will be
shown of how to develop the best experiment and examples of how laser
diagnostics is used in a wide range of environments ? from laboratory reactors
to aircraft gas turbines, aiding broad technological impacts. As the only
scientific forum with an interdisciplinary focus on laser-based diagnostics of
combustion, providing an important medium of dissemination and technical
education for young and emerging US scientists as well as senior
specialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
