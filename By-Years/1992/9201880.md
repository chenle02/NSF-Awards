The object of this proposal is to upgrade the computers and radar hardware at
the Sondrestrom Facility. The PIs feel this will better enable the use of a
data-acquisition system that provides greater flexibility in radar operating
modes. In addition, the PI proposes to extend the capabilities of the data-
acquisition system, improve the radar circuits that limit existing operating
modes, and extend the facility computer power to allow on-site data reduction
with fitting software.
