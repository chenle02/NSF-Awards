This project is to conduct experiments and to provide core measurements of
carbon productivity on the US JGOFS cruises to the equatorial Pacific in 1992.
The basic measurement techniques use the radioisotope carbon-14 to assess total
carbon production. Core measurements of new and total production are to be
provided to all participants in the EQPAC experiment. The C14 measurements will
be made using "clean analytical techniques" and incubations will be conducted at
both 6 and 24 hours. These core measurements will be made on both the survey and
time series cruises of the JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Experiment. These core
estimates will be used by other /collaborating scientists to develop global
models of carbon flux. //
