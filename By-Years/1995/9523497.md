9523497 Rieke This grant funds the construction of IRIS, the Infrared
Radiometer, Imager, and Spectrometer, a facility instrument for the upgraded 6.5
meter Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT). The focal plane instrument will be a 256
x 256 pixel camera/spectrometer based on a new generation of infrared arrays.
The instrument builds on the experience gained in the operation of a smaller
format thermal infrared camera. IRIS will be capable of a resolution of 13,500
and an imaging resolution of 0.35 arc seconds at a wavelength of 10 micrometers.
It will operate in the spectral region from 4 to 25 micrometers. ***
