Controllability of a Fluid-Structure Interaction Arising in Chemical Vapor
Deposition In this project, we spell out an infinite dimensional control problem
arising from the use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in the manufacture of
this films on the surface of a substrate; this CVD is used in a host of
technological applications, including the construction of microelectric
circuitry, compound semiconductor devices and high-performance cutting and
grinding tools. Mathematically, one has a version of the Navier-Stokes equations
coupled to a semilinear heat equation, with the control (temperature)
implemented on a wall of the boundary. With a view towards determining the
physical feasibility of improving the quality of the film growth by controlling
the wall temperature, we aim to study the controllability of the associated
system of coupled partial differential equations, controllability in a sense to
be made precise below. The approach to be taken in addressing our control
theoretic question will be that adopted for other coupled partial differential
equations seen in the analysis of "smart material" technology. Both continuous
and approximation theory will be considered in this work.
