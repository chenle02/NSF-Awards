9420567 Montgomery ABSTRACT The goals are: The developed materials to expose all
undergraduate chemical engineering students to current industrial applications
of biotechnology within the context of the core curriculum; and we will train
interested undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering students to meet the
new challenges in biotechnology by integrating current research into the
curriculum. The accomplished of these goals are by fulfilling the following
specific aims: 1. Develop a new biotechnology curriculum - An upper level
undergraduate/lower level graduate course, entitled "Biomolecular Engineering",
will focus on engineering analyses and applications at the molecular, cellular,
and tissue level. It will be based largely on on-going research efforts in
laboratories of the University of Michigan and some of its industrial research
partners. The existing upper level biochemical engineering courses will be
modified to include more advanced concepts. The resulting bioengineering
sequence will provide students with breadth as well as depth of knowledge in
biotechnology. 2. Develop interactive multimedia-based software for the new
curriculum and for national integration into the core undergraduate chemical
engineering curriculum - This software will be used in the new course (Aim 1) as
well as in an existing biotechnology course which covers the more traditional
aspects of biotechnology, e.g. fermentation process design. Abbreviated versions
of the software will be prepared for use in core undergraduate chemical
engineering courses. These modules, which will be distributed nationally, will
serve both as motivators to provide exposure to the biotechnology field as well
as facilitators to enable students to analyze engineering fundamentals as they
are applied to new situations. ***
