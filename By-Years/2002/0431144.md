Sudden heart attacks remain the leading cause of death in the US. Heart attacks
are caused by complications of "vulnerable plaques." The discovery of vulnerable
plaques has recently evolved into the definition of the "vulnerable patient"
(VP). A VP is defined as a person with a high likelihood of developing a heart
attack in the near future. Since the majority of sudden cardiac deaths occur in
people with no prior symptoms, there is an urgent need for computational tools
to assist in screening for the conditions that underlie sudden cardiac events.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing the theoretical framework and
computational tools for the mining of information from CT and intravascular
ultrasound (IVUS) imaging for the detection of VPs. The specific objectives are
to: (1) develop new denoising algorithms; (2) develop a new medical image
segmentation framework; (3) develop new enhancement quantification techniques;
and (4) apply these techniques and evaluate their performance to the problems of
CT and IVUS-based detection of VPs. The project's collaborating cardiovascular
specialists at the Association for the Eradication of Heart Attack believe that
such methods hold the potential to contribute to the development of a
quantitative method for early detection and intervention to improve outcomes and
increase survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new course on Cardiovascular
Informatics offered at the undergraduate and graduate levels will allow the
integration of this research into education. Outreach materials will be created
in collaboration with the Pearland (TX) Independent School District, the Houston
Area Technology Advancement Center, and the Houston Museum of Natural
Science.&lt;br/&gt;
