The Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) will administer and
implement, "Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating (PolarTREC)", a
program that selects U.S. teachers and informal educators and prepares them to
participate in cutting-edge field research with polar scientists in various, and
often remote, locations in the Arctic and Antarctica. Through hands-on field
experiences, participating teachers (pre-service and in-service) and informal
educators will improve teaching strategies, develop resources for their careers,
and change how they teach STEM in the classroom and to the public. The project's
goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing
educators and polar researchers together in professional collaboration. By
integrating research and education, PolarTREC will help sustain and grow the
considerable scientific and public enthusiasm for polar research and education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve teachers or informal educators will be recruited,
selected, and matched with polar researchers. ARCUS will maintain a website for
dissemination of information about the expeditions, provide orientation training
for the teachers that includes field safety and communication training, provide
travel support for the teachers to meet with scientists prior to deployments and
for them to join the scientific expeditions in the field. Participants in the
TRE will not only increase their knowledge of polar science and effective
teaching practices, but also will develop long-term collaborative professional
relationships with polar researchers and become part of an ever-growing educator
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
