9713025 Pillai This project will provide a cadre of rural high school science
teachers with college-level coursework in physics. As a consequence, the
teachers will be able to earn state certification to teach physics at the high
school level. The PI will direct the curriculum over two academic years to allow
the teachers to take the courses while continuing to teach their regular
classes. The courses will be structured to provide the teachers both physics
content and pedagogy for teaching high school physics in both the classroom and
the laboratory. The project will involve 20 teachers in the poor, rural service
area of Mississippi Valley State University. The project is in itself not
systemic, but is a teacher enhancement model. It can, however, further systemic
reform efforts in the area. ??
