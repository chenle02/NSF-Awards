This industry/university cooperative research program is concerned with an
understanding and improvement of the various structural and materials effects
determining the performance of the modulation-doped FET's including their
thermal stability and millimeter-wave power gains. For thermal stability, the
conventional n-AlGaAs layer on GaAs buffer layer will be replaced by a short
period n-GaAs/AlAs superlattice. This configuration will be used to achieve
submicron gate-length MODFET's with optimized gate layer thickness to improve
the device power gain stability margin at mm-wave frequencies. Additional design
refinements will be incorporated to reduce the device output conductance and
contact series resistances. Detailed electrical characterization and modeling of
the improved MODFET's, first to support the structural design optimization
process and then to extract the basic electrical and physical parameters that
are indicative of the HF potential of the optimized devices will be performed.
