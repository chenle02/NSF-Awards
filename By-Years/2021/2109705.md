The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new environmentally sustainable
material for diapers and incontinence products. In the US, 25 million adults
suffer from urinary incontinence, generating up to 1.5 million kilograms of
problematic material for landfills. The proposed material will be manufactured
using cheap, and renewable raw materials, improving the environmental impact of
managing this condition and enabling high quality of life for its users.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project proposes to develop a new superabsorbent polymer (SAP). In the first
phase of research, this project will identify design parameters based on polymer
architecture, charge density, and gel fraction for a SAP that meets
specifications regarding absorbency under load (AUL), centrifuge retention
capacity (CRC), and kinetics of absorption. The project will validate the safety
and biodegradability in simulated composting conditions. Finally, the project
will explore protocols for manufacturing at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
