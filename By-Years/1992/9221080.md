This grant is to assist in the support of an international boundary element
symposium (IABEM-92, International Symposium on Boundary Element Methods) to be
held August 3-6, 1992, at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The aim of the
symposium is to appraise the state-of-the-art and set directions for new
research in the field of boundary element methods, especially for large-scale
analysis. It will facilitate a dialogue between engineers and scientists working
in a variety of technological fields that employ boundary element methods. The
conference will result in an authoritative high quality proceedings volume,
based on selected symposium papers, which will serve as a basic reference on
this subject.
