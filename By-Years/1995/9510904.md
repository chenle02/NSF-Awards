Metherate 9510904 The brain seems to process information in special ways during
times of behavioral arousal. One aspect of this arousal is secretion of the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) within the cerebral cortex. It has not yet
been determined exactly how ACh modifies cortical function. With this award, Dr.
Metherate will determine how ACh secretion activates the cortex, and in
particular how it modifies information processing within cellular circuits
within the cortex. The auditory cortex will be used as a model system for these
studies. This work will uncover important cellular mechanisms of plasticity that
are likely to be involved in shifts of attention, learning and memory. ***
