This project will produce the first complete, book-length study of eighteeenth-
century Dutch science, filling an important gap in knowledge about science
during the Enlightenment. Since the Netherlands was a republic, not a monarchy
with its court and aristocratic cultures, the study will help us refine
generalizations about scientific culture in early modern Europe. Current views
of Dutch science are influenced by a longstanding emphasis on the seventeenth
century as the Netherlands' `Golden Age,` followed by what is usually
characterized as a period of decline. By embedding a cultural history of science
within the context of eighteenth-century Dutch life, this study will develop an
appreciation of Dutch scientific activities and achievements that is not
predetermined by such value judgments. The study will be organized around the
concepts of `utility` and `virtue` both because they were constantly invoked as
the guiding ideals of science during the Enlightenment and because their
meanings changed constantly. The method to be employed in this project begins
with a survey of available primary and secondary literature, followed by
archival research. What distinguishes this study from others is its commitment
to respect the integrity of science while demonstrating its dynamic relationship
to the cultural environment in which it is practiced.
