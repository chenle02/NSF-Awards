Over the past 15 years, Dr. William Quinn has been an active participant in the
genetic dissection of memory. In well controlled behavioral experiments, Dr.
Quinn and his colleagues have isolated mutant flies with specific deficits in
associative learning and proceeded to characterize the molecular defects that
underlie them. One of the advantages of the Drosophila as an experimental system
is that it is "holistic"; the effect of molecular perturbations on behavior are
observable in the intact animal. The work which will be pursued in the future
concerns ways in which genes will be manipulated in order to evaluate the role
of different proteins and enzymes in learning and memory in Drosophila. The
approach presented by Dr. Quinn represents an original approach to the problem
of understanding memory formation, and a unique wedding of cutting-edge
molecular genetic techniques with solid detailed behavioral analysis.
