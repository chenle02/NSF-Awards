This research focuses on dynamical aspects of rod-bearing polymer solutions.
Tracer self-diffusivities of fluorescently tagged rodlike polymers will be
measured by fluorescence photobleaching recovery to verify the large data set
already obtained via light-scattering methods, and to test existing theories of
self diffusion and its relationship to mutual diffusion. Solvent mobility in
such solutions will be measured by pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic
resonance techniques, in order to account for the increasing resistance offered
by solvent as polymer concentration is increased. This will, enable a comparison
with theoretical predictions made by Doi and Edwards a decade ago, as well as
more recent developments. The diffusion of rigid asymmetric probes through
solutions of less stiff polymers will be measured. Finally, an initiative into
the behavior of rods with long, flexible sidechains-"furry rods"-is planned.
These experiments will open research into the molecular dynamics of rods in the
molten state, which relates to the processing of thermotropic liquid crystals.
