This project will incorporate the High Temperature Aerosol Decomposition (HTAD)
process for the processing of high transition temperature superconducting
materials. A series of layered perovskites in the substitutional family,
Ln1-xMxCuO4-y, will be synthesized. The High Temperature Aerosol Decomposition
(HTAD) process to be utilized in this study for materials synthesis has
demonstrated a unique facility for the preparation of phase pure mixed metal
oxides and homogeneous solid solutions of ion modified metal oxides. The first
objective of the study will be to demonstrate that the HTAD process is an
especially efficient method for the synthesis and processing of superconducting
materials demonstrating high Tc. The best of these materials will be subjected
to controlled high temperature calcining to obtain interparticulate chemical
reaction at the microcrystalline interfacial contact points.
