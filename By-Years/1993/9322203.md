9322203 Kampmeier University of Rochester Dr. Jack A. Kampmeier and other
members of the Chemistry Department of the University of Rochester are being
supported for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.
For the period 1994-6, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each
summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects cover the
traditional areas of chemistry-analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and
biochemistry. A unique feature of this site is the interaction with the NSF
Science and Technology Center for Photoinduced Charge Transfer.
