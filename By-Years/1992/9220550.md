Rao This research is studying novel algorithms for computing solutions to least
squares problems with constraints, especially those problems that are
underdetermined. The primary application is expected to be in
Magnetoencephalography (MEG), a potentially new modality for the imaging of the
brain. Both algorithm development and analysis are being considered, with MEG
providing the forum for the testing and evaluation of these algorithms. It is
expected that this research will greatly enhance our understanding of nonlinear
iterative techniques.
