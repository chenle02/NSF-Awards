The National Academies' Board on Mathematical Sciences and their Applications
(BMSA) is a primary interface between the research enterprise and federal
agencies that rely on the mathematical sciences. Through studies and workshops,
the Board's 20 pro bono experts help to ensure that the nation's decision making
is based on strong mathematical analysis and reliable computational simulations.
BMSA reports issued in 2009 documented best practices in uncertainty management
for remotely sensed climate data; identified needs of the U.S. forensic science
enterprise, including new statistical research; reviewed NSF's program in
Vertical Integration in Graduate Research and Education; and documented
technical capabilities necessary for the regulation of systemic risk in the
financial sector.

The current grant will enable to Board to launch and oversee new studies on
mathematical foundations of verification, validation, and uncertainty
quantification; enlarging the toolkit for analysis of massive data; preparing
the mathematical sciences for the coming decades; and evaluating the
macroeconomic effects of our aging population. Funding will also support BMSA
efforts to build stronger ties between the mathematical sciences and other
communities of science, engineering, and public policy, through Board meetings
and the activities that are initiated at those meetings.
