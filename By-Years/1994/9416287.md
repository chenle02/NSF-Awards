9416287 Engelhardt The January 1994 Northridge Earthquake caused unprecedented
damage at beam-to-column connections in steel moment resisting frames. The
failures occurred largely at the standard welded flange - bolted web type of
steel moment connection. These failures reflected nonductile behavior, and has
raised serious questions on current methods and standards of design. The
research undertaken in this project will experimentally evaluate the performance
of reinforced moment connections. Two reinforcing schemes will be investigated.
Both involve the addition of reinforcing plates at the connection. The
reinforcing plates substantially increase the flexural capacity of the
connection, and at the same time, reduce stress levels on the beam flange welds.
The lower weld stresses will significantly reduce the sensitivity of the
connection to welding quality. Such reinforced connection details have shown
promising performance in limited past tests. However additional large scale
verification of these details is needed, and will be provided by this research
project. Most tests will be conducted using beam steels with high yield strength
and high yield to tensile strength ratio, in order to provide a severe test of
the reinforced connections. However, some tests will also be conducted using
beam steels with a controlled low value of yield and yield to tensile strengths.
These tests will demonstrate the role of steel strength characteristics in the
observed connection failures, and investigate the possibility of improved
connection performance through control of steel material properties. The results
of this testing program will provide urgently needed data for structural
engineers and building code officials involved with design of new steel moment
frames, as well as the repair or retrofit of existing steel moment frames. This
is a Northridge Earthquake project. ***
