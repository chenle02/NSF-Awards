This project is part of an ongoing research program. It revolves around
understanding how various fundamental algebraic objects occurring in mathematics
---such as rings, class groups, algebraic curves and varieties, and maps
relating such structures---are parametrized. Our goals in understanding these
parametrizations are at least fourfold: 1) to describe how these fundamental
algebraic objects are distributed with respect to their most basic invariants;
2) to discover new invariants of these objects, and their applications; 3) to
develop efficient and practical algorithms for performing computations with
these algebraic objects; and, perhaps most importantly, 4) to discover and
understand how various seemingly different algebraic structures are in fact
closely related to each other.

Such parametrizations have been already used by the PI over the past few years
to obtain precise information on the distribution of number fields with respect
to basic invariants such as discriminant and class number divisibility. Applying
refined counting methods to these parametrizations has led, for example, to a
proof of the first known case of the Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet class number
heuristics for higher degree number fields, and other theorems of this nature
are forthcoming. We expect similar theorems for ranks of elliptic curves, and
other data of this kind for algebraic curves and surfaces, in the near future.
