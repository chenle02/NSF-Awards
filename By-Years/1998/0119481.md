0119481&lt;br/&gt;Odde&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project will be to use
LGDW to deliver vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-coated microspheres to
undifferentiated multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) to induce the
endothelial (blood vessel lining) cell phenotype locally. The particle materials
to be studied will include polystyrene and polylactic-glycolic acid with sizes
ranging from 1-10 um. VEGF will be covalently immobilized to the particles via
commercially available surface chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
