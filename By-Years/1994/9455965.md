9455965 Wallace Dartmouth College is planning a major curricular effort aimed at
integrating mathematics across the entire undergraduate curriculum. A team of 29
people, most of which are faculty at Dartmouth College, are working together to
create ways of simultaneously teaching mathematics and at least one other
subject. The team comes from the departments of mathematics, chemistry, physics,
biology, psychology, social science, education, music, geology and computer
science, as well as the medical and engineering schools. Also included are a
fine artist, a performing artist, a writing teacher and the director of the
local science museum. The goal is the design of a curriculum project which will
change completely the way undergraduate mathematics is taught across the
curriculum, across the population and across the nation.
