most taxonomically divers collection of Colorado plants in the world and has one
of the most significant collections of plants from the Rocky Mountains. The
gymnosperm portion of the collection comprises approximately 1700 specimens and
is particularly noteworthy for its important collections of the genus Pinus from
Mexico and the United States southwest. This award will be used to purchase 15
steel herbarium cases to house the collection (previously stored in substandard
cases) and provide for increased accessibility to and modest growth of the
collection.
