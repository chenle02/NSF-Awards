This is a small workshop of women researchers in statistics who have received
their doctorates in the last five years. The workshop will be held immediately
prior to the Annual Meeting of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and its
Special Symposium on Probability and its Applications. Each workshop participant
will give a brief introduction to her area of research interest and describe her
reseach environment. The opportunity to meet and interact with each other as
well as with a few established women researchers will be invaluable as the
participants learn to promote their own research and to decrease their
professional isolation.
