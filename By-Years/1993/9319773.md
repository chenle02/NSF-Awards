9319773 Granato Ultrasonic measurements are applied to two different topics. In
the first case the effect of viscosity on dislocation tunneling through impurity
pinning points is determined by comparing the ultrasonically found microyield
stress in the normal and superconducting state in dilute aluminum alloys. The
measurements build on results from a previous grant that showed dislocation
tunneling occurring below , but not above, 0.5 degrees Kelvin. The second case
involves a critical test of the interstitialcy model of condensed matter states
by measuring the temperature dependence of the elastic constants of aluminum and
other crystals just below the melting temperature by an electromagnetic acoustic
transformation technique (EMAT). Positive results for an unusual and unexpected
effect would confirm a simple, quantitative easily visualized model according to
which liquids and amorphous materials are crystals containing a few percent of
self-interstitials. %%% Knowledge obtained from this research is important to
the understanding of material properties in superconductors, amorphous materials
and glasses. ***
