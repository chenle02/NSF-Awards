Professor Mu-Tao Wang proposes to study the geometry of higher codimensional
submanifolds and the associated PDEs. He plans to continue his research on the
mean curvature flow of Lagrangian submanifolds of Kahler-Einstein manifolds.
This is closely related to a conjecture on the existence of special Lagrangians
in Calabi-Yau manifolds. Professor Wang shall also continue his joint research
project with Professor Shing-Tung Yau on the quasi-local mass of surfaces in
general relativity. Immediate goals include understanding the conservation of
the quasi-local mass and identifying the contribution of momentum.

Professor Mu-Tao Wang purposes to study the geometry and PDEs associated with
special curved geometric shapes, including special Lagrangians which are higher
dimensional analogues of soap films and surfaces in space-time that are
boundaries of space-like regions. The study of special Lagrangians will lead to
the further understanding of the geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds, the space of
string theory. Professor Wang also plans to use the geometry and canonical PDEs
on the boundary surfaces to detect the quasi-local energy-momentum contained in
the space-like region. The proposed research will clarify the formation of black
holes due to condensation of matter.
