9409078 Showen The objective of this research is to better determine the effects
of lightning or other transient events on the ionosphere. The method to be
employed is to measure and analyze IS data taken at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, during
lightning storms. Both the ion line and plasma line echoes will be used to find
the transient responses of number density, temperature, velocity and enhanced
plasma-wave strengths. The likely results of this study will be increased
knowledge of lightning E-field penetration into the ionosphere, and resultant
ionization and plasma wave generation. This work should permit the joining of
transient measurements of satellites with those of the IS radars, so that the
entire structure from the lower ionosphere to the magnetosphere can be analyzed
in unison.
