This award supports the research in number theory, arithmetic groups, and
automorphic forms of Professor Avner Ash of Ohio State University. Dr. Ash's
project centers on the cohomology of the group of n-by-n integral matrices with
determinant 1, and will follow two main paths. These are the study of the
structure of the cohomology as a module for the Hecke algebra, and computer-
aided calculation of cohomology groups in the case where n is 3. Except for
counting, number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole
numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics. In modern days, problems in number
theory have furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the
fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most
astonishing applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer
science and coding theory.
