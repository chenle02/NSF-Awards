This cooperative research award supports Sunil Agrawal, and a graduate student
from the University of Delaware to collaborate with Gerd Hirzinger and Richard
Schwertassek of the Institute for Robotics and System Dynamics at the German
Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The
research will lead to the development of a laboratory simulator for the capture
and repair of satellites in space which can be used to train astronauts. Several
German aerospace firms are contributing to the research funding on the German
side, and the collaboration gives the U.S. group access to world-class German
expertise. The laboratory simulator will be used to validate theoretical studies
on space robots and in planning future space missions.
