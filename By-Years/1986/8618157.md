Abstract Research on mammals, such as various types of rats and deer, has shown
crowding to be associated with a variety of deleterious consequences for the
overcrowded animals. In sociological theory, crowding (or density) has also been
thought to be associated with adverse social consequences. However, among
humans, studies of crowding in the United States and in Canada have produced
inconsistent results. Different study results may be due to the fact that
crowding in North America tends to vary only from low to moderate when viewed in
global terms. Perhaps there is a crowding "threshold;" that is, some number of
persons per household above which the adverse effects of crowding may be
observed. Bangkok, Thailand is a highly appropriate site in which to conduct
this type of research because of the extreme rates of crowding found in some
Thai communities. This study brings together American and Cambodian research
teams. Their survey, in metropolitan Bankok, will assess whether a greater
density of persons in households is associated with more stress related physical
illnesses (e.g. hypertension, angina) and greater tension between spouses and
between parents and children. The investigators' crowding--stress model will be
assessed with Lisrel analysis.
