Primary crystallization ages may have been preserved in several metamorphosed
igneous rocks of the Adirondack Mountains of New York. Preliminary data
indicates a major plutonic event at 1100-1140 Ma followed by granulite facies
metamorphism at ~1050 Ma. This project will date additional samples to fix the
age of anorthosite emplacement, to establish the emplacement ages and regional
relationships of mangeritic-charnockitic rocks which envelope the anorthosites
and to develop a regionally consistent evolutionary history of these rocks.
