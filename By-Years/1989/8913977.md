This research addresses Three Dimensional Printing, a process for the
manufacture of tooling and functional prototype parts directly from computer
models. The process offers the critical advantages of rapid part turnaround and
minimal investment in tooling. Three Dimensional Printing functions by the
deposition of powdered material in layers and the selective binding of the
powder by "ink-jet" printing of a binder material. Following the sequential
application of layers, the unbound powder is removed, resulting in a complex
three dimensional part. The process may be applied to the production of metal,
ceramic, and metal/ceramic composite parts. Initially, the focus will be on the
manufacture of ceramic parts and will be applied to the rapid fabrication of
molds for metal casting and the rapid fabrication of preforms for metal matrix
composites.
