With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry
Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Ralf Warmuth of Rutgers University
New Brunswick conducts research to construct "dynamic nanocapsules" in water for
entrapping proteins and studying the effects of encapsulation on protein
activity. Specifically, the Warmuth group is developing methodologies for the
one-pot multi-component synthesis of different nanometer-sized molecular
capsules using reversible acylhydrazone chemistry. Kinetic and mechanistic
investigations will be performed to gain insights into the dynamic features and
stability of these capsules. The role of solvents for the formation of these
capsules will be examined. In addition, this research group will explore
methodologies for the encapsulation of insulin inside a water-soluble
rhombicuboctahedral nanocapsule. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of
thermodynamically controlled synthesis of nanocapsules and the studies of these
capsules will advance knowledge in supramolecular chemistry and have impacts on
nanoscience and nanotechnology. The investigation of the potential of these
nanocapsules to entrap and influence the properties of the encapsulated proteins
(especially insulin) would provide insights into methods for controlling protein
activities and would broadly impact biological and medical fields. Furthermore,
this project will provide multidisciplinary research training for graduate,
undergraduate, and high school students.
