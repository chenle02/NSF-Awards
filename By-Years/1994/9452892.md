9452892 Boudjouk Funds are requested to continue the effort in North Dakota to
build a permanent infrastructure in science, engineering and mathematics (SEM)
that provides 1) incentives and means for researchers to compete effectively for
merit-based grants and contracts, 2) programs for students in grades 10 - 16,
and, 3) programs for North Dakota businesses to link with SEM talent at North
Dakota University System colleges. Key features of the Strategic Improvement
Plan are: 1) Strengthening of existing and emerging research clusters with
potential to achieve national and international prominence. Two clusters
(Supramolecular Protein Complexes, Main Group Chemistry), will continue to
receive support, although at diminishing levels during the grant period.
Following rigorous screening and evaluation, new clusters will be developed. 2)
A multi-component program composed of: undergraduate research and mentoring
programs; a program targeting potential women scientists and another to
facilitate the transition from high school science activities to undergraduate
research programs; pilot technology transfer programs linking students and
faculty with local industries; and a program to remove barriers to success in
obtaining Human Resource Development and Systemic Reform grants. Programs with
North Dakota's Tribal Community Colleges: summer workshops for students, and
academic year workshops for faculty at our five Tribal Community Colleges.
