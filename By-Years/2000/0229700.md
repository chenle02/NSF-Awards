The Hugh Moore Historical Park and Museum will develop an integrated framework
of exhibits on the science and technology of canals and inland waterways at the
National Canal Museum (NCM) in Easton, PA., which will serve as a model for
interdisciplinary public education and exhibit programs at other canal history
organizations in more than 28 states, primarily east of the Mississippi River.
Representatives from major waterway and industrial history sites and museums
across the nation will work with NCM staff and a national advisory panel of
leading informal science educators to develop, design and disseminate a series
of interactive science exhibits that can travel or be replicated in museums,
parks and organizations that interpret inland waterways and related industrial
sites
