This is a pilot project to provide nine undergraduate faculty members with the
opportunity to keep up with the newest advances in microbiology (immunology,
medical microbiology, and molecular biology) by working on a one-to-one basis
with a mentor who is a research scientist in one of those specialties. The
participants will attend the 1990 Annual meeting of the American Society of
Microbiology and then visit the mentor's laboratory for a month during the
summer, during which time the participant will be exposed to the mentor's
research program. This will be followed by a two-day visit of the mentor to the
participant's institution. A Steering Committee will select the participants and
the mentors, with an eye toward substantial participation by women and
minorities. The steering committee will also evaluate the success of the program
- how the participants' knowledge of these areas of biology was enhanced, and
how they incorporated these new areas into their teaching. A.S.M. will make an
in-kind contribution to cover the time spent by the senior personnel on the
project.
