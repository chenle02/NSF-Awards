This project investigates the synthesis and processing of mixed barium lead
titanate crystals for use as a new nonlinear optical material with improved
properties. Barium titanate is widely used as a photorefractive optical
material, but is not suitable for nonlinear optical applications such as
frequency doubling and parametric amplification. The addition of lead to form
the mixed barium lead titanate crystal increases the spontaneous polarization
and could possibly increase the birefringence and the nonlinear susceptibility.
Major emphasis of the project will be on a study of the crystal growth
parameters necessary for growth of large, homogeneous single crystals of good
optical quality; a detailed program of materials characterization will also be
performed utilizing optical, X-ray, and chemical analyses. Many of the
fundamental properties being addressed on this project will be of interest for
technological applications, such as optical data processing.
