Morehouse and Spelman Colleges will plan and design a collaborative center in
Socially Relevant Computing. The center will provide interdisciplinary
education, research, and workforce development for African American
undergraduate computer science students, particularly those who are at risk for
degree completion. In addition, the center will create an ecosystem of partners
to conduct research that leads to innovations to address critical societal
problems of national priority and demonstrated interventions to increase the
representation of African Americans in graduate school and the STEM workforce.

The principal investigators will implement the proposed project in multiple
stages that include an internal assessment of capability and infrastructure
requirements, an external assessment of relevant existing computer science
centers for benchmarking, curriculum enhancements, and a pilot education
research project to test an evidence-based socially relevant computing
intervention concept. The project will help articulate strategies for developing
degree pathways to increase persistence in computing for African Americans.
