In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Hales will conduct theoretical and experimental research on
the properties of boron-halide clusters. Candidate species include B2F5(+),
B2Br5(+), B2Br3(+) and others. The structures of these complexes are predicted
to be similar to those of BnHn(2-) and BnXn, where X = Cl, Br, or I. The goal of
this research is to verify these predictions. This research will be conducted
with the assistance of undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ion-molecule
chemistry is one of the core areas of contemporary chemical research. This
project deals with the structure of clusters of boron halides and other species
related to plasma processing of semiconductors. Computational modeling of the
observed ions complements the experimental work. These cast light on the
structures of the cluster ions and on ion-molecule processes that lead to those
structures. This research is conducted with the assistance of undergraduate
students. They will receive training in one of the contemporary forefront areas
of physical chemistry in preparation for advanced studies or entry into the
scientific/technological workforce.&lt;br/&gt;
