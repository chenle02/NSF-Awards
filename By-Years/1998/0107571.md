This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Dynamic species
interactions, uncertainty and the maintenance of ecosystem robustness." The
interplay between community complexity and stability is the source of one of the
classic debates in ecology. Heterogeneous spatial and temporal species
distributions and trophic interactions, though central to the debate, have been
studied little. To address these issues this research develops new computational
methods to parameterize, simulate, and analyze a multi-species, multi-patch
model.
