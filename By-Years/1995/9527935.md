Orville/Abstract The objectives of this research are to 1) combine all valid
data to compare the infrared satellite cold cloud histories, cloud- to-ground
lightning histories, and cell structure using the ship radar volume scans during
the TOGA COARE period (Dec. 1992-Mar. 1993), 2) construct sounding data
appropriate for each case, 3) derive the convective available potential energy
(CAPE), seeking differences in the environment between MCS's which produce
lightning from those cloud systems that do not produce lightning. In addition,
we will 4) determine the detection efficiency of the advanced lightning
direction finder (ALDF) as a function of range and azimuth using waveform
digitized lightning data obtained at Kavieng, Papua New Guinea, and 5) determine
the sensitivity of the ALDF to intracloud lightning flashes.
