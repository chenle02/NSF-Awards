This project is concerned with the development of software implementing new
matrix decomposition algorithms which have been formulated for solving the
systems of linear algebraic equations arising when orthogonal spline collocation
(that is, spline collocation at Gauss points) is applied to certain separable,
second order, linear problems on rectangular regions. Two classes of algorithms
will be examined. In the first, the approximate solution is a piecewise Hermite
bicubic defined on a uniform mesh, while the second provides approximations of
arbitrarily high order on nonuniform partitions. The new algorithms, which are
modular and possess a great deal of natural parallelism, also have application
in the solution of nonseparable boundary value problems, problems on general
regions, and time dependent problems. The new software will be written in
Fortran and developed for use on various shared memory machines.
