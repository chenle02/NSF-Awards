This research focuses on the mechanical behavior of composite materials during
fabrication and during failure. The myriad choices available to the designer of
composites, combines with the diversity of phenomena which may occur at the
various stages of processing and service make modeling of critical importance.
Analytical and numerical techniques will be developed and used, supported by
carefully designed model experiments where appropriate, to provide guidelines
for the material designer. Two topics initially to be explored are crack growth
at ductile/brittle interfaces and the effect of damage of sintering of ceramic
composites. The former will involve the development of a steady-state algorithm
of rather general utility, the latter the incorporation of a constitutive
description of a damaged powder matrix into a detailed model of composite
sintering. Each is an example of a micromechanical process with significant
macroscopic consequences for the reliability of composite materials.
