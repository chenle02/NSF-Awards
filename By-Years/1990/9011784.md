This research is to analyze data collected by the new IRIS/NSF PASSCAL seismic
instruments deployed in the Santa Cruz Mountains within hours of the Loma Prieta
earthquake. The objective is to investigate the seismic velocity structure in
the epicentral region using three-dimensional seismic imaging techniques
involving both P and S waves. Earlier work has suggested that the nature of the
seismic activity is controlled by the mechanical properties of the material
along the fault, both in terms of the ability to store strain energy along the
fault and the possible existence of competent crustal blocks that force a change
in fault geometry. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
