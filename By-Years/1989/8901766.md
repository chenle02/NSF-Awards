Each area of investigation relates to geometric questions in the theory of
functions of complex and real variables. Functions of interest include both
holomorphic and quasiconformal mappings. This work includes a continuing effort
to find simple geometric conditions that can be used to determine if a domain in
Euclidean space can support the Poincare inequality. This is actually a class of
inequalities measuring the integral of (the absolute value of) a function
against the integral of a power of the function's gradient. The inequality
provides information as to whether or not certain boundary value problems in
partial differential equations can be solved on the given domain. The best
results to date have been obtained for two-dimensional domains. Evidence
suggests that any general criterion will involve the behavior of a particular
non-Euclidean metric attached to a domain. Work is also planned on the influence
of differentiation on the distribution of roots of entire functions. More
specifically, real entire functions having only real roots are under
consideration. It is not true that roots of the derivative must also be real,
and one main objective of this work is to measure the number of non-real roots
that one can expect on successive differentiation. Ultimately, one would like to
get asymptotic estimates on the number of roots, to attack a long-standing
conjecture of Polya. A third area of investigation concerns spaces of
holomorphic functions which are area integrable - Bergman spaces. Analysis of
the mapping properties of such functions is pertinent to the theory of
quasiconformal mappings. Many such mappings may share the same boundary values.
Among them will be maps which have extreme dilatations. A characterization of
the extremal mappings has never been obtained. This work seeks to use the
Bergman spaces to show that for nonconstant extreme dilatations, the argument of
such functions cannot be too limited.
