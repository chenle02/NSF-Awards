The goal of this proposal is to examine the molecular basis of the
physiological phenomenon termed `competence' which is used here to describe the
appearance of responsiveness to a hormone that results in the expression of new
genes. The appearance of the competent state is thought to be due to structural
changes in regulatory regions of these genes that permit the binding of
proteins, such as hormone receptors and other transcriptional factors, to
specific nucleotide sequences. This study should help us to understand how
hormones regulate gene expression. Two genes expressed during egg development in
the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, will be examined; a vitellogenin and a vitelline
envelope protein gene, both of which are under the control of 20-
hydroxyecdysone. We have shown that the vitellogenin gene of the newly enclosed
adult female is not capable of responding to 20- hydroxyecdysone, and that
competence to respond appears during the first two days after eclosion in
response to juvenile hormone. We propose to use a mobility shift assay to follow
changes in the binding of proteins to the regulatory regions of these two genes
during the acquisition of competence and after exposure to 20- hydroxyecdysone
and juvenile hormone.
