The proposed research program is a collaboration between the University of New
Mexico, Air Products, and Sandia National Laboratories. It is aimed at the
development of a new class of ceramic membranes based on inorganic silicate
polymers synthesized be sol-gel processing. Using concepts of polymer physics,
fractal geometry, and drying theory, the project develops strategies to tailor
the membrane pore diameters within the range 0.2 - 3.0 nm appropriate for
ultrafiltration and molecular separation of gaseous and liquid mixtures. Because
the membranes are amorphous polymers rather than polycrystalline solids, the
pore size is not limited by particle size as in normal ceramics. Moreover, phase
transitions and grain growth are avoided. The gels and gel- derived films are
characterized by surface acoustic wave methods, by imaging ellipsometry, and NMR
proton spin relaxation. Such ceramic membranes have excellent thermal, chemical,
and mechanical stability and can be used in gas separations and industrial waste
treatment. This proposal is jointly supported by NSF and the Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI), following a special NSF-EPRI research initiative on
polymeric materials.
