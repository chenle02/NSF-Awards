A study of C-isotopic composition and Cd and Ba concentration in pore waters
from Atlantic and Pacific box cores together with C-13 and Cd/Ca and Ba/Ca
ratios of benthic forminiferal tests in same samples. The objective is to
document the any relationship between these chemical traces in pore waters and
forminiferal tests that can the be used as a paleoenvironmental tool in
microhabitat studies of the past.
