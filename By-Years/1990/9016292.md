Western Washington University proposes to implement a Minorities in Marine
Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) at the Shannon Point Marine Center. This
program will recruit minority undergraduates for two quarters of their junior
year. Approximately eight minority students will join other WWU students in an
educational program that combines an initial phase of specialized group
instruction, followed by formal courses in an integrated setting. The Winter
Quarter provides fundamental training in the physical, chemical and biological
processes basic to marine science; workshops on use of sophisticated analytical
instrumentation; participation in monitoring and research projects; a journal
club; and field trips. The Spring Quarter includes three marine science courses.
Students will receive 30 credits for these two quarters. WWU has allocated a
faculty position to Shannon Point to supervise the program.
