The ultimate goal of this research is to visualize, in intact cells, the
structure of any gene. When gene expression is regulated at the level of
transcription, changes in the structure of the gene are responsible for inducing
changes in gene expression. These functional differences in gene structure are
initiated and maintained by the interaction of regulatory proteins and
chromosomal proteins with the gene, and possibly, by the formation of altered
structures within the DNA helix. Dr. Becker is developing a set of photochemical
methods, which, when taken together, is allowing one to detect as well as
specify those elements of a gene's structure that are responsible for regulating
its activity. This approach is based on earlier work which demonstrated that
ultraviolet light can detect, at single nucleotide resolution, protein DNA
contacts in whole cells. By directly probing gene structure in vivo rather than
in vitro, potentially inaccurate or incomplete conclusions regarding the role of
gene structure in regulating gene expression will be avoided. The ability to
rapidly sequence any gene has revolutionized biology. Here the next level of
organization, the structure of the gene, is being attacked. By determining the
protein - DNA interactions and altered DNA structures within a gene general
organizational principles for rendering the genetic message biologically active,
stable, and inheritable will be uncovered.
