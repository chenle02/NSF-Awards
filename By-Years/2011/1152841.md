This research aims to understand the interaction of language and culture on the
perception of color. The Standard Model of color vision asserts that the visual
system of all humans with normal color vision is organized around six
fundamental sensations in a color-opponent fashion: red vs. green, blue vs.
yellow, and black vs. white. Yet most of the world languages do not have a
specific term for the colors that English speakers call "blue." Some speakers
use a word meaning black, others use the term gray to mean blue, and still
others use a single word that means green-or-blue. In what sense, then, is the
mental representation of color in these individuals "color-opponent" if
identical names are given to two sensations that fall on two presumptively
independent color dimensions? How do the language differences affect how people
think about color? To answer this, color naming studies will examine in detail
the structures of the named color categories in monolingual American English
speakers and a group of recent immigrants from Somalia who now live in Columbus,
OH. The Somalis, who do not yet speak English, do not use a specific word for
blue. Experiments based on color sorting and similarity, which do not require a
color name response, will examine the possibility that classical color-opponency
is observable in their non-language representation of color. Control studies of
spectral sensitivity and discrimination will test for the possible interplay
between cultural and sensory factors (including congenital and acquired
impairments in color vision) in shaping an individual's mental representation of
color.

This research will contribute to understanding the foundational processes by
which innate and cultural factors shape an individual's understanding of their
world. In addition, it will bring the Somalis, who came to the US as refugees
from political upheaval, into a research environment in a university and will
give students a better understanding of people from a vastly different culture.
