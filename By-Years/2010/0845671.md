With the continuing proliferation of wireless technology, a wide spectrum of
emerging applications using this technology will be tightly interwoven into the
fabric of our everyday lives: wireless sensor networks can monitor personal
health or critical infrastructures. The viability and success of many of these
applications critically hinges on the availability of the underlying wireless
communication. As wireless networks become increasingly pervasive, the problem
of radio interference and jamming will be inevitable, raising a serious threat
to the availability of wireless services. To enable the continuous and highly-
available data delivery services over the entire lifetime of wireless networks
in support of wireless applications, it is crucial that the wireless networks
have built-in strong defense mechanisms against interference and
jamming.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a suite of holistic
solutions that monitor the radio environment and provide quick recovery to
interrupted services in case of jamming or radio interference. In contrast to
traditional techniques, such as spread spectrum which requires costly new
hardware, the proposed techniques involve networks to manage their resources
collaboratively across all layers to assure the availability of network
services, leveraging existing commodity wireless platforms. Through the
interaction with industry partners, the project results are expected to provide
guidance for coping with jamming in future network architecture. &lt;br/&gt; The
educational component of this project seeks to prepare students to face the
challenges of rapidly evolving technologies in wireless networks. The
experimental and design components of this project will enhance both the
undergraduate and graduate students? education in related areas.
