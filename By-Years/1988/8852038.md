This project enhances the upper level computer science offerings at this
institution by providing students with high-efficiency work stations and
specialized programming tools. The laboratory that supports this project
includes networked SUN workstations and such software as Franz Extended Common
Lisp, Smalltalk, MProlog, Ada and expert systems tools. Using this laboratory,
students are exposed to some pratical programming projects that would not be
possible using conventional microcomputers. This award is being matched by an
equal sum from the grantee.
