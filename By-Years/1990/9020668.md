This grant will help fund the Fifth Copper Mountain Conference on Multigrid
Methods to be held March 31 through April 5, 1991. The topics of emphasis are
hypersonic flow, adaptive methods, large structures, transport processes,
particle physics, parallel computation, and large-scale applications software.
These topics will be addressed by the invited speakers, in the special sessions
and the workshops, and by the panel. Other sessions of contributed papers will
also be held. In order to provide the novice with a basic understanding of
multigrid and its processes, four one-hour introductory lectures on multigrid
techniques will be offered the first morning of the conference.
