The conference, to be held in June 2001 in Charleston, SC, will focus on
computational procedures for developing and studying the network of connections
between proteins. The networks of connections between proteins in genomes have
to be built by a combination of experimental studies, knowledge-based methods,
sequence analysis and structural approaches that are both fast and insensitive
to inaccuracies. The Advisory Committee is committed to attending the
conference, which will be on the order of 100 participants. The PI is committed
to involving junior researchers and under-represented groups as speakers and
participants in this conference.
