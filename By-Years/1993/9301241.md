This award is concerned with the representations of reductive groups in prime
characteristic and of related infinitesimal groups, as well as of quantum groups
at a root of unity. The principal investigator will investigate construction of
graded structures on representation categories of restricted Lie algebras and
their quantum analogues; explicit bounds for the truth of Lusztig's conjecture
and investigation of its failure for small primes; applications of deformation
categories to get more precise information on endomorphism algebras and
projective functors; and cohomology varieties for higher Frobenius kernels and
their quantum analogues. A group is an algebraic structure with an operation
defined on it. A group is called an algebraic group if its elements satisfy a
polynomial identity. Algebraic groups are important for several different areas
of mathematics, as well as physics.
