9500119 German A three-dimensional microscopic image analysis system will be
purchased with funds partially supplied by this grant. The equipment to be
purchased will allow the dissection and analysis of virtually all engineering
materials on a layer by layer basis using a microtome with micromilling
capabilities. The image analysis system will then reassemble a series of two-
dimensional planer images into a three-dimensional construct that will show the
microstructural features in the original environment. The situation envisioned
is similar to the modern CAT scans used in medicine. This should provide insight
into phenomena that are poorly understood at present. ***
