NorthWestNet over a 56 kbps line. Faculty and students will benefit from access
to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In
addition, they will be able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at
other institutions in pursuit of research and educational projects. The award
provides partial support of the project for two years.
