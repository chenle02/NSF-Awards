The Ohio LSAMP Alliance is a new alliance among 7 four-year institutions
(Central State University, the University of Cincinnati, Cleveland State
University, Miami University, The Ohio State University, Wilberforce University,
and Wright State University), 4 community colleges (Cincinnati State Technical
and Community College, Columbus State Community College, Cuyahoga Community
College, and Sinclair Community College), community partners, and an Industry
Advisory Board. The purpose of this alliance is to significantly increase
underrepresented minority (URM) student recruitment, retention, persistence, and
attainment of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees.
The goal of the program is to double the number of underrepresented minority
baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines at partner institutions within five
years. Programming includes the following alliance-wide activities: articulation
agreements and credit transfers, Ohio LSAMP Alliance Conference, innovative
curricular reforms in mathematics, interactive web site, sharing of online
courses, cyber-enabled sharing of workshops, diversity sensitivity training,
collaborative faculty mentoring, and production of Ohio LSAMP Alliance
brochures, programs, and other materials. In addition, each institution will
provide programming that includes advisement and counseling, residential summer
bridge and early arrival programs, undergraduate research internships with
stipends, faculty and peer mentoring, and tutoring or supplemental instruction.
