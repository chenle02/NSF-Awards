This is an innovative study of heat transfer augmentation employing oscillating
fluid motion. The work is a 2-year effort devoted to a better understanding of
the mixing process which occurs at the end of capillaries, and will be based on
a theoretical approach. This study can lead to a major advancement of heat
transfer enhancement technology.
