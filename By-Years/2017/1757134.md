This research is concerned with the incentives and rewards to innovation, and
their impacts on economic development, growth and welfare. The investigator
examines three related questions as follows: Is innovation going to the right
areas? Are the incentives for innovation and diffusion of new ideas appropriate?
What constitutes the innovation capital of the economy? By addressing these
questions from a novel perspective, this research will advance our knowledge
about some of the most important issues that relate to national prosperity and
welfare. The investigator also identifies a new source of market failure that is
very likely to attract future research in this area.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
research contains three projects. The first is concerned with where innovation
resources go, how they are allocated across different R&amp;D areas. The theory
developed shows that the market allocates excessive innovation resources to high
return areas relative to the social optima, as appeared to be the case in the
dot.com boom. The source of the inefficiency is the lack of property rights on
open problems that combined with R&amp;D resources, give rise to innovations. It
is a novel contribution of this project to recognize this source of
inefficiency, and examine the specific channels and its potential magnitude. The
second project is concerned with the incentives to innovate versus imitate and
the interaction of the two forces in driving growth. Intellectual property
rights affect the way in which innovators and imitators split the surplus
created by knowledge transfer. This project further examines the impact on long
run growth and welfare. The third project examines quantitatively the role of
firms vis-a-vis inventors as sources of innovation and the properties of the
match between the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
