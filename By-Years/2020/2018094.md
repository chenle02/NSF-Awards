Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines what causes stock market
jumps by exploring and characterizing next-day newspaper accounts of daily stock
market moves both in the United States and a range of other countries. This
project advances the body of knowledge in this area in both the scale and the
scope. The project examines over 5,000 stock market jumps in 15 countries back
to the 1900s and characterizes information on what triggered the jump through
human processing. The project further explores the geographic source of the
market-moving information, and the clarity of perceptions about the reasons for
the jump. Considering stock market jumps of different types and levels of
clarity indicate different downstream effects on market
volatility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores stock market jumps by
examining newspaper accounts over a long time period and for a large set of
countries. The project examines the significant role the United States plays in
global stock markets, particularly since 1980. The project further explores the
countercyclical role of government policy; jumps associated with monetary policy
and government spending are the most over-represented following negative non-
policy market moves. The project further investigates the impact of both the
cause and the clarity of stock market jumps on future market volatility. Jumps
driven by non-policy events and jumps that are less clearly attributed to a
single cause tend to have significant positive effects on volatility over the
next days and weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
