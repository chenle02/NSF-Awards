Semantic definitions for programming languages which are fully abstract are
needed in the construction of a mathematical framework for program optimization.
In particular, the observable behavior of program phrases in practical languages
needs to be captured. Today, denotational language specifications often make
artificial distinctions between program phrases with indistinguishable behavior.
A new approach based upon a realistic treatment of error values and error
propagation in models is utilized in this project. Sequential functions form an
ordinary Scott-domain under pointwise ordering in the presence of error elements
and can be represented as decision trees. This helps to implicitly describe how
errors are propagated. This approach will be used to define practical languages
such as FORTRAN, Pascal, C, ML, and Scheme.
