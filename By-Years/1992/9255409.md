The project involves two (Summer 1993, 1994), two-week summer workshops that
will provide undergraduate educators with an in- depth exposure to modern
theories and experimental techniques of polymer science and engineering. The
major goals are to provide background information and experience to stimulate
incorporation of these topics into undergraduate curricula. The program
emphasizes lectures on the prominent theories and experimental approaches by
renowned scientists and engineers and provides participants with hands-on
experience in several polymer science laboratories carrying out synthetic
procedures, measuring solution and solid state properties and examining surface
and bulk structures.
