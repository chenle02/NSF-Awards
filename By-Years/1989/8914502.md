This award supports an international workshop on econometrics and mathematical
economics to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from July 16-20, 1990. The U.S.
organizer is Arnold Zellner of the University of Chicago and his Brazilian
counterpart is Ruben Klein of the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing
in Rio. The participants will consist of statisticians and econometricians from
the U.S., Brazil and other countries. Thirteen will attend from the U.S. while
nine or more will come from Brazil, three from Mexico and one from Venezuela.
This workshop will be held just before the annual meeting of the Brazilian
National Symposium on Probability and Statistics and some of the attendees at
that meeting are expected to participate in the workshop. The main topic of the
workshop will be Bayesian inference and decision analysis techniques. Research
papers will be presented, affording the participants an excellent opportunity to
learn about current applied and theoretical research in such topics as: Bayesian
decision theory and applications, time series analysis, spatial statistics,
learning models and model selection techniques, computer programs and
comparisons of Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches. Applications to be covered
include analysis of spatial and time series data, forecasting problems,
financial economic analysis and firm decision problems. Some research contacts
have already been established among North, Central and South American Bayesian
researchers. This workshop will strengthen these contacts and promote further
joint research in this timely area.
