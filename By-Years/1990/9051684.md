The acquisition, setup, and incorporation of a computer- controlled viscometer
system and a laboratory filter press system into ceramic engineering curriculum
is supported. This equipment represents a significant modernization of available
instrumentation to support the teaching of ceramic processing of fine particle
systems. Most ceramic manufacturing deals with the processing of powder raw
materials. The ability to control these processed depends upon the engineer's
understanding of the governing cause-and- effect relationships. Although such
processes have been in use for many year, many details of these relationships
are only just becoming clear as computers and computer modelling techniques are
applied to these processing phenomena. The implementation of this equipment will
allow the effects of particle size distribution and surface chemistry on the
viscous properties of ceramic ware, to taught, graphically demonstrated, and
studied in depth. These principles form the very basis for the successful
processing of all ceramic -- traditional ceramics such as porcelains, electronic
ceramics including the new superconducting oxides, and structural ceramics.
