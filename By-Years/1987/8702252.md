The general goal of this research is to understand the cellular processes
involved in the activation of B-lymphocytes. These studies use as a model the
murine pre-B like cell line 70Z/3 which, when stimulated with either Interleukin
1 or gamma Interferon, differentiates from surface IgM negative to surface IgM
positive. The appearance of IgM on the cell surface requires new synthesis of
the kappa light chain. This proposal outlines early stages of a program designed
to trace the sequence of events from binding of the activating lymphokines to
expression of the kappa light chain gene. It focuses on the possible role of
changes in cellular ionic content and in membrane permeability to ions as
mediators of lymphokine action. Immediate plans include studies of the effects
of gamma Interferon on intracellular sodium, pH, chloride, calcium, and
magnesium, on membrane transport of these ions, and on membrane potential.
Changes in these parameters have been implicated in the mechanisms of action of
hormones and growth factors in other cell types, and results obtained in the
70Z/3 cells will be interpreted in the light of available information obtained
from other systems. Although much is being learned about the overall effects of
lymphokines as immunoregulatory hormones very little is yet known about the
detailed cellular mechanisms of their action. This study will examine the role
of ions in the cascade of intracellular events involved in lymphokine-mediated B
lymphocyte differentiation. It should provide important information about the
mechanism of action of lymphokines and enhance our overall understanding of the
regulation of the immune response.
