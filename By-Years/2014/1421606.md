Speed and power are key attributes of a digital electronic integrated circuit
that translate to system-level metrics such as response times and battery life
in electronic systems. With progress in technology, these performance parameters
are found to be increasingly dependent on thermal and mechanical stress in the
system. This stress may be intentionally introduced (intrinsic stress) to
enhance circuit performance, or may be unintentional (extrinsic stress) due to
design factors or due to the environment faced by individual transistors in the
circuit. The goal of this proposal is to enable a systematic and scientific
approach to full-chip performance analysis and optimization in the presence of
stress, through the development of (a) fast modeling approaches (b) optimization
techniques that invoke the modeling solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current
state of the art in stress modeling shows few to no significant approaches for
full-chip analysis of stress effects, and stress optimization is rarely
performed in a systematic way. This project will develop novel analytical and
semi-analytical modeling techniques that are computationally efficient and
scalable, permitting fast analysis of commonly encountered structures. The
approach will draw upon a toolbox of stress analysis frameworks, tailoring them
to on-chip environments and seeking new efficiencies. Full-chip analysis will be
performed by invoking the modeling techniques on critical segments of the design
to determine the drift in timing and power. The project will perform stress
optimization at both the pre-silicon stage and the post-silicon stage. The
research goals of the project will be supplemented by educational efforts as
well as technology transfer efforts to industry.
