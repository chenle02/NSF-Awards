A workshop on spatial and temporal aspects of ecological scaling as they relate
to exchanges of water, carbon, and energy in terrestrial ecosystems will be
conducted at Snowbird, Utah from December 2-5, 1990. It will focus on scaling
between leaf-level ecophysiological processes, the whole plant, the community,
the ecosystem, and the globe. Issues of scale dominate and constrain the
contributions of ecophysiology to global change research. Yet it is evident that
ecophysiologists, whose primary interests lie in mechanistic, process-level
studies, have not adequately considered linkages between their disciplines and
others interested in the ramifications of these processes at broader
geographical and longer temporal scales. This workshop will bring together
ecophysiologists, ecologists, biometeorologists, ecosystem ecologists, and
remote sensing specialists interested in the challenge of scaling to meet the
critical need of linking process- level and global scale interests. In content
and format, this workshop will be geared toward formulating the paradigms and
facilitating the contacts necessary to establish the role of ecophysiology in
the emerging field of earth system science.
