This award will support a BIORETS Workshop planned to be held in January, 2024,
at Florida International University in Miami, FL. BIORETS is the Research
Experience for Teachers (RET) Site program offered by the Directorate for
Biological Sciences (BIO). The BIORETS program enables active research by
cohorts of middle school teachers, high school teachers and community college
faculty. BIORETS sites focus on using the teachers’ research experiences to
develop curriculum, with the goal of enriching the teachers’ classroom teaching
practices and inspiring a broad swath of students to consider higher education
and careers in STEM.

The workshop will bring together mentors and teachers supported with an active
BIORETS awards. Approximately 40-60 participants will represent awards made in
FY22 and FY23. The goals of the workshop are to create a national BIORETS
community of practice, enhance networking between and among Sites, and share
promising practices in teacher engagement, curriculum development, and
mentoring. There will be discussions on sharing data resources and tools. The
deliverables from the workshop will include a report of promising practices,
tools, and other suggestions that will be valuable to both the BIORETS program
participants and the NSF. A major goal of the BIORETS program is to increase the
participation of underrepresented groups in biological research to enhance
ethnic, cultural, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
