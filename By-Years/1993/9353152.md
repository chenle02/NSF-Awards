SSC-9353152 Harvey Mudd College Claremont, CA Tanenbaum, Samuel B "Harvey Mudd
College Summer Science Institute" Harvey Mudd College request a three-year grant
of $197,490 to establish the Harvey Mudd College Summer Science Institute, a
commuter summer science program targeted to underrepresented students in grades
7 and 8 from the surrounding local school districts. The five week program will
offer students the opportunity to explore five different science and engineering
topics in-depth, and give them hands-on experience in highly motivating projects
especially designed to excite the enthusiasm of junior high students. Students
will also interact with representatives from industry and selected members of
the Harvey Mudd faculty and student body. Follow-up activities will be organized
during the academic year to further motivate the students to continue their
studies of science and mathematics, and ultimately pursue careers in technical
fields.
