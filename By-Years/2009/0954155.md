The research objective of this CAREER award is to develop a non invasive,
quantitative microscopy method with enhanced spatial resolution and depth
penetration for the study of collagen fibers in living biological systems such
as the cornea. The method, second-harmonic generation microscopy, is a nonlinear
optical process that allows detailed imaging without the need for stains or
contrast agents. The microscope would combine second harmonic nonlinear
scattering with three dimensional control of light polarization and software
analysis methods. The resulting system will enable noninvasive determination of
the spatial organization of collagen fibers, allowing differentiation between
fibrillar collagen types and assessment of collagen fiber spatial orientation
and spacing. The educational objective of this award is to promote optical
science and engineering education to the general public. To accomplish this, an
online educational YouTube series ("Photonics TV") on optics for high-school and
college students will be established. A hands-on optics module ("Optics Circus")
will be developed for middle school students, and a Minority Contributions to
Science and Technology Series set for use in the local community. More
