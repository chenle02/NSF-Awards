9724004 Hatcher This two-year award supports US-France cooperative research
between Philip Hatcher at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) and researchers
affiliated with INRIA (French National Institute for Research in Informatics and
Applied Mathematics) at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS-Lyons). The
UNH team are experts on the construction of compilers and run-time systems for
parallel computers. The ENS-Lyon researchers have recognized expertise in
design, transformation and validation of parallel proposals, as well as
expertise in programming environments based upon multithreading. These
complementary strengths will be brought together to study issues such as: the
utility of multithreaded implementations of data-parallel programming languages,
the compilation of Java programs for high performance execution on clusters of
multiprocessor PCs, and the utilization of thread migration to effect load
balancing in both data-parallel and Java programs.
