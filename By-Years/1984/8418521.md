This research is concerned with the application of gradient-index materials to
complex optical systems. During the past few years, a number of design
techniques and analytical tools for guided wave lenses were developed which are
shown to be mathematically equivalent to gradient-index lenses in bulk form for
wavelength dispersion, optical communication systems, propagation of water waves
in the deep ocean for energy focusing, and the propagation of seismic waves in
the earth's crust for oil exploration. The major areas to be studied include
design and fabrication of gradient-index systems without rotational symmetry, an
optical instrument for real-time measurement of the ion exchange process, and
guided wave devices using principles of gradient-index optics. Also, measurement
and characterization of gradient-index lenses operating at very high
temperatures are being investigated.
