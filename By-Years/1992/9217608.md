This project is attempting to engineering a bacterium, using no more than
currently available technology, intro an intracellular, seed-transmissible
endosymbiont that functions as a plant 'organelle'. The approach is based on a
screen designed to select directly for endosymbiosis. An SGER would allow us to
test the feasibility of the method. We will construct Bacillus subtilis Kan
(kanamycin-resistant) Hyg (hygromycin-resistant) Gus (B- glucuronidase); derive
L-forms from it; introduce these into tobacco protoplasts; select for callus
simultaneously resistant to Kan on the presence of endosymbiotic 'organelles'.
If this proves feasible, it would permit a full-scale research project to
develop conditions for optimization of selection and regeneration of
endosymbiotic callus into whole plants. Several arguments suggest the approach
is feasible in principle. These include not only the straightforward selection
and simple technology, but also the large number of endosymbioses found in
nature, and particularly the reports of laboratory-induced endosymbiosis in
Amoeba and plant cells. %%% Organelle engineering would allow plants to be
equipped with agronomically valuable metabolic and physiological capabilities
that are too complex to be introduced by gene transfer, would also provide a
practical system for system endosymbiosis in the laboratory.
