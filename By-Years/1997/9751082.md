This project is introducing students to the applications of Gas Chromatography
Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) in the separation and identification of components in
a mixture. Exposure to the technique depends on a student's major. General
chemistry students enrolled in the course for non-science-majors are performing
at least one introductory experiment based on guided, hands-on experience. Both
chemistry majors and science majors with organic and analytical chemistry
requirements are being exposed to the technique throughout their academic
careers with a series a experiments designed to increase their level of
proficiency. *
