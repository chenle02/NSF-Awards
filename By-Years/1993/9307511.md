Experimental and theoretical studies of the radiative properties of atoms that
are in the presence of a phase- conjugate mirror (PCM) are proposed. The studies
will investigate the prediction from quantum theory that an atom in its ground
state is spontaneously excited when the atoms is radiatively coupled to a PCM.
These results would confirm that the description of this system using classical
field theory is inadequate to describe the effect of the PCM on the atoms. The
PCM will be based on the nonlinear optical process of four- wave mixing in a
potassium vapor cell. The quantum-noise properties of the PCM will be
characterized as a precursor to the primary goal of the proposed research.
Additional experimental and theoretical studies on the radiative properties of
atoms in the presence of a phase- conjugate resonator will also be made. These
studies offer the possibility of studying the behavior of a collection of atoms
when a fraction of the field modes to which the atoms are coupled are in a
squeezed vacuum state.
