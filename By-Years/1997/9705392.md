ECS-9705392 Yao This project is motivated by two recent developments at the IBM
T.J. Watson Research Center concerning the scheduling and resource management in
computer operating systems: (1) implementation of the so-called "time-function
scheduling" in both OS/400 (the operating system for IBM's AS/400 product line)
and AIX (the UNLX-based operating system for IBM's RS/6000 product line); and
(2) a prototype scheduler for distributed-memory, multiprocessor environments
(e.g., IBM's SP2 and clusters of workstations), which integrates several
scheduling paradigms such as gang scheduling and load-sharing scheduling. In
both cases, through extensive theoretical studies, in addition to empirical
studies, it has been found that the schedulers provide effective and flexible
control of resources that achieves a diverse set of scheduling objectives and
improves the performance of a variety of applications in large and complex
scientific and engineering applications. What we propose here is to explore and
establish the control-theoretic foundation of these schedulers, and in return
further enhance the dynamic scheduling and resource management protocols in
high-performance operating systems. Specifically, we propose to study the
mathematical structure of the schedulers in the context of discrete-event
systems. Some of the PI's recent works in this area have established the
connection between the optimality of simple control rules of a wide class of
discrete-event systems and discrete mathematical structures such as matroid and
antimatroid. Here, we want to explore related structures such as polymatroid and
extended polymatroid, which are associated with conservation laws and
generalized conservation laws of many stochastic systems, so as to bring out the
effectiveness, or in some cases, optimality, of the schedulers. We also propose
to implement the theoretical results for empirical studies, by way of adding new
features to the prototype testbeds at Watson.
