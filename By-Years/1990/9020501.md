The fundamental problem of obtaining the parameters of the model (assumed) of a
physical system from measured samples of its output response to a known input,
is one that impacts on many different and important fields of interest.
Naturally, it has a long and continuing history. The purpose of this work is to
break fresh ground by utilizing a new simple deterministic theory founded
squarely on well established passive network concepts. Specifically, the
approach is used to achieve two main goals: 1) stable rational minimum-phase
transfer functions can be identified without a priori knowledge of either
numerator or denominator degrees, and 2) stable rational minimum-phase Pade-like
approximations appear to be generated automatically in the nonrational case.
Detailed theoretical analysis of the basic ideas and extensive numerical
simulation will be carried out.
