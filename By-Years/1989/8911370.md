This proposal develops a theoretical model for explaining the formation of
strategic alliances in new high technology ventures and proposes to test it on
an existing data base collected between 1978 and 1986. The data base, which
contains information on strategic alliances among 105 semiconductor firms, is
considered to be very comprehensive. Of particular interest is the proposed
development of an explanation for how new firms faced with substantial
technological and financial risk typically plan activities and devote
organizational resources to survive the developmental period. Key considerations
in the proposed model include the degree of risk from new technology
development, the extent and type of organizational resources, the
characteristics of the founding management team, and environmental variability.
The project combines an advancement of organizational theory with an improved
understanding of an important real-world industry, and promises to provide
important additional information of general interest on the organizational
characteristics andstrategies of start.up ventures.
