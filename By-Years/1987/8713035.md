Research experiences for undergraduates will be offered through the Caltech
Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program. The SURF program was
started in 1979 and from 1979-1987 621 students participated in research
projects. During the 10-week period in the summer the students will participate
in technical seminars, roundtable discussions and communications workshops. Ten
students will be selected from institutions where research opportunities may be
relatively limited including Historically Black Institutions (HBUs). Contacts
with the Atlanta University Center, Howard University, Jackson State Univeristy,
and Morehouse University have already been established. Undergraduate research
experiences will include developing new algorithms or scientific codes and
systems software for the hypocube, and working within-house hardware development
projects. An award of $39,500 is highly recommended for this meritorious project
under the REU programs.
