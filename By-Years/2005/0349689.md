This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II will develop and
commercialize electrochemically operated devices that will revolutionize the
oral hygiene industry by providing an on-demand generation of mouthwash in a
portable device and in an irrigator. The mouthwash generated in these devices
will be effective in controlling halitosis and dental plaque and will also
provide tooth whitening. In the Phase I study, all of the proposed objectives
and specified criteria of success were accomplished to amply establish the proof
of concept and feasibility of the project. In Phase II, further optimization of
the parameters will be followed by the design and fabrication of prototypes in
conjunction with a prominent company dealing with turnkey manufacturing, and the
testing of 100 portable units in a clinical setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial impact of this project will be in the area of oral hygiene products.
It is broadly estimated that up to 85 million Americans have halitosis, and over
35 million suffer from periodontal disease. Thus, the cost effective devices to
be developed in this project are expected to have a large market potential in
the $ 4.7 billion oral care industry. &lt;br/&gt;
