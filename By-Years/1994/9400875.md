9400875 Sundaram This award funds the research of Professor Sheila Sundaram in
algebraic combinatorics. In particular Prof. Sundaram will the homology of
subposets of the partition lattice. She will try to establish that Whitney
homology modules associated to certain posets are in fact permutation modules.
This conjecture has implications regarding refinements of the tangent and
Genocchi numbers. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,
which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. At its roots,
combinatorics is the study of systematic counting and arrangement. Counting can
be incredibly difficult when the objects are difficult to list, and
combinatorists look for general methods for overcoming these difficulties.
Today's combinatorics makes use of a wide variety of the most advanced and
modern mathematical techniques. Although its roots go back several centuries,
the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades. This growth
comes from its importance in communications and information technology and from
the success of modern techniques to problems of counting. ***
