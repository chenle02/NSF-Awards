The objective of this research is to undertake data analysis for the NSF-
sponsored ACTpol and AdvACTpol experiments. These experiments are seeking to
better understand the thermal radiation (known as the cosmic microwave
background, or CMB) left over from the time of recombination in Big Bang
cosmology. The ACT is the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, a 6m-diameter millimeter
wavelength telescope located at 17,000 ft elevation in northern Chile. Broader
impacts of the work include mentoring of female undergraduates, and research
training of graduate students and a postdoc. The awardee will also visit
elementary schools and museums to lead astronomy education activities as part of
the Project ASTRO program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on CMB
science including inflation and lensing B modes, and CMB weak lensing. The
former informs our knowledge of cosmic inflation during the big bang, and the
latter can provide information on the mass of neutrinos. Millimeter sky
simulations with polarization will also be created.
