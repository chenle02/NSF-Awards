Proposal ID: 0233710 PI: Herbert Lee Title: Bayesian methods for spatio-
temporal, inverse, and multi-resolution problems

Abstract

The principal investigator and his collaborators study a new class of spatial
models derived from the convolution representation of Gaussian process models.
By expanding the class of distributions for the underlying process being
convolved, the result is a range of flexible spatial models that are especially
useful for inverse problems and spatial processes over time. The research
specifically examines convolutions of Markov random fields and convolutions of
temporally evolving processes. The researchers also explore the use of coupled
chains, parallel computing, and surrogate modeling to develop efficient
computational methods for this computationally intensive modeling approach.

Spatio-temporal models have a broad spectrum of applications, and the
development of more flexible models is a problem of high priority. The
motivation for the models developed under this project comes from an inverse
problem in hydrology and a space-time problem from meteorology. The research,
that addresses both theoretical and methodological aspects in a Bayesian
framework, will develop models that are useful for dealing with multiple scales,
a phenomenon encountered in physical processes in both hydrology and
meteorology.
