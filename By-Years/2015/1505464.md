It is widely believed that the most fundamental constituents of some of the most
common elementary particles are quarks, and their anti-matter counterpart, anti-
quarks. By probing the existence and structure of these particles, it is
possible to learn about the underlying principles governing quark and anti-quark
matter. The work in this project will use data collected at the Belle experiment
at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) laboratory in Japan
to measure the formation of particles known as mesons that consist of a quark-
antiquark pair. By studying these mesons, one can probe fundamental physics
processes such as Charge Parity (CP) violation, rare meson decays and the
existence of possible exotic particles which could indicate the presence of Dark
Matter. This effort has a particular focus on the support of students, thereby
contributing to the development of a much-needed high tech workforce.

Belle is built around the interaction region of an asymmetric electron-positron
collider, with electrons having the energy of 8 GeV and positrons having the
energy of 3.5 GeV, giving 10.58 GeV center-of-mass energy. The main goal of
Belle is to detect mesons made of a quark-anti-quark pair, in particular those
mesons made of charm quarks (charmonium) and bottom quarks (bottomonium). The
Belle Experiment at KEK in Japan has the world's largest data samples recorded
at the bottomonium resonances: upsilon (5S), upsilon (2S) and upsilon (1S). The
central aim of this project is to perform very precise measurements of details
of fragmentation (the break-up of resonant particles such as the upsilon) and
hadronization (the process of initial state quarks and gluons decaying into
detectable particles like pions and photons) at a center of mass energy of 10
GeV. This will provide tests of Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD), providing
detailed information for theoretical Lattice QCD calculations. The decays of the
upsilon(1S) resonance to gluons and photons provides a precise measurement of
the QCD strong coupling constant.
