9625137 Ma The objective of this project is to develop a combined research and
educational program in biomagnetic imaging engineering. The research work
includes (1) the implementation of high quality Na, H, and P receiver coils for
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy using high temperature
superconductor materials, (2) the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of
MRI images for medical applications, and (3) the development of high temperature
superconducting quantum interference device for magnetocardiogram studies. The
research efforts will be incorporated into the development of new curriculum for
undergraduate and graduate student training in advanced biomagnetic sensing and
imaging technology. ***
