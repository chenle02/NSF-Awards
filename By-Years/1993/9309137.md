The Circuit Isomorphism problem is the problem of deciding whether two given
circuits are isomorphic. Two circuits are isomorphic, in this sense, when they
are functionally identical (compute the same input/output relation) under some
permutation of the input values. The computational complexity of this problem
has not been established. This project undertakes a comprehensive study of the
complexity of Circuit Isomorphism in relation to the standard complexity
classes. It is conjectured that Circuit Isomorphism is an incomplete problem in
the Polynomial Hierarchy. The basis of this conjecture relies on the observation
that the counting version of the Circuit Isomorphism problem has a relatively
lower computational complexity. (The counting version of the Circuit Isomorphism
problem asks for the number of permutations which certify the isomorphism
between the two circuits.) Thus, it seems appropriate for the decision problem
to have a lower computational complexity as well. Extensive comparisons are made
to the much better studied Graph Isomorphism problem, which is a special case of
the Circuit Isomorphism problem. The results of this study would bring about a
better understanding of the computational complexity of Circuit Isomorphism and
establish a new link between counting problems and decision problems.
