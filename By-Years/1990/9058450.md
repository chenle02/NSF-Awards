The connectionist paradigm provides the initial assumptions which form the basis
of this work on characterizing mechanisms of the mind in terms of large networks
of autonomous processing elements. Specific aspects of this work include models
of human cognition, connectionist AI, and connectionist lerning algorithms in an
interleaved fashion. This work focuses specifically on attention which will be
studied in perception and also in higher levels of cognition.
