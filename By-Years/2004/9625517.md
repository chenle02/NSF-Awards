9625517 London The goal of this project is to continue studying the behavior of
lithophile elements in magmatic systems and specifically to investigate
experimentally the distribution of halogens between halogen-bearing minerals and
coexisting silicate liquids. This proposal focuses on the some of the chemical
parameters controlling the distribution of halogens between silicate liquids and
biotite, amphibole, apatite, and titanite. With proper assessment of these
parameters, these minerals may eventually be able to be used as direct monitors
of halogen concentrations within evolving magmatic-hydrothermal systems. Such
knowledge us of great value in determining the ability of halogens to act as
fluxes and mineralizers during the formation of granite-associated magnetic-
hydrothermal ore deposits and, more generally, to control other fundamental
parameters such as liquid structure, viscosity, and density, phase
relationships, and diffusion, speciation, and liquid/fluid/crystal partitioning
of elements. This is a collaborative project involving undergraduate students at
Augustana College and researchers at the University of Oklahoma.
