The "Out on a Limb -- Forest Canopies" exhibit will educate people about forest
canopies, and illustrate the challenges of canopy access by scientists. A
traveling rain forest diorama -- with scaled models of scientists exploring the
canopy, and accompanying graphic panels and interactive activities -- will
circulate to community venues in southwest Florida, increasing public awareness
of how forest canopies are important to life on Earth. Canopy research provides
a highly visual, exploratory approach to scientific inquiry that can be
effectively communicated to the general public and school groups. Based on
research funded by NSF, (DEB-0228871), this project was funded as part of the
Communicating Research to Public Audiences program.
