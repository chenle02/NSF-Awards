Investigations will be pursued into: (i) The priority method as applied to
recursively enumerable Turing degrees and automorphisms of the r.e. sets; (ii)
Superstable theories and Lachlan's conjecture on homogeneous structures; (iii)
Mathematical ideas in the sense of ideas which admit formalization. Such
foundational studies have the potential of clarifying our thoughts and have
sometimes carried over into theoretical computer science.
