Heterogeneous reaction pathways involving water droplets in clouds and fogs are
important conduits for chemical transformation of important atmospheric trace
gases. One of the basic parameters which determines the transfer rate of trace
gases into atmospheric droplets is the mass accommodation or "sticking"
coefficient for trace gas molecules on aqueous surfaces. In this research
project the study of atmospherically important heterogeneous process including
measurement of the mass accommodation coefficients and their temperature
dependence for a variety of species will be undertaken. Additionally, studies of
the effect on sulfur dioxide uptake of ion chemistry and co- deposition of two
gases such as sulfur dioxide and ammonia, the chemistry of surface species, and
the effect of electric charge and surfactant coating on gas-liquid interaction
are planned. This research is motivated by the importance of heterogeneous
reaction pathways involving water droplets in clouds and fogs as conduits for
chemical transformation of atmospheric trace gases. For example, one of the
basic parameters which determines the transfer rate of trace gases into
atmospheric droplets is the mass accommodation or "sticking" coefficient for
trace gas molecules on aqueous surfaces.
