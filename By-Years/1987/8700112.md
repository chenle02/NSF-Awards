Males in many animal species exhibit discontinuous variationin their
reproductive behavior or adult body form. The geneticbasis, if any, for
differences among males in such species isunknown. Moreover, the mechanisms
maintaining different maletypes in a single population are poorly understood.
>Paracerceis>>sculpta> is a marine isopod crustacean that exhibits threedistinct
adult male types. Dr. Sassaman's research combinestechniques in behavioral
ecology and biochemical genetics to (1)identify the hereditary, behavioral and
social mechanismsmaintaining the three male types in the population, and (2)
todetermine the nature of genetic differences among males. Usingenzymes as
genetic markers, Dr. Sassaman will conduct paternityanalyses of young produced
in the field. By monitoring changesin success among different males types, Dr.
Sassman will measurehow relative male reproductive success varies over time. He
willalso conduct specific crosses among lines to determine whether afew or many
genes determine male body form. A simple geneticmechanism could itself determine
a polymorphism, while a morecomplex mode of inheritance could indicate that male
body type issubstantially influenced by local conditions.
