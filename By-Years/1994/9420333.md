Blyth/Abstract The objective of this research is to investigate the formation of
raindrops in cumulus clouds. Existing observational data from several previous
field experiments will be used. Additional measurements are proposed in a new
field experiment (SCMS) to be deployed in Florida (July-August, 1995). The
results of this research will provide a better understanding of the length of
time and the sizes of cloud droplets involved in producing raindrops in cumulus
clouds, how the largest cloud droplets are formed, and how entrainment and
mixing influences the cloud droplets.
