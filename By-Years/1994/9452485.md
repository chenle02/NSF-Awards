9452485 Heilman This project includes notebook computers and video equipment
which undergraduate students use as part of their field courses in urban
ethnography. Students take field notes in situ on the computers. They use the
computers to access archive material, the library and to communicate
(downloading reports) with the departmental network. They also video the
settings they observe. Written and visual documents are then integrated,
displayed, analyzed and archived at a multi-media desktop site in the
department. There students examine one another's finished projects, using these
to learn about the various ethnic and urban landscapes they have documented.
Final products are used both for teaching and as a models for a student run and
faculty mentored programs of urban ethnography.
