This one-day entrepreneurs education workshop on January 30th, 2009 is designed
to educate and train NSF Grantees on how to build their businesses and
transition their technology solutions into the commercial market. The workshop
will focus on effective business execution. There will be a follow-up web-
session in late February to re-enforce training topics.

The broader impact includes enhanced tool-sets for entreprenurial activity for a
wide range of NSF SBIR Phase I grantees.
