This workshop will identify AI knowledge representation technology which is
ready for standardization. It will further initiate the development of standards
for the areas deemed appropriate. For areas which presently are considered
untargeted for standardization, attempts will be undertaken to define the
remaining problems and issues that need solution to meet a minimum level of
consistency that will allow standardization. The overall goal is to enhance the
effective use of related software by the entire research and commerical
community.
