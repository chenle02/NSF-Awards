DMS-0110085&lt;br/&gt;Gordana Matic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial support for participants to &lt;br/&gt;attend the 2001 Georgia
International Topology Conference &lt;br/&gt;to be held at the University of
Georgia, May 21 through &lt;br/&gt;June 2, 2001. Since 1961 the University of
Georgia has &lt;br/&gt;organized and hosted a major international topology
conference&lt;br/&gt;every 8 years. The 1961, 1969, 1977, 1985, and 1993
conferences &lt;br/&gt;came at times when fundamental new ideas were surfacing
to set &lt;br/&gt;the direction of topology for the next few years. The theme of
&lt;br/&gt;this year's conference is primarily on geometric topology with
&lt;br/&gt;special emphasis on contact and symplectic topology and related
geometries. Further information, including invited speakers, &lt;br/&gt;schedule
of talks, housing and travel information and application &lt;br/&gt;is available
at http://www.math.uga.edu/~topology/. &lt;br/&gt;
