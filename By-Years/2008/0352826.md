AST-0352826/Ren, PSU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first Advanced Image Slicer
Integral Field Unit for a solar telescope will be developed. The Integral Field
Unit will be tested and used as a facility instrument at the McMath-Pierce
Telescope at Kitt Peak. The future 4-meter aperture Advanced Technology Solar
Telescope will also require such Integral Field Units for its suite of
instruments. The Integral Field Unit will take full advantage of the Adaptive
Optics-corrected image on the McMath-Pierce telescope, and will be optimized for
infrared to address questions that cannot be studied at visible wavelengths.
