9319086 Lau This award provides partial support for a conference on wavelets and
fractals to be held at the University of Pittsburgh, May 20-22, 1994. The
conference will present studies on various aspects and connections of wavelets
and fractals; wavelet decomposition, reconstruction and sampling of functions
and fractal measures; existence and regularity of the two-scale dilation
equations; self-similarity in harmonic analysis; multifractal structure of
measures and multi-dimensional wavelets and self-similar tilings. Wavelets is a
recently new development in the mathematical area of harmonic analysis. It
combines traditional Hilbert space methods with new constructions of bases from
dilations and translations of a single function (the wavelet). In addition to
computational advantages in this approach, it has been found that wavelets can
be found which are local in both time and frequency making their application to
signal processing particularly effective. ***
