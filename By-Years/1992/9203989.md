This two-year study will conduct a comprehensive investigation of the Gorda
plate seismicity since 1964, focusing on the larger events that contribute
significantly to the seismic strain rate. Source mechanisms, depths, seismic
movement and other details of the rupture events will be determined using
waveform inversion techniques. Relocation of all events with mb >=5 will be used
to produce precise locations of the intraplate events that can be compared to
geological observations, such as GLORIA side-scan imagery.
