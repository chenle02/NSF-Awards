and presenters to the Sharing Our Knowledge conference, which will take place
March 29-April 1, 2012 in Sitka, Alaska. The Sharing Our Knowledge conference is
a large gathering of Native and Non-Native Cultural experts and scholars,
scientists, clan leaders, writers, poets and artists, embracing both Western and
Native American traditions of research, education, knowledge and preservation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers anticipate over 400 participants and 100
presenters including presentations on biology, traditional ecological knowledge,
archaeology, linguistics, museum studies, Cultural anthropology, education,
ethnohistory, humanities, and indigenous law. The conference is an opportunity
for academics scholars, traditional knowledge experts, and students to share
idea, findings, and methodologies with colleagues, students, members of the
Native community, and the public. The invitation list is a who's who in science
and traditional knowledge in the Tlingit region; however, most of the funding is
to support student, Elder, and Clan Leader participation in the conference.
