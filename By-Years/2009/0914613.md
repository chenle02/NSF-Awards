GeoPREP is a multi-track program serving high school students from high-needs
school districts on Long Island, underrepresented minority undergraduates at
SUNY Stony Brook, and in-service and pre-service Earth science teachers in the
region. This Track 2 OEDG project addresses the lack of scholastic follow-up
opportunities for students in New York State whose interest in the geosciences
has been whetted by 8th or 9th grade Earth Science. It expands on successful
program models created during a Track 1 OEDG project. These models include an
intensive summer residential geoscience research program for high school
students, a series of in-service teacher training workshops to develop new
interdisciplinary geoscience curricula, and, through partnership with Brookhaven
National Laboratory, webcasts from the National Synchrotron Light Source and
further development of the Open Space Stewardship Program. New components
include the introduction of an academic-year university laboratory visitation
program for high school students that provides for expanded hands-on geoscience
learning activities, scholarship support for undergraduates in the Louis Stokes
Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), and a longitudinal study of
attitudes and possible biases regarding the geosciences by underrepresented
minority students. &lt;br/&gt;
