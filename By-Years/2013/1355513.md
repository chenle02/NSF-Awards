Miami University is increasing the number of women in its computer science
majors by establishing a living-learning community with service learning at its
core. Connecting computer science and engineering course work to local
community-based problems (e.g. "design a low-cost lightweight playground kit for
elementary school students and simulate its strength characteristics before
building a prototype"), increases the attractiveness of such courses to all
students. Increased enrollment and persistence in such courses contributes in
turn to the pool of well-motivated and capable STEM graduates, with direct
consequences on meeting national workforce development
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical features of the project's
implementation include creating a service learning living community in the
residential halls for two cohorts of thirty students each. The project builds on
converging theory and evidence that points to motivational, rather than ability-
based, explanations for gender imbalance in the participation of undergraduates
in STEM fields. By focusing on service-oriented curricular and co-curricular
offerings, gender balance and diversity within the institution's computer
science, software engineering, computer engineering, and electrical engineering
majors are expected to improve. This project is unique in that it focuses on the
service-oriented learning living community, rather than just the disbursement of
scholarship funds. This emphasis holds promise to help ensure that the students
participate not just for the financial benefits and that the project can
continue after funding for the scholarships has ended.
