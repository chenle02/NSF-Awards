In this project the P.I will carry out a laboratory study of oscillatory fluid
flow over varying bottom topography. A stratified fluid will be contained in a
rotating cylinder, with the rotation rate varied periodically about a mean
value. Both barotropic and baroclinic oscillatory flow over slopes, hills, and
valleys formed in the bottom of the cylinder will be investigated for the
fluctuating and mean responses over a wide range of parameters. The data will be
used for testing theoretical ideas, as well as the results of numerical models.
