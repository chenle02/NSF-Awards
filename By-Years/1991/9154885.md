The University of Wyoming will initiate a three-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in Engineering which will offer science enrichment activities
for 30 precollege students entering grade 12. The program will emphasize
research participation in materials science, control systems and computer-aided
engineering. Sessions will apply fundamental mathematics, chemistry and physics
concepts to open-ended design problems. Participants will be introduced to
developing technologies of composite materials and surface mount technology as
well as more established areas such as digital electronics and structural
engineering. Students will share their research experiences with classmates
during the academic year and will experience continued involvement in
engineering-related activities at the University through video teleconferencing.
