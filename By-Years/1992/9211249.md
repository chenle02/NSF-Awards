This project addresses the structure and stability of metal surfaces. Part of
the work deals with methods by which an equilibrium rough surface can be forced
into an ordered state under steady-state sputter growth conditions. The ability
to control or reduce disorder by an inert technique can have important
consequences for film growth techniques. The second area of study is the
determination of the equilibrium crystal shape (ECS) of silver near the (110)
plane. An understanding of the ECS is a necessary prerequisite to
interpretations of growth, catalysis, diffusion, etc. involving the silver
surface. The final part of the project deals with surface phase transitions and
surface disorder transitions and surface disorder transitions occuring in alkali
metal surface layers on (110) substrates. The research will study the phase
diagram of such transitions in the context of current theories of these phase
transitions.
