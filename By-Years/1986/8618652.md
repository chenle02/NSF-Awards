Economic considerations pervade decisions to sue, to go to court, or to settle.
The monetary and nonmonetary costs, offset by estimates of the magnitude and
probability of gain, may be expected to shape the contours of litigation and
decisions to litigate. Dr. Rubinfeld seeks to examine the influence of economic
factors through theoretical and empirical study. First, given extant research,
writing, and conjecture on these issues, he plans to undertake a critical and
synthetic assessment of the literature on the economics of litigation, (a)
focusing on the uses and misuses of economic tools and ideas and (b) developing
an agenda for future inquiry. Second, he plans a series of theoretical efforts
aimed at (a) incorporating settlements and litigation into the current theory of
optimal public enforcement and (b) exploring the benefits of trial rather than
settlement. Third, using a data set of antitrust cases filed in six Federal
District Courts over a thirteen-year period (supplemented by survey data of
attorneys and participants), he plans rigorous econometric analysis of the
economic underpinnings of the litigation process. In this empirical work, Dr.
Rubinfeld will focus on the estimation of a set of settlement and trial outcome
equations incorporating such issues as selection bias (in the kinds of cases
that go to trial), the influence of reputational factors associated with the
defendant and plaintiff, and the effect of perceptions prior to trial on trial
outcome. Bringing substantial theoretical and econometric expertise, Dr.
Rubinfeld is especially well situated to add to the scientific discourse
regarding litigation and when, why, and how it is used.
