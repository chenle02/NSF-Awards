Funds are requested to support travel to European participants to attend a
Penrose Conference on "The Origin of Massif Anorthosites and Related Rocks". In
addition, a matching allocation from INT will provide similar funds for Indian
geoscientists to attend this conference. The invited foreign scientists are
experts on research on anorthosite complexes from several classical localities
in northern Europe and India. Their participation will provide important
contributions concerning anorthosite genesis at different times and places in
Earth history that is critical to developing a broad perspective on this topic.
