0222211 Bao The applicants propose to develop a novel dual-FRET molecular
beacons methodology for the detection of cancer cells with high specificity,
sensitivity and efficiency. Molecular beacons (MBs) are single-stranded
oligonucleotides with a stem-loop hairpin structure and dual-labeled with a
fluorophore at one end and a quencher at the other. Delivering MBs into cells
will result in a fluorescence signal if the MBs hybridize to target mRNAs. Thus,
when the target mRNAs correspond to the molecular markers of a cancer, cancer
cells (bright) can be distinguished from normal cells (dark ).
