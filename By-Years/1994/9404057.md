9404057 Bagger Research in theoretical particle physics will focus on
experimental consequences of the standard model description of the fundamental
interactions in nature. Special emphasis will be placed on the interactions of
heavy quarks, and the implications of supersymmetry. This symmetry relates the
fields that describe the forces and those that describe the constituents of
matter. The results of the research will further our understanding of these
fundamental interactions. ***
