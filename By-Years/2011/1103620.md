This project is focusing on the development, implementation, and assessment of
five core courses in Geographic Information Science (GISc), which are building
the foundation for the future development and implementation of a full-scale
GISc program at the CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College. The PIs have
engaged appropriate expert assistance from nearby CUNY Hunter College, and also
are working with representatives from the National Center for Geospatial
Technology (NGTC), other two-year and four-year institutions, local private
industries, and federal, state, and city agencies to develop, adapt, and
implement exemplary educational materials and key pedagogical strategies in
GISc. The short-term activities are aimed at creating, adapting, and
disseminating new learning materials and teaching strategies to reflect advances
in geospatial technology, and the project is serving the dual purpose of
preparing students for entry level employment in a variety of industries and
facilitating student transfer to local baccalaureate degree programs in
Geographical Information Science (GISc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
also attempting to increase critical thinking and problem solving skills among
students in addition to improving their geospatial literacy. This is being done
through the innovative use of emerging technologies, cases studies, and hands-on
instruction and in-class research. These instructional methods build upon and
extend in new ways research already being undertaken by the NGTC's network of
community colleges. The GISc courses that are being developed by the project are
significantly enhancing student learning in a large urban area and are providing
a new pool of highly trained technicians able to join and enhance the local and
regional workforce. Likewise, the instructional methods and strategies being
developed by the project PIs have the potential to become a national model
suitable for replication in other urban areas and at institutions serving groups
that are traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.
