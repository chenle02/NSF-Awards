of the High Latitude Dynamics Program.

Dr. Robin Muench of Earth & Space Research will serve at ONR Headquarters, full
time, under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPPA) Mobility Program, as an

The period of the assignment will be for 24 months, from 01 October 2000 to 30
September 2002, with an option to extend two additional years if the assignment
is of continued benefit to ONR. This proposed IPAP assignee is uniquely
qualified and available for this assignment.

In assessing the relative benefits to INR and the parent organization of this
IPA, ONR is determined to be the principal beneficiary because of its critical
need for his expertise and agrees to pay 100% of the salary, fringe benefit and
travel costs. Because of its own critical need for the expertise provided by
this IPA, the National Science Foundation by seperate arrangement is providing
50% of the funds required to fund this IPA.
