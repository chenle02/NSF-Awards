Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIS - 0803410&lt;br/&gt;Tools to Mine
and Index Trajectories of Physical Artifacts&lt;br/&gt;Keogh,
Eamonn&lt;br/&gt;University of California-
Riverside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes to develop
computational methods and tools for the discovery of spatio-temporal patterns in
the distribution and historical development of physical artifacts important to
anthropology including the development of a shape recognition system that allows
researchers to compare numerous projectile points and petroglyphs according to
several criteria. This will involve creation of a set of definitions/ data
representations/predicates/algorithms and intuitive and usable software tools to
enable the study of the spatio-temporal spread of physical objects. The proposal
uses innovative technology to apply to questions central to archaeology. but
which also has broad applicability to research in other, diverse
domans.&lt;br/&gt;
