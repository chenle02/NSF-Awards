Logical methods are playing an increasingly important role in many areas of
computer science and mathematics. The applications of logical methods to
problems in both areas, in particular, the ways in which logical methods can be
applied to understand the theory of computation including the study of the
effective or computational content of theorems in mathematics and how logical
methods can be used to solve a variety of problems in computer science are the
foci of this conference activity. Topics will include recursion theory,
recursive and polynomial time mathematics, the general theory of computation,
automata, complexity theory, and various other applications of logic within
computer science including non-classical logics such as temporal and dynamic
logic, concurrent programming, nonmonotonic reasoning, program verification, and
hybrid control. This project will support the Meeting on Logical Methods in
Mathematics and Computer Science to be held at Cornell University from June 1-3,
1992. The purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers from both
mathematics and computer science to explore the many applications of logical
methods to problems in both areas and to increase the interaction between
mathematical logicians and computer scientists.
