The history of artificial intelligence has been marked by a continuing
specialization and diversification of its areas of research. At times, some sort
of reaction to developments is needed, one in which theorists can step back and
consider the implications of theories in subareas of artificial intelligence
that are potentially important to the development of integrated systems. All
areas of artificial intelligence, such a natural language understanding and
computer vision, have made significant progress, but the field lacks a high
level of integration. The goal of this workshop is to bring together top-level
researchers form both the US and Japan to explore potential development of an
integrated in multi-media environments, as well as to promote better
understanding and cooperation on this problem between the two countries.//
