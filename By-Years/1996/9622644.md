CMS-9622644 Title: "Direct Measurement of Strain-Rate Dependent Constitutive
Relations for the Compression of Clay" co-PI's: Gerald A. Leonards and Patrick
J. Fox, Department of Civil Engineering, Purdue University The objective of the
proposed research program is to provide definitive experimental data to resolve
long-standing issues of strain rate effects during the process of consolidation
in clay. Novel experimental techniques will be applied to measure the time-
dependent and time- independent components of compressibility both during and
after the consolidation process is completed, without the need for analytical
interpretation of the test results. Undisturbed soils, known to be sensitive to
strain rate effects, will be tested using: 1) a fixed-ring consolidometer
specially treated for low sidewall friction, and 2) a Ko-triaxial cell modified
to provide essentially one-dimensional strain under conditions of zero side
friction, using a flow-pump volume control system. Local values of void ratio
and effective stress will be measured directly. Large ranges in strain rate will
be investigated by testing samples of different thickness. Redundant experiments
will be used to establish that the results are free from bias due to minor
departures from zero side friction in one case, and from zero lateral strain in
the other. With the basic constitutive relations obtained from direct
measurement, predictions of pore water pressure dissipation in incremental
loading tests, and build up of pore water pressures in constant rate of strain
(CRS) tests, will be compared with those using replicate specimens from block
samples. The results of this study will have a fundamental bearing on how
consolidation concepts are taught, and on how they are applied in practice.
