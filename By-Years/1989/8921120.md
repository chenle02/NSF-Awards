This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Kevin Cleary,
presently of the University of Texas, Austin, to conduct collaborative research
for six months with Dr. Tatsuo Arai of the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in
Tsukuba, Japan. They will explore the potential for incorporating multiple
secondary criteria in a motion planning system for robot manipulators. Common
industrial manipulators have six degrees of freedom (DOF). Adding additional DOF
will potentially extend the capabilities of these manipulators to enable them to
perform in obstacle strewn environments, avoid singularities, and be more
dextrous. Cleary has developed algorithms for incorporating such multiple
secondary performance criteria and has applied these to a seven DOF robot system
via computer simulation. Dr. Arai and his colleaques at the Mechanical
Engineering Lab have built a direct drive manipulator with seven DOF and applied
it to a sewing system. By bringing theory and hardware together, this
collaboration should yield insights into the practical implementation of
redundant manipulators.
