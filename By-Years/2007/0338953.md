9986962 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Barnes will undertake an extensive survey of
nearby stellar clusters whose goal is to determine the dependence of rotation
rate on stellar mass and age. The rotation periods will be determined for solar-
type stars in carefully selected clusters with ages ranging from 300 million
years to 1 billion years using photometric observations with a precision of
better than one percent. The observational results will be compared to models
for the rotational evolution of stars, not only with respect to age and mass,
but also to other properties such as the degree of interaction between stars and
their circumstellar disks. This project is likely to provide new insight into
the role of magnetic disk locking between slow and fast rotation zones, the
incidence of solid versus differential rotation, and magnetic saturation. These
issues directly contribute to our understanding of the interplay between the
Sun's rotation and activity level. Funding for this project is provided by the
NSF program for Stellar Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (AST/SAA).&lt;br/&gt;
