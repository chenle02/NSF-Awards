This award will support, in part, the travel of about 16 younger American
physicists, who are actively working in the area of CP violation, to a
conference on CP violation. It is to be held in Blois (France) May 22-26, 1989.
The conference is set to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the CP violation
discovery in kaon decays and will deal with the prospect of new experimental
results, an update on the theoretical studies, a presentation on future
initiatives and the role of CP violation in the early universe.
