9314446 Wiens This project will deploy a set of Ocean Bottom Seismometers across
the Lau Basin and Tonge Trench, to complement an already-funded land-based
array. The goal is to use seismic velocities to interpret the structure of the
mantle wedge and subducting slab, and thereby to determine evidence for phase
changes in the slab, and sources of arc back-arc magmas.
