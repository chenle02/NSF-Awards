Capacity of Wireless Networks: Cooperative
Communication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental capacity limit of wireless
networks is a highly pursued&lt;br/&gt;yet elusive problem lying at the
intersection of distinct fields of&lt;br/&gt;research. The principle issue is
the lack of appropriate tools within any&lt;br/&gt;one field to tackle this
problem in its entirety. This research activity&lt;br/&gt;builds an inter-
disciplinary framework for the analysis of this&lt;br/&gt;fundamental limit,
merging networking and optimization theoretic concepts&lt;br/&gt;such as node
cooperation, cooperative routing and Lagrangian duality in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction
with sophisticated mathematical tools from information theory.&lt;br/&gt;A
mathematical theory is developed using these diverse tools and,
where&lt;br/&gt;necessary, introducing new tools to obtain 1) improved
achievable rates&lt;br/&gt;for a given network configuration over those
currently known 2) novel&lt;br/&gt;outer bounds on network sum capacity, 3) non-
trivial conditions where&lt;br/&gt;inner and outer bounds meet and 4) algorithms
that compute the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding resource allocation strategies for
time-varying wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, techniques
such as joint source-channel coding, multi-user&lt;br/&gt;binning and multiuser
cooperative coding are used to develop the inner&lt;br/&gt;bounds on the
capacity of the systems, while Lagrangian duality theory
and&lt;br/&gt;estimation theory is used both to develop outer bounds on capacity
and to&lt;br/&gt;compare the inner and outer
bounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
