The objective of this internship project is to develop an efficient Just-In-
Time production system in collaboration with a leading manufacturer of
agricultural equipment. Objectives of the project include the analysis and
development of a hybrid push/pull system for parts usage and integration of
material handling equipment. The manufacturing facility under study employs
extensive use of materials handling equipment and state-of-the-art automation
and robotics. The results of the study will shed considerable insight into the
effectiveness of Just-In-Time approaches in environments of this nature.
