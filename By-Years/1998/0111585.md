This project is a longitudinal study of parents making school and program
placement decisions for their children. The study has 4 specific aims: (1) To
compare the decision making of couples to that of individuals; (2) To compare
the information gathering and decision structuring of people who report
themselves as having different decision-making styles; (3) To examine the
relationship between the performance variables (amount of information gathered,
complexity of the decision structure) and affective response variables (ratings
of stress, satisfaction, comfort, enjoyment with the decision-making process
itself) and to eventual, retrospective evaluations of the decision making; and
(4) To compare the decision-making of novice and experienced parents, and of
less educated and more educated parents. The study will provide descriptive data
on dyadic decision making in real life contexts, It will contribute to a better
understanding of how the "fit" between both parents' thinking, information
gathering, and decision structuring influences the thoroughness of information
gathering and decision structuring, affective reactions during the decision-
making process, and retrospective satisfaction with the decision. This research
will also improve our understanding of how making a decision with a partner is
different from and similar to making a decision alone.
