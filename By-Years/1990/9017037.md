Palusinski This research applies spectral techniques to the time domain
simulation of integrated circuits. The methods have been used to compute
transient effects in multiple transmission lines. They are based on the
expansion of unknown variables in the Chebyshev series. This assures very
compact representation of waveforms, thus reducing computational penalties
imposed by data interchange in relaxation methods. Tasks include: 1. Modeling of
MOS circuits based on modified nodal analysis; 2. Application of spectral
algorithms to bipolar circuits with various model switching strategies; 3.
Construction of an efficient spectral algorithm for computation of transients in
lossy transmission lines with frequency dependent parameters and nonlinear
termination networks; 4. Using spectral techniques in a relaxation framework.
