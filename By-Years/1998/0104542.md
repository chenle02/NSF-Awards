0104542&lt;br/&gt;Hannaford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year award will
support a dissertation enhancement project of Greg Lee, a student in the
Biorobotics Lab of the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of
Washington. He will work with Prof. Paolo Dario at the ARTS/MITEC Laboratory at
the Scuola Superiore Santa Anna, in Pisa, Italy. The objective of Mr. Lee's
research is to incorporate MEMS techniques into his research on low power
haptics. Mr. Lee will benefit from studying biorobotic MEMS technology being
developed at the ARTS/MITEC laboratory, which is unique in its integration of
MEMS with biorobotics. interface. While at ARTS/MITEC, Mr. Lee will offer
seminars in real-time embedded Windows CE networked control
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
