One of the outcomes from the explosion of intellectual activities in knot theory
that followed the discovery of Jones polynomials is the area of quantum
topology. This area of low dimensional topology has made a significant
development recently through categorifications of the quantum invariants such as
Khovanov and Ozvath-Szabo theories. The main motivation for the planned
conference: Knotting Mathematics and Art, Conference in Low Dimensional Topology
and Mathematical Art, is to make advances in this research area. bringing in
leading researchers and graduate students internationally. The highly visual
aspects of low dimensional topology makes it possible to bring together wide
range of speakers including mathematical artists. Hence, another goal of the
conference is to bring together mathematicians and artists to promote their
interactions and public awareness.

A knot is a circle situated in space. Knot theory studies such knotted circles,
and has provided models and applications to DNA theory, molecular
configurations, and physics. Knot diagrams drawn on a piece of paper, and
numerical quantities that are easily computable from diagrams, have been
extensively used in knot theory. Knot theory has been one of the most active
research areas in mathematics in recent decades, and continues to do so today.
Due to its graphical subject matters and methods, this area of mathematics also
attracts artists, in particular mathematical artists. Indeed, geometric
structures can be found in variety of art works in general. The planned
conference: Knotting Mathematics and Art, Conference in Low Dimensional Topology
and Mathematical Art, will not only bring together top research mathematicians
to an international research conference and make further advances in the
subject, but also bring together mathematical artists to promote collaboration,
with wide participation from general public interested in art and mathematics.
