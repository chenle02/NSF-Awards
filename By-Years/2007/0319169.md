This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project studies a new
coding and implementation techniques for high-speed high-density optical disk
data storage. It is well known that conventional optical disk storage is based
on recording and readout binary data pits in an optical disk such as compact
disk and DVD. The data storage density is thus limited by the size of these pits
that can be recorded and readout optically due to diffraction limitation. This
proposed research explores a new coding concept and uses an extended depth of
focus diffractive optical element to facilitate recording and readout many bits
of data in a single storage pit. The data storage density can thus be
significantly increased. The novel approach can potentially reach 50 Gbits/in
storage density using the same optical and motion scanning system as DVD and
using a commercially available data recording material. Thus, the technology
development can reach its near-term maturity. Phase I research will demonstrate
the feasibility of the proposed novel disk storage concept. Compatibility with
existing data storage technology will also be
demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop a simple proof-of-
concept high-density optical disk storage prototype based on a new coding
concept. Implementation of such coding concept can significantly increase the
disk storage density for commercial and military applications such as computer
data storage, on-line storage, library archival applications, image storage and
processing for medical applications, and military target identification and fast
access to large intelligent database.
