GER-9554567 Flournoy The Chemistry and Statistics Departments of the American
University (TAU), located in the nation's capital, plan to recruit five doctoral
students with potential for superior accomplishments to study chemistry and
statistics and develop an interdisciplinary environmental research program in
the Fall of 1996. We propose to use the flexibility that is available within the
existing requirements for a PhD in Statistics effectively to initiate a new
interdisciplinary PhD program. The proposed training program focuses on several
issues that involve statistics and chemistry. It is expected that the students
will pursue a career in teaching or research with an environmental emphasis in
academia, industry or government at the completion of their program. The
students will be recruited nationwide, through a special brochure discussing the
program, with special attention to recruiting talented students for
traditionally underrepresented groups in chemistry - women and minorities. In
addition a focus of the recruitment will be for students with BS degrees who are
working at environmental laboratories and remedial contractors and who have been
out of school a few years to attract them back to graduate school as full-time
students in an interdisciplinary program focused on Environmental Chemometrics.
