This research explores a cooperative intelligent real time control architecture
(CIRCA) developed by the PIs as an alternative to traditional approaches that
have limited the power of the AI methods or embedded "reactivity" into an AI
system to achieve real time performance. The CIRCA architecture uses separate AI
and real-time subsystems to address the problems for which each is designed. A
structured interface allows the subsystems to communicate without compromising
their respective performance goals. By reasoning about its own bounded
reactivity, CIRCA can guarantee that it will meet hard deadlines while using AI
methods whose time performance need not be accurately predictable. With its
abilities to guarantee or trade off the timeliness, precision, confidence, and
completeness of its output, CIRCA should provide more flexible performance than
traditional systems. This project will develop the cooperative theory which
supports CIRCA's performance guarantees as well as its experimental
implementation and evaluation. The main emphasis is on CIRCA's ability to
combine AI and real-time subsystems.
