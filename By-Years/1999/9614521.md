9614521 Paterson Mineral lineations are commonly observed in ductilely deformed
crustal rocks, and they potentially record considerable kinematic information.
However, there is currently debate about the significance and interpretation of
mineral lineations, including whether they record regional displacement
directions, regional stretching directions or heterogeneous strain. Flow
partitioning and volume loss also are potential factors. This project will use
the well-studied Cascade Core of the mid-Cretaceous orogeny in the North
Cascades Mountain of Washington to investigate the kinematic significance of
mineral lineations formed at mid-crustal depths. Successful results will be
widely applicable to ductile deformation in many other orogens, may provide
better procedures for understanding these lineations and allow further
evaluation of flow fields in the mid crust.
