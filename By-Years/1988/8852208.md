Motion analysis and predetermined motion time systems are important techniques
for work design and simplification in industry. The primary objective of this
project is to provide a laboratory experience consistent with current industrial
practice. This objective will be pursued by the addition of computerized work
measurement and video micromotion analysis capabilities. Resources will be used
for an advanced technology microcomputer system when which coupled with
appropriate software will provide a state-of-the-art computerized work
measurement system similar to that used in industry. The video-based motion
analysis system will provide students with hands-on experience in video-based
micromotion studies.
