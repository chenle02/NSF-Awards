Cellular automata are useful paradigms for representing and analyzing spatial
patterns and dynamics. And they have potential for investigating relationships
between spatial processes and patterns at various scales and levels of
organization in ecology. Various grid-cell schema have been applied in
ecological research (e.g. succession, landscapes, biogeography), but generally
lack the theoretical formalism of cellular automata. Cellular automata may be
particularly useful for understanding how ecological complexity can arise from
relatively simple local interactions. Dr. Rykiel proposes to: (1) evaluate
available cellular automata tools (especially the CAM-6 computer board), (2)
investigate potential applications of cellular automata in various areas of
ecology, and (3) test cellular automata models with primary succession data for
lupin (Lupinus lepidus) at Mount St. Helens. This research is an attempt to
apply a new, untested approach to traditional areas of ecological research.
