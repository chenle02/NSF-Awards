This award is to support Phase I research to determine the feasibility of using
an electron beam for sterilization of hospital wastes. The proposal leading to
this award was submitted in response to NSF 91-20, Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR). This project involves determination of the feasibility of
integrating an electron beam accelerator into a hospital's waste handling
stream, shredding the waste for appropriate presentation to the beam, and
configuration of the overall design, capital and operating costs. For cost-
effectiveness, chemical and physical procedures now used for disinfection and
sterilization of hospital wastes generally require separation of infectious from
noninfectious wastes. Results of this research are expected to determine the
technical feasibility of the proposed concept and the basis for potential
continuation of this research into a subsequent Phase II.
