9707706 Service The goal of this project is to identify genes that control
senescence in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The fruit fly is a "model"
organism that has been used for many years to investigate fundamental genetic
questions. The flies to be used in this study are from populations that have a
more than two-fold difference in average life span as a result of selective
breeding in the laboratory. This difference in life span is due to differences
in rates of senescence. Flies that undergo more rapid senescence have shorter
life spans. This project will provide data on the number of genes responsible
for differences in life span and senescence between these fly populations. It
will also enable identification of the approximate chromosomal locations of
these genes. This project will contribute to our understanding of the molecular
and genetic basis of aging. Because all animals share many basic similarities at
the molecular and cellular levels, this project may provide results that are
broadly applicable to the many animal species that undergo aging and senescence,
including humans.
