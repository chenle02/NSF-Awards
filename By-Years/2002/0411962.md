The PI will study major problem in random matrix theory and their applications.
One question is what mathematical abstractions are responsible for the
universality of random matrix theory formulas. The PI will investigate whether a
certain stochastic Hermitian operator will yield new insights. This point of
view allows the study of general beta formulas beyond the traditional beta=1,2,
and 4 available in much of classical random matrix theory. As part of this
project we will produce software for random matrix integrals, Jack polynomials,
and orthogonal polynomials of matrix argument.

Random matrix theory is becoming increasingly important as the formulas that
were obtained in this once esoteric field are now finding application in areas
as far reaching as array processing, numerical analysis, computational
complexity, and traditional fields of mathematics and physics including
combinatorics, integrable-systems, and so many other fields. This is randomized
"linear algebra." The random matrix techniques developed today will become
important tools for scientists and engineers in the coming decade.
