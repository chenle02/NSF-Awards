With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of the Sciences in
Philadelphia will acquire a 64-processor 64-bit parallel computer cluster. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including studies on a) the
structural and dynamical properties of electrolyte solutions to better
understand complex processes such as clathrate formation; b) the role of
structure and conformation changes in protein-DNA complexes; c) development of
ab initio based methods that will allow NMR chemical shifts to be used as
sources of structural constraints; d) the binding of molecules and small
peptides to unilamellar vesicles and lipid bilayers and their impact on
apolipoprotein E binding behavior and atherosclerosis; and e) the development of
a computer-based drug design system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cluster of fast,
modern computer workstations is vital to serving the computing needs of active
research departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development
environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art
graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art
applications of parallel processing. These studies will have a significant
impact in a wide number of areas, especially biochemistry and medicinal
chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
