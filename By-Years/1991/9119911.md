This award provides funds for a Workshop on Active Vision Research, to be held
in Chicago, Illinois on August 5-7, 1991 to take advantage of the occurrence of
the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society in Chicago immediately
following the Workshop. A growing number of researchers recognize that the
ability to actively combine computer vision with physical/mechanical behavior is
vital to achieving useful and robust perception for a robot interacting with a
complex, dynamic world. In this paradigm, termed active vision, the vision
process is mist readily understood in the context of the behaviors that the
system is engaged in; these behaviors may not require elaborate categorical
representations of the three- dimensional world. Thirty leading researchers will
meet to discuss research opportunities and funding needs in this emerging field.
They will discuss the motivations for active vision, recommend research
priorities, and identify important influences on the field, such as emerging
computer, camera, and robotic technologies.
