week, summer residential, Young Scholars project for 15 students entering grades
9-12. The project focus is interdisciplinary and will stress the acquisition of
research skills and awareness of environmental issues. Participants are exposed
to a broad range of scientific issues through conferences, lectures and
interacting with practicing scientists in different scientific fields. Students
work on and complete research projects in the summer and academic year follow-up
portion of the project. Ethics and philosophy of science activities along with
career explorations complete the program.
