This project investigates spoken language systems for the elderly and non-native
speakers of English. Existing systems have been constructed for the average user
and thus perform poorly for these nontraditional populations. The elderly have
little access at present to computerized information, yet they have telephones
that would enable them to access computers easily if the information were
presented in a way that they could readily understand. Non-native speakers have
difficulty being understood by the same dialogue systems, which need to be
adapted to their speech and aid them in finding the correct way to express
themselves. In order to improve the understandability of spoken output, Let's Go
will investigate differences in lexical, prosodic and spectral content to enable
elderly and non-native listeners to better understand the message. In order to
improve spoken input, the project will explore adaptation of the statistical
models of the lexical and acoustic information of the incoming speech signal for
the target populations. Let's Go will assess the pertinence of its findings by
creating a spoken language demonstrator that allows elderly and non-native users
to access Port Authority Transit Bus information over the telephone.
