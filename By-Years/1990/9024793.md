Analytic methods for Bayesian analysis hinge upon the "posterior distribution"
as the representation for the accumulated information upon observation of the
data. For many observational studies as well as many or most experimental
situations, an adequate analysis depends on representing complicated information
in a satisfactory way. Advances in computational techniques, notably adaptive
Monte-Carlo integration, have begun to make the reconstruction of suitable
posterior distributions possible. This research will extend the range of
existing methods both by incorporating quantile integration to increase
efficiency and by formulating the distribution approximation problem in terms of
mixture distributions and then imposing a clustering approach to gain
efficiency.
