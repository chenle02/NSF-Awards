Bearing failure in mechanical systems can result in complete failure or extended
down time and can be extremely costly. Bearing failure often results from
failure in bearing lubricant caused by destructive oxidation. Use of antioxident
additives, such as zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDTPs) can extend lubricant
life. However, ZDTPs undergo oxidative degradation so that useful lifetime of
ZDTP limits lubricant lifetime. Use of deuterium increases oxidation resistance.
This project experimentally investigates the effect of deuteration of ZDTP
additives on service life extension. Work has shown that certain deuterated
ZDTPs are improved lubricant additives. Improvements in commercial base-stock
lubricants will be demonstrated and efforts on product commercialization will be
undertaken.
