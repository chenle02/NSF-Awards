Dynamical evidence shows that most of the mass in disk galaxies lies in some
form of unseen matter, the nature and distribution of which is largely unkown.
The dynamics of polar-ring galaxies, which have outer rings of gas, stars, and
dust orbiting in a plane perpendicular to their rotating central disks, provide
one of the few observational tests available to determine whether the dark
matter lies in a spherical halo, a thin disk, or something in between. Work to
be supported by this grant will be devoted to using these galaxies as means for
examining the distribution of dark matter in galaxies. The Principal
Investigator is a highly regarded expert in this field.
