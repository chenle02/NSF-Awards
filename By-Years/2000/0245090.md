Despite several decades of steady progress in obtaining Ph.D.s in science and
engineering (S&amp;E), women remain underrepresented in academia, particularly
at senior academic ranks. Since many members of underrepresented minority groups
receiving Ph.D.s in all fields are women, the obstacles to racial and ethnic
diversity of university faculty include obstacles to gender diversity. At UAB,
few women can be found at any academic rank in many science and engineering
&lt;br/&gt;departments. The specific aims of the project are to increase the
visibility of the problems that women face in academic science and engineering
careers, to increase the number of women recruited to science and engineering
positions, and to develop a campus climate in which practice and policy
recognize and support the needs of women so that women are retained on the
faculty of the institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project seeks to
enhance both UAB's long-term commitment to faculty diversity and the
institution's newer efforts in professional development of young investigators.
The project will be institutionalized by changes in policy and by the evolution
of the project into a center for the study of women and minorities in science
and engineering. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To bring focus to the needs of women,
the project will establish an Office for the &lt;br/&gt;Advancement of Women in
Science and Engineering with an internal advisory board of campus leaders and an
external board of individuals recognized for their leadership in the advancement
of women and minorities in academia. The direction of the project will be driven
by qualitative and quantitative data collected and analyzed throughout the
project to evaluate the needs of the campus and the effectiveness of activities
undertaken. The project also seeks to stimulate basic &lt;br/&gt;research that
will broaden understanding of the issues affecting women and minorities in
science and engineering and lead to better informed policy decisions.
