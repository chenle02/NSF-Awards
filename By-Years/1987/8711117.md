The object of this project is to develop a user-friendly data base consisting of
price data on security transactions for the New York and American Stock
Exchanges. This data base will be made readily accessible, in a convenient
format, and at reasonable cost to scholars doing empirical research in the area
of financial economics. At present these data are not readily available to
academic researchers. This project is important because it will allow scholars
to explore a host of questions regarding the functioning of financial markets
which at present is not possible, given the high cost and access problems with
existing data sets. This data base will include transaction prices for all
security trades, not just closing trades on the New York and American Stock
Exchanges. Transaction prices will be maintained for the most recent ten years
of historical data. The data base will initially be provided on magnetic tape
for IBM computers. Following, these data will be available for VAX computers,
and finally they will be available for processing on micro-computers.
