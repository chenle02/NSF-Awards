The human microbiome, the sum total of bacteria that live in and on the human
body, harbors 90% of our cells and &gt;99% of our genes, and plays a critical
role in performing many basic human life functions. And yet, we know very little
about its diversity, variation, and evolution. The human oral cavity alone
harbors a complex ecosystem containing more than 1,000 microbial species, and
this oral microbiome has been associated with tooth decay, cardiovascular
disease and a range of respiratory illnesses. Recently it has been discovered
that dental calculus (calcified dental plaque) entraps a rich record of the oral
microbiome that preserves for thousands of years. The objective of this study is
to use metagenomic and metaproteomic approaches to systematically characterize
the oral microbiome of chimpanzees and humans from the Paleolithic to the
present. This study will contribute to reconstructing the human oral microbiome
through time and understanding the origins of common oral pathogens and
diseases. Findings from this study will also contribute to student training, and
public science outreach and education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Few studies have
conducted basic research on the natural variation of the human oral microbiome
or on changes in the oral microbiome through time. As a result little is known
about the origins and evolutionary ecology of the human oral microbiome.
Recently it has been discovered that dental calculus (calcified dental plaque)
entraps a rich biomolecular record of the oral microbiome that preserves for
thousands of years. This project will use state-of-the-art metagenomic and
metaproteomic technologies to characterize the microbes of the oral cavity
collected from chimpanzees and extinct and extant members of Homo: archaic Homo
heidelbergensis (ca. 430,000 BP), Paleolithic H. sapiens (ca. 23,000 BP and
20,000 BP), Chalcolithic H. sapiens (ca. 4,000 BP), and present-day humans and
chimpanzees. These samples will provide a path to reconstructing the the human
oral microbiome over the course of hominin evolution.
