This award will enable the U.S. National Committee for the International Union
of Biochemistry (IUB) to support effective and numerically adequate travel of
U.S. participants in the 14th International Congress of Biochemistry. This
Congress, to be convened under the auspices of the Czechoslovak National
Committee of Biochemistry, The Czechoslovak Biochemical Society, and the
Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Czechoslovak Academy of
Sciences and the IUB, will be held in Prague, Czechoslovakia during the period
July 10-15, 1988. A Travel Award Committee will be named to select from
applicants those best qualified to represent U.S. biochemistry with due regard
for equitable distribution of grants based on geographic location, scientific
interest, minority status, age, identification with learned and professional
societies, participation in past Congresses, and general standing in the
scientific community. In addition to the grant support, the American Society of
Biological Chemists and the American Chemical Society will contribute over
$400,000 toward travel support. This is an important international meeting, and
the travel support provided will help to assure an appropriate level of
participation by U.S. biochemists.
