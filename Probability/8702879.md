The investigator will study two problems dealing with random walks. The first
problem of self avoiding random walks has applications in chemical physics as a
model for polymer chains. The properties of self avoiding walks will be analyzed
via the mathematically more tractable intersection properties of two simple
random walks. The second problem of the random walks in random environments has
applications in many fields including biology and chemistry. The general problem
of the field is to find properties of a markov chain when its transition matrix
is chosen from some probability distribution. The investigator has had a strong
record in both areas already and has exiting new ideas for the new problems
proposed.
