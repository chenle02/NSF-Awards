The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the architecture of telomeres
in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Telomeres are essential and complex
nucleoprotein structures that form protective caps on the physical ends of
linear eukaryotic chromosomes. Previous studies by the Shippen lab indicate that
Arabidopsis has remarkably plastic development and tolerance to genome
perturbations allowing investigations of the consequences of mutations in
telomere-related genes that are lethal in other species. The specific objectives
of this research focus on identification and characterization of proteins that
bind double-strand telomeric DNA tracts. In humans, such proteins have been
shown to regulate telomere length and protect against end-to-end chromosome
fusions. In a BLAST search, the Shippen lab identified eleven genes in
Arabidopsis with features similar to the human double-strand telomere proteins
TRF1 and TRF2. The Arabidopsis genes were designated TRF-like (TRFL). For
Objective 1, the DNA binding properties of TRFL proteins will be examined as
well as their interactions with proteins known to associate with telomeres in
other organisms. For Objective 2, the subcellular localization of TRFL proteins
will be determined to ascertain whether these components co-localize with
telomeric DNA in vivo. Objective 3 will examine the function of TRFL genes in
telomere length maintenance and genome stability by studying the consequences of
their inactivation in mutants. For Objective 4, regulation and function of
TRFL-4 will be undertaken. TRFL-4 is a novel gene whose expression is controlled
by alternative mRNA splicing and leads to developmentally regulated interactions
with telomeric DNA. Because telomeres and their associated proteins are
conserved across evolution, these studies may provide insight into fundamental
mechanisms that contribute to genome stability for a broad range of eukaryotic
organisms. The project will also give students, both undergraduate and graduate,
the opportunity to gain valuable expertise in plant molecular biology,
cytogenetics, and biochemistry, while working at the cutting edge of genome
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
