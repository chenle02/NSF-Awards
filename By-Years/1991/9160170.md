Fluids that rapidly and reversibly change to solids on the application of an
electric field would be very useful for damping vibrations. Electro-rheological
fluids exist; however, because they are suspensions of solids in inert liquids,
problems are experienced with designing practical devices. Electroviscous fluids
are single-phase liquids whose rheology changes on application of an electric
field. This effect is normally very small. This Phase I research explores the
feasibility of designing electroviscous fluids that experience large changes in
viscosity on application of electric fields. The research involves synthesis of
the experimental verification of the unusual properties of a novel class of
lubricants.
