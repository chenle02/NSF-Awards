Proposal No. ESIE 93-55633 Proposal Name: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON "SOUNDPRINT"
PI: Moira Rankin ABSTRACT The SOUNDPRINT Media Center is producing a series of
radio documentaries entitled "Science and Technology on SOUNDPRINT," a set of
related educational and outreach materials, and multimedia non-broadcast
applications. The project will include 16 original science documentaries and 21
programs repackaged as special broadcasts distributed to over 200 public radio
stations in the United States, reaching over 750,000 listeners, and ten
countries around the world. The programs also will be distributed on Internet
Talk Radio. The 16 new Programs will be grouped around three themes: "The
Butterfly Effect" which will bring large scientific concepts describing global
change to a more human level, "Technology and Culture" which will consider the
implications of technology, and "The Consequences of Science" which will look at
the broad implications of scientific research. The Executive Producer for the
project is Moira Rankin. Neenah Ellis will serve as Senior Producer and will
work directly with independent producers in story and script development. The
Science Editors will be Ann Finkbeiner, a freelance science writer, and Barbara
Culliton, Deputy Editor of "Nature."
