This action funds Kevin H. Miller of the University of Florida to conduct a
research project, entitled "Infrared Transmission Study of Electric and Magnetic
Excitations in Novel Single Crystals" during the summer of 2012 at the
University of Wollongong in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. The host
scientist is Professor Roger A. Lewis.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in searching for magnon and
electromagnon excitations in novel multiferroic and magnetoelectric single
crystals. More specifically, the proposed research involveds terahertz
transmission measurements on FeTe2O5Br, CuSe2O5, and Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2Cl to
investigate the existence of magnetoelectric coupling in these materials.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
