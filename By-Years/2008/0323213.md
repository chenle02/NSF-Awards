0323213&lt;br/&gt;Grasmueck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports development
of a new generation 3-D ground penetrating radar (GPR) system that will employ
laser scanning technology for cm-level positioning of multiple GPR antennae and
wireless links to replace industry standard GPR cables. The developed system
should allow for rapid acquisition of high resolution 3-D GPR images of the
shallow subsurface underlying natural terrains, regardless of topography. The
project will involve interdisciplinary collaborations between geoscientists and
electrical engineers at the Universities of Miami and Notre Dame and in the
commercial sector. The project will also involve graduate students and the
prototype system will be tested in applications ranging from studies of
hydrologic conditions of the vadose zone to surveys of the distribution of
buried unexploded ordnance on military
bases.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
