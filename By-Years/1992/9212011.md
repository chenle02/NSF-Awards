This research addresses the learning of a concept class in the exact learning
model. This concept class, the set of k-quasi Horn sentences, has crucial
significance in both models: it is known that if k-quasi Horn sentences are
shown to be learnable in the exact learning model, then (under some general
cryptographic assumptions) the large class of conjunctive normal form sentences
are predictable in the PAC model. Partial research has shown that k-quasi Horn
sentences are indeed learnable when the exact learning model is augmented with
somewhat more power. This line of research will be continued to obtain a
definitive answer about the learnability of k-quasi Horn sentences in the exact
learning model.
