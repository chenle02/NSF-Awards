This project will provide funding to assist US-based graduate students to attend
the 2011 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC). In addition to attending the
conference events, students receiving assistance will serve as scribes for the
conference technical sessions to write summaries for a later issue of ;login:
magazine, will be required to attend the Student Birds-of-a-Feather session to
interact with senior members of the research community specifically interested
in meeting students in a casual and informal atmosphere, and will be strongly
encouraged to present posters and works-in-progress as part of the selection
process. Participation in USENIX ATC?11 is a valuable and important part of the
graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to
interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to
leading work in their research area. The USENIX conference creates a bridge
between academic and corporate researchers, and offers a unique, vendor neutral
forum for students to gain experience and relationships with an important peer
group. It is expected this experience will be very important to their ongoing
education, and future career. This project will enable the participation of
students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference.
