This special minority award will give Ph.D. student Rebecca Sanchez additional
flexibility to pursue her graduate studies and research in sociology. This award
will strengthen minority research participation in sociology. More specifically,
the grant will permit Sanchez to strengthen her research skills by improving her
ability to use Spanish through intensive language training in Mexico. This is
important to her research into social issues affecting Mexicans and Chicanos,
her chosen area of study for her Master's thesis and Ph.D. work.
