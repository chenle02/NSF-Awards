Animals can benefit from living in social groups for many reasons. For example,
individuals living in a group can share the burden of finding food resources,
watching for predators and caring for offspring. However, we know very little
about the physiological mechanisms that contribute to social advantages. This
project will address this deficiency by evaluating the relationships among
stress hormones, immune function, behavior, survival and kinship in Belding?s
ground squirrels. Specifically, this project will test how living near kin or
non-kin affects stress hormones and immune function as well as how increased
stress hormones change predation risk. Captive experiments will be conducted
with wild-caught squirrels and will measure genetic relatedness, hormone levels
and immune function with laboratory assays. It is predicted that individuals
living with kin will exhibit reduced stress hormones, increased immune function
and will perceive reduced predation risk. It is also predicted that individuals
with experimentally increased stress hormone levels will perceive greater
predation risk. This research will have broader impacts because it will improve
our understanding of how physiology shapes social benefits. This is relevant to
all social vertebrates, including humans, because they all share the
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis that regulates stress responses. In
addition, this research program has a strong history of outreach. Two
undergraduates and two field assistants will be trained in behavioral,
ecological and laboratory techniques. In addition, the results of this research
will be used to teach urban Chicago youth about behavioral research and the
scientific method.
