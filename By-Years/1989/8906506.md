The proposed project involves basic nuclear physics research at various
accelerator laboratories. Using the Laser Electron Gamma Source (LEGS) at the
National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, experiments
will be performed using polarized gamma rays to study the photodisintegration of
the deuteron, the E2/M1 ratio of the delta, the polarizabilities of the proton
and the neutron, and pion production. At the SATURNE National Laboratory in
Saclay, France, experiments on pion, kaon, and eta production will be studied
using proton-proton and proton-nucleus reactions. Experiments studying spin
degrees of freedom in nuclei are also planned using inelastic scattering of
polarized protons and deuterons. These studies extend a continuing research
program at the Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility in Los Alamos which
has focussed on pion-nucleus elastic and inelastic interactions and pion
absorption. The proposed experiments involving meson production (absorption) and
the fundamental properties of the nucleon will provide detailed information on
the general structure of the hadrons (shape and polarizabilities) and on the
hadronic interaction which intrinsically involves meson exchange. In addition,
experiments involving nuclear targets (other than the proton) will yield
information on specific aspects of nuclear structure.
