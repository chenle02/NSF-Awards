PI requests funds to collect volcanic rocks suitable for precise dating of 19
fossil floras, chiefly in the region from northern Nevada to Washington and
central Idaho. This is required to complete a comparative snythesis of
vegetation and climate during the time 14-12 Ma over the region from eastern
Washington to the Salton Sea, some 1,700 km (1,000 mi.) southward. All the
floras under study record environments directly following a major climatic
crisis as revealed by comparison with floras 16-15 Ma. The younger floras show a
drastic reduction or virtual elimination of exotic genera, those now in eastern
US or Asia, a change reflecting a marked decrease in summer rainfall over the
interior. As a result, most species in younger floras closely resemble those in
modern vegetation in the western U.S. However, the change was the greatest over
the central interior for exotic taxa persisted longer under more favorable
climate in coastal regions and to the north. To complete this regional
synthesis, radiometric dating of volcanic rocks associated with previously
described floras is mandatory so that those of closely similar age will be
compared. Research will improve understanding of how vegetation changes in
response to climate change.
