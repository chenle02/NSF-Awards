9403723 Pesin The proposed topics for research are in the general area of
dynamical systems and include the study of stochastic behavior of trajectories
for certain finite dimensional systems and for dissipative dynamical systems
with singularities having attractors which are close to hyperbolic attractors.
This research has potential applications to areas of mathematical physics where
dynamical sytems models are relevant and also to the theory of fractals and
chaos. ***
