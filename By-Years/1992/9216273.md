The principal investigators propose an investigation of interactions between
spatial and spectral degrees of freedom in high bandwidth optical systems.
Applications include high speed communications and interconnections, adaptive
signal processing and spectroscopy. Their focus is on three systems concepts: 1)
Holographic spectral filtering; 2) Holographic mode shaping; and 3) Holographic
dispersion compensation. Successful development of these concepts relies on the
development novel materials, modulators and detectors.
