&lt;br/&gt;Title: Strengthening Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics Programs of Study&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turtle Mountain Community
College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HRD 0222546&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI - Carol
Davis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With NSF support, Turtle Mountain Community College
(TMCC) will improve its capacity to enroll, retain, and graduate Native American
students in STEM disciplines. The use of technology will be emphasized where it
can be directly applied within the STEM curriculum and used as a mechanism to
enhance teaching and learning. Faculty professional development will also focus
on the infusion of technology into the STEM
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project goals include strengthening the
institution's technological infrastructure and systematically enhancing TMCC's
STEM capacity; improving STEM teaching and learning through curriculum
development, reform and enhancement; and, broadening student participation in
STEM programs through improved outreach, recruitment, retention and graduation.
Special emphasis will focus on promoting student success in STEM gatekeeper and
bottleneck courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
