This research assesses the response of eolian geomorphic systems in the Mojave
Desert to climatic changes during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene (~the last
50,000 yr) as an example of the geologic record of the effects of global change
on desert regions. The history of eolian activity in the region is documented
using information from eolian sand accumulations and luminescence dating of
eolian depositional episodes and is correlated with parallel records
environmental change (e.g. lake level changes, vegetation changes). Wind
directions and circulation patterns associated with periods of eolian activity
have been reconstructed from evidence contained in eolian deposits and
landforms; and the magnitude of climatic changes required to produce significant
eolian transport and deposition in the region has been assessed through studies
of the modern climatology of sand and dust transporting events.
