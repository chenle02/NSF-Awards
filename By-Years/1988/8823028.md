This is a project to obtain petrologic, major and trace element abundances, and
radioisotopic data for lavas of varying age from diverse localities in the
eastern Indian Ocean. Objectives are to determine the long term geochemical
trends along 90E Ridge in order to understand changes in mixing ratios between
enriched and depleted mantle components; evaluate growth and evolution of
individual 90E volcanoes as they migrated away from hot spot source; determine
role of unusual mantle components as function of age; determine if enriched
components distinct from a Kerguelen hotspot signature have also contributed to
volcanism on the eastern Indian Ocean seafloor. %%% Relatively little is known
about the geochemical signature of volcanic rocks from the eastern Indian ocean,
and this project will provide baseline data needed for comparison with the
observed isotopic anomalies from the western Indian Ocean. Dr. Frey is a well
respected petrologist and there is mo doubt that his lab is equipped to generate
the high quality data that is necessary. He has worked successfully on projects
of a similar scope in the past.
