A broad program of research in theoretical physics will be concerned with
string theory, which seeks to explain all of the fundamental forces of nature
and the constituents of matter. The research will focus on string duality--- a
radical new dynamical symmetry principle which relates physical phenomena
occurring at the shortest and longest distance scales. A concurrent educational
focus will be the development of a common core curriculum in the mathematical
methods of physics for graduate students in theoretical physics.
