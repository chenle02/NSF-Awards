This project adds an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) to the
instruments available to students for their senior research project. Students
learn to use the instrument in the quantitative analysis course and are then
able to use the AAS for their senior research project. Those students familiar
with the use of the AAS help other students on the research project without this
training to use the AAS. This sharing of knowledge and capabilities encourages
cooperative research projects. The grantee provides funds that are an equal
match for the NSF award.
