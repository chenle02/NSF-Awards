This project will apply the non-redundant masking technique to an adaptive
optics system. The advantages of non-redundant masking are: rejection of
atmospheric noise resulting in improved signal-to-noise ratio; precision
calibratability of the data resulting in reliable results even beyond the
diffraction limit (super-resolution); and image reconstruction with closure
phase techniques that is immune to phase errors introduced by the atmosphere,
telescope, and adaptive optics system. Visibility data will be simultaneously
calibrated with wavefront sensor telemetry, eliminating temporal variability in
the atmospheric and AO system properties as a systematic uncertainty.
