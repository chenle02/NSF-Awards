This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for the installation and operation of a DS-3 ATM connection to the MREN
where they can gain access to the Very High Performance Backbone Network Service
(vBNS). This link will be upgraded to a OC-3c sometime in the summer of 1988.
