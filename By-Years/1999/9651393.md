This project updates and redesigns laboratory activities associated with a
2-semester introductory survey course in astronomy. The objectives of the
courses are to teach the method and approach of science to non-science-majors.
The laboratory exercises are each focused on specific scientific concepts. The
exercises draw on the research experience of the astronomy faculty and can be
made available to other institutions. The courses enroll about 400 students each
semester, and equipment for 20 laboratory stations is being purchased.
