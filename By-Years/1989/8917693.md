This is a study of halogen elements and water in basalt rocks from the mid-
ocean ridge system. Several questions will be addressed. Is the elevated
abundance of chlorine in some basalts the result of seawater alteration of the
rocks, or does the chlorine come from the earth's mantle? If alteration is the
source, is the concentration related to seafloor spreading rate, tectonic
associations, or crystallization depth of the basalt? Does the observed excess
in chlorine relate to commonly observed excesses in some other elements? Are
there regional variations in the concentration of water relative to other
elements in mid-ocean ridge basalts, and if so, does this reflect mantle
heterogeneity? Despite their low abundances in mid-ocean ridge basalt, these
volatiles play an important role in magmatic processes with the suboceanic
mantle and crust and this study of the nature and concentration of volatiles
will provide crucial information about the formation and evolution of magmas at
mid-ocean ridges.
