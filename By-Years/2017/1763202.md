The International Conference on Epigenetics and Bioengineering 2017 (EpiBio
2017) is sponsored by the Society for Biological Engineering, and will be held
in Miami, Florida. This international conference will bring together established
biologists, engineers, biochemists, and clinician-scientists, as well as
graduate students to train one another in complementary viewpoints and
expertise. To encourage interaction and further discussions, the entire meeting
is held in a single-track format, with most meals taken together and with
multiple poster sessions (typically presented by students, postdocs, or junior
faculty/scientists). This conference is designed to achieve several NSF
missions, including; enhancing collaboration with international communities,
integrating the engineering sciences with the life sciences, encouraging
research and development in multidisciplinary areas, and educating the next
generation of young scientists. EpiBio 2017 will focus on growing the scientific
exchange among epigenetic and bioengineering researchers, and increasing
collaboration between international and American
scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elements of the meeting will include
scientific talks from leaders in the field, held in plenary format (no
concurrent sessions), and poster sessions, with an emphasis on participation
from graduate students, postdocs, and young investigators, held in the evenings.
Session topics will include: Detecting epigenetic modifications, Editing the
epigenome, Epigenetics in bioprocess engineering, and Epigenetics in human
health. The organizers are collaborating with the conference chairs on a 10 page
supplement to be published in the CEP Magazine on the technologies discussed at
the conference. The conference proceedings will be published both online on the
conference website and in one or two of the AIChE journals, including
Biotechnology Progress, in collaboration with Wiley.
