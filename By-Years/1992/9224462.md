Somani This is a project to mitigate the effects of transient faults in
redundant computer systems that use cache memories. Redundant computer systems
typically employ a voting circuit as part of the processor-memory interface to
check for consistency in all bus transactions. If cache memories are used, many
operations do not use the processor-memory interface, and so escape the scrutiny
of the voter. In this project new cache protocols are being designed that
provide for fault tolerance in redundant systems. The new protocols require the
cache controllers to broadcast the contents of cache lines on occasion, and
require cache controllers to respond to requests from the memory system to
replace erroneous data. The project covers the development, analysis, and
application of fault-tolerant cache protocols.
