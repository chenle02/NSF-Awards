Funds are requested for an acquisition of the BetaScope 603 Radioanalytic Imager
to detect, record and analyze B-emmitting isotopes (32P, 35S, 14C) from any one
or two dimensional samples (gels, blots, TLC plates, etc.). Research projects
include studies of: 1) the biophysics of protein-nucleic acid interactions; 2)
expression and regulation of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genetic material; 3)
biology of episomes and transposable elements; 4) the biology and biochemistry
of RNA processing in eukaryotes; 5) the biochemistry of ribozymes (i.e., Group I
autocatalytic introns); 6) the biochemistry and genetic of cholesterol and bile
acid metabolism; 7) a new class of MHC linked genes and protein products; 8)
factors directing the development of several classes of terminally
differentiated mammalian cell. A group of "minor users" studying a wide range of
biological problems is also described.
