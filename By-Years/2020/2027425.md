This award will enhance the Nation's competitiveness by reducing life cycle
costs of battery-powered wireless devices that constitute networked sensor
systems. Networked sensor systems are integral to emerging Internet of Things
(IoT) applications in such diverse domains as manufacturing systems and civil
infrastructure systems. Battery life continues to limit network performance.
This project will investigate system-level performance improvements through
individual battery management and group replacement strategies. By monitoring
and controlling individual battery usage, system level quality of service can be
dynamically adjusted, leading to more uniform useful battery life. When these
networked systems are located in remote locations, cost-effective group
replacement policies can lead to lower costs to maintain the network. The
project will involve graduate students and will include mentoring activities to
attract students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
is expected to advance the state of the art in the following aspects: (1) a
prognostic algorithm that accurately predicts battery remaining useful life,
using transfer learning to leverage condition monitoring data of all batteries
in a connected environment; (2) a novel predictive maintenance policy designed
for battery group replacement, enabled by active management of battery
degradation processes; (3) optimal scheduling of battery maintenance activities
under the presence of another independently managed maintenance program with
higher priority. The project will advance knowledge on battery health management
in connected environments and provide effective power management strategies for
battery-powered wireless IoT devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
