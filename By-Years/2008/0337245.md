The new dual-beam capability of the Arecibo Observatory incoherent scatter radar
is used to derive unprecedented information about transport and momentum flux in
the complex ionospheric D-region. The horizontal and vertical wavelengths, the
propagation direction, and the horizontal coherence of gravity waves in the
region are derived using the dual-beam technique. Small beam motions in the
observation direction are used to remove historical ambiguities in the
horizontal wavelength determination. The momentum flux and momentum deposition
in the D-region are determined during large-wave events by quantification of
terms in extant theoretical parameterizations. The characteristic time constant
of gravity wave propagation is experimentally matched or bettered by a novel 4
ms inter-pulse-period sampling technique. The D-region transport
characterization is central first-step to untangling the complex transport and
chemical coupling in the region that determines the observed variations of
temperature and density.
