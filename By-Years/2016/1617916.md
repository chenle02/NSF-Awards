Software is everywhere and its correct operation plays an increasingly important
role in the health, productivity, and safety of society and in the lives of
individuals. Consequently, there is a need for techniques that can cost-
effectively measure software correctness to establish a well-founded basis for
making judgments about whether software is ready for deployment and wide spread
use. The availability of such measures provides an evidentiary basis for
balancing the rewards of using a software system against the risks of its
failure. This type of evidence has the potential to transform the expectations
of consumers of software and to enhance their understanding of software behavior
and how to place their trust in that behavior. Evidence of correctness has
obvious value for safety critical software, but more broadly it will help shape
how society views software as critical infrastructure and the professionalism
that it expects of its manufacture.

This project blends the outcomes of decades of work on abstraction-based program
analysis and symbolic execution with recent results in quantifying the solution
space of a logical formula. The project explores novel combinations and staging
of scalable non-quantitative analyses, to identify sub-spaces of program
behavior that may be erroneous, followed by quantitative analyses focused on
those sub-spaces. This offers an approach to measurable program analysis (MPA)
that promises scalability while yielding safe and accurate results. The project
produces theory and tools that realize a variety of MPA, empirically evaluates
the cost and benefit of these analyses, and openly shares all results and
artifacts with the research community.
