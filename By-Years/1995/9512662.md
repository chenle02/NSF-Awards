9512662 Liu This award is for a two year cooperative research project between
Dr. Sheng Liu, Florida Institute of Technology, and Dr. Yang Wei, Tsinghua
University, Beijing, China. The proposed work expands research funded under MSS
9310085 on damage tolerance in microelectronic packaging to include
collaboration with Tsinghua University where Professor Yang is engaged in
research on micromechanics modeling, testing and failure prediction. Under this
project researchers will conduct experimental and analytical studies on material
response and interfacial strength followed by damage tolerance analysis. The
work is experimental and computational in nature, and addresses an important
technological problem in the microelectronics industry.
