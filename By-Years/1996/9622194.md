The focus of this research is to investigate the dynamics of poly-reactive
intermediates which are generated intramolecularly within a matrix. The key
feature will be the interaction of the biscarbene or carbene-nitrene electrons
through anti-ferromagnetic connectors. Possible uses of this investigation
include cross-linking polymeric chains, bis-photoaffinity labeling and
photoactivated antitumor agents. With this renewal award, the Organic Dynamics
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Sheridan of the University of Nevada-
Reno. Professor Sheridan will focus on understanding the chemistry of a cluster
reactive intermediates. He will generate them with light and study them at low
temperatures in isolated matrices. The possible technological applications
include photoaffinity labeling and photoactivated antitumor agents.
