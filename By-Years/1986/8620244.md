Narrative: The principal investigators propose to develop a family of novel
microreactors that could simulate the reaction kinetic performance to be
expected in commercial-scale fluid beds of powdered catalysts. Design of the
microreactors will exploit a newly discovered phenomenon: about 0.5 mm layer of
fluid cracking catalyst (FCC) powder on the floor of a horizontal duct of
rectangular cross-section, vibrated vertically at about 25 Hertz with an
amplitude of several milimeters, appears to enjoy intimate contact with
"supernatant" gas flowing laterally above the powder. Cold-model experiments
would study the dispersion of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas in the ducts.
Variables in experiments would be humidity (causing SF6 adsorptivity to vary),
degree of solid back-mixing, and, in the models with flow of powder, the ratio
of flow of solid and gas. Later, a hot microreactor would be built for kinetic
studies of a catalytic reaction with once-through flow of solids. The ultimate
objective would be development of a family of microreactors for hot kinetic
studies with capabilities for commercial size fluid bed reactors.
