This award supports the research in algebraic geometry and combinatorics of
Professor Bernd Sturmfels of Cornell University. Dr. Sturmfels has proposed to
make use of the combinatorial structure of convex polytopes to attack problems
in constructive algebra and algebraic geometry. His research on combinatorial
structures arising in geometry will include a study of higher-order matroids
associated with graded ideals and how they relate to the state polytopes of
these ideals. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which
is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally,
combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical
activities, counting. In its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone
beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical
techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had
an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in
communications and information technology.
