This research involves an integrated geologic, geochemical, and isotopic study
of platform dolomites in the Cambro- Ordovician of the U.S. Applachians in
Virginia and adjacent states. Two sequences selected from the 3 to 4 km thick
passive margin succession and considered representative of the dolomite types in
the sequence are the Early Cambrian Shady Dolomite (1500 m thick) and the Early
Ordovician Knox Dolomite (600 m thick). Possible dolomite types include
hypersaline tidal-flat and possible shallow marine dolomite, shallow subsurface
dolomite forming from brines or mixed fluids beneath flats, mixing zone
dolomites (possibly associated with prograded flats or with unconformities that
cap the two successions), marine dolomites associated with the steep Cambrian
platform margin and various types of burial dolomite, locally associated with
MVT ore mineralization. The studies will be integrated with regional geologic
studies involving computer modelling of platform sequences (which provides
information on sea-level behavior, duration of cycle formation, progradation
rates of tidal flats and migration of early diagenetic zones, and duration of
emergence of flats during regressive events). For each dolomite type, data will
be obtained on major and trace element chemistry, stable isotopic composition,
and radiogenic Sr composition of the dolomites, as well as fluid inclusion data.
The effects of recrystallization or replacement of early dolomites in subsequent
diagenetic environments will be determined. The likely hydrologic and chemical
systems involved in dolomitization history will be integrated will burial
history plots that will provide timing of fluid migration and likely P- T
conditions during diagenesis.
