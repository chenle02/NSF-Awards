Multidatabase systems respond to the need of organizations to support
applications that require information maintained by several autonomous and
possibly heterogeneous database systems. A fundamental requirement underlying
Multidatabase systems is the preservation of the autonomy of the individual
database systems. However, autonomy requirements cause problems in maintaining
traditional database consistency in these systems, the reason being that
autonomy and consistency are conflicting requirements. Attempts to strike a
balance between these two requirements have focused on new correctness criteria.
However, very little analysis has been done with respect to (a) the semantics of
autonomy requirements and (b) their implications for both consistency
requirements and implementation considerations. The goal of this research is to
systematically analyze autonomy and consistency by applying a uniform
specification technique to express autonomy requirements and correctness
criteria, thereby explicitly showing their relationships and identifying the
tradeoffs between them. By understanding these tradeoffs and their effects on
different parts of a database system, this work will help in the development of
Multidatabase systems and will have an impact on the integration of other
systems in which autonomy and consistency are requirements.
