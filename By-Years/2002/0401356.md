The objective of this research is to investigate the combination of two or more
materials in the form of nanocomposite in making microstructures for
Microelectromechanical Systems applications. The first research task focuses on
metal-organic/inorganic nanocomposites by adding nanoparticles into
microstructures in order to modify and strengthen the material properties and
alleviate the mechanical deficiency such as fatigue and aging with the advantage
of low temperature processing and feasibility for direct integration with
microelectronics. The architecture of these microstructures is based on
suspended mechanical microstructures made of nanocomposite for micro actuators
or sensors such as inertial sensors applications. The second research task aims
to study conductive-polymer based nanocomposite made by encapsulating nano
substances such as chemicals, enzymes, or biomarkers into microstructures for
biosensor applications. The architecture is based on the micro-gap structures
that will be filled with conductive nanocomposite with in situ encapsulated
nanoparticles such as enzymes for bio-sensing applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrosynthesized nanocomposite will create a wide range
of novel sensor applications for Microelectromechanical systems such as high
frequency mechanical resonators that perform as precision filters in wireless
communication systems, and disposable glucose sensors that assist daily life of
diabetic patients. For industry, this research will provide potential industrial
applications with (a) advanced manufacturing capability of nanocomposite for
microstructures and (b) new ways to interact with micro systems using
nanocomposite integrated with microelectronics. For the academic world, results
of the proposed research will open a new area in nanocomposite-based design,
manufacturing and applications.&lt;br/&gt;
