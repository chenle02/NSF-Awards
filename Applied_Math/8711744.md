This project will provide sufficiently delicate infinite dimensional analogues
of Clarke and Rockafellar non- differentiable calculus to allow its application
in infinite dimensional optimization and geometry of normed spaces. The novelty
of this approach lies in attempting to provide the subgradient formulas and
normal cone formulas involving exact subdifferentials and exact normals.
Previous work by Treiman, and by the Russian school around Ioffe, Kruger and
others has always used much less satisfactory approximate subderivatives. Up to
date, the investigator has investigated the case of reflexive spaces obtaining,
in cooperation with Borwein, an exact basis of his now standard theory. She now
proposes a general research program of building a comprehensive calculus of
exact subdifferentials in Banach spaces with smooth norms. This research is part
of nonlinear analysis with potential applications to optimization and control
theory.
