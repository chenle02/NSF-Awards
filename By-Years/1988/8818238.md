In an Accomplishment-Based Renewal of his pioneering cladistic and morphometric
studies of diatoms, Dr. Edward Theriot of Philadelphia's Academy of Natural
Sciences will examine two major groups of freshwater diatoms of the northern
hemisphere, studying both fossil and living forms to determine patterns of
evolutionary change. Morphological variability in diagnostic cell-wall features
will be examined by light- and electron- microscopy in conjunction with
statistical analyses. Reliable identification of diatom species will facilitate
both basic taxonomic classification as well as stratigraphic interpretation of
geological sediments, thus benefitting oil company geologists and
paleontologists. Diatoms are among the most widespread and ecologically
important plants in the world, despite their small size. They contribute
significantly to photosynthesis in lakes and oceans as well as to geochemical
cycling of silicon, a constituent of their cell walls. These siliceous cell
walls accumulate in dense fossil deposits, providing unique opportunities to
assess the record of evolutionary origins and extinctions in a major lineage of
plants. Dr. Theriot's work thus provides insight concerning the linkage between
climatic events and evolutionary changes during recent Earth history.
