This grant provides funding for the development of efficient computational
methods to determine optimal ordering policies for inventory control problems
with multiple products and correlated demands. While the problem is fairly easy
and well solved for the single product case, methods to tract the multiple
product case face a significant challenge due to the dimensionality of the
problem. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, this work proposes on developing
a method based on the moving boundary approach. Under a moving boundary
framework, one begins with an initial guess for the optimal policy and an
estimate of the value of using that policy. If one can then come up with a
boundary update procedure that is akin to policy improvement, is monotone and
guarantees convergence, then one can to a large extent simplify the complexity
involved in solving multi-dimensional problems. An inventory control game is
also proposed alongside the development of the research where participants try
controlling multi-product inventory levels in the presence of stochastic demand,
competing not only against each other but also against the optimal
policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in this work would have an impact in two
areas. In the area of inventory control, this would be the first computational
method that can solve problems that are of the real-world size, with a large
number of product types. Second, the proposed method in general develops a
moving boundary approach to solving impulse control problems. Impulse control
problems arise in a variety of areas that include finance, economics and queuing
theory. Hence researchers would potentially be able to extend or adapt the
method for their purposes in these other areas. The stochastic control game can
provide a direct feel for the challenges in decision making under uncertainty
and enrich the learning experience of students taking courses that cover
inventory control.
