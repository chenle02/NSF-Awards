Autophagy, the regulated degradation and recycling of cellular material, is
required for many cellular functions including the response to starvation,
differentiation and development and senescence and immunity. However, the
regulation of this process and the structure of the autophagosome (the organelle
in which autophagy occurs) are not well understood in plants. This project will
advance our understanding of autophagy in plants (specifically Arabidopsis) by
addressing two major unsolved challenges 1) developing high-throughput assays to
identify small chemical modulators of autophagy in plants, and 2) developing
methods for the biochemical purification and study of plant autophagosomes.
Broader Impacts. Training at the intersection of proteomics, biochemistry, cell
biology and chemical genomics will be provided to a postdoctoral fellow and to
undergraduate students.
