This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar that will be held on October 5 and 6, 2018,
on the campus of Seattle University. Additional information about this meeting
can be found at the website: http://fac-

This conference is the twenty-fifth installment of the West Coast Operator
Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group
of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator
algebras. These meetings cover many current aspects of research in the theory of
C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras. Some of the 2018 emphasis will be on the
following topics: subfactors and their invariants, rigidity for ergodic actions
and von Neumann algebras, free probability and its applications, classification
of C*-algebras (the Elliot program), noncommutative geometry, operator spaces,
quantum groups, graph C*-algebras. The conference program broadens participation
in the theory of operator algebras and provides ample opportunity for graduate
students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
