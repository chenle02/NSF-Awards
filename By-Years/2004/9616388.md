The Organic Dynamics Program supports studies of photochemistry and strained
molecules carried out under the direction of Professor Richard Johnson of the
University of New Hampshire at Durham. Through a combination of experimental and
calculational studies, Professor Johnson explores the formation and reaction
chemistry of high-energy organic compounds with distorted multiple bonds,
including small-ring 1,2-dienes such as 1,2-cyclobutadiene and
1,2-cyclopentadiene and 1,2,3-trienes such as 1,2,3-cyclobutatriene and
1,2,3-cyclohexatriene. Other strained-ring compounds, cyclopropanated
phenanthrenes, serve as photochemical precursors to vinylidene, vinylcarbene,
cyclopropylidene, and other carbenes. Development of a fundamental understanding
of chemical structure and reactivity often requires the study of compounds
designed to test implicit and explicit assumptions about chemical bonding and
stability. Professor Richard Johnson, of the University of New Hampshire at
Durham, uses the energy of light to induce the formation of molecules designed
to stretch the limits of such assumptions, focusing on cyclic compounds for
which consideration of simple bonding principles would predict impossibility of
existence. These studies, in addition to their importance on the fundamental
level, will lead to new routes for the preparation of molecules with biological
activity and for the preparation of unusual polymeric materials, and may also
shed light on phenomena observed in combustion chemistry, fullerene (`Bucky
ball`) synthesis, and extraterrestrial chemistry.
