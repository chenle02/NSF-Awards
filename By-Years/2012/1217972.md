The objective of this research is to create a new stochastic computing paradigm
to reap the full benefits of emerging memristor devices for the next generation
of energy-limited and high-performance applications. The computing paradigm
takes advantage of the nondeterministic memristors for native stochastic
computing, where the randomness required by stochastic computing will be
intrinsic to the system without resorting to expensive stochastic number
generation. The native stochastic computing system consists of memristor memory
and stochastic computing elements that are seamlessly integrated. To evaluate
the approach, test vehicles including a stochastic calculator and a clustering
processor are created by the hybrid integration of memristor memory and
stochastic computing circuits. The native stochastic computing based on
memristors demonstrates key advantages in energy and speed over a competitive
CMOS baseline, and is best positioned for compute-intensive, data-intensive and
probabilistic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary nature of
this research encourages a tight integration of device and computer hardware
research areas and provides excellent training to students in cutting-edge
nanoelectronics, integrated circuit design, and computer architecture. The
graduates of this research program possess skill sets of critical need in both
industry and academia. The research contributes to the undergraduate and
graduate curriculum, in the forms of updated undergraduate courses and special
topics offered in graduate courses. The research outcomes, along with two test
vehicles, are disseminated through professional seminars, workshops, and as part
of high school outreach programs. An emphasis on undergraduate and minority
mentoring helps draw a broad and diverse participation over the course of this
research project.
