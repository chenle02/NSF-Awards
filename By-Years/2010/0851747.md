The University of Nebraska REU Site will provide a research program for
undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Ten students will be selected to
participate in a 10-week research experience in redox biology under the guidance
of experienced faculty mentors. Redox biology includes oxidation-reduction
linked biological reactions, redox signaling and regulation, and cellular
defense mechanisms that minimize oxidative damage/stress. The summer program
will enable students to explore fundamental redox processes related to
biotechnology and the environment. The goal of the training program is to
involve undergraduate students in broad-based research and significantly impact
their career decisions. REU participants will conduct individual research
projects under the guidance of a faculty mentor in the Redox Biology Center. The
mentors offer a breadth of multidisciplinary approaches and share a common goal
of understanding critical redox-active processes. Students will receive
experimental training in a variety of areas including molecular biology,
microbiology, biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, and protein crystallography,
and will utilize state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. In addition,
students will attend journal club meetings, career development seminars, lunch
discussion groups, and social activities. The program will conclude with
students presenting their research findings at a poster session. Participant
selection will be based on academic achievements, research interests, and career
goals. Students at smaller institutions with limited research opportunities and
those from underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply. REU participants
receive a stipend, full room and board, and travel assistance. More information
