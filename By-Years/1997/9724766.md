9724766 BERELSON This is a cooperative research project between William
Berelson of the University of Southern California and David T. Heggie of the
Australian Geological Survey Organisation, Canberra. Funds will be used to
support testing the components of new benthic chambers developed with research
funding from the National Science Foundation's Division of Ocean Sciences while
conducting research into nutrient recycling and denitrification in Australian
bays and estuaries. The Australian research projects offer tangible benefit to
the U.S. research effort. For example, they make multiple chambers available to
conduct side-by-side comparisons, and they have analytical facilities and
expertise to process many chamber samples. They offer logistical field support
with research vessels and divers, and they are interested in conducting complex
and expensive manipulation experiments such as labeled N spike experiments and
N2 measurements. This will contribute to the development of the best device for
use in shallow coastal Australian and U.S. waters.
