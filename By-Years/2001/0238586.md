The goal of this research project is to study research challenges to support
efficient, effective data integration and sharing in distributed environments.
The approach consists of (1) how to describe various source contents and allow
users to formulate queries easily; (2) how to manage source metadata
effectively; (3) how to deal with data heterogeneity (e.g., link duplicate
records from different sources); and (4) how to optimize distributed queries
that involve multiple sources. The research provides great opportunities to
educate students about existing database-management techniques as well as
initiating them into research. Further information about the project can be
found on the web site (http://www-db.ics.uci.edu/pages/raccoon/). The research
results will have broad impacts in information management in e-commerce,
scientific data management, digital government, and homeland security. The
results will be disseminated in the form of publications, publicly available
data sets, software, and demos. The personnel of the project will give
presentations in conferences and colloquia.
