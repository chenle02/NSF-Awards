The objective of this research is to study the characterization of yeast that
are metabolizing very rapidly, using a novel continuous culture technique called
"controlled-concentration-coupled-continuous-culture" (abbreviated as C5)
system. Conventional means for continuous culturing are the chemostat in which
nutrient is fed into a reactor at a constant rate, and the turbidostat which
employs feedback control of the pumping rate to keep a constant turbidity of the
culture in the reactor. This study depends upon another technique for continuous
culture employing sensors for proportional control of substrate concentration.
The research initially concentrates on demonstrating ethanol production by
aerobic continuous culture at very high dilution rates by the C5 system.
Continuous biological production of ethanol should lower its cost. The areas of
investigation include: means of increasing ethanol concentration and
productivity in fermentors; improvement of ethanol tolerance by microorganisms;
and developing methods of achieving high-density cell cultures.
