9424061 Eisenberg The REU Site will provide mentored research experiences for
ten undergraduate interns within the context of ongoing research programs in the
Department of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University. These ongoing
projects span a wide range of research activities representative of Biomedical
Engineering and include both modeling/simulation and experimental work. The REU
intern will work on their individual projects as members of research teams in
the laboratories of the participating investigators. All interns will be exposed
to the entire spectrum of research activities included in this proposal through
joint weekly meetings in which the interns discuss their work with each other.
These sessions will also be used to provide a forum for presentations and group
discussions about a variety of topics intended to supplement the research
experiences and encourage the interns to pursue graduate training in Biomedical
Engineering. An orientation at the beginning of the program will introduce the
interns to the undergraduate research experiences and help familiarize the
participants with the process of initiating independent inquiry in which there
are a number of degrees of freedom in the methods chosen and the outcomes
obtained. Oral and written technical communication skills will also be
introduced. The goal of the REU Site program in Biomedical Engineering is to
create an environment and culture to encourage the undergraduate participants to
pursue research careers in Biomedical Engineering by exposing them to the
intellectual challenge and excitements of independent inquiry. ***
