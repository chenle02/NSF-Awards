9704640 Farb Farb's project is in the area of geometric group theory. A new
geometric/topological approach to rigidity questions for lattices in semisimple
Lie groups, generalizing Mostow rigidity, has been developed by several authors,
including Farb. He plans to continue his work with L. Mosher in bringing these
new ideas and themes to bear on understanding quasi-isometries of broader
classes of groups arising in combinatorial group theory. He will also work on
characterizing a broad class of finitely generated groups by certain dynamics
they exhibit. Finally, Farb will study the geometry of deformation spaces of
discrete subgroups of rank-one Lie groups over local fields. Geometric group
theory is a mixture of geometry, topology, algebra, and algorithms. Farb's
project in this area is an attempt to understand the relationship between the
symmetries exhibited by a space and its geometric structure on very large
scales. ***
