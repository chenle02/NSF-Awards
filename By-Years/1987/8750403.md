The psychology department to upgrading equipment in existing laboratories in
learning and perception, in a cognition course, and further promoting and
broadening the opportunities for independent student research. The laboratories
and research activities supported by this proposal are intended to illustrate
the principles and concepts of psychology through first hand exposure, to
familiarize students with the scientific methodology and instrumentation in
these areas, and ultimately to develop the skills necessary for independent
investigation. Six microcomputers, six printers, and two interfacing devices are
being requested. Two computers, printers, and the interfaces will be used to
support laboratories in learning and three computers and printers will be used
in cognition and sensation/perception courses. The sixth computer and printer
will be devoted to data analysis and preparation and report writing by students
enrolled in the above courses and those carrying out a senior thesis.
