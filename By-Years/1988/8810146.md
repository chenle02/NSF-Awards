The objective of this research is to establish a theoretical basis for the
creation of a spherical wrist stepper motor capable of three degrees of
orientation motion in a single joint. The ball-joint-like spherical wrist motor
is characterized by its simplicity in structure, compact design and free from
singularities in the middle of the workspace except at the boundaries and
unbalanced rotor centrifugal forces. The spherical wrist stepper motor has
significant applications where the end-effector is required to orient quickly,
continuously and isotropically in all directions such as high speed plasma and
laser cutting. The research will focus on three areas. The first is the
prediction of the magnetic fields and reluctance forces for a given design using
finite element technique, which will also provide a good understanding of the
influences of the design parameters, on the torque and resolution. The second is
an optimization using non-linear programming techniques to maximize torque while
minimizing weight and volume for a specified resolution. The third area is the
development of a two-level control scheme to pre-plan an optimum trajectory and
to develop an orientation control law with good disturbance rejection.
