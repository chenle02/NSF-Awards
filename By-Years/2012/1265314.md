The Logical Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS) symposium of 2013 will be
held in San Diego, CA on January 6-8 of 2013. The LFCS General Chair is Anil
Nerode (Cornell University), the Program Committee Chair is Sergei Artemov
(Graduate Center of the City University of New York), and the Organizing
Committee Chair is Jeff Remmel (University of California San Diego). The LFCS
series represents the body of work in those areas of fundamental logic related
to computer science. The conference is intended to encourage the interchange and
interuse of ideas emanating from a wide variety of fields and applications.
Since its origin in 1989, each LFCS meeting has resulted in a Springer volume of
proceedings published prior to the conference and, as has been the norm, a post-
conference volume of Annals of Pure and Applied Logic - a flagship journal in
mathematical logic.

LFCS conferences appear to be of significant and growing importance for the
logic and foundations community in the United States since computer and
information sciences provide a cluster of areas in which the core logical
methods are applicable in the most immediate and powerful way. Such a conference
is pivotal for building a cadre of future logical foundations of computer
science. The US community in logic and foundations will benefit greatly from
such a conference. Logic life in the San Diego area is vibrant with many
directions of logic and foundations interacting in most fruitful ways. The
conference will attract a good number of participants including graduate
students for whom this conference will be a milestone event.
