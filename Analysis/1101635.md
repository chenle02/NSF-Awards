The PI will continue his work on limit theorem for dynamical systems. The main
directions of research will be the following: convergence to stable laws, limit
theorems for actions of higher rank abelian groups, limit theorems for random
translations and diffusion limit theorems.

Examples of systems which evolve according to deterministic laws but exhibit
stochasticity when the initial conditions are not known exactly appear in
natural phenomena ranging from atomic scales (Brownian Motion of particles in
fluids) to astronomical scales (motion of comets and asteroids). In cases where
exact calculations are impossible due to stochasticity a statistical description
has to be used. The research supported by the current proposal will develop
methods of statistical description of deterministic system by identifying the
regions in the phase space responsable for the stochasticity and analyzing the
behaviour of the system in those regions. PI will also continue his synergistic
activities including organizing conferences, giving lectures and minicourses on
recent advances in dynamics, writing survey papers and mentoring graduate
students and postdocs.
