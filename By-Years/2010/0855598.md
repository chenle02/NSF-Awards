Title: Biological Materials Science Symposium

INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The Biological Materials Science Symposium at the Annual
Meeting of the Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society (April 2009) provides a
venue for researchers exploring the intersection of materials science and
biology. Materials science and engineering is expected to play a highly
significant role in the foreseeable future of biomedicine. Conversely, noting
that materials science finds its roots in solid state physics and chemistry,
biology is logically the next great frontier for materials science. The BMS
Symposium is different from other related symposia in emphasizing the primacy of
the study of biological materials to the development of biomaterials and
biomimetic materials, as well as the application of materials science and
engineering principles to the study of biological materials. The well-planed
program of the proposed five-day symposium provides an important venue for
discussion of the role of biologically-derived materials in the broader field of
biomaterials, which encompasses not only bioderived materials but also
biomimetic, bioinspired, and biocompatible materials that may not be of
biological origin. Outstanding keynote and other invited speakers from around
the world have been asked to highlight recent advances and emerging trends in
the biomaterials field in each of eight topical sessions.

BROADER IMPACTS: A particularly strong feature of this symposium is its
commitment to the involvement of students, whose travel to the symposium will be
supported in part by this award and who will participate in a student poster
contest for which prizes will be given to the best presentations. These students
will not only be active symposium participants but will have ample opportunity
to meet an international array of biomaterials researchers and learn of their
work. Sessions of the broader meeting are specifically designed to highlight the
opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities in the field.
