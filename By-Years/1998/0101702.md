The incompressibility of the ionosphere has led to the paradox that it appears
as if the ionosphere must sometimes drive the magnetosphere. To understand this
problem the mechanism by which information is transferred from one part of the
ionosphere to another must be examined. This project will investigate the role
of the fast-mode plasma wave and how it propagates in the ionospheric waveguide.
The investigation will look at how far fast-mode waves can travel and how they
couple to shear-mode Alfeven waves. Strongly coupled waves would imply that the
propagation is controlled by the lower altitude ionosphere's properties. This
will provide a definitive answer to whether or not the magnetosphere can be
driven by the ionosphere.
