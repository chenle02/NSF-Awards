The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications at the University of
Minnesota holds a number of workshops, or "Periods of Concentration," each year.
These workshops are interdisciplinary in nature and involve engineers,
mathematicians, and scientists from academia, industry, and government. This
award will provide support for a Period of Concentration on Stochastic Control
Theory with Applications in Electrical/Computer Engineering and Operations
Research. The specific areas to be covered during the workshop include: control
of Markov diffusion processes; connections with nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDE); nonlinear filtering; stochastic variational calculus; theory
and applications of control of jump processes; dynamic allocation; stochastic
scheduling; adaptive control; stochastic approximation; stochastic systems with
multiple scales; stochastic stability; and optimization by simulated annealing.
