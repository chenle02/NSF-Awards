Frequently research on data integration carried out by computer scientists and
resulting tools must be modified to fit the needs of domain practitioners
(ecologists in this case). This challenge is a socio-technical, collective
action problem that can be addressed through a combination of tools and
incentives. The project proposes to holding a series of workshops along with
proofs-of-concept implementations. These workshops will result in approaches to
decentralize the sharing of data in the long tail, through socio-technical
approaches that appropriately incentivize and facilitate data integration by
smaller labs. Such an interdisciplinary community will provide crucial real-
world input to computer science researchers, which will give their research into
tools the potential for larger impact in ecological practice and will yield
better tools for ecologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
