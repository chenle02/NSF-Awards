This award supports the development of an improved version of an oxygen
electrode that is expected to have an oxygen sensitivity five orders of
magnitude greater than that of commercially available electrodes of similar
type, as well as an improved response time. The instrument will also have
fluorescence excitation and detection capabilities. The instrument is expected
to facilitate studies of photosynthetic reaction mechanisms, permitting the
determination of the redox state and charge transfer kinetics of photosynthetic
cofactors in the microsecond time range. In addition to these scientific goals,
the project is expected to have a significant impact on training of graduate and
undergraduate students.
