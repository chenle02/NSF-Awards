This project aims to enhance the training and mentoring of postdocs, graduate
students, and undergraduates. It will strengthen connections among researchers
at different career stages and in different research areas within algebraic and
geometric topology and related disciplines. Important outcomes for the project
are the development of structured feedback mechanisms for students and postdocs,
expansion of professional development opportunities, increasing research
collaboration amongst the graduate students, postdocs, and faculty,
strengthening connections between the topology group at Michigan State
University and those at peer institutions, and broadening access to graduate
school for undergraduates. The activities are designed to have a lasting impact
on the RTG participants as well as the broader topology research
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will incorporate four additional
postdoctoral researchers, as well as supporting the research of twelve graduate
students. Undergraduates will also be increasingly integrated into the
activities of the topology group through the creation of a summer directed
reading program and an undergraduate peer mentoring program. Inclusive mentoring
and feedback processes for graduate students and postdocs will be introduced, as
well as extensive professional development opportunities. Small groups of
faculty, postdocs, and students will make extended visits to peer institutions
to build stronger ties and broaden the impact of the research training group
beyond the boundaries of the university. Other activities include structured
vertical collaborations and new courses, seminars, and workshops, benefiting
graduate students, postdocs, and faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
