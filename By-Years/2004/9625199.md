This is a Faculty Early Career project. The project will study gas phase protein
folding and structure. The solution tertiary/quaternary structure of proteins is
crucial to their activity. Gas phase proteins are solvent-free, and are
structurally defined only by their intramolecular constraints. Gas phase work
thus provides a background for understanding folding and structure in solution,
and the present project will elucidate the roles that intramolecular and solvent
interactions play in establishing protein structure in solution. This work will
use ion chromatography, a new technique for separating isomers in the gas phase,
combined with electrospray mass spectrometry. The technique will provide overall
shape information about the proteins studied. Educationally, Dr. Clemmer will
teach oral communication skills to graduate students by development of a
student-run bioanalytical chemistry seminar series and will mentor minority
students regularly. This project will study protein structure in the simplest of
situations, the gas phase, and will use the information gained thereby to
understand the factors governing their solution structures. The project will
teach effective oral communication to graduate students and Dr. Clemmer will
mentor minority students regularly in his research group.
