Datacenters and clouds have become the main compute platform for many large
scale corporations. Petabyte-scale datasets are stored throughout the datacenter
and hundreds to thousands of different users submit jobs to collect business
intelligence, gather statistics, or to compute essential data, such as a large
scale index or a list of top users or their message posts. However, a
significant challenge to these centers arises from user manipulation by some or
all of the many tenants (both intentional and unintentional) of the underlying
resource allocation mechanisms through misreporting of true job
characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designing and testing new
algorithms combining ideas from computer science and economics which will make
datacenters and clouds more robust to user manipulations. It is initially
focusing on two important abstractions. The first allocates the total amount of
resources and the second allocates individual machines (or virtual machines).
The former is the standard abstraction for datacenters and the latter for many
clouds, such as Facebook's internal cluster and Amazon's public EC2. For the
former, where there are existing non-manipulable algorithms, the PIs are
developing extensions to support new requirements, such as jobs with
constraints. For the latter, the PIs are inventing new non-manipulable
algorithms based on their preliminary studies. In addition, this project is
applying recent results from algorithmic mechanism design and game theory to
develop general procedures for converting existing manipulable protocols into
non-manipulable ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to more robust
mechanisms for datacenters and clouds, reducing costs and energy usage.
