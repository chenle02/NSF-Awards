The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve safety by detecting toxic
chemicals. Toxic chemicals present risks in many sectors; examples include the
oil and gas industry, food quality monitoring, waste management optimization,
agricultural pest infestations, and even breath analysis for disease detection.
This project will advance the development of a low-cost, low-power vapor sensing
system, with an initial focus on the threat detection and air quality monitoring
market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I
project proposes a high sensitivity, micro-fabricated functionalized sensor. The
proposed architecture fabricates a high-frequency bulk acoustic resonator
directly on CMOS integrated circuits, enabling low-cost mass production and
improves the noise characteristics of the sensor. This direct integration
simplifies the architecture and allows for suppressed electrical noise and also
enables fabrication of an array of highly specific sensors. The project's
research objectives include receptor evaluation, resonator fabrication, receptor
integration, and sensor testing to characterize the system in relevant
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
