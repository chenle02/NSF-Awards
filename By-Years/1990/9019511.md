Professor Knight is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study chemical reaction products generated under high
energy pulsed laser vaporization conditions using electron spin resonance (ESR)
spectroscopy. Scientific knowledge obtained from these studies could be
important in several areas including silicon deposition processes involved in
the fabrication of microelectronic components and identification of reactive
intermediates involved in upper atmospheric chemistry. This research is done in
collaboration with undergraduate students in chemistry who gain experience with
lasers, high vacuum technology, ESR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and
spectral simulations, all of which provide good preparation for careers in
science and engineering. Cation, anion and neutral radicals are produced by
pulsed laser vaporization, the radicals are identified by time-of-flight mass
spectroscopy, and are trapped in a neon matrix at 4 K. Many new molecular
radical ions are being generated and characterized for the first time in Prof.
Knight's laboratory. The electron spin resonance spectra obtained have
linewidths which are comparable to those in the gas phase and allow the
determination of hyperfine structure as well as g values. Hyperfine parameters
are extremely sensitive to the electronic wavefunction and hence provide
stringent tests of ab initio theoretical calculations which are being carried
out in collaboration with several theoretical groups.
