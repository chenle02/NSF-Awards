The PIs will build three Hi-throughput Imaging Echelle spectrograph (Hi-TIES)
instruments to demonstrate visible tomography of cusp emissions. They will use a
CCD detector suitable for cusp application, to be presented in a campaign type
mode. The key objectives are (1) to provide extensive data of sunlit cusp
emissions for extended periods using a newly developed capability, complemented
by other ground-based and space based instruments, and (2) to provide a hands-on
interdisciplinary research training ground for graduate students, with a mix of
experimental and modeling and data analyses components.
