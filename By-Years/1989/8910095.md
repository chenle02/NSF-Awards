This project addresses research in the control of redundant manipulators.
Manipulators currently in use are configured with six degrees of freedom, which
is the minimum number of joints required to achieve an arbitrary position and
orientation of the end effector. However, due to singularities throughout the
manipulator workspace, a six degree of freedom manipulator is functionally only
a five degree of freedom manipulator. This research examines the utilization of
additional, or redundant, degrees of freedom to contend with singularities, and
to avoid obstacles and joint and torque limits. Four basic issues are addressed
herein, including : a) determination of self motion (joint motion which does not
cause end effector motion) to optimize performance criteria, b) optimization of
performance criteria for redundant manipulators (smooth switching from one
criteria to another and assignment of varying weights to different criteria), c)
task based utilization of redundancy resulting in joint configurations requiring
lower joint torques, and d) automatic adjustment of end effector speed to avoid
obstacles, singularities, and joint limits. This research should expand the
application of redundant manipulators to a wider range of tasks requiring high
speed and dexterity, thus justifying the additional cost associated with
redundant joints.
