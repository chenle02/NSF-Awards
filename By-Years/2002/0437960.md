Program Summary&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program will organize a U.S./Africa
Materials Workshop in Cape Town,&lt;br/&gt;South Africa. The workshop will be
organized by Professors Wole Soboyejo and Alan&lt;br/&gt;Needleman in the U.S.,
and Professors Daya Reddy and Bob Tait in South Africa. It will be
held&lt;br/&gt;during the second week of January in 2005. It will feature
invited speakers from the U.S. and&lt;br/&gt;Africa that are working at the
interface between mechanics and materials. The topics of the&lt;br/&gt;workshop
will include: micro-electro-mechanical systems; nano-mechanics and nano-
materials;&lt;br/&gt;thin films; dislocation mechanics and plasticity length
scales; heterogeneous materials and&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure materials. Short
courses on mechanics and materials will also be organized for&lt;br/&gt;students
at the end of the workshop. Following the workshop, the U.S./Africa Materials
Institute&lt;br/&gt;will implement collaborative research plans that will be
developed in panel discussions that will&lt;br/&gt;occur after the technical
presentations.
