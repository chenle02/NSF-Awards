9909963&lt;br/&gt;Stemmer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Susanne
Stemmer from Rice University in a collaboration with Christian Ruessel of the
Department of Glass Chemistry at the University of Jena, Germany. The
collaboration studies the titanate family of molecules, such as barium titanate,
which have attracted attention recently for many important applications such as
information storage devices or tunable microwave devices. Techniques that
provide information about the distribution of defects within these
microstructures are currently lacking. The cooperative work funded here will
develop a method to quantify the point defect chemistry and dielectric
properties of titanates almost down to the atomic level by means of electron
energy-loss spectroscopy. The project benefits from synergy of expertise in
defect-property relationships of multicomponent oxides and expertise in the
synthesis of oxides from highly reduced melts. The research will also benefit
from sharing characterization facilities and materials-synthesis
facilities.&lt;br/&gt;
