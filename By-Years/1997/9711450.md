EEC-9711450 Huband American Society for Engineering Education Abstract This
award provides funding for a 1997 FutureCar Challenge Faculty Advisor Award to
develop and disseminate undergraduate engineering curriculum materials based on
the design and construction of this team-based, student vehicle competition. The
FutureCar Challenge is a competition for undergraduate students teams to design
and build a mid-size, production-ready vehicle which can get up to 80 miles per
gallon while still maintaining the performance, safety, and affordability of
existing cars. This competition is sponsored by the Department of Energy and
USCAR, a research venture between Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. Curriculum
will be developed to incorporate this vehicle competition into undergraduate
engineering curriculum that combines advanced automotive technology, business
skills, problem-solving, marketing, management, teaming, and leadership.
