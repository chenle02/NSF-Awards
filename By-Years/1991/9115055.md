This project addresses the design and testing of a system for improving time
dissemination on computer networks. The system consists of two parts: 1) servers
whose clocks are calibrated using dial-up telephone links to the NIST primary
time scale, and 2) clients who request calibration data from the servers via
either a local- or wide-area network. The servers and clients construct models
of the performance of the local clock and the calibration channel, and use these
models to adjust the local time and the interval between calibrations to
maintain a specified accuracy. The Internet is being used to compare the
performance of the method with other systems. The method is simpler and
potentially more accurate than the existing Network TIme Protocol because: 1)
there can be many more primary servers since they require no special hardware.
The network distance between any client and a primary server therefore can be
quite short. 2) The channel between NIST and each primary server is easier to
characterize because it is stable and reciprocal to a high degree. The result is
either less frequent calibrations for the same level of accuracy or improved
performance at the same calibration interval.
