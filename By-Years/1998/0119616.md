This project is investigating the thermodynamic properties associated with the
growth of small aerosols (approximately 3-50 nm) in the laboratory as a function
of composition, temperature and size. At present, very little is known about
very small particles that serve as the critical nuclei for nucleation and input
for models of aerosol formation and growth in the atmosphere and large
discrepancies exist between model predictions and field observations. This work
is expected to lead to a greater understanding of the Kelvin effect (particle
surface-tension effect) on particle phase transitions and the new particle
formation of pure aerosols. During the final phase of the study, size-selected
field samples will be collected and analyzed for comparison with the laboratory
results.
