The goal of this project is to provide Nautical and Naval Science students with
a 30 student Multipurpose Microcomputer teaching laboratory. By utilizing new
technologies and software, several new courses are being developed. A unique
feature of this laboratory is the utilization of microcomputer based hardware
and software to teach principals of safety in marine navigation. The equipment
purchased for this project includes 80286 8MHZ machines with one 3.5 inch floppy
drive and one 20MB Hard Drive, 640K RAM/256 EMS. These machines permit the
utilization of software for Nautical and Naval Science. An RCS-100 authoring
system is an important component of this project and consists of a graphics
panel assembly, sonic digitizer, stylus, microphone assembly, and connecting
cable. The use of the sonic digitizer as the students interface with the
training media allows the instructor to present visual support of teaching
points as a panel of photos, drawings or forms, or as graphics on a video
monitor. This allows the instructor to direct the students attention to higher
fidelity graphics and objects within an are that is much larger and more
versatile than any video - only system. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
