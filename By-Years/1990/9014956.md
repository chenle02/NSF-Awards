The defoliation of montane cloud forest in Puerto Rico by a recent hurricane
offers an opportunity to investigate the influence of canopy structure on the
deposition of material from the atmosphere and the chemical processing of that
material before it reaches the forest floor. Drs. Lovett and Asbury hypothesize
that: 1. As the canopy recovers, cloud water deposition will first increase in
response to increasing surfaces for deposition, and then decrease as the canopy
becomes dense enough to limit penetration of wind and cloud droplets. 2. The
canopy will take up NO3-, NH4+, and H+ and release all other ions. The amount of
uptake or release will increase rapidly in the initial stages of recovery and
then level off at higher levels of canopy surface areas. 3. Because of the
abundance of chemically active epiphytes on boles and branches, stemflow
chemistry will change more than throughfall chemistry as the canopy recovers.
This innovative research takes advantage of a natural catastrophe to investigate
the properties of forest canopy- atmosphere interaction. This is an important
area of research for global change and atmospheric deposition. Drs. Lovett and
Asbury are highly qualified investigators who have experience with sampling and
modeling canopy-atmosphere interactions.
