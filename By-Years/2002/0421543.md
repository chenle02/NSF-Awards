0421543&lt;br/&gt;Scherer&lt;br/&gt;This proposed instrumentation acquisition is
that of a dual-beam focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM)
system, with which the involved research team intends to investigate
electromagnetic phenomena at the nanometer scale. The involved research 'team'
includes three collaborative elements. CalTech will take the lead, JPL will
provide supplemental input, and the FIB/SEM vendor (i.e., FEI Inc.) will not
only furnish the basic hardware but will interactively assist CalTech students
and faculty in their efforts with software optimization.
