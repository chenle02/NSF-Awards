*** 9709977 SAMULSKI This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities Program (CRIF) and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA)
will help the Department of Chemistry at University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill acquire a single crystal x-ray diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector.
The equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: (1) structures of catalytic intermediates in olefin polymerization
reactions, (2) control of stereochemistry in radical addition reactions, (3)
structural studies of cluster chains and mixed-valance cluster complexes, (4)
enantioselective reactions of coordinated ligands, (5) a fundamental study of
the interrelationships between alpha, beta, and gamma polarizabilities in metal
chromophores, and (6) structural studies of 13-15 (II-V) monomers, chains,
cycles and clusters. The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule. The
information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and bond
angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the spatial
arrangement of the molecule relative to neighboring molecules. ***
