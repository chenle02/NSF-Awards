This project will investigate the physical mechanisms for the observed behavior
of the planetary waves in the Southern Hemisphere. The work will focus on the
quasi-stationary and traveling components of zonal wave numbers 1 and 2. These
components, which are particularly important during the southern spring, differ
significantly from their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. Simple dynamical as
well as general circulation models (the UCLA-GCM) will be used in the
investigation. Sensitivity studies to understand the influence of different
forcing mechanisms on the generation of the planetary waves will be carried out.
This work will enhance our basic understanding of the general circulation of the
atmosphere.
