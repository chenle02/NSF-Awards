Abstract

Award: DMS-9876471 Principal Investigator: Frank Morgan

The principal investigator will study various isoperimetric problems in
Euclidean space and more general Riemannian manifolds. He will work on Aubin's
conjecture, that the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality continues to hold in a
simply connected space of nonpositive curvature, at least for small volumes.
More general isoperimetric problems in Euclidean space involve clusters of
several given volumes, crystalline energies dependent on direction, and
immiscible fluids, for which interface cost depends on the fluids separated. He
will work on the Double Bubble Conjecture for general volumes and in higher
dimensions. A distinguishing feature of many of these problems is the appearance
of singularities.

Isoperimetric problems consider the cost of enclosing volume: soap bubbles
enclosing volumes of air, crystalline arrangements of molecules in materials,
the interplay between area and volume in the curvature of the universe.
Singularities often play a critical role: soap films meeting in threes,
structural defects in materials, black holes in the universe. Fundamental
questions remain open. The Double Bubble Conjecture, for example, says that the
familiar double soap bubble is the least-area way to enclose and separate two
given volumes of air. The recent computer proof for the case of equal volumes by
Hass and Schlafly can be traced back to work by Morgan's NSF undergraduate
research Geometry Group, which will continue to work on the general problem.
Morgan gives some forty talks a year. To popular audiences he likes to explain
that the way to understand the geometry of the universe is first to understand
the geometry of soap bubbles. He has a Math Chat TV show and column, both
available at the Mathematical Association of America website at
http://www.maa.org, and is currently making final preparations for the
publication of a popular Math Chat Book.
