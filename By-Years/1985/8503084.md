The immediate goal of this project is to work toward a detailed understanding of
one aspect of a heterogeneous chemical reaction, namely, the mechanisms of
absorption and dissociation of small molecules on clean and modified surfaces.
The long-range goal is to permit the design of a catalytic material that will
improve a given chemical reaction or process. The surfaces of present interest
include single crystal iron and the oxides, nitrides, and sulfides of certain
transition elements including titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), iron (Fe), and
platinum (Pt). As appropriate for these systems, the relevant techniques will be
used to determine structure, orientation, and electronic properties of adsorbed
reaction intermediates; reaction dynamics; and energy transfer processes.
Emphasis will be on examining the relationship between the detailed geometric
and electronic structures of the surfaces of these materials and their very
interesting surface chemistries.
