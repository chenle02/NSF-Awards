The goal of this research is to further our understanding of how covalent
histone modifications facilitate the process of DNA repair. One of the early
signals of certain types of DNA damage is phosphorylation of histone H2A at the
site of the lesion, testifying to an important role of chromatin structure in
the detection of damage and/or its repair. Histone acetylation has been shown to
facilitate transcription and recombination in many different species, presumably
via chromatin decondensation as well as targeting of factors that recognize
acetylated nucleosomes. It is hypothesized that histone acetylation will have an
analogous role(s) in facilitating DNA repair. This project will use a
combination of genetics and in vivo chromatin analysis in the yeast S.
cerevisiae to directly test the roles of combinatorial histone H2A modifications
in the process of double strand break (DSB) repair. The project has two specific
aims: 1. To determine the roles of specific C-terminal and N-terminal residues
of histone H2A in DSB repair in vivo. 2. To identify and characterize other
modifications of histone H2A required for DSB repair.

In addition to increasing our knowledge of the relationships between different
histone modifications and DNA repair, a critical aspect of this project is to
provide educational research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate
students at the University of Alaska-Anchorage. The experiments described in
this proposal represent research projects for Ph.D., M.S., and B.S. students,
and the budget includes direct support for a graduate student. Also, this
laboratory has a unique opportunity to draw Alaska Natives into the fields of
basic cell and molecular biology.
