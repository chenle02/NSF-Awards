The Organelle Molecular Biology Group at the University of Southern Mississippi
is composed of seven energetic young investigators with common research
interests and goals. The Group's ultimate research goal is to understand
communication between subcellular compartments at the molecular level. This goal
encompasses three essential biochemical processes in organelles-- DNA
replication, transcription, and translation. We are particularly interested in
the regulatory controls exerted by the nucleus on the organelle and vice versa.
The two best studied organelles, chloroplasts and mitochondria, are the chosen
subjects in a variety of eukaryotes. Funds are solicited for (1) expansion of
the present capabilities for centrifugation, radioisotope counting, autoclaving,
and dishwashing, and (2) the acquisition of research instrumentation that is not
currently available (French pressure cell and fluorescence spectrophotometer).
