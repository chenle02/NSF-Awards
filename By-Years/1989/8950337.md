"3-2-1 Contact," the nationally broadcast award winning children's public
television science series, has been reaching children aged 8-12 with daily half
hour science programming since 1980 with support from both the National Science
Foundation and the U. S. Department of Education. In seven seasons of
production, CTW has produced 225 regular and two special shows, generating an
estimated 633 million viewings by the target audience and more than 1.66 billion
viewings by viewers of all ages. With completion of primary show production, the
series will begin repeat broadcasts in the fall of 1989 drawn from the library
of existing programs. This final award will support continued broadcast of the
series and insure the widest possible distribution and utilization of "3-2-1
Contact." CTW will implement a Transition Plan to sustain series broadcast,
establish series access as a VCR based science resource, and insure permanent
access for teachers, schools, and out of school resources to the "3-2-1 Contact"
program library. Broadcast activities will include supporting a portion of the
costs of residuals for rebroadcast for a five year period, production of five
"3-2-1 Contact EXTRAS" -- single topic half hour specials with high visibility
-- and encouraging increased off air taping of the series by teachers. Support
for school use of the series will be strengthened with the development and
distribution of topic indexing software and teacher guides, the creation of
short "3-2-1 Contact" segments specifically tailored to the classroom needs of
teachers and a series blockfeed to schools to create a permanent archive of
shows. Community outreach partnerships will be strengthened and home video
opportunities explored as well. This five year award will allow millions of
American children the continued opportunity to view science programming after
school on a regular basis, and will assist their teachers in making effective
use of "3-2-1 Contact" program materials in classroom settings.
