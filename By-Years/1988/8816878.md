This is a project to determine the sulfide petrology, sulfur contents, and
sulfur isotopic compositions of well documented fresh submarine glasses and
rocks form the Mariana Arc and back arc trough. The goal is to evaluate the
sources and sinks of sulfur in these rocks in order to investigate role of
subducted oceanic lithosphere and hydrothermally altered fore arc rocks in the
generation of back arc basin magmas. These data will also be useful for
understanding the sources of sulfur in massive sulfide ore deposits formed in
back arc settings. %%% A primary goal in petrogenesis is to understand the
source materials of magmas that are produced in various settings. One important
setting in the ocean crust is the back arc basin. Back arc basin magmas are
thought to be derived from mixing of two different mantle sources. Because the
suggested sources have different sulfur isotopic compositions, their analysis in
the rocks from the Mariana Arc and back arc trough will provide fundamental new
data to help sort out the sources of back arc basin magmas. A study of the
sulfide petrology will help to determine the fate of sulfur in back arc basin
magmas.
