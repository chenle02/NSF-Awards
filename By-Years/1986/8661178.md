Vortex chambers can be used to control flow resistance through a device. Such
"vortex amplifier" devices can be used to control the pressure of isolated
enclosures, such as clean rooms, and glove boxes. This research proposes to
obtain the necessary data based on vortex-amplifier dynamic response and design
technology for ventilation control by fluidic vortex amplifier control. The
development of such a device will be of importance to chemical, biotechnology,
nuclear research, and manufacturing activities which deal with substances which
must be strictly isolated from the environment in order to protect plant and
public safety.
