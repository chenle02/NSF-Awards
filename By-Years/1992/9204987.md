The long-term objective of our research is the elucidation of the molecular
pathways which function in thyroid hormone (T3) regulation of Na, K-ATPase
subunit genes. In our research to-date, chimeric genes consisting of a portion
of the 5'-flanking region of alpha2 and alpha3 subunit genes ligated to the
coding region of the firefly luciferase gene have been utilized to transiently
transfect neonatal cardiac myocytes. Surprisingly, we find that the expression
of both alpha2 and alpha3 chimeric genes is significantly repressed by T3 in the
presence of co-transfected T3 receptor. These observations are consistent with a
preliminary finding of T3-mediated repression of endogenous alpha2 and alpha3
subunit gene transcription. In the proposed studies we intend to examine the
underlying molecular mechanism of T3 repression of Na, K-ATPase alpha2 and
alpha3 chimeric genes in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes to test the hypothesis
that subunit gene transcription rates are inhibited following an interaction of
the T3-receptor complex with subunit DNA sequence motifs. Accordingly,the
specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To determine the effect of T3 on
the rate of alpha2 and alpha 3 subunit gene transcription by the run-on
transcription assay. (2) To ascertain the location and sequence of the element
responsible for T3-mediated repression of chimeric gene expression (nTRE)
through an analysis of T3- responsiveness of various truncated
subunit/luciferase chimeric genes. (3) To characterize the transacting factor
which mediates T3 inhibition of alpha2 and alpha3 subunit chimeric gene activity
by an assessment of binding of both unfractionated nuclear extracts and purified
T3-receptor to subunit gene fragments containing negative TREs. We expect that
the accomplishment of these research objectives will provide new and significant
information concerning fundamental features of T3 action at a molecular level.
