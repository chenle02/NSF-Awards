This research project will examine the possibility that a non- Newtonian
(viscoelastic) fluid may enhance heat transfer while reducing drag and pressure
drop. This thesis will be explored in experiments on a complex pipe flow--the
flow downstream of a sudden enlargement in a circular pipe. The experiments will
encompass both laminar and turbulent flow and will include both fluid flow and
heat transfer measurements. A second objective of the project is to develop an
advanced, degradation-free non- Newtonian fluid based on a surfactant additive.
