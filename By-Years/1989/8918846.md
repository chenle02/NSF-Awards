Recent advances in molecular biology have led to the generation of new and novel
techniques for producing biomedical and pharmaceutical proteins. Often, however,
the requisite purity of such new materials dictates the need for a downstream
separation technology well beyond the use of conventional or classical
physicochemical recovery methods. In this work the focus is upon the effect of
thermodynamic parameters such as pressure on the separation efficiency of these
new biotechnology methods. The primary objective of this work is to investigate
the effect of elevated pressures on the binding of protein agents (antigens,
haptens, etc.) to biospecific receptors (monoclonal antibodies). Such studies
will lead to the development of gentle methods of elution and recovery of these
target biologicals.
