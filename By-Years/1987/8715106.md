This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Herbert Blough of
the University of Pennsylvania, and Prof. Luc Montagnier of the Institut
Pasteur, Paris, in a study of the HIV virus. The objective of this work is to
characterize the oligosaccharides of the major glycoproteins of this virus, and
to see what differences exist in these molecules among the various HIV virus
strains. The oligosaccharides will be isolated, purified and analyzed, using
specific enzymes to hydrolyze the sugar moieties, as well as chromatography and
nuclear magnetic resonances. The French collaborators have unique skills in the
biology, genetics, and clinical trials for HIV, and the U.S. investigator is an
expert in membrane biochemistry and antivirals. In this collaboration, the
Institut Pasteur will provide large amounts of purified HIV glycoproteins for
analysis. The characterization of molecular weight and composition will be done
in France; biological sequencing will be done in the U.S. This research could
lead to an increased understanding of phenomena that occur at the surface of HIV
cells, and therefore of the virus-host interaction. Results could have a
significant impact on limiting the spread of AIDS.
