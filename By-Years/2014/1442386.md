Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1442386, Principal Investigator: Nassif
Ghoussoub &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Established in 2003, the Banff International
Research Station (BIRS) is a North American research institute that addresses
the imperatives of collaborative research and cross-disciplinary synergy, by
facilitating intense and prolonged interactions among mathematical scientists
from around the world. BIRS unique infrastructure ensures a creative environment
for the exchange of ideas, knowledge, and methods within the mathematical
sciences and their vast array of applications in science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BIRS embraces all aspects of quantitative and
analytic research. Its programs span almost every aspect of pure, applied,
computational, and industrial mathematics, as well as statistics and computer
science. Its workshops involve physicists, biologists, engineers, economists,
and financial analysts. BIRS main mode of operation is to annually competitively
select and run 48 weekly workshops, each hosting 42 researchers. The
extraordinary response to the opportunities at BIRS leads to extremely high
quality workshops. This award supports the participation of more than 4,200 US-
based mathematical scientists in the stations activities for the period 2016-20.
