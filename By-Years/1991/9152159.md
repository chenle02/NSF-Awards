The Department of Chemistry and Physics is purchasing a 60 MHz rapid scan NMR
for use in sophomore and higher level chemistry courses. Hands-on student use of
the NMR during the third week beginning organic chemistry course. The instrument
is being used in the study of reaction stereochemistry, kinetics, determination
of equilibrium constants, as well as the characterization of reaction products.
