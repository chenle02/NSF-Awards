Determination of the sequence of amino acids is the first step toward the study
of cloning and structure-function relationships of proteins. DNA of known base
sequence can be synthesized if the amino acid sequence of a protein is known.
Genes for several proteins are proposed to be cloned in the Biochemistry
Department; these include actin depolymerization factor and an rRNA
transcription initiation factor. Amino acid sequence is also essential to find
the site of proteins damaged by oxyradicals and hydrogen peroxide; for the
region of neurotoxin-acetylcholine receptor binding; to elucidate the active
center of snake hemorrhagic toxins; and to determine the regulatory site of
phosphorylation in actin depolymerizing factor. The active sites of the RNA
polymerases from E. coli and bacteriophage T7 are also proposed to be studied.
Unfortunately, there is no protein sequencer at Colorado State University. At
the moment we are relying on a facility at a neighboring state university. Our
ability to do protein research is impaired by the lack of more direct and timely
access to this instrumentation. Acquisition of a sequenator will enhance the
efficiency and quality of protein research at Colorado State University.
