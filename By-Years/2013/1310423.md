With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry
Division is funding Dr. Christopher Switzer at the University of California-
Riverside, to develop metal mediated base pairs that are capable of
participating in information transfer reactions alongside their natural
counterparts. To accomplish this objective, metal mediated base pair motifs will
be developed with optimal shape and size for acceptance by natural enzymes. The
work under the award will build on preliminary studies by the PI's laboratory to
create a next generation metal mediated base pair capable of such function. This
next generation base pair uses a tridentate purine-like component and a
monodentate pyrimidine-like component to coordinate a divalent metal ion, such
as Cu2+. The function of metal mediated base pairs with natural polymerase
enzymes will be explored and optimized by employing a range of different
monodentate nucleotides chosen on the basis of synthetic expediency and known
optimal design features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watson-Crick base pairs encode
genetic information in all organisms. While natural base pairs rely on hydrogen
bonds for recognition, other weak or reversible interactions hold promise for
the creation of non-standard base pairs. Metal-mediated bonds have been shown
recently to replace hydrogen bonds between non-standard bases in the DNA helix.
The next steps in the progression to achieve functional metal-mediated base
pairs are therefore now within reach. The program of study will provide a solid
training ground for graduate students in chemical biology. Additionally,
research opportunities for undergraduate students will be offered during the
proposal period, including a summer undergraduate research position for
underrepresented minorities or women.
