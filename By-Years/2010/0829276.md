Biological interaction networks are graphs in which nodes represent molecules,
such as genes or proteins, and edges represent interactions among the molecules.
These networks underly and govern the mechanisms of cellular decision-making,
and play major roles in understanding causes of different diseases, as well as
designing effective, targeted therapeutics. Advances in biotechnologies are
amassing large amounts of these types of data from multiple organisms. One
powerful tool for analyzing such data and elucidating functional components in
them is through comparative analysis by means of network alignment. Roughly
speaking, aligning a pair of networks, typically from two different organisms,
entail finding the ?evolutionary correspondence? between the nodes of the
networks. This pairwise alignment is also generalizable to multiple networks.
The rationale behind aligning a set of networks is identifying subsets of these
networks that are conserved across organisms, which are natural candidates for
functional molecular components.

This research will develop models and algorithms for aligning interaction
networks and identifying conserved elements via a probabilistic framework that
uses hidden Markov models (HMMs). Despite the success of HMMs in a variety of
biological applications, mainly in the sequence analysis area, they have not
been considered in the realm of network alignment. The reason for this has been
that while HMMs naturally apply to one-dimensional data, such as sequences or
columns of a matrix, they do not apply to multidimensional data, such as graphs.
To achieve this goal, the investigator will conduct research in two areas.
First, the investigator will formulate an HMM-based framework for alignment
multiple biological interaction networks. This part entails devising strategies
for identifying a mapping among nodes of the networks and devising schemes for
handling matches, mismatches, insertions, and deletions in these networks.
Second, the investigator will design novel algorithms that enable the HMM to
?operate? in a multi-dimensional space.
