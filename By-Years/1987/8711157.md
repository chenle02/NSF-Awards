As we learn more about stress and the social psychological factors that affect
it, it becomes increasingly clear that these factors are complex and that
duration of exposure to stress is also important in determining outcomes. We
know a great deal about acute laboratory stress but relatively little about
longer lasting stress occurring in the real world. Most people experience
repeated episodes of stress during the course of everyday life, and the effects
of these experiences may be important. Some people experience more constant
long-term, stress as a result of a particular condition such as the illness of a
child. This research will explore the latter case, where substantial stress is
experienced more or less continuously. The ways in which social support and
changes in the perceived social support affect the experience of stress due to
one's child's life-threatening illness will also be studied, as will the role of
uncertainty. In order to do this, a sample of parents of children who are
seriously ill (neoplastic disease) will be compared with a sample of parents
whose children are healthy. Over the next year-and-a- half, each parent will be
studied nine times at two month intervals. During each session, several
psychological and physiological measures will be collected including information
about the child's health, symptom reporting, perceived stress, social support,
uncertainty, blood pressure, immune status, and hormonal activity. Changes in
each child's condition will be noted and used to help track changes in parents'
response. Completion of this research should provide a more complete picture of
how people respond to chronic stress and how social support affects this
response. In addition, the possibility of psychophysiological correlates of
uncertainty will be evaluated and the role of uncertainty in stress and social
support effects will be clarified.
