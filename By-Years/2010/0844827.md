This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to obtain new examples of
gauge/gravity dualities and apply them to address open problems in standard
model, nuclear, and condensed matter physics.The PI's research focuses on the
AdS/CFT correspondence and more generally on gauge/gravity dualities in string
theory, a framework that provides tools to understand both quantum gravity and
strongly interacting field theories. His research is in three areas a) building
new gauge/gravity dualities that will deepen our fundamental understanding of
string theory; b) using gauge/gravity dualities to better understand QCD by
studying related theories with gravity duals; c) applying gauge/gravity
dualities to better understand the transport properties of strongly interacting
condensed matter systems including superconductors and superfluids. This work is
important because of its potential to develop fundamental aspects of string
theory in addition to helping to answer experimental questions posed by LHC,
RHIC, and certain condensed matter experiments, questions for which we otherwise
have few theoretical tools.&lt;br/&gt;The educational outreach goal of this
proposal will be to hold a number of staged readings of physics plays followed
by talkbacks with scientists on the Princeton campus. While some of the plays
will be published work, others will be generated by a playwriting competition
open to college students. Through advertising these events in the Princeton
community and at local high schools, these readings are intended to generate
greater awareness of and good will toward physics among the general public.
