Dr. Rita Colwell at the University of Maryland will continue her pioneering
investigations into the biology, ecology, and evolution of marine bacteria
placed in or near the genus Vibrio. Current work in her laboratory encompasses
both classical approaches in bacteriology as well as application of new
molecular methods of ribosomal RNA sequence analysis, to generate data useful in
identification of new strains, often from novel environments, and classification
of these and better known taxa into groups reflective of phylogenetic affinity.
Vibrios and related bacteria constitute a significant portion of the
heterotrophic bacteria of the world's oceans, coastal waters, and estuaries.
Some of the taxa are commensals of near-shore shellfish or of marine animals
(including sharks), and others cause human diseases. Hence, the systematics and
ecology of the genus and its close relatives are of major importance for both
scientific and economic reasons.
