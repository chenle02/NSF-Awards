In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division of the National Science Foundation, Professor Valery V. Fokin of the
Department of Chemistry at The Scripps Research Institute will develop a
mechanistically driven approach to catalytic reaction optimization that takes
advantage of real-time monitoring of reactions without putting them into
constraints of model systems. Reactions to be probed involve 2+3 cycloadditions
to alkynes to form a variety of five-membered heterocycles which undergo further
reactions to form a number of reactive intermediates, including metal carbene
complexes. This research focuses on the critical role of transient catalyst
behaviors and, in the context of the proposed work, on the defining role of
weak, rapid, and reversible interactions of alkynes with transition metal
catalysts.

A successful outcome to this research will result in practical synthetic methods
that will allow chemists, biologists, and materials scientists to reliably
assemble a variety of complex molecules with defined geometry from readily
available starting materials under experimentally simple conditions. Practical
synthesis of such molecules will have an impact on new and inexpensive
pharmaceuticals, new materials, and advanced agrochemicals. Additionally, the
next generation of scientists in catalytic synthetic chemistry will be trained
in state-of-the-art techniques.
