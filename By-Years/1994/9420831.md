9420831 Curtin This project will develop the general concepts needed to predict
the damage accumulation and ultimate failure of materials subject to slow damage
formation. This work will develop models to describe the scaling of failure
times and distribution on system size and on the underlying damage formation
rate by using stochastic methods to calculate the time evolution of the damage
distribution. Numerical simulations of the damage evolution using newly-
developed efficient algorithms based on lattice Green functions will be utilized
to verify and guide the analytic model development. An important goal will be to
identify well- defined precursors to the failure, such that failure can be
anticipated. The models developed here will also provide a broad framework for
interpreting experiments. Relationships between the spectrum of experimental
data will be elucidated. %%% This theoretical project involves investigating the
accumulation of damage in a variety of materials. Both modeling using equations
and also computer simulations using newly-developed algorithms help to
understand damage. How damage accumulates is directly related to failure, i.e.,
when the material breaks. The work involves applying models for specific systems
in materials such as ceramics, polymers, composites, metals, bones, and
earthquake faults. This research area, spanning physics and materials, is
underrepresented in the Materials Theory Program, so it is one of high priority.
