The annual ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS) is a
leading international forum for the timely dissemination of cutting-edge
research results in computer and communications security. The conference
achieves that by bringing together researchers, practitioners, developers, and
users to participate in several technical sessions, tutorials, poster sessions,
panels, and workshops. The program of the main conference consists of
approximately 140 technical research papers across a wide range of topics in the
domain of computer networks security and online privacy. Participation in the
conference is a valuable opportunity for students and is an important and
integral part in their cybersecurity graduate education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides travel support to encourage
participation in the 2021 ACM CCS by students who would normally find it
difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious
interest in the field as demonstrated by statement of research, curriculum vitae
showing research output, coursework and/or project experience. Organizers
encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented
groups in computing. Preference is given to undergraduate students participating
in the poster session, and students with papers in the conference or one of the
conferenceâ€™s co-located workshops who do not have other financial support to
attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
