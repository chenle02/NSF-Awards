In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supported by the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Gary A. Strobel of the Department of
Plant Sciences at Montana State University, will trap, isolate and characterize
the volatile substances produced by Muscodor alba, a new fungal genus and
species isolated from the Honoduran rainforest. It has been demonstrated that at
least one of the gaseous compounds produced by M. alba is lethal to virtually
all other endophytic fungi and bacteria that are present in the stem tissues of
its plant host. The separation and identification of the volatile components
possessing antimicrobial activity will be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the
support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Gary A.
Strobel, of the Department of Plant Sciencs at Montana State University, will
isolate and identify volatile organic compounds produced by a new fungal
species, M. alba. This mixture of gaseous substances has been shown to be lethal
to a range of other fungi and bacteria. Isolation of the bioactive product(s)
may result in the identification of compounds with potential pharmaceutical
applications, including antimicrobial agents.
