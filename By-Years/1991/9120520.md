In the last several years the level of research activityof the Miami
Biochemistry division has increased dramatically. The division has added a new
faculty member (a new position) and obtained $975,000 in research funding
including four grants from NSF. This increase in research activity has
identified several inadequacies in the divisions' instrumentation. Several o
fthe funded research projects require capabilities not currently available in
the division. The required instrumentation are: a supraspeed centrifuge and
rotors, a gradient HPLC system with microbore capabilities to isolate ug
quantitites of protein, and a scanning UV/visibile spectrophotometer with high
sensitivity. All three pieces of equipment, commonly found in biochemistry
laboratories, are essential to at least two of the PIs and will be used
occasionally by the other three groups in the division. The requested
instruments will be used to support and enhance the following research projects:
1) development regulation of plant mitochondrial biogenesis and pollen
development, 2) metabolic regulation and biosynthesis of fatty acids in plant,
and 3) the role of tannins in plant-herbivore interactions.
