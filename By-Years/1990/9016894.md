. J H.Laboratory experiments will be performed to determine if and how
trivalent REE are fractionated during their geochemical interactions in waters
and sediments. Field data have shown that fractionation occurs during weathering
and soil development, during early diagenesis of redox.reactive marine sediments
and in the water column of marine and estuarine basins with oxic/anoxic
boundaries. Little is known about the reactions and chemical factors which
govern fractionation of trivalent REE. Fractionation, in turn, is a unique
characteristic of REE series and forms the basis for understanding geochemical
cycling of these important elements. Emphasis will be placed on developing
laboratory simulation of natural processes at natural concentrations of solution
and solid phases. Radioactive isotopes of REE will be used as tracers for the
different reactions.
