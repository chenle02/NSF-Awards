Experimental program on electromagnetic propagation in random structures.
Observation of photon localization in the near future is a specific goal.
Approaches include the use of both light and microwave radiation. The cross-
correlation of fluctuations in intensity will be measured as a function of
separation between two points. The physical systems which are employed in the
experiments consist of metallic or high-index dielectric spheres imbedded in a
transparant medium. Measurements will be made in the diffusive, critical, and
localized regimes.
