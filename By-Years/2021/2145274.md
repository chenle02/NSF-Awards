This NSF CAREER project aims to improve the size and efficiency of electric
energy conversion systems which are critical in many applications which progress
science, advance national prosperity, and secure national defense. The project
will bring transformative change by allowing power converters to operate ten
times faster and therefore store ten times less energy, reducing size and
improving efficiency. This will be achieved by advancing the science of magnetic
components (inductors and transformers) which are the most significant
bottleneck to this improved speed and size. The intellectual merits of the
project include new rapid models for optimization, new component structures and
designs, new applications for materials, and enabling further advancement
through engineered platforms capable of studying high-power components at high
speed. The broader impacts of the project include both scientific and
educational components. Improved size and efficiency of power converters will
enable greater proliferation of renewable energy, lighter and more affordable
electric vehicles, the electrification of naval and air travel, and more
affordable semiconductors. This project will also bring these scientific
advances into the classroom through authentic, project-oriented courses and
extracurricular activities which benefit all students and especially first-
generation college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As power converters increase
in switching frequency to decrease energy storage and size, the most significant
barrier encountered is the energy loss in magnetic components. This barrier
becomes even more significant in the megahertz (MHz) regime where the only
accurate modeling methods are prohibitively slow, the few available techniques
to suppress high-frequency eddy currents become unfeasible to manufacture,
typical core materials become very lossy, and available characterization
approaches cannot achieve good accuracy. All of these barriers stand to inhibit
the design, optimization, manufacturing, and characterization of magnetic
components which are required to unlock the next order-of-magnitude improvement
in power conversion. This project will enable MHz operation with new accurate
and rapid modeling, eddy-current suppressing designs, investigation of new
materials and existing materials repurposed for power conversion, and platforms
to characterize both cores and components accurately at MHz or tens of
MHz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
