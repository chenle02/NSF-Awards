Program Summary: The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to
acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of
oceanographic data. This proposal from NCSU requests funding for equipment to
upgrade a mass spectrometer facility. The mass spectrometer was originally
purchased in 1984 withfunding from the oceanographic instrumentation program
(OCE83-10579) and ONR. THe upgrades requested include a Kiel single acid bath
auto-carbonated reaction system and fully automated multiport system. The Kiel
system is necessary to analyze small carbonate samples, and the automated
multiport will allow unattended, automatic operation, increasing the efficiency
of the facility. NCSU will provide 50% cost-sharing this purchase. The
instrument will improve the analysis of small sample-size carbonates which are
increasingly important for oceanographic studies. It will be maintained and
operated as a shared-use facility. The PI is well qualified to acquire,
maintain, operate and manage the instrument. Cost sharing by the University is
appropriate.
