This project supports the creation of a Solid State Device Animation laboratory
(SSDAL) that will make it possible to accomplish a number of pedagogical goals
by improving instruction and providing a rich context for student learning and
practice. With simulations tools available, the facility is able to accommodate
a large number of students in concrete and relevant activities. Students are
then better able to visualize abstract concepts and engage in more productive
collaborative learning. Additionally, students are exposed to a variety of
hands-on learning opportunities through multiple educational media, which
enables students of varying learning styles or with special needs to take better
advantage of the programs. Also, the facility allows students to record and
disseminate their projects, which in turn helps the faculty develop and improve
the overall curriculum. Dissemination of projects also gives students practical
experience presenting findings in classrooms, at conferences, and over the World
Wide Web (WWW), all of which increase a sense of professional self-efficacy
among prospective graduates. The SSDAL is based on Hewlett-Packard workstations,
Macintosh-based animation and video capture, and device and process simulation
software to augment required junior- and senior-level courses in the form of
interactive animated tutorials that can be accessed at SSDAL or on the WWW.
SSDAL also supports senior projects and classes, allowing combining simulations
and animations as investigative tools and where computer science and electrical
engineering students can work in team projects. To accomplish this objective,
the laboratory uses device and process simulation software developed by Silvaco,
along with two- and three-dimensional graphics interface, and Macintosh-based
animation and visualization tools for generating animated tutorials and
projects. The software includes Atlas II, which is a framework for device
simulation that includes PISCES, BLAZE, TFT, LUMINOS, and GIGA, and the Athena
framework, with one- and two-dimensional process simulation capability.
