This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Portland State University (PSU)
Robert Noyce Teacher Scholars Program, Phase II addresses the critical local and
national need to expand the talent pool of teachers with science content
knowledge, pedagogical skills and leadership capacity to improve K-12 science
education. Specifically this program focuses on achievement disparities
associated with socioeconomic status, ethnic/cultural background, disability and
English language proficiency. It provides 24 scholarships to the students in the
PSU Graduate Teachers Education Program during the project
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in the Phase II Noyce Scholars Program
is a two-year commitment that culminates in the awarding of a Masters of Science
in Teaching degree and an Oregon Initial Teaching License. The program
emphasizes the use of student-centered and project-based learning practices,
current educational technology, inquiry-learning curricula, the development and
use of on-going assessment and the integration of literacy strategies for
English Limited Language (ELL) students. The summary evaluation of this program
yields valuable data on the merits of a research-based model for teacher
education that includes an extensive partnership relationship with an in-service
teacher mentor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PSU Noyce program targets both recent
STEM graduates and career changers who seek employment as highly qualified
science teachers in high-need K-12 schools. In Phase II, the University expands
the partnerships to include three of the largest districts in Oregon: Beaverton
School District (BSD), Hillsboro School District (HSD) and Portland Public
School District (PPS). These districts serve a combined total of 101,000
students in grades K-12 and are designated high-need school districts.
