This research is concerned with the theory of quantum groups. The theory of
quasitriangualar Hopf Algebras, particularly calculations of certain invariants
of 3- manifolds derived from finite dimensional Hopf algebras and conformal
field theory, provides the focus for the project. Quantum groups are a new area
of research for both mathematicians and physicists. On the mathematical side it
combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics, algebra, analysis and
geometry, yet it is of great interest to physicists working in conformal quantum
field theory.
