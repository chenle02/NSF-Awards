This award supports collaborative research between Dr. Peter Dorato, University
of New Mexico, and Profesor Chen Shunlin, Automatic Control Research Institute,
Nanjing Aeronautical Institute on development of design procedures for feedback
systems and their application to problems in aeronautics and astronautic
systems. The project will bring together expertise at the University of New
Mexico in robust control theory with expertise at the Najing Aeronautical
Institute in application of feedback theory to flight vehicles. This project is
jointly supported by NSF and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation.
