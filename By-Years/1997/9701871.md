This research is developing a new approach to testing of the next generation
Multichip Module (MCM) substrates. The next generation MCM substrates will
contain high density interconnects and integrated passives. There are numerous
techniques that are being pursued in the packaging industry for MCM interconnect
testing. These techniques are limited in the resolution of defect detection and
are expensive in terms of test equipment or cumbersome due to test methodology
to improve resolution of defect detection and to reduce the cost of testing
MCMs. A novel low-cost text technique has been discovered by this investigator
for interconnect testing. Based on this discovery, the objectives of this
research are: (1) development of electrical models of thin film interconnects
and integrated passives; (2) discovery and investigation of a low-cost test
technique for integrated passives; (3) develogpement of a parallel membrane
probe technique for testing high density interconnects; (4) development of test
software tools to locate process defects, and, (5) fabrication of a test vehicle
with a thin film MCM substrate to demonstrate and evaluate the success of the
research goals.
