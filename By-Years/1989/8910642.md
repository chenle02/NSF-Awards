This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Frank Joe, Jr. of
the Food and Drug Administration to conduct collaborative research for one year
with Dr. Kunitoshi Yoshihira in the Division of Food Additives at the National
Institute of Hygienic Sciences in Japan. They will study the nature of the
substances which arise from the decomposition of antioxidants in synthetic oils,
which are taken up by foods prepared in these oils. Relationships between the
structural features of these decomposition products and those found in real
(natural) fat systems will be investigated. Chromatographic separation
techniques will be developed and used to separate the major decomposition
products of both artificial and real fats subject to high-temperature treatment.
These compounds will then be subjected to spectroscopic studies to determine
their structural characteristics, and evaluated for whatever deoxidizing
properties that remain. The past experiences of the U.S. and Japanese
investigators in chromatographic techniques and food analysis complement each
other in this project.
