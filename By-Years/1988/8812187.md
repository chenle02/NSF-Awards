The research will deal with the kinematic properties of periodic breaking waves
and their interaction with the bottom. Wave period amplitude, and bottom slope
will be controlled in a series of experiments in a wave tank. A forward
scattering dual beam laser anemometer will be utilized to obtain velocity data.
The research results are relevant to evaluation of forces, erosion, and damage
due to breaking waves along the shore line.
