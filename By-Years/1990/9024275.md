Dr. David R. McMillin of the Chemistry Department, Purdue University, is being
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program to
investigate coordinately unsaturated excited states associated with metal
complexes containing 8, 9, or 10 'd' electrons. Specifically, the complexes are
copper phenanthrolines and porphyrins and platinum(II) terpyridines. McMillan
will identify the orbitals involved in the excited states and assess the role of
d-orbitals in reactivity. Absorption spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and
luminescence spectroscopy will be employed and emission lifetimes and
polarization effects will be measured as a function of temperature. Viscometry
will be used in the DNA-binding studies to help ascertain the binding modes of
the complex. %%% The objective of the work is to characterize the luminescence
properties of these complexes so that their interaction with a variety of
"hosts" can be assessed. The excited states of these complexes are sensitive to
their local environment, so they can be used as structural probes. McMillan will
investigate their interactions with macromolecules, including DNA and RNA, and
with layered lattices. The results could have application to catalyst design.
