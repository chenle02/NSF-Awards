Alperin 9619727 The principal investigator will continue to develop his approach
to the structure of endo-permuation modules, especially with a view to the
question of the rank of the Dade group and the question of lifting from
characteristic p. He, together with Linckelmann and Rouquier, will proceed with
their work on putting the whole approach of Puig on a module-theoretic basis.
Jointly with G. Mason, he will apply the complexity theory of modules to Lie
type groups. The idea of a clique, generalizing the concept of a block, will be
developed and some results from homotopy theory will be put in an algebraic
concept and generalized. The field of group theory is the mathematical theory of
symmetry and interacts with many other disciplines,for example physics and
chemistry outside of mathematics, coding theory, number theory and geometry
inside mathematics.The investigator?s particular area is finite groups and
representation theory which is the interface between group theory and linear
algebra. It is a hundred year old subject but still facing great unsolved
problems and with many opportunities for breakthroughs.
