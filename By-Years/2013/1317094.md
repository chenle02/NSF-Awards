This action funds Michelle Lee Galloway of University of California, Berkeley to
conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the
School of Engineering, University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan. The project title is
"Deployment of a Gamma-ray Imaging Instrument for Characterizing Radioactive
Land Contamination." The host scientist is Professor Hiroyuki Takahashi.

This research project investigates the use of a novel gamma-ray imaging
instrument for the purpose of informing the environmental remediation efforts
within the Fukushima prefecture. The instrument uses semiconductor detectors
(cadmium zinc telluride) that are configured to allow for Compton imaging of
radioactive sources. The instrument is being integrated into the existing
infrastructure of the Japanese aerial monitoring program. This project assesses
the capabilities of this technology for use in environmental monitoring
applications. Successful deployment of the instrument allows for isotopic
identification, localization and morphology of radioactive sources.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, this experience provides the Fellow with a
unique opportunity to learn first-hand about the impact upon and needs of the
local community as a result of radioactive contamination and also how the
existing scientific infrastructure, policies, and technologies are able to
address these issues. The project provides the opportunity for further
collaboration between the two institutions as well as facilitating technological
advancement within a field that is of local, national, and global interest.
