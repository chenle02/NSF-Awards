The Yukon-Tanana terrane, an extensive metamorphic-plutonic assemblage, is
exposed in east-central Alaska and southern Yukon, and forms the fundamental
boundary between antochthonous strata of North American and outboard accreted
terrane. This project will test a model of subduction-related strike-slip
translation developed within the Teslin suture zone, Yukon by complementary
kinematic, geothermobarometric, and isotopic and analyses of involved rocks.
Results should apply to deeper parts of those subduction systems having
significant strike-slip components.
