Although marine cores from the Norwegian Sea document a complex record of late
glacial climate variation, little is know about the influence of North Atlantic
circulation on the last deglaciation of western Spitsbergen. This project will
provide a late glacial paleo-climate record for the high Arctic limb of the
North Atlantic Current system through detailed stratigraphic study of raised
marine sediments from west Spitsbergin, and recently retrieved cores from the
adjacent shelf and slope. Biostratigraphy and stable isotope studies will be
used to determine paleoenvironmental variables in a transect from near- shore to
slope depths in Fram Strait. Accelerator radiocarbon dating of the cores and
raised marine sediments will allow correlation of the new paleoenvironmental
records to the well established emergence record which currently provides the
clearest signal on the extent and timing of regional deglaciation and the
possible influence of North Atlantic hydrography.
