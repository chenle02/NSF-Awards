9521628 Cutter The photolysis of dissolved organic sulfur (DOS) compounds in
seawater is a principle source of the radiatively important gas carbonyl sulfur
cycle and may be involved in trace metal complexation since many organic sulfur
compounds are strong ligands. However, no suitable means for the detection of
DOS in seawater exists. Therefore, the overall goal for this work is to adapt an
existing reductive pyrolysis method for the determination of DOS in seawater
(combustion in a hydrogen atmosphere to hydrogen sulfide and then gas
chromatography-flame photometric detection) and to apply it to an initial study
of DOS cycling. Specific objectives for this project are: (1) to evaluate the
accuracy, precision, detection limits, and linearity of the method; (2) to test
the method in the field and develop appropriate sample storage procedures; and
(3) to obtain DOS data for estuarine, coastal, and open ocean waters as an
initial survey of its biogeochemical behavior. Work on this last objective will
be in conjunction with other studies of carbonyl sulfide, DOC and DON, and trace
metal complexation in order to allow the formulation of specific hypotheses on
DOS biochemistry.
