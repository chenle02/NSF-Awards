9732953 Solgaard This proposal describes research on a new type of fiber-optic
switch for wavelength-division-multiplexed transparent-optical-networks. The
switch architecture is based on free-space separation of the wavelength channels
using bulk lenses and gratings and on spatial switching using silicon
micromachined mirror arrays. Optical modeling of the switch predicts low
insertion loss, low cross talk, flat pass band, and low polarization
sensitivity. Existing WDM crossbar switches are limited to two input and two
output ports, while the proposed switch is scaleable to large port numbers
providing dramatically enhanced flexibility in configuring complex network
topologies owing to numerous switched path options obtainable in a single
switching package. The proposed switch is fabricated using silicon integrated
circuit technology and it can be miniaturized for easy packaging. These traits
leads to potentially low-cost production and installation. The design space for
the proposed switch is investigated using Gaussian beam propagation. Based on
this investigation, a design of a 3x3 switch using standard optics and standard
micromachining technology is developed. This design will be built as a proof-of-
principle demonstration. The analysis of the diffractive characteristics of the
proposed switch shows that switches with larger number of ports require
micromirrors with large and continuously-controllable angular deflection.
Development of such mirrors using a combination of analytical, numerical and
experimental tools is proposed. Finally it is shown that the proposed switch can
be miniaturized and integrated on a silicon chip. The integration technology
will be developed and an integrated WDM crossbar switch will be created. The
educational aspects of this proposal are focused on course development and on
the establishment of an industrially sponsored undergraduate research program.
The first course that is under development is an undergraduate optoelectronics
laboratory course, and the second is a graduate course on MEMS device physics
and design. The objective of these courses is to build a foundation for an
experimentally oriented program in optoetectronic integration and fabrication.
To further integrate teaching and research in electrooptics, the establishment
of an undergraduate research program is proposed. The objectives and
requirements of the research projects will be defined by industrial sponsors.
The research will be carried out by a team of undergraduate researchers under
the guidance of a faculty member in close collaboration with industrial
partners. Funds for a start-up period for this program is requested. The program
will become selfsustaining by the end of the proposal period. ***
