This project will study the feasibility of fabricating microelectronic devices
from boron and boron carbide-based materials. The research is based on initial
success in the selective area deposition of boron and boron carbide by chemical
vapor deposition, using boranes. A number of electronic devices and electronic
grade protective coatings will be fabricated by using x-ray lithographic
techniques. Boron carbide-based semiconductor devices may be of considerable
interest, due to their potential high temperature and radiation-resistant
properties. As a result, such devices may work under extreme conditions.
