Overall, the PI will improve understanding of acoustic gravity waves in the
high-latitude thermosphere. Mainly, he will analyze data from the SuperDARN HF
radar network. Building upon previous work, he will use techniques developed
both for observation of gravity waves and observation of plasma flows and field-
aligned currents. Various aspects of the waves to be investigated include:
examining the connection between solar wind and IMF changes and generating
gravity waves, determining the amount of gravity wave energy in the high-
latitude thermosphere due to solar and magnetospheric energy sources, and
determining how much of the energy that is deposited in the upper mesosphere and
lower thermosphere as Joule heating is carried away to the upper thermosphere by
gravity waves. Finally, he will continue pursuing a theoretical understanding of
wave reflection from the mesopause.
