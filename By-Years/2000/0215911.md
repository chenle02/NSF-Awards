This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports acquisition of a powder
x-ray diffractometer (XRD). The XRD is an extremely useful tool in materials
characterization. The lattice plane distance measurements it yields make
possible the identification of unknown crystalline compounds. The XRD will
enhance a vigorous research program in novel materials by identifying compounds
grown in single crystal form by precipitation from solution, a technique known
as flux growth. Once identified, these single crystals will be characterized
using an existing instrument at Grinnell, which measures dc magnetization, ac
susceptibility, resistivity, magnetoresistivity, and heat capacity. This
research is pursued as a strongly collaborative effort between the principal
investigator, undergraduates at Grinnell, and colleagues at Ames Laboratory.
Examples of current research projects the XRD will support include studies of
magnetic anisotropy in rare earth intermetallic single crystals and the design
of a strongly anisotropic spin glass in single crystal form, to be used as a
model system for testing spin glass theories. The results of these projects will
be disseminated broadly through peer-reviewed journal publications with student
co-authors and through presentations at national conferences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because research is always blended with teaching at
Grinnell, the XRD will have impact beyond the research projects that it
supports. Students will use the XRD in collaborative research with the principal
investigator, faculty-mentored independent student projects, and experiments in
courses taken by physics majors. Grinnell College has attained national
recognition for its successful efforts to increase the retention of under-
represented groups in science through programs such as the New Science Project.
The XRD will help to broaden the exposure of under-represented groups to
research quality instrumentation in their education and research training.
