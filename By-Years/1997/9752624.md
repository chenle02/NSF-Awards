The overall goal of Project Inclusion is to provide appropriate materials and
strategies to deal with student diversity. The Project products will be a series
of resource materials and an implementation process that supports faculty in
focusing students' attention on the chemical contributions of women and
minorities. All Project materials are connected to the typical topics presented
in introductory/general chemistry. The resource materials are undergoing review
by a set of external faculty members and a group of faculty participants from a
summer workshop program, as well as through extensive field-testing by a number
of interested faculty. Summer workshops provide faculty with an opportunity to
learn how to prepare and integrate Project materials into their classes. Project
Inclusion is being publicized in presentations at chemistry conferences, by
announcements to a comprehensive mailing list and through journal articles.
Preliminary work in the Project supports the belief that use of Project
Inclusion materials and strategies results in greater student interest and
success in their chemistry classes. Evaluation is primarily focused on measuring
attitude changes in faculty and students through use of CBAM (Concerns Based
Adoption Model). The potential impact of the Project is tremendous as its
audience is every lower division college chemistry class in the nation.
