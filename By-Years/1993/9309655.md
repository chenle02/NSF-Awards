9309655 Fischer The recent years have seen the development of several
knowledge- based scheduling systems that facilitate the integration of design
information with the generation of construction schedules. This research
proposes to extend the idea behind these planners and schedulers by adding
detailed models of construction methods. Such knowledge is needed in model-based
form to enhance the practicality of the schedules that are generated, and to
overcome some of the limitations of heuristic systems. while the use of product
models to represent design information has been well documented over the last
few years, the formalization and implementation of detailed models of
construction methods still represents a major challenge and opportunity. When
interacting with a product model, such construction method models will be able
to generate construction schedules and cost estimates almost instantly. This
will enable project participants to explore more alternatives to a greater level
of detail in less time. This will lead to projects that are more constuctible
than some of today's projects which in turn will lead to a reduced total
delivery time and cost for constructed facilities.
