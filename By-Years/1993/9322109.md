9322109 Hogg Texas A &amp; M Dr. John L. Hogg and other members of the Chemistry
Department of Texas A &amp; M are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1994-6,
ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of
chemistry -analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. There will
be a strong focus on women, minorities and handicapped drawn nationally from
smaller schools that lack major research programs.
