This pilot project focuses on the development of computer modules that present
the fundamentals of archeology to undergraduate students in an interactive,
visually stimulating context. The software modules, involve: 1) stratigraphy and
relative dating, 2) artifact classification, and 3) analysis of animal bones
have a strong visual component, and employ current techniques of video image
analysis that allow students to participate in the process of science, not just
its results. It is hoped that by providing stimulating laboratory exercises with
a significant visual component, that the recruitment and retention of students
in the sciences will be enhanced, especially with respect to the significant
Native American population served by the institution.
