The high-pressure stability of majority garnet will be experimentally determined
at 165-230 kbar pressures, 1650and higher temperatures, with the split-sphere
anvil apparatus in Stony Brook (USSA-2000). The study would include: 1. The
determination of the equilibrium compositions of enstatite- jadeite garnet
coexisting with MgSiO3 ilmenite, and NaAlSiO4 (calcium ferrite structure) +
stishovite; 2. The determination of the compositions of diopside-jadeite garnet
coexisting with pyroxene, CaSiO3 perovskite, and NaAlSiO4 + stishovite. The
compositions of enstatite-pyrope garnet coexisting with MgSiO3- Al2O3 perovskite
would be determined at 220-280 kbar, 2000oC, If new developments are successful
in reaching those pressures. The results of the proposed experiments would place
new constraints on the nature of the 650 km discontinuity, and on the cause of
the high-velocity gradients in the vicinity of the 650 km discontinuity. The
results would also allow to evaluate the effect of sodium on the CMAS phase
relations, which would lead to a better understanding of the Earth Mantle
mineralogy. Supplementary projects could include: 1. The determination of the
melting curves of simple compounds at 165-230 kbar, e.g. Mg4Si4O12 garnet, beta
phase, diopside, CaSiO3 perovskite, grossular, jadeite; 2. The extension of the
CMAS melting relations to the superphase B - Mg10Si3O14 (OH,F,Cl).4
