Several concerns of national importance have surfaced in recent seismic code
decisions in the Wasatch Front. This study will use seismic risk analysis to
elaborate relevant features of these decisions. Particular attention will be
paid to: (1) systematic differences of opinions on geoscience and structural
engineering issues; (2) differences among different types of buildings in cost
upgrades for designing to higher seismic code levels; (3) potential implications
of high soft surfacial soil site dynamic amplification factors; and of (4)
strengths and weaknesses of diverse ways of structuring seismic risk statistics
in order to yield a decision. A model application to the Wasatch fault will
assist in developing these seismic risk methods. Risk statistics will also be
produced for the Los Angeles region to put Wasatch Front statistics into
perspective.
