This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will support the CSM group to work
on the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) Cosmic Ray experiment. The high-energy
cumulative exposure of the PAO has surpassed the summed exposures of all
previous cosmic ray experiments. First measurements of the energy spectra,
anisotropy and particle composition indicate that the observatory has an
unprecedented view of the high-energy universe and particle physics at energies
well beyond that of the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. The
observatory combines the collecting power of 1600 surface detectors (SD), the
calorimetric energy measurement of a four-eye atmospheric fluorescence detector
(FD), and the precision of two laser "test-beam" facilities near the array
center. With this baseline configuration completed in late 2008, the observatory
will collect data using its full complement of instrumentation. The CSM group
has the responsibility for generating the critical hourly data base of
atmospheric transmission constants, and overseeing the operation and data
processing of these laser facilities. The sensitivity and the observation of
anisotropy strongly motivate the need for a precise energy standard.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past few years, the CSM group has been engaged in
outreach activities in southeastern Colorado. Cosmic-ray educational experiments
built at CSM were made available for public events and use in classrooms.
Recently, two demonstration surface detectors, identical to the detectors at the
southern Auger Observatory, were installed in two towns in southeastern
Colorado. This installation was part of a continuing effort to enhance science
education in this area. CSM undergraduates are naturally involved in the
research, as they are required to complete a senior design project as part of
their curriculum.
