9509900 DEYOUNG The general thrust of this proposal will be to examine the
behavior of nuclear matter as one moves from normal cold conditions to highly
excited conditions using the tool of heavy- ion collisions. Specifically we
propose to measure: light charged particle coincidences with intermediate mass
fragments (IMFs) to determine timescales at higher energies, angular
distributions of IMFs in coincidence with a heavy residue over a range of
energies, neutron-neutron correlation measurements at lower energies, and
coincidences between pre-equilibrium light particles and heavy products at
intermediate energies. We also propose to continue a small effort directed
towards development of trigger algorithms and simulations for the STAR
collaboration at RHIC. In addition to our own ambitious experimental program, we
will also support collaborative effopts proposed by others, such as the
anticipated measurements of the spin dependence of particle emission from
compound systems, investigations of highly excited systems that do not fragment
and additional measurements of excited nuclei which do disintegrate.
Undergraduate students from Hope College will be involved in all aspects of
these proposed experiments, and included on the publications that will
result.***
