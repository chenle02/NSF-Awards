The Pathways to Earth Science Education (PESE) program is a partnership between
York College (part of the CUNY system) and the Bronx Community College that
seeks to enrich and support Earth and environmental science education and
provide college and high school students with educational pathways to STEM
degree programs. The main goals and objectives of this program are to: a)
increase the number of students - most of whom are underrepresented minorities -
studying Earth science at the high school and the college levels; b) create
educational pathways for high school and community college students to Earth and
environmental science baccalaureate programs; and c) support, improve and enrich
college and high school Earth science instruction in the partnering institutions
and the communities they serve. PESE program activities include: a) summer
institutes for college and high school faculty and students; b) Earth and
environmental science program articulation agreements between the Bronx
Community College and York College; c) design and development of two new courses
in geospatial methods and hydrology; c) review and identification of the
learning objectives for the first and second year Earth and environmental
science course; d) recruitment and mentoring of student research assistants; e)
student and faculty outreach; f) professional development activities for
existing and new faculty; and g) faculty and student enrichment workshops and
seminars. The PESE project is expected to lead to increased enrollment and
improved retention rates for minority students in Earth science and related
science courses and programs, as well as enhanced awareness of the important
contributions of this scientific field to society. The program also addresses
the growing need for well-prepared Earth science teachers in the New York
metropolitan area high schools, a need which is especially acute for inner city
high schools.
