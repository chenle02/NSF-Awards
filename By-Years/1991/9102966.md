9102966 Shiflet Pearlite growth is investigated with respect to the role of
crystallography in the context of kinetics and thermodynamics. The mathematics
for coupled pearlite colony growth are examined. Experimental data are coupled
to the thermodynamics and models of growth kinetics. With the use of a new Field
Emission Gun transmission electron microscope (FEG-TEM), composition gradients
in the developing colony are measured. This approach together with three
dimensional modeling should assist in understanding phenomena such as lamellar
versus degenerate growth, pearlite versus bainite phase selection, and
orientation relationships. %%% This research program examines the factors
affecting phase transformations in metal alloys. The understanding derived from
studies such as this one can be applied to a wide range of metal alloy systems,
such as steel alloys, to improve their properties. ***
