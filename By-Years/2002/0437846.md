0437846&lt;br/&gt;Schwartz, Daniel K. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Mexico
workshop, organized by Prof. Daniel Schwartz, of the University of Colorado at
Boulder, and Prof. Rolando Castillo of the Institute of Physics, Universidad
Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), and Prof. Jaime Ruiz-Garcia of the Universidad
Autonoma de San Luis Potosi, will address current problems in biomolecular and
biomimetic self-assembling systems. Self-assembling systems is a
multidisciplinary research field encompassing biology, chemistry, physics, and
material and chemical engineering. This workshop will bring together leading
researchers, as well as several junior researchers and graduate students, to
discuss current developments in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will include research presentations and discussion on fundamental topics related
to molecular self-organization as well as selected applications, including
nanomaterials, drug delivery, and biomaterials. The presentations will be
organized within three topical areas: 1. Self-Assembly of Peptides and
Polynucleotides 2. Lipid and Surfactant Self-Assembly 3. Biomimetic Polymer
Self-Assembly. Approximately 25 oral presentations will be divided among these
topics, and a general poster session will also be scheduled.&lt;br/&gt;
