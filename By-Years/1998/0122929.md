A minimum of 25 scholarships are being awarded annually to academically
talented, low-income students pursuing degrees in computer science, engineering
or mathematics. The program is providing faculty mentoring to all scholarship
recipients and tutoring to aid in the transition from high school to university
level studies. Undergraduate research in association with a faculty member is an
integral part of the educational experience and presentation at the annual
research seminar is expected.
