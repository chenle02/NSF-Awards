The purpose of this grant is to obtain a comprehensive description of the
physical oceanography and underlying dynamics of eastern boundary currents. The
investigators propose to analyse an extensive collection of data gathered during
1981-1985 in the upwelling region off Peru. They will combine water properties
(temperature, salinity), current measurements, winds, and sea-level to obtain a
complete description of the phenomenology of the region encompassing an El Nino
event. With this grant Huyer will also analyse similar data collected off the
coast of California and Oregon during the Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment
(CODE) and SuperCODE.
