The Physics Department at Indiana University of Pennsylvania is constructing a
set of experiments around a semiconductor characterization workstation,
consisting of a variable-temperature cryostat, a capacitance-voltage (C-V)
measurement system, a current- voltage (I-V) measurement system, and a deep
level transient spectroscopy system (DLTS). The workstation is being used in the
senior solid state electronics laboratory to allow students to explore the
properties of semiconducting materials. In addition, it is being used in
undergraduate research projects. The University is matching the award with an
equal amount of funds.
