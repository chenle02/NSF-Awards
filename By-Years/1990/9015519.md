This grant supports the International Culture Collection of Vesicular-Arbuscular
Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM) at West Virginia University. INVAM will collect,
maintain, and distribute authenticated mycorrhizal fungi for research and
education activities. Mycorrhyzal fungi are important mutualistic microorganisms
in that they have a principal role in maximizing productivity and longevity of
plants in natural and cultivated ecosystems. Mycorrhyzal fungi are difficult to
culture and maintain. Research progress on this organism depends on a central
repository of germplasm maintained under defined conditions. INVAM is expected
to serve as a focal point for mycorrhyzal research.
