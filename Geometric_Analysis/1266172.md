This project addresses questions concerning the regularity of and the analysis
of singularities of solutions to nonlinear parabolic equations, primarily in
connection with more complex problems in differential geometry. A significant
part of this project is devoted to the understanding of global-in-time solutions
to geometric flows such as the Ricci flow, the Yamabe flow, and the mean
curvature flow, and the related problem of the classification of associated
singularities and solitons. Other projects include free boundary problems
arising from the mathematics of finance, the qualitative behavior to solutions
of fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations, and the study of the Ricci
flow on Lorentzian manifolds.

The project links a wide range of active fields of mathematics, in particular,
nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry, and classical analysis. The
principal investigator intends to study the applications of the mathematical
problems to other disciplines such as quantum field theory, relativity theory,
and mathematical finance. Results will be disseminated to the research community
at various meetings and by publication of research articles. New courses linking
partial differential equations and geometric analysis for graduate students will
be designed and implemented.
