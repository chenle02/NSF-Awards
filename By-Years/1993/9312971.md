9312971 Magnanti This research will investigate complexity issues for the
variational inequality problem. This is a new research direction that aims to:
(1) provide new theoretical insights and a better understanding for a very
general class problem, as well as for several of its specializations and
applications, and (2) create new algorithms and algorithmic approaches for
variational inequalities and related problems. Variational inequality problems
(VIP) provide a natural and efficient framework for unifying the treatment of
equilibrium problems encountered in areas as diverse as economics, game theory,
transportation, and regional science. Moveover, variational inequalities
encompass a wide range of generic problem areas including mathematical
optimization (linear and non-linear), complementarity, fixed point, and
equilibrium problems. The investigation aims to address several questions
concerning the complexity of variational inequality problems: (a) What is the
most general subclass of VIPs that are solvable in polynomial time? (b) What is
the complexity of VIPs or of VIPs with special structure? (c) What is the
relationship between the complexity of computing equilibria and fixed points and
the complexity of algorithms for VIPs? (d) Can duality results for VIPs suggest
new efficient algorithms? (e) What algorithms for VIPs are efficient in
practice? Building upon many of the ideas used in recent research, this
investigation will draw upon methods developed in the past decade in studying
the complexity of linear and nonlinear programming (e.g. potential function
methods, volume estimates, duality results) as well as other results from
mathematical analysis such as convergence properties of nonexpansion maps.
