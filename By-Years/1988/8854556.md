This project seeks to increase the level of concern about curriculum reform
among engineering educators in the mechanical engineering area and to provide a
disciplinary environment that is much more supportive of revision and change in
the undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum than appears to exist at the
present. The efforts include the following steps: 1) a conference of the
Mechanical Engineering Department Heads to discuss ME curriculum during the
Spring of 1989, 2) a program of "Awards for Exemplary Experiences with
Mechanical Engineering Curriculum Change", 3) a follow-on step to determine what
the impact of the curriculum innovation has been after a period of one year to
keep attention focused on innovation in undergraduate programs in Mechanical
Engineering. The grantee and the institutions of the participants provide funds
that are an approximate match for the NSF award. A valuable part of the project
is the continuing publication of the papers about the various efforts to improve
the curriculum. During the two years of the project this is expected to increase
interest in and sensitivity about undergraduate education among those in the
Mechanical Engineering education community.
