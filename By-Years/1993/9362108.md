9362108 Arlinghaus We propose to demonstrate the potential applicability of the
sputter-initiated resonance ionization microprobe (SIRIMP) technique for
geological studies by measuring Pb isotope ratios and U/Pb atomic ratios in
geological samples relevant to geochronology. SIRIMP is based on the concept of
resonance ionization of sputtered atoms and potentially offers several
advantages over conventional high-resolution ion microprobe instruments. The
most important of these are the high selectivity, significant reduction of
isobaric interferences and matrix effects, and notable reduction in instrument
cost. Preliminary research will be required in order (a) assess interferences
due to unsuppressed ions created in the sputtering process (secondary ions) and
those created by nonresonant photoionization and evaluate methods for their
elimination, and (b) experimentally identify and evaluate resonant ionization
schemes for Pb and U. Results from the proposed research will provide the basis
for the development of new state- of-the-art analytical methods which would
significantly advance analytical capabilities in earth sciences and promote new
areas of research. These benefits could extend to other areas such as the
semiconductor industry, the biomedical field, and environmental sciences.
