Description: This project provides travel support for fifteen Indian
astronomers who plan to participate in the General Assembly Meeting of The
International Astronomical Union, to be held in Baltimore, MD in August 1988,
and in satellite symposia to be held in other parts of the U.S. Dr. Arthur
Davidsen of the Space Telescopic Science Institute, Johns Hopkins University is
co-chairman of the IAU Local Committee. The Indian counterpart is Dr. B.V.
Sreekantan, Astrophysics Group, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay.
The Indian participants will be mainly from TIFR, the Physical Research
Laboratory in Ahmedabad, Osmania University, and from the Udaipur Solar
Observatory. Scope: Membership of the IAU includes over 150 scientists from
India, and a large number of these have applied to participate in the general
assembly meeting and to certain satellite symposia and colloquia in the U.S.
Participation by Indian scientists is likely to significantly enhance the
exchange of scientific information and increase the potential for joint research
in this field where international cooperation is particularly important.
