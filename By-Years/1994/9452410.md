The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a FT-IR spectrophotometer for use in
Organic Chemistry and General Chemistry courses. The instrument is enabling the
department to introduce environmental investigations into the curriculum and
redesign the general chemistry course to include a broader introduction to the
field of organic chemistry. Students majoring in non-science disciplines are
benefiting also by use of modern instrument technology to investigate natural
phenomena.
