9625141 Farwell This award is to develop a validated, mobile system for the
preparation and delivery of test gas mixtures. In addition to testing analytical
performance features such as detectability, dynamic range, precision, and
selectivity, the improved system will enable the assessment of method response
times by varying the test gas concentrations with time in a rapid, controlled
manner in order to more realistically mimic atmospheric conditions. Reliable
measurements of tropospheric sulfur gases such as sulfur dioxide, dimethyl
sulfide, and others are important for our understanding of the albedo effect of
sulfate aerosol produced from marine biogenic emissions, acidic precipitation,
and the biogeochemical sulfur cycle. In the absence of absolutely known
standards, which do not exist for sulfur dioxide and other sulfur gases,
intercomparison experiments involving several different measurement methods
present the best forum for assessing the quantitative reliability of these
methods.
