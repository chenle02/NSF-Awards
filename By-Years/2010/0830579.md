The Cincinnati Symposium on Probability Theory and Applications 2009 will take
place March 20-23, 2009 at the University of Cincinnati, and is part of a year-
long research seminar in probability theory sponsored by the Charles Phelps Taft
Research Center. The Symposium will serve as a forum for dissemination and
exchange of ideas, questions, and approaches in some active research areas in
probability theory, focusing on high impact areas chosen because of their
scientific and practical interest as well as to their relationship with other
fields. These areas are 1. New advances in studying the structure of a
stochastic process via a martingale approximation, connections to ergodic
theory; 2. Limit theorems and applications in statistics, finance, and
statistical inference for random processes which may exhibit strong or long-
range dependence, nonlinearity, heavy tails and other features; 3. Probability
Theory in DNA Forensics; 4. Large-dimensional random matrices. A unique feature
of our symposium is a series of four talks by experts on forensic genomics.
These talks will introduce graduate students and junior faculty to an emerging
and exciting area of mathematical biology which relies on sophisticated
probabilistic techniques. By combining together four fairly focused research
areas, we also expect to foster interactions between specialists in limit
theorems, random matrices, and the researchers who apply probabilistic methods
to Forensic Genomics
