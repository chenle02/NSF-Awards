The genus Entamoeba comprises a lineage of single cell anaerobic amoebae that
are mostly parasites in the intestines of animals. Most are harmless gut-
dwellers, but a few species are pathogens. The best known and studied species
are those that infect vertebrae hosts, including the human pathogen Entamoeba
histolytica, which is responsible for approximately 100,000 deaths/year. The
current study will focus on describing and determining the evolutionary history
of Entamoeba infecting invertebrates. Entamoeba ribosomal gene sequences (SSU)
and cultures of invertebrate-infecting Entamoeba will be acquired from known and
suspected hosts. Amoebae will be fully characterized and documented by light
microscopy. Specific probes will enable SSU gene acquisition from most species
of Entamoeba, whether isolated from cultured amoebae or directly from the host
gut. Comparative gene analyses will be utilized to infer the evolutionary
history in this lineage of parasites and this history will inform knowledge of
the evolution of key features such as degree of
pathogenicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will begin to clarify Entamoeba
systematics and taxonomy. The vastly underappreciated biodiversity of these
organisms will be illuminated. Characterization of Entamoeba infections in
invertebrates may identify unexpected natural reservoirs of human infection and
will open up avenues of research on Entamoeba in the entomological research
community (e.g., pathology, bio-control). Genetic and morphologic criteria will
serve to delineate and describe species new to science and will provide a
paradigm for the taxonomy of other Amoebozoans.&lt;br/&gt;
