This project is a continuation of a previously funded REU- SITE proposal. It is
a cooperative venture among 3 Florida Universities designed to recruit
undergraduate students to engage in research projects at these institutions. In
all, 12 students, including a large percentage of women and minorities, will be
selected to work with 3 principal investigators from the University of Central
Florida, the University of South Florida and Stetson University. The focus of
the research will be on computer vision. After a general introduction to
material on computer vision, students will be asked to select an individual
research project from those proposed by the faculty. Specific areas of research
include dynamic scene analysis, recognition systems, and motion trajectories.
