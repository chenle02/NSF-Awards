9417502 Nurmikko This poject concentrates on research in which high speed
optical and optoelectronic techniques are applied to the study of lower
dimensional electronic excitations in small heterostructures in compound
semiconductors. In particular, new terahertz transient spectroscopic methods
will be applied to the study of few and many electron systems in quantum wires
and dots in quantizing magnetic fields, with emphasis on the ballistic and
coherent response. Enhanced spatial resolution in high amplitude THz fields will
be provided by near field imaging methods. % % % This project aims at the study
of electrom motion in small semiconductor structures, on a scale much smaller
than a micrometer. The electrons may be confined along a very thin wire or in a
box, this will make them behave more as waves rather than particles. Ultrashort
laser pulse techniques are applied to provide an initial impact of excitation of
the electrons and to follow their subsequent motion on a timescale of about one
trillionth of a second. In particular, a novel spectroscopic arrangement that
uses so-called terahertz techniques will be employed. ***
