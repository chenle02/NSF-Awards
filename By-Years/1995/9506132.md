SBR-9506132 This dissertation-improvement award is to fund a year of research in
southern India. The Student aims to compare three community-based
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Karnatka State to explore hypotheses
about the relationships between fiscal autonomy and political "distance" from
the state, on the one hand, and the structure, form, and organizational
practices of NGOs. The context of the research is the increased salience given
this form of civil institution in industrializing societies. India is the site
of the extended case studies because of the importance of NGOs to current
development strategies there. The Student will compare the three NGOs along a
set of detailed parameters, including household characteristics of participants,
organizational structure and activities, and organizational impact. A major
purpose of the study is the impact of NGO practices within both the household
and larger political spheres.
