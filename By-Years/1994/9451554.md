9451554 Stroup This project will improve the ability of Francis Marion
University science and nonscience majors to analyze and solve new problems by
developing their higher order thinking skills. The major components of the
proposal include laboratory exercises organized around hands-on experimentation,
a series of interactive introductory videotapes, Computer-Augmented Teaching
(C.A.T.) techniques, and a program of recently published analysis problems and
case studies to improve student oral and written communication. We propose to
enhance the development of thinking skills by a combination of microvideo-
instructional techniques and C.A.T. exercises. In two pilot research projects
these multimedia presentations have been shown to significantly improve
identified thinking skills when used in combination with the requested
equipment. New laboratory exercises, and simulations will improve the content
mastery and the process skills of our students and promote an increased interest
in the biological sciences. The proposed project will impact directly on
approximately one thousand students annually enrolled in Biology, will provide
models for other FMU Departments, and will be extended nationally through the
authors' NSF sponsored Chautauqua Short Course, the National Association of
Biology Teachers (NABT) monograph series and an NABT sponsored videotape. The
South Carolina Commission on Higher Education competitively funded our pilot
research project, which partially equipped two of our four introductory Biology
laboratories. The purpose of this NSF proposal is to request funds to purchase
microvideo and microcomputer instructional systems to fully equip all four
freshman laboratories. Successful implementation of our instructional strategy
in all of our introductory biology laboratories will not be possible without the
requested instructional equipment.
