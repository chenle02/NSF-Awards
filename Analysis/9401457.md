9401457 Kaminker This project will pursue several directions involving the use
of operator algebras to obtain invariants for elliptic operators, algebraic
K-theory and dynamical systems. a notion of higher spectral flow will be
developed. Index theoretic invariants will be defined which will detect elements
of algebraic K-theory of the complex numbers. Operator algebras associated to
hyperbolic dynamical systems will be studied and a K-theoretic duality relation
will be used to obtain dynamical information. Work will also be done on some
questions related to the Novikov conjecture and generalized homology theories on
C*- algebras. These problems all involve Hilbert space operators and their
relation to the geometric properties of manifolds, the higher dimensional
analogues of surfaces. Partial differential operators play a large role in this
work. These operators occur naturally in the study of applied mathematics and
mathematical physics. ***
