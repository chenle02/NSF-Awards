This project will focus on the development of inequalities which provide
information on the embedding of Orlicz spaces of the weighted Sobolev type into
other Orlicz spaces. Included will be studies of embedding of weighted Sobolev
spaces into weighted Lebesque spaces. Basic tools involved in this work are
singular integral operators, capacity theory and maximal operators. Applications
will be made to nonlinear partial differential equations such as semilinear
elliptic boundary value problems.
