This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an
oxygen sensor for monitoring explosive mixtures in the head space (ullage) of an
aircraft fuel tank. This sensor integrates technological advancements in micro-
electronics such as digital signal processors, new vertical cavity surface
emitting lasers, high sensitivity absorption spectroscopy, and the development
of innovative shields to prevent liquid interferences of optical surfaces. The
sensor is expected to detect oxygen concentrations between 5 to 21 percent at a
rate of one sample per second, and to perform in conditions where the
temperature range is -70 to 120 F and the pressure range is 100 to 760 Torr. The
proposed sensor system will be initially compatible for aircraft fuel tanks and
later modified for oil tankers and other potential
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of this program
will lead to a rugged and miniaturized oxygen sensor system that is compatible
with aircraft fuel tanks. Commercial and military aircraft will greatly benefit
from this sensor since it increases their survivability. In addition, the sensor
can monitor fuel tanks in oil tankers to prevent oil spillage due to
explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
