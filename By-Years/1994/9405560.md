9405560 Patrick The Brooks Range of Alaska is a major collisional belt that
contains a metamorphic core of high pressure/low temperature rocks. It is
thought that these blueschist and greenschist facies rocks in the metamorphic
core resulted form a mid-Mesozoic collision between a north-facing island arc
and an older passive continental margin. The P.I.'s recent work in the area has
shown that a proposed major thrust in the schist belt of the Central Brooks
Range is in fact a stratigraphic contact and there is evidence to suggest that
the bulk deformation was mostly contractional, rather than extensional as
proposed by other workers. This project will examine the petrology, structure
and geochronology of the transition between the internal metamorphic zone and
the external zone of the Brooks Range. It will investigate the links between the
internal and external zones and examine the contributions of extension and
contraction during the collisional orogenic event. The results of this work will
be broadly applicable to all major orogenic belts.
