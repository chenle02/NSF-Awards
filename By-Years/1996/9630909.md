9630909 Stein This project will implement, over a period of two years, an
information management data model that has been developed by the PIs and
collaborators at no cost to NSF. The strength and uniqueness of this data model
is its ability to integrate, into a single processing environment, multiple
specimen catalogs and to track individual specimen parts and collections
objects. The hardware and software choices were selected in part because they
are scaleable and portable to computing platforms that are common throughout the
collections community. All intermediate and final development products,
including design documents, annotated source code, and run-time programs, will
be made publicly available on an open-access Internet server so that they may be
freely adopted by other institutions. This project represents a conceptual and
technical advance in the managment of natural history collections information by
extending community approaches. The solution developed here will be applicable
within many institutions nation- and world-wide. Therefore, this project is
being conducted not only in partnership between the University of California at
Berkeley and the NSF, but also among institutions, and between programs and
divisions within the NSF (funding has been provided by the Database Activities
and the Research Collections in Systematics & Ecology Programs).
