One of the unique features of neurons that make learning and memory possible is
their ability to alter their shape to make contact with other neurons. The
ability of neurons to alter their shape to form these contacts is dependent on
the regulation of the cytoskeleton ? a highly dynamic network of intracellular
filaments that provide a function analogous to bones in the human body. Because
of its role in regulating neuronal shape, the cytoskeleton is believed to play a
critical role in several nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer?s disease.
In spite of the importance of the cytoskeleton in neurons, it is unclear whether
all of the cytoskeletal filaments in neurons have been identified. The PI has
conducted a genome wide-screen for novel filament-forming proteins. This screen
identified one protein that forms filaments in the cellular extensions called
axons that connect neurons to each other suggesting that this protein has a
cytoskeletal function. Surprisingly, this filament-forming protein, CTP
synthase, is also responsible for synthesizing nucleotides, the building blocks
of DNA, arguing that CTP synthase is an unusual protein with two distinct
functions. The goal of this proposal is to use powerful genetic approaches to
identify mutant forms of CTP synthase that are selectively defective in the
ability to form filaments. These mutants will be used to determine if the
ability of CTP synthase to form filaments is necessary for neurons to form
functional connections. The identification of a novel component of the neuronal
cytoskeleton will have broad implications for our understanding of how neuronal
connections are formed and will open a new area for cell biological research.
Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate researchers will be integrated into all
aspects of the project providing an opportunity to train the next generation of
scientists in a cutting-edge area of neuroscience.
