This award supports the first Summer School on Cyber-Physical Systems, held at
the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, June 22-25, 2009. NSF
funds support outreach and enable the participation of US graduate students and
early career faculty in this international event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber
Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that rely on a tight integration of
computation, communication, and controls, for their operation and interaction
with the physical environment in which they are deployed. Such systems must be
able to operate safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and in real-time, in
potentially highly uncertain or unstructured environments. CPS are expected to
have great technical, economic and societal impacts in the near
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the Georgia Tech Summer School on
Cyber-Physical Systems is to establish a forum for intellectual exchange on CPS
science and technology for researchers from industry and academia. The format of
the Summer School is a five-day meeting, organized around the different aspects
of Cyber Physical Systems. The topical areas covered include: formal methods,
distributed embedded systems, networked control systems, embedded software,
scheduling, platforms, and applications.&lt;br/&gt;
