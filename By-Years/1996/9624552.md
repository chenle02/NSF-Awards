This project focuses on two lines of research: (1) program correctness and (2)
the problem of learning deterministic and probabilistic finite automata:(1)
Because the simplest of programs can be full of elusive errors, the study of
program checkers, self-testing programs and self correcting programs, was
introduced, in order to permit the use of a program without trusting that it
works correctly. In this area, the goal of this project is to develop a core of
algorithmic techniques for writing fast and simple checkers, self-correctors,
and self-testers;(2) The goal in the area of learning deterministic and
probabilistic finite automata is to study the applications of automata learning
algorithms to on-line page replacement strategies, reinforcement learning, game
theory, part-of-speech tagging, phoneme modeling, and parsing. The Integrated
Educational Plan of this CAREER Grant includes designing new projects to
facilitate undergraduate and graduate student involvement in the research
process and mentoring undergraduates. ***
