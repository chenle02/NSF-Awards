An understanding of the influence of local landscape structure on insect
population dynamics is critically needed to address questions concerning agro-
ecosytem re-design. An in depth examination of specific alfalfa herbivores and
predators in a diverse ecological-agricultural landscape is proposed. A
Geographic Information System (GIS) will be employed as the principal analytical
tool in establishing relationships between landscape complexity and insects. The
following objectives are proposed: characterize local ecosytems wide
distribution of predaceous coccinellids, aphid prey and leafhopper migrants as
colonization of alfalfa begins; quantify microclimate factors which influence
insect development in and dispersal from over- wintering sites to spring
habitats; measure and determine the effect of landscape structural diversity on
initial colonization of alfalfa by insect predators and pests, and the
recolonization of alfalfa following disturbance associated with alfalfa cutting
and harvest. These results will be used in a GIS assessment of landscape effects
on insect dynamics. This research will provide essential information on
predator/prey dynamics across landscapes.
