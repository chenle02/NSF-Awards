9318137 Pfeffer The principal investigators will conduct an investigation into
the behavior of stationary and transient waves in the atmosphere through a
series of laboratory experiments with a rotating annulus. This research
represents a continuation of work with the annulus which is complemented by
diagnostic and theoretical analyses. In particular, the PIs will explore the
effects of the basic state potential vorticity gradient and latent heat release
on wave behavior as well as the fate of topographically-induced midlatitude
waves as they encounter the tropics with its different flow regime (reflection
or absorption). In conducting the laboratory experiments, the PIs will test new
techniques for creating the potential vorticity gradients and for simulating
latent heat release and wave absorption at the so-called critical line. These
experiments, combined with the diagnostic and modeling studies, should provide
insights into still unresolved questions about planetary scale atmospheric wave
behavior. ***
