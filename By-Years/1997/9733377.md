Flora 9733377 This is an award to support a project proposed in accord with the
Guidelines for Submission of Proposals to the Faculty Early Career Development
(CAREER) Program, NSF 97-87. The Principal Investigator's research goal is to
study the potential use of bioelectrochemical systems for treatment of polluted
water. His objectives are to obtain the engineering design parameters that would
provide guidance to engineers in design of processes and systems utilizing these
bioelectrochemical systems for treatment of surface and groundwaters. The
research proposed is a renewal of work that was started under NSF's Research
Initiation Award No. 94-10486. In accord with NSF 97-87, the Principal
Investigator plans on involving undergraduate students in the conduct of his
research. His plan for revising the undergraduate laboratory used for
environmental engineering instruction is to structure it to provide
opportunities for discovery and creativity by students rather than specifying
the performance of rigid laboratory exercises consisting of experiments that are
performed, data recorded and ended with a laboratory report. He plans to
coordinate the laboratory experiences of students with lectures and classwork
that will include addressing field-scale problems. ***
