Analyses of "wrongful convictions," cases in which subsequent evidence (e.g.,
DNA analyses) has indicated that the convicted person was not guilty of the
crime, have found that incorrect eyewitness identifications have led to more
convictions of innocent people than have all other factors combined. Prior
research has shown that a key factor on eyewitness mistakes is the tendency for
people to recognize faces of a different race more poorly than faces of their
own race; this phenomenon has been called the "other-race effect." Research with
adults has clearly demonstrated the pervasiveness of this effect, but little is
known about when this effect originates or what its course of development may be
through childhood. This gap in knowledge is addressed in the current project by
examining the effect in young African Americans and Whites at four developmental
levels (second graders, sixth graders, tenth graders, and college sophomores).
The goals of the project are to understand how the effect develops across
childhood, and whether and how it can be changed. In addition to yielding
important basic information about human perception and memory, these studies
should provide useful information to those who work with children as witnesses
in the criminal and civil justice systems. The findings should be particularly
relevant to those who formulate policies about how best to obtain, interpret,
and utilize eyewitness memory reports from children of various ages.&lt;br/&gt;
