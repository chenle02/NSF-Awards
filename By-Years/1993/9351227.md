9351227 Powell The Department is currently expanding its undergraduate
laboratory experiments in astronomy. The University has made a commitment to
construct a local observatory which will support eight 8-inch telescopes and one
14-inch telescope. To provide the most versatile observational astronomy
laboratory possible, each 8-inch telescope will be equipped with a CCD camera
and controlling computer. The 14-inch telescope will be equipped with a larger
format, higher dynamic range CCD for upper level undergraduate classes and
student research projects. The combination of telescopes and CCD cameras will be
used for students to obtain experimental results for a color-magnitude diagram,
variable stars, planets, and galaxies. The laboratory experiments are designed
to improve students' problem-solving skills, provide experience with state-of-
the-art technology, and increase their awareness of scientific principles. ***
