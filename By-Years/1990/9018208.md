This proposal is for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
to continue, through 1995, the operation of an atmospheric monitoring
observatory at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, under the direction of the
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory, Boulder, Colorado. Program
objectives are the determination of concentrations, time variations, and other
properties of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols that may have potential
impacts on the global climate. Solar and infrared radiation fluxes are also
monitored to determine long-term means and any possible trends that could be
associated with climate changes.
