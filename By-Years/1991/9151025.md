A computer classroom/laboratory is being used to allow students to examine
topics from a geometric point of view whenever possible. Students are using the
computer and their intuition to develop an understanding of concepts and to
discover theorems. When analytic methods fail to yield a closed form solution,
numerical methods are used to obtain an approximate solution. Students are
shown, in small doses, how to use the True Basic programming language and are
required to write programs to accomplish a wide range of meaningful tasks.
Unisys Personal Workstations running True Basic and Derive are the principal
tools in the laboratory.
