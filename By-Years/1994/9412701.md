9412701 Samulski This research is concerned with characterization and
quantification of intermolecular forces in liquid crystals (LCs). The ultimate
goal is to understand the properties of liquid crystals in terms of their
molecular structural features to allow rational designs for new mesogens
optimized for specific applications (high contrast ratios, rapid switching, high
spontaneous polarization, etc.). This is achieved through carefully constructed
experiments and associated modeling of the experimental findings with the
intention of deriving a general formulation of molecular ordering in LCs in
terms of an orientational potential. Knowledge of orientational potentials
allows one to construct the molecular orientation distribution and thereby
calculate a molecule's order tensor, and compute and correlate thermodynamic
properties of mesogens with molecular structure. %%% This project is concerned
with the measurement of molecular properties in liquid crystals (LCs) so that
improved LCs can be engineered for new display applications such as high
definition TV. This is achieved by studying the behavior of selected solutes
dissolved in LC solvents in order to clarify the importance of the different
kinds of intermolecular interactions that contribute to the electro optic
responses of these unusual fluids. The goal is an increased understanding of the
molecular origins of important physical and technologically significant
characteristics of liquid crystals (e.g., birefringence, spontaneous electric
polarization) with the ulterior motive of designing more responsive and higher
contrast materials for LC displays.
