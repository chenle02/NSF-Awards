Funded by an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, equipment will be purchased
for use in an investigation of turbulence in sediment-laden flows. Grid-
generated turbulence in a fluid- particle medium will be explored with a laser-
Doppler velocimeter capable of measuring instantaneous fluid and particle
velocities. The particles will be matched to the fluid with the same index of
refraction. Suspension of particulates occur in a variety of flow applications
in the civil and environmental engineering area.
