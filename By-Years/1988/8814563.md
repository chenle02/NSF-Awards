This work will undertake the development of a nearly fully automated Fabry-Perot
Interferometer (FPI) and to employ it to measure the winds and temperatures of
the thermospheric and mesopheric regions of the atmosphere over the South Pole.
The data will greatly complement those obtained by other South Pole
instrumentation and the new Halley Station radar. It will also be important to
the new NSF initiative CEDAR, which addresses global atmospheric dynamics. The
automated FPI will be remotely commanded by the proposer and guest investigators
from the University of Alaska campus using satellite relay. Normal operation
will require that the South Pole staff only change the data storage medium on an
infrequent schedule. The proposer and his co-investigators are leaders in
atmospheric dynamics and optics and can be expected to do an excellent job. The
facilities of the institutions involved are more than adequate. Due to the
instrument development involved partial funding is being provided by the Polar
Operations Section. The Program recommends funding at the revised level for
three years.
