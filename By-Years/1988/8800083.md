A number of community health surveys have found that social support is
associated with reduced rates of mortality and morbidity. Individuals with more
ties to relatives, friends, neighbors, and voluntary organizations live longer
and healthier lives than those with fewer ties. Why social support protects
people against illness and premature death has not, however, been satisfactorily
explained. The theoretical perspective guiding this research is that the
influence of social support in reducing mortality should systematically vary by
cause of death. The research will refine and validate a new classification of
cause of death, which will then be used to test a series of hypotheses specify
that the strength of association between social support and mortality will
depend on gender, socioeconomic status, availability of formal medical
resources, as well as on the structural features of the social support itself.
Longitudinal surveys and mortality data from U.S. and Swedish samples of elderly
persons will be used to test the hypotheses. The findings will contribute to our
understanding of how people's social environments are linked to their physical
health.
