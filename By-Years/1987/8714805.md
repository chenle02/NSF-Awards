Meharry Medical College proposes the establishment of a Center for the Study of
Cell and Molecular Biology. Researchers at the Center, including four new
scientists, will expand the medical school's current work in cellular and
molecular biology and will at the same time, initiate work in the
characterization of genes that are developmentally regulated. Work will continue
on advanced applications of recombinant DNA technology to the neurosciences. The
Center will also be used to motivate minority students at all educational levels
to consider careers in science and engineering. In addition, the Center will
develop strategies to strengthen partnerships with industry and academia. This
project meets the major goal of the Minority Research Centers of Excellence
(MRCE) program: to increase the minority presence in science and engineering by
making substantial resources available to upgrade the research capabilities of
strong and productive minority institutions. The project will at the same time
enable this institution to use research as a tool to increase the effectiveness
of related science and engineering activities for minority groups in its region.
In addition, the project will provide opportunities for minority faculty and
students at Meharry and nearby institutions to engage in meritorious research
that leads to publications in refereed journals.
