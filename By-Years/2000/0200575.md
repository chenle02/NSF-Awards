This award provides support to a consortium of faculty from the University of
Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)
for purchase of an ultra-high field magnetic micro-imaging device to be used for
biological research. The instrument includes a 9.4T, 89 mm bore, actively
shielded, superconducting magnet, console, dual fullband RF system, gradient
amplifier, two gradient coils, and five RF probes for multi-nuclear spectroscopy
from 20 MHz to 480 MHz. The instrument is made cost effective by the small bore,
a constraint that contributes to enhanced gradient performance and field
homogeneity. Ultra high-field, large bore systems used for medical research and
diagnosis cost millions of dollars and push the limits and performance of
gradient coils. Ultra high-field microimagers give unprecedented anatomical and
functional images, allow multiple and single voxel spectroscopy, and have the
potential to determine up to eighteen neurochemical signals simultaneously in
vivo. The microimager is expected to provide research and training opportunities
for students in 1) MR imaging, 2) data acquisition, management, image
processing, and informatics, 3) development of radiofrequency electronics, and
4) neurophysiological and biological experimental design and implementation. The
planned biological applications include: imaging functional brain activity,
quantitative developmental neuroanatomy, imaging brain metabolism, and imaging
brain receptors with ligand specific contrast agents, all using small animals.
The success of these studies will require new developments in electronics,
computer science and chemistry. Hence there is a natural collaboration between
engineers, computer and biological scientists at WPI and neuroscientists at
UMMS. &lt;br/&gt;
