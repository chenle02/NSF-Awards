This research will investigate soil as a reinforcing agent for ice. Ice has been
used on many occasions as an engineering construction mater, especially recently
as a means of constructing offshore drilling platforms, roads, and airstrips in
the Arctic. These constructions could be improved if a suitable reinforcing
agent could be incorporated into the ice. First, the material properties of the
reinforced ice could be improved over those of natural ice. Second, construction
time and costs could be significantly reduced. The work will investigate the use
of various alluvia (sands, silts and gravel) as reinforcing agents in ice.
Bending tests of both large and small beams will be performed as will
compression tests at a controlled strainrate and temperature.
