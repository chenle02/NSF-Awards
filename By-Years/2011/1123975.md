Critical to the study of languages and how they change are longitudinal studies,
which allow for the examination of communities over time. This study focuses on
African American English as spoken in Harlem, New York City. African American
English refers to a nonstandard variety of English characteristically spoken by
African Americans in the United States. This term covers a wide range of ways of
speaking, from very casual to very formal, as spoken by a range of individuals
from different age groups, ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds. Today,
Harlem is undergoing rapid change due to gentrification. This has resulted in a
decrease of its black majority as new residents come in. The aim of this
research is to examine the ways in which the language of Harlem's African
American residents has changed since the 1960s, in light of the significant
changes the neighborhood itself has undergone. That is, what is happening to
African American English, now that Harlem is no longer home to just African
Americans?

This study will observe and record roughly seventy-two residents of Harlem, from
a range of age groups and socioeconomic classes. Social and linguistic data will
be collected through sociolinguistic interviews with individuals and groups and
ethnographic observations, which will then be compared to previous linguistic
research conducted in Harlem in the 1960s. The current research promises to
build a more comprehensive picture of language contact and change, and will shed
light on issues pertaining to mediums for language transmission. This study also
has implications for education, especially in urban centers, where black
students continue to struggle in schools throughout the United States. A better
understanding of African American English and the social circumstances under
which it is used can help educators to differentiate between dialectal
differences and actual learning deficiencies, and thus provide the necessary
support for students.
