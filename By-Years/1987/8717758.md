This proposal requests funds to obtain a state of the art light microscopy ,
video and digital image processing equipment. The equipment will be utilized in
the research of five major users who have proposed projects investigating (1)
particle transport in living cells, (2) liposome-cell fusion and Z-DNA, (3) the
theoretical aspects of image formation in video microscopy, (4) ion transporting
epithelia and (5) cell-cell contact during invertebrate gastrulation.
