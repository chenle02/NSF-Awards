9521507 Menendez This research aims, using advanced Raman scattering
capabilities, to understand details of growth phenomena affecting disorder at
GaAs/AlAs superlattice(SL) interfaces, and interface chemistry and physics
relationships to III-V SL optoelectronic properties. This approach will be used
to study basic chemical and physical processes that produce disorder at
heterojunction during growth. In addition, the vibrational and electronic
properties of ultrasmall structures and the stresses in semiconductor devices
will be further investigated. The project also includes modeling and simulation
to predict phonon frequencies in complex materials for comparison and
interpretation of experimental results. %%% An advanced laser light scattering
with computer simulation has recently been developed and will be used for basic
research of chemical and physical properties of ultrasmall structures, and
heterojunction interfaces. This project will be important for advances in
microelectronics and photonics because progress in the miniaturization of
semiconductor devices depends on the availability of material structures whose
crystalline and chemical properties can be controlled at the atomic level.
Additionally, an important feature of the program is the training of graduate
and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant
area. ***
