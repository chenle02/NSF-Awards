The Center for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering Education (CASEE)
of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) is building upon the National
Survey of Student Engagement, the Faculty Survey of Student Engagement, and the
ABET EC2000 Study in order to develop integrated assessment tools that will
measure faculty and student engagement in instructional and learning practices
that may correlate with desired student learning outcomes in undergraduate
engineering programs. To provide the context and basis for these assessment
tools, we are developing: i) a set of synthesized learning outcomes for
undergraduate engineering education that reflect the desires of the academic and
employer communities; and ii) a pilot database summarizing the education
research literature that links desired student outcomes to specific educational
"best practices". The outcome of this work will be an integrated set of pilot
instruments, vetted with a representative cross-section of the engineering
community, to assess the current state of instructional practice and student
learning outcomes.
