9409025 jahnke An analytical investigation is carried out for the stability and
maneuverability of aircrafts subjected to large perturbations. The stall/spin
phenomena lead to catastrophic accidents under such large inputs. The divergence
often occurs when the cruise condition becomes unstable due to bifurcation of
the steadystates of the aircraft, with the result that the aircraft jumps to a
new steady state or limit cycle that represents a spin condition. The stability
analysis is performed via a liapunov function using total energy of the aircraft
as a guide for constructing such functions. A continuation technique is used to
compute specific level curves which define the basin of attraction of the steady
state. The analytical technique is quite general, and applicable for stability
analysis of a variety of nonlinear dynamical systems. ***
