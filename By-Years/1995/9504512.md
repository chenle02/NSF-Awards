Schlosser 9504512 The Maurice Ewing Symposium on pplications of trace substance
measurements to oceanographic problems will be held in October 1995. The main
goals of the Symposium are: (1) to review the status of the tracer methodology
(technological advances and progress in applications), (2) to evaluate the
potential of the individual tracers for regional and global studies of water
mass formation and circulation of the ocean, (3) to outline the role of tracers
in calibration of Global Circulation Models, and (4) to outline strategies for
the development of the tracer methods in view of the structure of future ocean
observing systems. Resuls from the workshop will be published in a proceedings
volume.
