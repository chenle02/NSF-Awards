This award supports the Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry in
Big Sky, Montana, September 7-11, 2003. This Gordon Research Conference is one
of the major meetings in this field. In 2003, the conference will cover a broad
range of areas in atmospheric chemistry, including tropospheric chemistry -
laboratory, field and theoretical studies, upper troposphere/lower stratosphere
- composition, chemistry and transport, and remote sensing. The meeting will be
attended by both established researchers and young scientists, among them the
participants of the preceding Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging
Senior Scientists (ACCESS), and provide invaluable opportunities for
interactions between scientists in all areas of atmospheric chemistry.
