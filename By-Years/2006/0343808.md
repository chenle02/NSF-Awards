The goal of this project is to understand how animal behavior changes during
evolution. Closely related animals often have very different behavior that
allows them to thrive in their environments. For instance, finches on the
Galapogos islands have evolved to eat different kinds of seeds. These changes in
behavior are puzzling, because, although behavior is the product of the nervous
system, animals with different behavior often have nervous systems that look
practically identical. This project studies feeding behavior in bacteria eating
soil nematodes. Feeding in these very small worms is controlled by a tiny
nervous system of just 20 neurons, which are the same in different species, even
though they show obvious differences in feeding behavior. To learn how the
feeding nervous system produces different behaviors, individual neurons are
killed with a laser, and the resulting changes in behavior watched. Although the
neurons look similar, they turn out to function differently. In the long term
the project seeks to find genes that cause differences in behavior,
concentrating on two species. Students will carry out this work as part of their
training as research scientists. It will contribute to our understanding of the
evolutionary relationships among soil nematodes, a huge and ecologically crucial
group of animals, and of how they are adapted to their environments. More
broadly, it seeks to learn why some things change in evolution, while others
stay the same. Such understanding could be helpful in understanding when results
from one sort of animal can be applied to another (mouse to human, for example).
