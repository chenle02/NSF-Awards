AST 0206006&lt;br/&gt;Quataert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black holes, a prediction of
Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, represent the ultimate victory of
gravity over all other forces in the Universe; so much mass is concentrated in
such a small volume that nothing, not even light, can escape. In the past
decade, astronomers have provided convincing evidence that most galaxies in the
Universe have a massive black hole at their center; these are a million to a
billion times more massive than our Sun. Such black holes can be detected by
several techniques, including the radiation produced by hot gas falling into the
black hole. In some cases this gas produces more light than all of the billions
of stars in the host galaxy which harbors the black hole. Most of the time,
however, massive black holes produce surprisingly little radiation from
accreting gas. This research is aimed at understanding this impressive range in
energy production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Quataert and collaborators will
carry out theoretical calculations of the properties of hot gas in the vicinity
of a black hole, both analytically ("pencil and paper") and using computer
simulations. They will focus on determining how much gas falls into a black hole
and how much radiation this gas produces. They will then compare these results
to observations from facilities such as the Very Large Array (VLA) Radio
Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
