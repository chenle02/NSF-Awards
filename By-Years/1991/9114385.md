The primary research objective is to develop a framework based on the recently
discovered differential equation approach for solving motion related problems
that arise in manufacturing automation. It is of particular interest to produce
an advance in the theory of swept volumes, which will lead to improved means of
representing and analyzing sweeps and swept volumes that occur in numerically
controlled (NC) machining, robot manipulation, etc. Also of interest is to
investigate the full potential of the differential equation approach as a tool
for characterizing intersections of swept volumes, which leads to solutions for
collision detection and other motion planning problems. The method will be
applied to program verification and motion planning problems in NC machining and
robotics. The tasks include identification of classes of sweeps,
characterization of singularities in swept volumes and detection of collision
with obstacles (both static and dynamic). The project will include work on
implementing the results for practical applications.
