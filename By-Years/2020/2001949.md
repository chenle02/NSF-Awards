This project broadly seeks to use multi-parameter tree ring records from Laos
and Vietnam in central Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) to reconstruct discrete
spring, summer, autumn and winter climate variability for comparison to
observations and model simulations and to understand the dynamics and drivers of
climate and surface ocean variability in the region. The long-term perspective
of central MSEA variability from the proxy records will be synthesized with the
simulations for a more dynamically-based understanding of past and future
changes in atmospheric and upper-ocean properties throughout Southeast Asia and
the Maritime Continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research team
aims to use measurements of early and late wood width and density from blue
light intensity in tree ring samples to reconstruct seasonal to multi-decadal
records of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Standardized Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), rainfall, and boreal winter maximum temperature
over the past five to ten centuries. Links between central MSEA and Indo-Pacific
atmospheric and surface ocean properties over the past centuries will be
evaluated using observational/reanalysis products and coupled climate model
simulations because model resolution may not fully capture climate and ocean
variability within individual monsoon seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Asian
Monsoon impacts roughly two-thirds of the global population. Multi-model
assessments of regional climate under anthropogenic warming predict changes to
the Asian Monsoon that are expected to impact regional climate and ocean
variability. These multi-model assessments also predict a transition to a more
El Nino-like state, which is expected to variably alter precipitation,
temperature and ocean circulation patterns globally. The present understanding
of past changes in monsoon strength and precipitation and the resulting
consequences for Indian Ocean surface variability limits climatologistâ€™s ability
to accurately forecast regional climate impacts at various
timescales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include
better understanding of variability and long-term trends in rainfall and drought
from Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. Such information has important
implications for surrounding countries whose largely agrarian societies depend
on reliable monsoon rainfall. The project also supports a new investigator and
student participation in Woods Hole and UCAR SOARS summer
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
