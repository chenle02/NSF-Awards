This project completes an alternative route to information on the distribution
of interstellar cosmic rays, complementing efforts of the only existing
approach. The existing method involves solar modulation and shock acceleration
of energetic charged particles at/interior to the solar wind termination shock,
while the new approach utilizes the energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) produced from
interacting charged particles and local interstellar medium exterior to the
termination shock. The investigators are: (1) compiling relevant cross sections
for ENA production and extinction, and all characterizing parameters of the
solar wind and interstellar gas; (2) coding a three-dimensional computer program
simulating ENA flux at any vantage point, and under any heliospheric and
interstellar conditions, and (3) developing an iterative process for optimizing
the parameters characterizing the spatial and energy distribution of cosmic rays
at the termination shock. The research takes a huge step forward in searching
for the origins of cosmic rays, as well as propagation of charged particles in
and out of the solar wind influence.
