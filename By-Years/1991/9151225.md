The Department of Mathematics and Physical Sciences of West Texas State
University is investigating the extent to which classroom instruction can be
effectively carried out in a laboratory setting using computer-assisted data
acquisition and analysis. During selected lectures, students are using personal
computers, interface equipment, electronic sensors, and laboratory equipment to
observe first-hand the physical systems being discussed and to demonstrate for
themselves the interdependence of those systems' variables. Initially, this
portion of the project is studying the areas of motion, forces, fields, and
thermodynamics.Equipment purchased for this project is also being used in
regular physical science and physics laboratories and for student tutorials and
interactive simulations. Routine use of the computer lab is particularly
important in acquainting prospective science educators with emerging educational
technology. The project is generating three comprehensive lab manuals--one for
non-calculus physics that includes traditional experiments with modern
technological ones, a second version that is adapted for introductory physical
science, and a third for public school application.Specific equipment being
purchased with the funds include Gateway 3865X personal computers with disk
drive and system software, SuperCHAMP universal interfaces, data acquisition and
analysis software and sensors, color monitors, Toshiba 24-pin printers, Cenco
air tracks, and a Hewlett Packard 6-pin plotter.NSF grant funds are being
matched with funds from non-federal sources.
