The undergraduate computer facility is being equipped to improve laboratory
experiences and enhance independent undergraduate research. Student interested
in perceptual phenomena were previously limited to investigating visual
phenomena. With the acquisition of new equipment, students are now able to
investigate a wide range of auditory phenomena as well, including voice
identification, speech and music analysis, and pitch discrimination. The
equipment is a combination of a McIntosh computer, Farallon's MacRecorder and
MacLaboratory. Students can store sound stimuli in digitized form within the
computer and then analyze or manipulate the sounds. They can conduct auditory
discrimination experiments as well as a variety of other cognitive experiments.
The equipment is being used in a number of courses, but predominantly in the
sensation and perception course, the experimental methodology course, and
independent undergraduate research. Demonstrations and auditory experiments
resulting from this project will have a large pedagogical impact on other
institutions which lack sophisticated audition laboratories. The college will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
