The production of the phytotoxin rhizobitoxine by Bradyrhizobium japonicum in
soybean root nodules confers a pathogenic character to the normally mutually
beneficial symbiosis by causing a transient foliar chlorosis, thus blurring the
distinction between mutualistic and parasitic symbiosis. Toxin synthesis is
dependent upon the genotype of both the host plant and bacteria. By selecting
for mutants that no longer synthesize rhizobitoxine in culture, several mutants
with altered symbiotic phenotypes have been identified. One group of mutants
does not make toxin in culture or in planta. These include mutations in
structural genes in rhizobitoxine biosynthesis. Interestingly, one of these
genes requires a translation frameshift for expression. Symbiotically, the most
interesting group of mutants are those that fail to synthesize rhizobitoxine in
cluture, but do produce rhizobitoxine in planta at levels greater than wild
type. Consequently, these mutants produce more severe chlorosis from which the
plant does not recover. In addition, this group of mutants has altered
mutualistic symbiosis. The parental strain is restricted in its ability to
nodulate soybeans that carry the Rj4 gene. These mutants are able to nodulate
Rj4 soybeans at rates similar to unrestricted strains. This group of mutants
demonstrates a relationship between rhizobitoxine biosynthesis and host range
functions of Bradyrhizobium. The goals of this proposal are to examine the
biochemical and genetic mechanisms controlling these parasitic and mutualistic
symbiotic functions.
