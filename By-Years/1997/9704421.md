Tabor 9704421 Motivated by a range of problems and, in particular, the observed
iterated, stretching and writhing motions of certain bacterial filaments, the
investigator and his collaborator Isaac Klapper at Montana State University
develop new techniques to study the linear and nonlinear stability of the time-
dependent equations governing elastic filament dynamics (the Kirchhoff
equations) and, in parallel, computational approaches to provide efficient
numerical simulations. Overall, the investigators develop (i) new analytic
techniques to study both the linear and nonlinear stability of elastic
filaments, (ii) quantitative models of writhing instabilities and buckling
phenomena in mechanical filaments, (iii) mathematical models of self-assembling
bacterial fibers, lipid bi-layer roll-up and various aspects of DNA dynamics,
(iv) efficient and flexible algorithms to simulate the described physical and
biological processes and to test the validity of the (continuum) models, (v)
discrete elastic models for simulating DNA conformations, (vi) theoretical and
numerical models of solar magnetic fields with twist. A host of practical
problems in the biological, physical and engineering sciences involve
filamentary structures on scales varying from the microscopic to the
macroscopic. These include, in progression of scales: molecular structures
including DNA and lipid tubules and helices, bacterial fibers, vorticity
filaments, ropes and cables, braided magnetic flux tubes as seen in solar
flares, etc. The motion of these structures has a crucial impact on their
structure and function. The investigators develop general computational methods
to model these filaments and their uses, including the structure and function of
DNA, and the self-assembly of advanced biomaterials.
