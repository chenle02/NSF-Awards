Todd Martinez of the University of Illinois, and Mark Gordon, Brett Bode, Ricky
Kendall, and Masha Sosonkina of Iowa State University are supported by the NSF
Divisions of Chemistry and Shared Cyberinfrastructure, under the
Cyberinfrastructure and Research Facilities Program. This project will link
state-of-the-art molecular dynamics techniques with electronic structure methods
in a publicly available computer code, for use by both experts and non-experts
interested in determining chemical reaction mechanisms. A graphical user
interface will allow fast simulation setups, and a database-driven analysis tool
will couple automated archived results with sophisticated multi-dimensional
analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The determination of reaction mechanisms is a
major activity in chemistry, and is used to explain existing experimental data
as well to assess the feasibility of new experiments. Outcomes of this project
include publicly available software tools, along with a workshop for
dissemination, that will allow for reaction rate estimation, simulation of
ultra-fast experiments, enumeration of local minima, and automatic generation of
steady-state spectra.
