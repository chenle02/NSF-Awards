The chief importance of this project is its impact on increasing the number of
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees awarded at U.S.
universities. The nation needs a sufficient number of STEM-degree holders, who
possess technical skills that are crucially important for the nation's economic
health and growth. Unfortunately, too many potential STEM majors are currently
lost because of poor experiences in introductory university STEM courses. This
project aims to improve dramatically the retention of students in STEM majors by
propagating widely (by means of a national workshop) "best practices" for
preparing high-quality instructors of key introductory STEM courses. Graduate
Teaching Assistants (GTAs) are the primary instructors in laboratories and
recitations in large lecture STEM courses; however, GTAs are often inadequately
prepared to apply cutting-edge, evidence-based pedagogies necessary for
excellent STEM instruction and, thereby, enhanced STEM-major retention. The goal
of this project is widespread improvements to GTA preparation in introductory
physics and chemistry courses via propagating GTA professional development
programs. In a workshop, planning teams from Ph.D.-granting physics and
chemistry departments will devise customized, realistic GTA professional
development plans by interacting with each other and with world-class experts on
best practices for GTA support. Twenty STEM departments will develop plans; each
implemented plan will benefit 15 new GTAs annually, who then interact with 900
new undergraduates. Thus, the propagation of best practices by this workshop
should impact positively approximately 13,500 new undergraduates each year.
