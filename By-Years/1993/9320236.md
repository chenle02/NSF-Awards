9320236 Beeman This project supports the dissertation research of a student in
cultural anthropology from Brown university, studying the relationship between
dominant national symbols and regional variations in the popular culture of
performances in Spain. The student, an ex-professional dancer, will conduct
participant observation among flamenco students in a school in Madrid, and also
in Seville, the traditional home of regional flamenco as performed by Spanish
Gypsies. Using formal interviews and group interviews (focus groups) as well as
examination of news media the student will study perfmroance traditions as
potent symbols of Spanish culture as well as the tension between regional and
central forces in national culture. This research is important because nations
often choose symbols of nationhood -- flags, dances and other performances and
works of art -- which are used by the central government as symbols of the
whole. These symbols are at the same time instituted and performed in regional
variations in opposition to the dominance of the center. When civil order breaks
down (as we see it happening in the former Yugoslavia) these symbols can become
targets and rallying points. Understanding through a careful case study how one
traditional national symbol is learned and interpreted by people with varying
agendas can help us understand the general processes of symbol formation and
exploitation in modern nations, which can help us understand how to deal with
regional and inter-ethnic problems.
