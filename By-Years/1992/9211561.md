The long-range goal of this research is to determine the basic principles of
how mechanical stimuli are converted into neuronal signals that result in touch
perception. Towards this end, the research focusses on the Pacinian corpuscle,
which is considered typical of many mechanoreceptors found in the skin. The
research involves two major lines of investigation: (1) measurement of the
mechanical and mechano-electrical properties of this receptor using video
microscopy, mechanical forces and displacement analysis, and electrophysiology
in order to better relate stimulus forces and displacements to neural response
properties; and (2) to test the adequacy of the Bell and Holmes model of the
Pacinian corpuscle's mechanics by performing specific experiments which have
outcomes predicted by the model. The results obtained during the project should
have significance for a more general understanding of mechanotransduction which
occurs in all living organisms.
