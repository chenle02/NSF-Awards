Dissertation Improvement Research: Lake-Catchment Based Evaluation of Medium-
Term Sediment Yield and Sediment Dynamics From the Blue Ridge Mountains,
Virginia Patterns of sediment yield even in small watersheds reflect complex and
poorly understood processes of temporary and long-term sediment storage. These
processes are related to the size and associated frequency of occurrence of
runoff events and to past watershed disturbance. For this study lake sediment
cores are used to provide sediment yield estimates over a 33-year period from an
ungauged watershed in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Variations in
sediment yield through time will be compared with meteorological,
dendrochronological, and watershed disturbance records. The lengthened
analytical timescale makes possible a new and very relevant perspective on the
nature of erosionally dominant runoff events, sediment storage dynamics, and the
impacts of former landuse on sediment yield. The results of the study will serve
to further the goal of understanding physical landscape evolution at the more
holistic ecosystem level.
