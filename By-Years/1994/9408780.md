Abstract 9408780 Dunn This research is concerned with the development of optical
diagnostic techniques for solution-based processing of inorganic materials. The
overall objective of the research program is to develop and create optical
probes and spectroscopic methods for solution-based processing of inorganic
solids. The dip coating of inorganic films from sol-gel precursors will be
emphasized to carefully evaluate the optical probe methods in terms of their
effectiveness and sensitivity. In addition, the studies will be extended to
include a variety of compositions, another solution-based film deposition method
(spin coating) and a different film configuration (multilayers). The outcome of
the research will be the science and spectroscopy of optical probes for
solution-based processing of materials. The proposed techniques offer the
opportunity to use optical signals to characterize processing parameters in
real-time. The techniques are compatible with computer-controlled, "intelligent
manufacturing" for materials processing. %%%% The research program has two
complementary goals. The first goal is to develop optical probes and
spectroscopic methods to characterize the most important ppocessing parameters
which will include film viscosity, drying, stress generation and uniformity. The
second objective is to utilize the probes to characterize the related chemical
and structural changes which occur during film evolution. The different probes
will be sensitive to such features as film orientation effects, solvent
composition changes, capillary pressure and network collapse. The outcome of the
research will be the science and spectroscopy of optical probes for solution-
based processing of materials. The techniques discussed in this proposal offer
the opportunity to use optical signals to characterize processing parameters in
real-time. The techniques are compatible with computer-controlled, "intelligent
manufacturing" for materials processing.
