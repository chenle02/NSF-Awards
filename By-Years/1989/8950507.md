This project will provide the necessary instrumentation for a comprehensive
undergraduate Modern Physics Laboratory course at the University of the Virgin
Islands. In addition, several of instruments will be used to enhance the General
Physics and Natural Science laboratories. Equipment will allow students to
perform experiments such as speed of light, the photoelectric effect, electron
spin resonance, and gamma ray spectroscopy. A MacAdios 411 and Macintosh SE will
be used in the manipulation and processing of data. The experiments listed (and
others presently available) will allow students to use the computer for
processing both analog and digital information in an interactive system. A
comprehensive Modern Physics Laboratory course is imperative to
Physics/Chemistry and pre-Engineering majors. This lab will provide a firm
foundation in the fundamentals of modern physics and valuable experience in the
use of modern electronic equipment nd the interactive use of computers necessary
to students current with technology. The college will match the award with an
equal amount of funds.
