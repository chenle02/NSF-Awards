9706189 Green The investigators will continue their experimental study of the
rheology of partially molten crustal rocks and of mechanisms of melt segregation
and extraction. Over the next year they will conduct deformation experiments on
partially molten, quartzo-feldspathic aggregates of various grain sizes to
determine the grain-size sensitivity of creep, and thus the rate-controlling
process under these conditions. They will also investigate mechanisms of melt
segregation by deforming partially molten samples with juxtaposed porous
material to act as a melt sink. By deforming rocks with different melt
fractions, they hope to determine the amount of melt that the rock can hold and
still deform by ductile mechanisms. These deformation experiments will be
conducted in a Griggs-type deformation apparatus utilizing the molten salt cell
to optimize the stress sensitivity of the apparatus. ***
