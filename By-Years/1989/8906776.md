Funds are provided (partial) for the purchase of workstations which will
increase the efficiency of the local computing facilities as they interface the
national supercomputing centers. The enhanced computing power will initially be
used for studies such as the impact of deformable bodies and deformable bodies
and deformable body-turbulent fluid interactions. Other near term uses will be
in the simulation of the pultrusion process, in constructing a generic chassis
dynamics model and in high temperature composite material mechanics.
