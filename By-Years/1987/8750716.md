The Chemistry Department at Albion College has based its efforts in curriculum
development and the preparation of instructional materials on the premise that a
chemistry curriculum should: (1) be designed for the specific students it
serves; (2) serve majors and non-majors equally well; (3) provide maximum
flexibility; (4) reflect current practice in chemistry and chemical education at
all levels of the curriculum, both in the classroom and the laboratory. Current
laboratory practice dictates the involvement of students with modern
instrumentation, an outcome which is being enhanced by the recent acquisition of
a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This instrument is being
utilized by students in laboratory courses in organic chemistry, advanced
laboratory instrumentation, and advanced laboratory projects. In addition the
availability of the NMR broadens the range of possibilities for student research
projects.
