The gap between scientific research on the law and public consumption of that
research is wide. The findings of law and social science research are too often
inaccessible to the public, disseminated in exclusive journals and sequestered
in academic institutions. This project narrows this gap by transforming long-
form scientific research into short-form, accessible, multimedia format for
dissemination to a broad and diverse audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will create a uniquely collaborative structure by bringing legal scholars into
dialogue with professional journalists in order to identify important findings
in social science research, create multi-media products based on that research,
and disseminate the products through popular outlets. In so doing, the project
will highlight key research questions within law and social sciences, the
multiple methods used to answer those questions, the relevance of those answers
to governance and social order, the gaps in our legal scientific knowledge, and
areas where additional research would prove fruitful. The project's broad
impacts include enhancing public understanding of how law operates, improving
social science literacy, and promoting citizen engagement.
