9424252 Osgood A cooperative research involving the collaboration of Professor
Richard Osgood, a faculty member at Columbia University with a research group at
IBM - T. J. Watson Laboratory, currently directed by Tony Heinz will be
conducted. The collaboration will focus on ultrashort-pulse (i.e. femtosecond
and picosecond) laser measurements of electron-dynamics at semiconductor
surfaces and interfaces. The proposed work will allow a study of the use of
ultrashort pulse techniques required for the measurements of electron dynamics
at or near single-crystal semiconductor surfaces. The collaboration will begin
with a three-month visit of T.J. Watson Laboratory starting in March 1995, and
will use the extensive experimental facilities there (which are unique and
therefore not available at Columbia University) for ultrashort laser
measurements. The joint program will allow IBM scientists to be involved
extensively and continuously in the thesis education of several Columbia Ph.D
students. Initial experiments will involve measurements of GaAs/Ge system, with
subsequent work focusing on a study of Si/SiGe interfaces. ***
