Deaf researchers are underrepresented in sign language research. The aim of this
project is to broaden the participation of deaf individuals in disciplines that
conduct sign language research. Funding from the National Science Foundation
will be used to bring deaf college students from the U.S.A. to the Theoretical
Issues in Sign Language Research (TISLR) conference, which will be hosted in
Hamburg, Germany, during the summer of 2019, and to provide American Sign
Language interpreting services for these students while attending the
conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TISLR is the most significant and well-
attended international conference on sign language research. The students will
work with a team of mentors prior to the conference to discuss their research
interests and to prepare for presentations at the conference. The mentors will
also meet with the students during and after the conference to help them plan
their research careers. The knowledge, resources, and networks the students will
develop at TISLR will make them better equipped to pursue careers in sign
language research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
