9360816 Nelson The development of a national fiber optic communications network
has recently been proposed as an important objective of our overall
infrastructure development in order to maintain and improve U.S. competitiveness
in high technology. Optical switching will no doubt ply an important role in the
functioning of many of the most advanced aspects of this high speed network. In
this proposal, Foster-Miller presents a new approach to optically activated
switching based on the resonantly-enhanced nonlinear optical switching in rare-
earth doped fluoride fibers. Together with our team partners, Dr. Richard
Pantell, Director of the Stanford University Ginzton Laboratory and Dr. Paul
France of British Telecom Research Laboratories, we will experimentally
demonstrate during Phase I an expected order of magnitude improvement in
performance of the fluoride fiber based switch over previous experiments. We
project that with the known properties of doped fluoride fibers, we will be able
to both lower the required pump power and reduce the interaction length to
produce a compact and low power all-fiber switch. During Phase II we will
design, fabricate, test and deliver very high speed all-fiber switches for use
in optical matrix applications, optical computing and optical interconnects,
local area networks and telecommunications. ***
