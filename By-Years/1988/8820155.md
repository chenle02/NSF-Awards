This award is funded as a special project to support a workshop/conference to
develop strategies to implement the recommendations of the successful conference
"Long-Term Activities in Science and Technology for Minority Institutions," held
at Lake Arrowhead, Georgia in 1984. The theme of the Arrowhead Conference was
the development of science and technology strength in the minority community by
attacking the problem at four levels -- pre-college, undergraduate, graduate,
and increasing cooperation between HBCUs and majority universities, industry,
and private corporations. The workshop/conference is intended not only to
develop implementation strategies for the Arrowhead Report, but to expand the
report to include greater emphasis on increasing Hispanic, Native American, and
female participation in science and technology.
