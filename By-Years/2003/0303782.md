9732957 Harcum The objective of this career program is to enhance the
understanding of the stress response in recombinant Escherichia coli and to
integrate biotechnology research and education of chemical engineers. The
research portion of this proposal will use experiments to increase the basic
understanding of cellular control of proteolytic processes during recombinant
protein production. Protease activity levels will be monitored as well as the
cleavage sensitive peptide bonds determined. A model will be developed and
refined to improve the control of recombinant fermentations. This information
will have the dual benefit of reducing both fermentation and downstream
purification costs. The education portion of the program is focused towards
educating chemical engineers in biotechnology principles to meet the growing
demand for this expertise. The stress response in recombinant E. coli will be
model system for the integration of research and education for undergraduate and
graduate students. ***
