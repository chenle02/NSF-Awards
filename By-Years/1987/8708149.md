Funds are requested for the purchase of a fathometer system suitable for
installation on a small research boat. The fathometer is to be used for research
by members of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of
Colorado, Boulder. The equipment will be employed to conduct surveys of sediment
thickness and sediment stratigraphy in lakes and shallow-marine environments
prior to taking core samples of the sediments. Analysis of sediment cores from
lakes and shallow- marine locations has proven very useful in the interpretation
of global changes in climate and biosphere activity during the most recent
geological past, and such reconstructions are vital for predicting future global
climatic trends.
