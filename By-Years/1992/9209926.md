The objective of this project is to provide an experimental basis for the
various analytical/numerical solution techniques which have been developed for
radiation heat transfer in participating media. A heated enclosure filled with a
fibrous materials as the participating medium will be the test article.
Radiation issuing through a slit will be measured with a reflective optical
system designed to minimize and account for thermal noise. The experimental
results will be compared to numerical results using the discrete ordinate
method. Results with and without imbedded thermal sensors will be obtained.
