Dr. Schooley will study an enzyme, called JH-specific epoxide hydrolase (JHEH),
thought to be important in regulating juvenile hormone (JH) levels in insects.
JH levels in insects are believed to be controlled partly by the rate of hormone
degradation. A dogma has developed that the drop in JH level required for
pupation of insects including moths and butterflies is due mainly to the JH-
specific esterase. He has preliminary evidence that JHEH is at least as
important as the esterase enzyme, if not more so. He will characterize the
enzyme in live insects and in insect extracts to gain an understanding of its
importance in controlling JH level. He will do this by studying JH metabolism as
a function of development and by studying the rate of metabolism of different
kinds of JH. He will determine portions of the protein sequence of the pure,
isolated enzyme, and then isolate a molecular clone of the gene encoding the
enzyme in order to determine the complete sequence of the enzyme. He will also
test how enzyme levels are controlled by studying the levels of messenger RNA
coding for the enzyme.
