In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry
Division, Richard N. Zare will obtain quantum-state specific information on the
dynamics of elementary gas-phase chemical reactions using molecular beam and
laser spectroscopic methods. The planned experiments will provide the complete
three-dimensional velocity distribution of the reaction products as well as the
state-to-state differential reaction cross sections. Reagents will be prepared
in individual rovibronic states using tunable infrared radiation or stimulated
Raman pumping. Molecular and atomic products will be detected in specific
quantum states, enabling the observations to be compared with calculations. %%%
In order to obtain detailed information on chemical reactions, the experiments
in this project will use molecular beam techniques as a means of isolating
molecules and investigating reactive encounters one collision at a time. Laser
techniques, on the other hand, permit the reacting species to be prepared with
very specific amounts of energy and spatial orientation, and they also allow the
products to be interrogated for their energy content and orientation. Such data
enable chemists to understand how reactions occur by relating the experimental
observations with precise calculations which describe the forces experienced by
reagents and products during a chemical transformation. The interplay between
theory and experiment will eventually allow chemists to predict the products of
any chemical reaction as well as to understand how to cause a reaction to be
more efficient or yield different products.
