9314581 Watts The Synoptic Ocean Prediction Program (SYNOP) is a major
observational and modeling program funded by NSF and ONR to understand the
physics of the Gulf Stream and its variability east of Cap Hatteras to the Grand
Banks. The PIs component of SYNOP consisted in two arrays of current meter
moorings, inverted echo sounders and pressure sensors. The instruments were
recovered during August 1990. Based on the analysis of these data sets, 12
articles were published, one MS and two PhD theses completed, and another will
be completed during the Summer of 1993. This proposal request support for
scientific analysis and publication of results based on data collected during
SYNOP. *** @ CG^ CI^ CP^ CC^ CE^ CD^ CB^ CS^ CF^ CU^ CQ^ CK^ En^ Em^ El^ Er^ Ei^
