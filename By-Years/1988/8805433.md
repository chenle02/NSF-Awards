Multiple imputation technology refers to a family of techniques for dealing
with incomplete data. This innovative technology, to be perfected under the
recommended accomplishment- based renewal, will be especially useful in the
context of data bases that have been constructed at great public expense and are
to be made available to many data analysts with their arsenals of standard
statistical software. Therefore, and in addition to its importance for the
academic research community, this innovative technology has implications for
statistical endeavors undertaken by government, such as census undercount
adjustment and similar forms of compensation for deficient data (so-called
"statistical repair work"). Such work is needed more than ever before as data
collection resources shrink and missing data problems multiply owing to
financial and other restrictions. Good quality analysis is also at stake when,
as is becoming increasingly true, incompleteness pervades intensively used
scientific data from sources as far-ranging as social surveys and clinical
medical protocols.
