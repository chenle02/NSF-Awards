Abstract. This research project concerns analysis on compact extensions of
nilpotent Lie groups. One says that the action of a compact Lie group K on a
nilpotent Lie group N yields a Gelfand pair when the integrable K-invariant
functions on N commute under convolution. The investigators will continue their
study of such Gelfand pairs, in particular their study of the associated space
of spherical functions, especially when N is a Heisenberg group. Specific goals
include further development of algorithms for computing spherical functions and
their eigenvalues, study of identities for generalized binomial coefficients, a
description of the topology of the Gelfand space, and applications to questions
concerning hull minimal ideals in Schwartz spaces.

The techniques of Fourier analysis, which traces its roots to the study of
problems in heat conduction, are among the most powerful tools in the
mathematician's arsenal. An important construction in Fourier analysis is the
so-called convolution product. In the classical setting, convolution has the
important property of commutativity. That is, one can rearrange the order of the
factors in the product without affecting the result of the multiplication. There
is, however, a modern and far-reaching generalization of Fourier analysis, like
its ancestor linked to important problems in physics, in which convolution often
fails to be commutative. In many problems in this type of analysis, which is
done in the framework of objects known as "Lie groups," noncommutativity arises
quite naturally and cannot be avoided, leading to great technical difficulties.
Gelfand pairs provide a device to recover the simplicity of commutativity in
certain noncommutative settings. Each Gelfand pair provides an environment with
enough symmetry to ensure commutativity of the convolution product. Such pairs
are named in honor of the Russian mathematician I. M. Gelfand and have been
studied since the 1950s. Their usefulness is now well established in connection
with analysis in the noncommutative setting of semi-simple Lie groups. In the
past decade, it has been shown that Gelfand pairs also arise in another non-
commutative setting, that of nilpotent Lie groups. The goals of this research
concern the systematic study and mathematical analysis of this new class of
Gelfand pairs, including the development of algorithms for explicit
computations.
