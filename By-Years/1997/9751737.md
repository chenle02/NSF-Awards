The Department of Physics has had a substantial involvement in astronomy
education over the last 11 years. Faculty and students in the Physics Department
have begun a vigorous program of stellar photometry research projects that has
resulted in faculty and student papers and presentations at professional and
student meetings. Remotely-controlled and robotic astronomical observatories are
now a reality, and several are currently operating successfully. Telescopes in
these observatories are controlled via telephone lines by completely remote
operators who are, in some cases, thousands of miles away from the observatory.
Robotic or automatic telescopes can be programmed to run completely independent
of the astronomer, making numerous observations throughout the entire night. A
remotely controlled and robotic telescope is a logical extension of the previous
efforts of this institution in astronomy education and research. This facility
is a multipurpose facility, performing university teaching, teacher education,
research, and community outreach. It is also providing an avenue for the
university to begin a distance education program with area high schools. *
