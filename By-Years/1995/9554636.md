With the advent of sophisticated computer algebra systems, increased speed and
memory, and the Internet, the computer has become essential for many
mathematicians not only in their research but also in their teaching. This week
long workshop, which will be held on the DePauw University campus, will focus on
computing in the undergraduate curriculum for students studying geometry and
abstract algebra. The schedule of the workshop will include
lecture/demonstrations, hands-on workshops, short courses and informal
discussions. The staff of the workshop will include leaders in the use of
technology in these areas. A World Wide Web site will be maintained to exchange
ideas on the theme of the workshop. New course materials will be developed by
some of the participants, anticipated for initial distribution in the fall of
1997.
