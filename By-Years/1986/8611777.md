The workshop entitled "Future Propects and Applications of UV and VUV Lasers" is
being organized under the suspices of the Engineering Foundation with the
support of the Optical Society of America and the Lasers and Electro-Optics
Society (LEOS) of the IEEE, and is scheduled to be held February 22-27, 1987 in
Santa Barbara, California. The purpose of this conference was twofold: to obtain
a concensus concerning where source development efforts in the UV and VUV should
be directed; and to identify fundamental photochemical, spectroscopic and
kinetics issues that must be resolved in order to move forward.
