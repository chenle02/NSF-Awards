The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Marion Baumgardner of Purdue University and Dr. George Varallyay of the
Hungarian Research Institute of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry is to
study the spectral reflectance of soils in two distinctly different pedogenic
environments, one in the California Valley and one in the Carpathian Basin. Two
hypotheses will be tested: 1) Variations in reflectance of salt-affected soils
is related to the quantity and quality of soluble salts present, organic
constituents and their interaction; and 2) these relationships will be different
for soils from different environments. Methods will emphasize the monitoring of
change and development of prediction models. Results should contribute to our
ability to track global changes related to potential soil productivity and
environmental quality. This project in earth sciences fulfills the program
objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
