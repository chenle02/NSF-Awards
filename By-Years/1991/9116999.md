The objective of this project is the development of an object oriented database
system for supporting application programs used by scientists involved in the
rational design of therapeutic agents and studies of specific interactions in
peptides and proteins. This work is focused specifically on the data storage and
access requirements this class of applications, and is the outgrowth of one
component of a project much larger in scope entitled "Macromolecular Workbench:
Computer-Assisted Analysis of Protein Design and Function" supported by DARPA.
Specific work includes refinement of the data communications protocol used
between the Macromolecular Workbench (MMWB) data manager module and object file
access library, as well as reimplementation of the data manager in the C++
programming language in order to take advantage of the natural correspondence
between scientific data and actions performed on this data as specified in the
original MMWB data manager design. The design provides for a unified user
interface and machine independent object oriented data access. The result of
this project will have significant impact on other scientific applications
software, and therefore on the scientific community as a whole, as this software
will now be able to take advantage of a unified database system, thereby making
possible a "toolkit" of scientific software with each tool capable of
simultaneously directly manipulating common shared data.
