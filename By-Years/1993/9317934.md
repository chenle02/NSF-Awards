9317934 Samson Photoionization and double photoionization studies will be used
to elucidate the effects of electron-electron correlation and spin-orbit effects
in atoms. Of particular interest is the recent discovery that Compton electrons
can produce ionization in atoms at high energies comparable to the direct
photoionization process. Experimental measurements to unravel the details of
these processes are important for a basic understanding of atomic
photoabsorption and have pragmatic implications for plasma and astrophysical
science.
