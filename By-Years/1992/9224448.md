9224448 Rosswall NSF support is provided from funds allocated for the planning,
development and implementation of regional institutes for global change
research. The International START Secretariat will undertake a series of
scientific planning activities related to development of regional
networks/institutes for global change research in Africa. START (the
IGBP/WCRP/HDP System for Research, Analysis, and Training) will initiate
scientific workshops and planning meetings, participation of scientists from the
region in these and related activities, such as training courses for global
change research. This effort will focus on sub-regional research networks for
North Africa; Southern, Central Africa; and the Mediterranean region. This
effort will also consider linkages among these sub-regional networks and between
them and other similar regional activities in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.
