In this project the third wave of a panel survey concerning the community
orientation, culture, and engagements of three communities in the midst of
social transformations will be collected. Those surveyed are representative
samples from each community, who were interviewed in the first wave in 2011-2013
and re-interviewed in the second wave in 2015-2016. The series of observations
over time will enable assessment of the significance of personal experiences and
major events in prompting individuals to change orientations. The data that this
project collects will expand the infrastructure for the diversification of the
educational curriculum, benefit other researchers, and are useful for
instructional purposes in the classrooms. The insights provided by this project
may inform national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appropriately
modified questions from previous waves will be used for the third survey after
testing to ensure they are understood properly. Respondents from the second wave
of the survey, over 2,000 for each community, will be re-interviewed with
various measures used to minimize attrition, including use of the same
interviewers where possible. Indices will be constructed in order to examine
trends in key concepts. Fixed effects statistical models will be used to examine
causal relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
