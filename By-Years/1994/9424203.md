Dr. Louis H. Pignolet and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Minnesota are being supported to provide a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97, twenty
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional and newer areas of
chemistry, including environmentally benign synthesis. While the NSF award
supports ten students, cost-sharing by the University enables a total of 20
students to participate, at least 65% of whom are recruited nationally from
institutions other than the University of Minnesota.
