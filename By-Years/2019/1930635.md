This is an award to support travel and a Doctoral Consortium at the 2019
Educational Data Mining (EDM) Conference for up to 10 doctoral students. The
Doctoral Consortium provides a forum for mentoring and research collaborations
with EDM participants. The doctoral students will be chosen through an
application process. The selection committee will ensure that the selected
students form a diverse group with respect to interests and with attention being
paid for participation of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Doctoral Consortium is a conference within the conference where each student is
matched with a mentor. The students will share their research with their
mentors, other experienced researchers, and other students as they pitch their
research as a high-level overview. They will then get tailored advice and
research contacts that will be valuable for their
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
