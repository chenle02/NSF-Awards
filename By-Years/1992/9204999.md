The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting research by Dr. Krishnan Balasubramanian of Arizona State University
on the electronic structure of Group III-V semiconductor clusters and very heavy
main group clusters, and also on the potential energy surfaces for the reaction
of bromine or chlorine with gallium arsenides. The work employs relativistic
complete active space multi- configuration self-consistent field calculations
followed by multi-reference configuration and relativistic configuration
interaction calculations. %%% Computational studies of the heavier elements,
including some of great importance to the semiconductor industry, require the
use of relativistic quantum mechanics. This research involves such studies,
using a very high level, computationally intensive treatment. The reactions
studied are those which take part in the halogen etching of gallium arsenide
semi- conductors.
