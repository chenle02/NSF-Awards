This award will provide travel support for approximately eighteen graduate
students to attend the 2004 ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Communications
Architectures, Protocols and Applications to be held in Portland, OR, from
August 30-September 3, 2004. The travel award will target graduate students,
since attending conferences is an important part of their educational
experience, and they often have limited funds. SIGCOMM is a highly esteemed
international conference series that have endeavored to provide researchers and
professionals with a cutting-edge forum to exchange and publish their work and
ideas in computer networks and communications.
