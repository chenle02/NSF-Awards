Theoretical understandings derived from the study of industrial North Atlantic
nations may not be useful when applied to Third World settings. Argentina is an
example of a nation that has had many of the resources necessary for robust
industrial development in the twentieth century. Argentina's development process
was thwarted, however, thereby calling into question current knowledge about
processes of industrialization and regional development. This doctoral
dissertation project will examine the development of the capital-goods
industries of Mendoza, Argentina. In-depth interviews with chief executive
officers of capital-goods firms will be conducted to uncover the origins,
evolution, and current form of industrial governance systems. Information also
will be collected about the material, information, and financial linkages among
firms and local, national, and international economies. These interviews will be
validated and complemented by data gathered from existing manufacturing surveys,
public and nongovernmental industrial sector reports, economic censuses, and
information from interviews with chief executive officers from other firms
linked to the capital-goods enterprises in Mendoza province. This project will
provide valuable information about and analyses of processes of
industrialization and regional development in Third World settings. This project
also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to
continue to develop independent research skills.
