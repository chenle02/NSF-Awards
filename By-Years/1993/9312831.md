9312831 Pyle This award supports the Nansen Arctic Drilling Program Secretariat
at Joint Oceanographic Institutions Incorporated. Each of ten participating
nations is being asked to contribute to support the activities of the
Secretariat. The Nansen Arctic Drilling Program (NAD) is a major international
research effort designed to understand the geological evolution of the Arctic as
well as the history of Arctic environmental change. This knowledge will help
predict the future of the Arctic basin and its effect on global processes. NAD
is developing strategic plans for acquiring long, high-resolution sediment cores
and deep basement cores needed to understand the Cenozoic and Mesozoic
paleoceanography, paleobiology, and structural history of the Arctic region.
These cores are critical for scientists developing a comprehensive understanding
of global change. This ambitious initiative commemorates the pioneering work of
Arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen during the Fram expeditions (1893-1896). ***
