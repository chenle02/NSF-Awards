0424414&lt;br/&gt;Kuga&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
research is to develop practical microwave devices based on EAP actuators. The
PIs have conducted preliminary experiments using Flemion and the results are
very encouraging. To achieve their objective, they propose the following four
tasks. Task 1: Complete the self-assembly process to create gold electrodes on
Flemion and fabricate a practical actuator. Task 2: Develop a Flemion micro-
actuator for microwave devices and MEMS. Task 3: Complete the development of a
low-cost phase shifter for steerable antennas. Task 4: Design a practical, low-
cost phased-array antenna for satellite communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed activity is centered on new material development and device
fabrications. Because the actuator performance depends on the interface between
membrane and electrodes, the nanotechnology and self-assemble will be an
essential part of their project. In addition, the small low-power microwave
devices have tremendous applications for wireless communications. Polymer-based
microwave and optical devices are mentioned as one of the most important
technologies in the future. Although they are focusing on the microwave
applications of EAP actuators in this proposal, these actuators can be applied
for many different applications. Education and training of students are always
their primary goals.
