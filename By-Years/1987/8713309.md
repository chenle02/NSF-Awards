The present work of this group includes studies of the long- lived excited
states of negative ions-atoms with one extra bound electron hence a net negative
charge. The pattern of excited states of such ions differs significantly from
those of the neutral atoms. Their study allows an extra dimension of atomic
structure to be explored. These ions play important roles in a number of
naturally-occurring reactions, so these studies also have immediate practical
benefit. This work will be continued. New experiments will study the energies
and dissociation mechanisms of highly excited ("Rydberg") states of simple
molecules and molecular fragments. The products of dissociation will be detected
and measured, to yield information on the excited states and the breakup
mechanisms.
