The 2005-2006 special year "Analysis in Number theory" at the Centre de
Recherche en Mathematiques in Montreal will focus on two main areas: 1) The fall
semester on p-adic analysis in arithmetic geometry, specifically i) A motivated
definition of a p-adic Langlands correspondence; ii) Arithmetic intersection of
cycles and modular forms.

2) The winter semester on analytic number theory, specifically i) "Hot"
traditional areas, such as bounds for the size of L-functions, the use of higher
dimensional L-functions, and understanding the "anatomy" of integers
(distribution of prime divisors, multiplicative functions, smooth numbers,
etc.); ii) Additive Combinatorics, an exciting new subject that has already led
to several important breakthroughs (including that there are infinitely many
k-term arithmetic progressions of primes, and non-trivial bounds on very short
exponential sums). There will be a total of six workshops and two major
"schools" to introduce junior mathematicians to the key exciting themes.
Activities during the year are centered around several key participants,
particularly early career researchers who are making an enormous impact such as
Bhargava, Green, Soundararajan and Tao. In addition there will be extended
visits by more than forty active researchers. This grant will help junior US
mathematicians to take advantage of these opportunities.

Number theory, a subject often motivated by the simplest and most basic of
questions, is nevertheless breathtaking in its scope of techniques and breadth
of applications. Certain number theoretic topics are very exciting at the
moment, following some extraordinary recent breakthroughs in the understanding
of some fundamental and longstanding questions. This special year in number
theory will give more researchers the opportunity not only to learn about these
breakthroughs, but to collaborate with a wide array of number theorists from
around the globe. Of particular emphasis are the development of a "p-adic
Langlands correspondence", which will tie together far flung topics in a
surprising way, and the further development of "additive combinatorics", which
has recently led to the proof that there are infinitely many k-term arithmetic
progressions of primes,a famous old question. There will also be focus workshops
on other topics that the organizers believe are primed for significant advances.
One of these areas has seen the proof that there are gaps between primes that
are far smaller than the average, another longstanding question. This special
year gives U.S. mathematicians, especially young researchers, an unusual
opportunity to interact with a large number of the world's leading number
theorists, particularly those from Europe and Asia.
