With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Chrys Wesdemiotis, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Akron, is
studying the gas phase chemistry of radicals and charged radicals.
Neutralization-reionization mass spectrometry is employed to obtain experimental
data regarding the stabilities and unimolecular reactions of radicals related to
amino acids, peptides, and nucleobases. Focus is placed on the alteration of
stability and reaction chemistry caused by the replacement of acidic hydrogen
atoms with metal ions. The synthesis and characterization of distonic radical
cations containing a metal ion and an organic radical site are also under
investigation. These metal ion-containing (and hence, charged) radicals will be
used as templates for the investigation of free radical chemistry by tandem mass
spectrometry. Solvated charged radicals will be utilized to derive
thermochemical data about amino acid and peptide-based
radicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecules and ions containing unpaired electrons
("radicals") play central roles in many chemical and biochemical processes.
Development of a detailed understanding of the structure and reactivity of these
elusive species remains a key focus of modern chemical research. With the
support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Chrys
Wesdemiotis, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Akron, is
generating and studying radicals related to amino acids, proteins, and nucleic
acid bases. Through these studies, Professor Wesdemiotis is gaining a
fundamental understanding of the chemistry of these important species,
implicated as key intermediates in the oxidative damage of proteins and nucleic
acids.
