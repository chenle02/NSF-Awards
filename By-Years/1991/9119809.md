Frankia are N2-fixing, sporulating, gram positive, filamentous bacteria
(Actinomycetales) capable of forming root nodules on a variety of predominantly
woody perennial plants, including Alnus and Ceanothus. These actinorhizal
associations contribute significant quantities of nitrogen (50-150 Kg N ha-1
ya-1) to temperate forest ecosystems. In addition to enhancing forest
productivity via nitrogen fixation, some actinorhizal plants, such as Alnus
rubra in the Pacific Northwest, are important timber resources. Ecological
studies of Frankia in soil are in their infancy, primarily because of the
difficulty of isolating Frankia from soil and of differentiating Frankia strains
from each other and from other soil microorganisms. No Frankia have been
isolated from Ceanothus, a plant important to forest productivity in Oregon.
Even alder, from which the majority of strains have been isolated, harbors many
strains which cannot be cultured at this time. In order to assess the diversity
of Frankia in soil, it is necessary to develop efficient methods of DNA
extraction and a means of distinguishing among Frankia strains. This research
will quantify and potentially improve soil DNA extraction efficiency. It will
also develop a means of differentiating among Alnus-infective Frankia strains
based on differences in the DNA sequence of rrn gene.
