This Presidential Young Investigator award is to support research on
embryogenesis. The PI is interested in how embryonic cells change position to
arrive at the right place at the right time. She is interested in the movement
of groups of cells and of individual cells and has developed the killlifish as
an experimental model for the investigation of these migrations. In the course
of her previous studies she has demonstrated two as yet unrecognized phenomena-
active epithelial cell underlapping as a mode of movement and controlled,
geometric membrane turnover as a motive force. This research has fundamental
importance to our understanding of how complex tissues, organs and systems arise
from a few, diffuse undifferentiated cells.
