ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0117183&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will
continue the measurement of inorganic carbonate parameters (dissolved inorganic
carbon, DIC, and titration alkalinity TAlk) and include a restoration of pH and
surface dissolved (pCO2) measurement components of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series
(HOT). The continuation of one of only a handful of long-term oceanic CO2 data
sets would appear essential for assessing oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2
and informing and interpreting the interannual variability in the oceanic global
carbon cycle.&lt;br/&gt;
