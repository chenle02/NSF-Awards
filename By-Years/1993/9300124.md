The processing of large collections of heterogeneous text is addressed where
both the text lengths and the subject matter vary widely. In such circumstances,
the integrity of full documents cannot be maintained, but access needs to be
provided to individual text excerpts in accordance with specific user
requirements. This project is concerned with three main aspects relating to the
design and operations of a flexible full-text environment: the content analysis
and text indexing for heterogeneous data in unrestricted subject areas; the
generation of linked text structures of many kinds where similar text excerpts
are jointly accessible by following the text links; and the implementation of
sophisticated text utilization methods in such a structured text environment.
Corpus-based text analysis methods are under development based on sophisticated
text matching algorithms that account both for existing global vocabulary
coincidences between different texts, and for similarities in the local
environment in which the vocabulary is used. When similar words are used in
similar local contexts, the meanings are normally congruent. Hypertext
structures of relatable text excerpts must then be generated at various levels
of detail, and these linked text structures must be utilized for flexible text
traversal, and the recognition of text themes, and the automatic construction of
text abstracts and summaries. The availability of large structured text
environments will vastly improve the manipulation of collections of full text,
and open up many areas of application in text transformation and text use. ***
