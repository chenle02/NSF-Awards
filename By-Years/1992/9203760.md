The primary goal of the investigation is the development of an efficient method
for the preparation of cadinane sesquiterpenes, which comprise a growing class
of biologically-active natural products. Two different approaches, both of which
employ a stereospecific beta-lactone rearrangement as the cornerstone
transformation, will be examined, and their relative strengths assessed and
compared. Each protocol will be investigated, first with model systems, and with
particular attention to stereochemical control. The total synthesis of several
naturally-occurring, butenolide-containing cadinanes will then be attempted,
using appropriately designed starting molecules. The first route, although
longer, offers the greatest potential for unequivocal stereochemical control.
However, if the second route exhibits high stereoselectivity in the key beta-
lactone-forming step, its considerable brevity will bode well for wide
application. Both routes allow for asymmetric syntheses by using optically
enriched starting materials. %%% With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program
will support the research of Dr. T. Howard Black at Eastern Illinois University,
which is an undergraduate institution. The research will apply the beta-
lactone/gamma-lactone rearrangement of the synthesis of the cadinane class of
sesquiterpenes. This should provide a stimulating introduction and training of
undergraduate students in research, besides producing new syntheses of the
challenging cadinane class of molecules.
