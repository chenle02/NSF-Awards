Current cloud based systems enable distributed access to both information and
computational resources. In this setting, it is imperative to have secure
communication, and powerful and expensive cryptographic techniques have been
proposed to address this issue. A severely limiting factor, however, is that
these methods for securely accessing or processing data between participating
parties can result in communication overheads when processing large amounts of
data. This project focuses on the question of minimizing the communication
complexity of cryptography and explores new approaches for tackling them. This
work could lead to wider deployment of ideas in cryptography which will result
in better security and privacy for users, as well as reduced costs and
increasing security for cloud service providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal
of this project is to investigate computationally lightweight solutions whose
security can be analyzed without resorting to unproven mathematical conjectures,
and diversifying the set of conjectures that suffice for provable security to be
achieved. The project develops new techniques for low communication interactive
proofs and arguments in order to improve their efficiency, diversify the
underlying intractability assumptions, and minimize the necessary set-up
assumptions. The investigators explore the possibility of reducing the
communication complexity of secure computation protocols while avoiding the use
of expensive general-purpose tools such as fully homomorphic encryption. The
project investigates new connections between communication complexity and
cryptography by using recent results and techniques for interactive compression
towards minimizing information leakage in unconditionally secure protocols. The
results from this project could enable new technologies for secure manipulation
of big data.
