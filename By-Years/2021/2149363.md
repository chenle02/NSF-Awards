This proposed research will study how labor market opportunities and political
attitudes have changed in response to population-level schooling gains over the
last several decades, drawing on evidence from a large number of developing
countries. While several countries rapidly train a large pool of skilled
workers, they struggle to create good jobs to absorb this educated labor force.
Large fractions of low-skilled workers are underemployed, while many of the
highly skilled are unemployed and waiting for jobs. This labor market
dysfunction is puzzling to economists who have study how workers shift from low
productivity agriculture to higher productivity non-farm sectors during the
process of economic development. The research results will be helpful for both
micro- and macro-oriented research in development economics and inform policy
making to create jobs and reduce poverty. This project will contribute graduate
education, generate new data sets on education, as well as provide inputs into
education policy. The results of this research will guide educational policy as
well as the spread of democracy across the globe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research project will leverage publicly available individual-level census data
and other data sets and policy-driven variation in access to education generated
by free primary education (FPE) laws to investigate two issues: (i) does
increased education change job expectations and if so, what impact does it have
on labor market outcomes?; (ii) does education-induced increase in unemployment
lead to decrease faith in democracy? The PI develops a simple theoretical model
education, labor market outcomes beliefs in democracy, and apply difference-in-
differences (diff-and-diff) and regression discontinuity-in-differences (RD-in-
diff) techniques to generate causal evidence of the impact of additional
education on employment outcomes, and on political attitudes. The PI relies on
random variation in changes in education policies across countries and through
time for identification. Instead of cross-country analyses, the PI will provide
new understanding about labor markets in developing countries by implementing a
consistent set of research methodologies in each country, to identify the
impacts of human capital on labor markets. The results of this research will
guide educational policy making in several parts of the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
