The proposed work is in the area of geometric group theory. A motivating
question is: Given a graph of groups G with some kind of restriction on the
vertex and edge groups, what can be said about G? For example, is G a non-
trivial free product?; does G split over the integers?; what is the JSJ-
decomposition of G? A focus will be on finite graphs of finitely generated free
groups. As an indication of progress along these lines, with his graduate
student Guo-An Diao, the principal investigator has found an algorithm for
determining whether a finite graph of finitely generated free groups is a non-
trivial free product.

Topological spaces are often analyzed by cutting them open and then considering
the resulting simpler pieces. An easy example of this is that if a circle is cut
then an arc remains. Analogously, groups are often studied by cutting them open
along subgroups. Since groups may be represented as symmetries of spaces,
splittings of groups and splittings of spaces are two manifestations of the same
construction. For example, the splitting of the circle above gives a description
of the integers. One of the most exciting developments in group theory over the
past 20 years is the description by Rips-Sela of all splittings of groups over
subgroups such as the integers. Dunwoody-Sageev and Fujiwara-Papasoglu have
extended the types of splittings that can be described. The principal
investigator will explore the extent to which these descriptions can be made
algorithmically.
