The ubiquitous phenomenon of massive data (including data streams) imposes
considerable challenges in data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
About 15 years ago, terabyte datasets were still considered `ridiculous.'
However, modern datasets managed by Stanford Linear Acceleration Center (SLAC),
NASA, NSA, etc. have reached the perabyte scale or larger. Corporations such as
Amazon, Wal-Mart, Ebay, and search engine firms are also major generators and
users of massive data. The general theme of data reduction and summarization has
become an active and highly inter-disciplinary area of research. This project
proposes to develop various approximation techniques, which generate a
"fingerprint" or "sketch" of the massive data by transforming the original data.
These `sketches' are reasonably small (hence easy to store) and can provide
approximate answers which are usually good enough for practical purposes.

This proposal concerns the fundamental problems of processing/transforming
massive (possibly dynamic) data. In particular, it focuses on (A) developing
systematic fundamental tools for effective data reduction and efficient data
summarization; (B) applying these tools to improve numerical analysis,
visualization, and exploratory data analysis. Two lines of theoretically sound
techniques for data reduction and summarization will be developed and further
improved: (1) the method of stable random projections (SRP), effective in heavy-
tailed data; (2) the method of Conditional Random Sampling (CRS), mainly for
sparse data. Concrete applications of SRP and CRS will be investigated. Widely-
used basic numerical algorithms can be rewritten by taking advantage of SRP or
CRS. Popular methods/tools for exploratory data analysis will also benefit
considerably from the development of data reduction techniques.
