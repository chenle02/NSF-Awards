The Archive of Traditional Appalachian Speech (ATAS) is a long-range project to
compile in two formats (text and audio) a one-million-word corpus of vernacular
speech recorded in the 1970's and 1980's from seven areas of Appalachia, in six
states including southern West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky, Southwest Virginia,
East Tennessee, Western North Carolina, and northeast Georgia. This award will
support completion of the first comprehensive stage of ATAS. Approximately
280,000 words from fifty native speakers recorded in four of the seven areas
will be transcribed, re-audited, and proofed to ensure optimal reliability and
conformity to conventions standard in the field of corpus linguistics.
Transcriptions and associated historical information will be mounted on websites
maintained at the University of South Carolina and at East Tennessee State
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting searchable electronic corpus will
be an invaluable resource for local and family historians, linguists,
folklorists, and other scholars. ATAS will be the largest bank of easily and
publicly accessible conversational data for any regional or social variety of
American English. The transcribed recordings will represent a comprehensive
resource on the diverse lifestyles, character and experiences of rural
Appalachian Americans born around the turn of the twentieth century. This
project will help dispel negative stereotypes of the region, and for those who
live in Appalachia, it will be a valuable community asset documenting their
speech and way of life.
