This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This award establishes a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
program in Physics at Case Western Reserve University (Case). Ten students from
outside Case majoring in physics or a related field will be recruited for the
ten week summer program each year for the next three years. The program
encourages participation from students at institutions with limited research
resources and also from groups that are traditionally under-represented in
Science and Engineering. The program is designed to introduce undergraduate
students to cutting-edge research environment and to help them develop
professional skills needed to pursue advanced degrees in physics and related
areas. The REU program includes a broad selection of interdisciplinary research
projects in condensed matter physics and particle-astrophysics, for example in
the areas of nanoscale physics, electronic materials including semiconductors,
optics, biological and imaging physics, dark matter, cosmic rays and cosmic
microwave background, covering experimental, theoretical and computational
aspects. The research projects are designed specifically for undergraduates and
mentored by a faculty member. In addition to being engaged in research, the REU
students participate in weekly discussion meetings, professional skills
development workshops, a workshop on ethical issues in science research, an end-
of-the-summer poster symposium, and other professional and social networking
activities for undergraduate summer researchers hosted by the institution.

This REU Site program is funded by the Division of Materials Research in the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate of National Science Foundation.
