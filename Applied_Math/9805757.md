This project will support the participation of researchers from the United
States at the Third Americas Conference on Differential Equations and Nonlinear
Analysis to be held at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia
from September 9-13, 1998. The emphasis of this meeting will be on applications
of modern dynamical systems theory to problems in science and engineering. The
objective of the conference is to maintain and foster research interactions in
these fields between researchers from countries in the Americas. The conference
will focus on applications of nonlinear oscillations, infinite dimensional
dynamics, phase transitions, lattice dynamics, mathematical biology, and
computational dynamics. The workshop will bring together researchers from the
U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Canada, and other countries in the Americas.
The program will include invited lectures, contributed talks, and a poster
session.
