Use of database systems for non-traditional applications has prompted the
development of new transaction models whose semantics vary from the traditional
model, as well as from each other. This project is concerned with the
development of a framework for supporting various transaction models in an
extensible manner. ECA (event-condition-action) rules are defined at the system
level, in contrast to the ECA rules currently supported at the application
level. The rules apply to significant operations of a transaction and/or data
structures and are used to support both traditional and extended transaction
models. Formalization of the interaction among various transaction models allows
the use of different transaction models by different applications on the same
database management system (DBMS). The results of this project will further
enhance the use of database systems -- for new classes of applications (e.g.,
workflow and enterprise modeling) that cannot be currently supported directly by
traditional DBMSs.
