The PI's research interests are in the fields of applied immunology,
bioseparations, artificial organs, and protein science and engineering. In the
area of applied immunology, he has an interest in a variety of phenomena with
application to important issues in biotechnology and medicine. These include:
(1) studies on the structure and dynamics of antigen-antibody complexes and
their interaction with various blood-borne molecules and cells, (2) development
of novel targeting therapies with light-activatable drugs, and (3) studies of
the dynamics of activation of lymphoid cells by lymphokines. In the area of
artificial organs, the PI's current research involves development of an
artificial liver and an artificial pancreas by encapsulating pancreatic or liver
cells with semipermeable membranes. In the field of bioseparations, several; new
approaches are under investigation including: (1) affinity chromatographic
separations using electric fields and high pressure, (2) development of affinity
reversed micelles, and (3) development of electrically controlled
polyelectrolyte membrane technology. In the fields of protein science and
engineering, the PI's research interests lie in defining the phenomena that
contribute to protein stability in different environments.
