When technological change occurs, it increases the productivity of factors of
production such as labor and capital. This increase could be proportionate
across all the factors, or the productivity of one factor might increase by an
especially large multiple. In the technical language of economics, technical
change could be 'factor neutral' or it could be biased toward one factor.

The PIs use firm-level panel data to directly assess whether technological
change is biased towards labor or is factor neutral. This is important because
other economists working in industrial economics, productivity, and economic
growth have made different assumptions about the effects of technological
change. This study provides empirical evidence for these assumptions.

The research team also analyzes their data to determine how firm R&D activities
affect the speed and direction of technological change in specific firms. The
result is a more precise measure of the relationship between R&D activities and
productivity growth.

The bias of technological change influences how goods and services are produced
and shapes the evolution of individual workplaces, firms, and entire industries.
This project is a step towards understanding the sources of technological
progress and the resulting societal impact.
