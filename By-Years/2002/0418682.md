The goal of this research is to examine the mesoscale evolution of tropical
cyclones. The Principal Investigator will test two hypotheses: (1) Vertical wind
shear can aid tropical cyclone development during early growth stages. It is
suggested that the vertical wind shear excites downshear convection and spin up
with the new convection either becoming a new, stronger circulation center that
absorbs the old or the new convection is absorbed by the original vortex, which
then intensifies. (2) Intensification to hurricane strength that is sustainable
does not occur until the storm satisfies the conditions specified in a
previously developed theory known as the wind induced surface heat exchange
theory.

The PI plans to address these hypotheses via diagnostic studies using existing
data, which includes airborne data sets (both operational and research), and
information from coastal radars, lightning sensors and satellites. Case studies
will be chosen from the numerous storms that have formed near the United States
coastline in recent years.

Broader impacts fall into four categories: education, training, dissemination of
results, and external collaborations. As in prior research efforts, material
from the current research will continue to be used in both undergraduate and
graduate classes. Supported graduate students will participate in conferences
and present their results, share software with fellow students, participate in
"reading groups" in which scientific papers are discussed. Results have been and
will be published in reputable journals by both the Principal Investigator and
supported students, and seminars will be presented in various locations.
Finally, external collaborations with other university departments and with
government entities will help to make the results available to other scientists
and to the operational community.
