The computation of transport problems are especially troublesome when the
solution field contains steep gradients such as those of temperature or
concentration. When solving such problems associated with convection either
wiggly or unstable, solutions generally result when the standard finite
difference of finite element methods are applied. There are schemes that add
artificial or numerical diffusion to the computation to dampen numerical
instabilities. However, such non-physical diffusion often serves to confuse the
real damping that exists in the problem. The objective of this Engineering
Initiation project is to expand on the recent developments in higher order
schemes which are non-diffusive. In particular, the fractional step method will
be used to treat a class of convective dominated problems. The benefits of this
procedure includes accuracy and a relative increase in computational scheme will
be possible. The institutional support is adequate and the P.I. has extensive
experience on the NSF-JVNC supercomputer. I strongly recommend support.
