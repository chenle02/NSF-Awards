The thermal structure of the lithosphere block overriding a subduction zone is
complicated and diverse with surface heat flow values ranging from the highest
to the lowest regional values on the earth. The thermal characteristics of the
Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest of the United States have been
extensively studied during the last 15 years, especially as regards the
geothermal potential of the Cascade volcanic arc. As a side result of these
studies some data has been collected in the low heat flow outer arc block as
well. As the primary objective of the project these data will be used to develop
a time-dependent three-dimensional temperature model of the subduction zone and
the outer arc block. This temperature model will be used as a basis for
evaluating the mechanical characteristics of the zone as a way to investigate
the potential for large subduction zone type earthquakes and to explore the
unique setting of the Cascadia subduction as the reason that no deep focus
earthquakes are associated with the zone.
