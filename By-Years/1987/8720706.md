This award provides one-half the funds required to acquire a cryogenic
magnetometer system for paleomagnetic research in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the University of Southern California. The magnetometer system will
be used in research projects on the magnetochemical studies of rocks and rock-
forming sediments to determine the source of their paleomagnetic properties and
how these change with time. Other projects using the new system include studies
of the paleosecular variations of the earth's magnetic field during the Plio-
Pleistocene, microplate tectonic studies of displaced terranes in the
southwestern U.S., and magnetostratigraphic measurements of marine and
terrestrial sedimentation sequences.
