This Conference on Visualization in Science and Education brings together
practitioners from four sectors: scientists, cognitive psychologists, educators,
and evaluators to examine the teaching of science and the science of teaching.
All four sectors are needed to ensure that the next generation of visualization
tools are accurate (the scientists' role), convey the intended message (the
cognitive psychologists' role) and minimize barriers to learning (the educators'
role). Evaluators, the fourth sector, form the essential base for the other
three groups by determining that the student has assimilated the intended
message and evaluating whether the visualization facilitated the process. The
primary purpose of the conference is to lay the foundation for images that are
ever more effective at conveying the intended meaning. To bring participants up-
to-speed on the latest hardware and software developments, the project contains
a pre-conference Workshop. Workshop participants will be provided with hands-on
experience with cutting-edge hardware and software. Finally, to ensure a lasting
change from the newly formed collaborations, conference participants will be
invited to apply for Mini-Grants. Mini-Grants consist of modest funds that are
intended to assist with development of larger scope proposals to either create
new technology or improve existing tools for visualization to deliver on the
promise of reconceptualizing instructional delivery. In addition, a session is
planned that specifically addresses alternate learning styles, a subject that is
expected to appeal to a broad audience. As part of the Gordon Research
Conference Organization, the conference is well advertised, recruiting
participants from all members of the science research and education enterprise.
