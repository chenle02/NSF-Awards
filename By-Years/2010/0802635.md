Diffusion (or inference) geometries , provide tools for organization
of&lt;br/&gt;massive digital data sets. Like differential calculus, they are
used to&lt;br/&gt;build global inference relations between objects by combining
&lt;br/&gt;``infinitesimal" (linear) models. Harmonic analysis on such
structures&lt;br/&gt;leads to multiscale folder building paradigms leading to
powerful tools&lt;br/&gt;for functional regression and analysis of massive
complex data.&lt;br/&gt;These geometric methods provide new insights in
classical differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry enabling explicit embedding theorems
and coordinate systems for&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multiscale analytic methods lead to a
systematic analysis tool for&lt;br/&gt;seemingly unstructured data bases, and
enables the automatic generation&lt;br/&gt;of Ontologies and data induced
languages. These methods are broadly&lt;br/&gt;applicable in medical
diagnostics, in the organization and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;psychological
questionnaires, as well as in all aspects of machine&lt;br/&gt;learning from
data mining to machine vision.
