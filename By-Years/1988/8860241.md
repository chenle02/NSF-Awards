The principal investigator will conduct research into software devices for
capturing knowledge from a realtime context and converting it to an effective
computational form. The artificial neural network learning paradigm will operate
on spatiotemporal patterns and has the following characteristics: operates
continuously without ad hoc supervision; stores novel data upon a single
presentation; retains stored patterns indefinitely; makes efficient use of its
storage resources; stores patterns in a form which, upon recall, is effective in
the computation of predictive estimates and adaptive motor control signals. The
algorithm employs an entropic definition of homeostasis and implements a
generalized Kalman filter using learned environmental dynamics.
