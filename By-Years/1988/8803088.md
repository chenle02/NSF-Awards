This project is a ten-day research conference on Automorphic Forms, Shimura
Varieties, and L-Functions, to be held at the University of Michigan, July 6-16,
1988. The conference is organized by Professors James Milne and Laurent Clozel.
The aims of the conference are to review the progress in these topics during the
last ten years or so, and to discuss new problems and directions for research.
The conference will be structured around thirteen or so lecture series of from
one to four lectures each by leading experts. Some participant support will be
provided, including some support for graduate students. Automophic Forms is a
topic with deep interactions with several different branches of mathematics,
including number theory, Lie groups, algebraic geometry, and several complex
variables.
