The Dynamic Gateways for International Research (DyGIR) project will provide
well-tested, production-ready solution for scheduling dynamic circuits on IRNC
ProNet infrastructure. DyGIR will help IRNC ProNet projects meet the
requirements of the IRNC solicitation to provide production hybrid network
services including dynamic circuit services and to do so in a way that is
interoperable with emerging production dynamic switching network services in the
US (e.g. ESnet, Internet2) and in other countries (e.g. GÃ‰ANT3,
JGN2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DyGIR will advance the state of the art of dynamic
circuit networking in support of international science and engineering by
developing new functionality, particularly for international exchange points -
critical pieces of the overall global R&amp;E network
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the DyGIR project for
the international science and engineering research community will be
significant. DyGIR will increase the opportunity for scientific collaboration
between distributed research efforts by enabling the predictable network
performance required to effectively share large data sets. DyGIR will also
enable these collaborators to schedule their use of the network, permitting the
sharing of costly network resources between institutions and scientific
disciplines.
