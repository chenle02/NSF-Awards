Analysis of output for a computer simulation of the North Atlantic Ocean will
be performed. Circulation of the equatorial system, a T-S volumetric census, and
the suitability of boundary conditions at the northern and southern ends will be
investigated. The WOCE Community Effort eddy-resolving numerical model provides
the information for analysis.
