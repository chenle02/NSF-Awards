9319827 Van Olst The striped bass aquaculture industry currently is dependent on
springtime capture and spawning of wild fish for fry production and subsequent
pond culture of fingerlings. Determination of the biological requirements needed
to spawn domesticated striped bass year-round and to raise fingerlings in
intensive tank culture systems is a key issue to the expansion of the striped
bass culture industry. The proposed research will focus on 1) defining the
biological cures of photoperiod, temperature, and hormonal treatments needed to
induce spawning in adult broodstock, and 2) developing the techniques necessary
to raise striped bass from fry to fingerling stage in tanks without using ponds.
