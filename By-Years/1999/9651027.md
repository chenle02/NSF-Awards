A recently established goal of this chemistry program is to incorporate open-
ended discovery-based project laboratories throughout the chemistry curriculum
from the freshman- to senior-year. In these labs, students can choose an area to
investigate, pose a problem, and carry out experiments to address the problem.
Students not only learn a lot of experimental techniques during these multiweek
labs, but they are also required to learn concepts needed to understand the
topic they choose to investigate. The primary objective of this project is to
reach this goal of having project labs in every course beyond the first semester
of the freshman year by providing an instrument that could be used in several
such courses. The department is making use of an Atomic Absorption (AA)
Spectrophotometer with both a conventional burner and a Heated Graphite Furnace.
Instrumentation is already available for students to undertake project-based
labs in Organic and Physical Chemistry. An AA is the one additional instrument
needed to open up many areas of investigation for Introduction to Analytical
Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Environmental Chemistry. The AA is a
useful tool for freshmen because it is easy to operate and to understand;
whereas instruments such as the Fourier-transform-nuclear magnetic resonance,
Fourier-transform infrared, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometers are
usually reserved for students who have had or are taking Organic Chemistry.
There are many open-ended experiments that can be carried out with the use of an
AA. The AA can also be used in undergraduate research and with special groups
such as the Math/Science Upward Bound students. The addition of an AA enhances
the courses offered and makes it possible to do project-based labs across the
curricula.
