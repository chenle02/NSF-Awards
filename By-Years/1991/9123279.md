This proposed program aims to study several classes of ceramics and ceramic
matrix composites, representing materials with different mechanisms of
toughening. The objective is to discover why and how fatigue cracks grow in
monolithic ceramics where toughening is induced by crack deflection and/or grain
bridging, such as in coarse and fine grained Al2O3 and grain-elongated Si3N4.
Other materials include the transformation and microcrack toughened ceramics
such as PSZ and ZTA, the brittle fiber or whisker reinforced ceramic matrix
composites such as SiC-whisker reinforced alumina, and the ductile-phase
toughened ceramic matrix composites such as Al-toughened alumina. Fatigue tests,
together with microstructural characterization of the degradation of the crack-
tip shielding (toughening) mechanisms behind the crack tip and accumulated
microstructural damage ahead of the tip, will be used to study the
micromechanism of cyclic crack-growth in these materials. %%%% This research is
designed to seek a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which ceramics
suffer cyclic fatigue failure. A number of ceramic materials, representing
materials with different mechanisms of toughening, will be used for this study.
Microstructural characterizations together with fatigue tests are used to study
the micromechanisms of cyclic crack-growth in these materials.
