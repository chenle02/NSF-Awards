9317898 Zuiderweg This proposal is a request for funds to purchase a new radio-
frequency console, probes and accessories for an existing older 500 MHz NMR
spectrometer. The upgraded system, which is actually on loan at the University
of Michigan now, provides state-of-the-art multi-dimensional multi-nuclear
magnetic resonance support for research supported faculty in the Biophysics
Research Division and the Department of Biological Chemistry at the University
of Michigan. The faculty involved is generally researching biological systems of
molecular size exceeding 15 kDa. Because of this size, NMR support for their
research will exclusively rely on advanced and time-consuming experiments in
two, three and four dimensions involving up to four nuclei simultaneously with
isotopically enriched materials, necessitating the upgrade. The purchase of the
upgraded instrument will immediately benefit the research of seven faculty who
hold a total of 16 active federally-sponsored research grants, one institutional
training grant and two pending grants. Specific projects are: NMR structure
determination of stromelysin catalytic domain NMR studies of Yersinia
Phosphatase in Solution Determination of a high-resolution solution structure of
T4-lysozyme by Multi-dimensional NMR NMR studies of the structures of catalytic
RNA subdomains Studies of the interaction of a2 adrenergic receptor peptides
with G-protein subtypes Electron Transfer and conformational gating in
Flavodoxins: NMR analysis of E. coli Flavodoxin Methodology development in
multi-nuclear multi- dimensional NMR
