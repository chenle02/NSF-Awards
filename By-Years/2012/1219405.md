This summer, during July 23-27, 2012, there will be a workshop entitled
``Spectral invariants on non-compact and singular spaces" held at the Centre de
Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) in Montreal, Canada. Important examples of
spectral invariants are given by the index of an elliptic operator, the
determinant of the Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold, the eta invariant (or
spectral asymmetry) of a self-adjoint elliptic operator, and the analytic
torsion. On non-compact or singular manifolds, the very definition of spectral
invariants is much more delicate. The workshop will highlight recent
developments and new research directions in spectral geometry in singular
contexts (e.g., spectral invariants in the presence of cusps and edges,
scattering theory for asymptotically regular non-compact geometries,
applications to moduli spaces and geometric structures, etc.).

This award provides funding to defray the expenses of U.S. participants at this
conference. The expected participants represent a balanced mixture of senior and
junior researchers and include some of the most renowned experts on spectral
invariants. This is a very active field with many recent developments, and this
workshop will provide an important forum to advertise the state-of-the-art and
an excellent opportunity for collaboration. The webpage for the conference can
