The Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET) department of the
Southern College of Technology is developing a Local Area Network (LAN)
laboratory to support a new Local Area Networks course. Southern Tech realizes
the impact networking has on the world today and is striving to educate and
prepare undergraduates for work in this growing communications era. With the
help of a grant from the National Science Foundation, the ECET LAN laboratory is
giving students hands-on experience with state of the art communications
equipment. The lab consists of (1) various network configurations, e.g. Ethernet
and Token Ring with Novell and IBM network operating systems, (2) a variety of
transmission media, e.g., coax, twisted pair, and fiber optic cabling, (3)
network analysis tools that have the ability to monitor signals, examine
protocols and simulate network traffic, (4) a LAN simulation package used to
analyze designed networks and optimize performance, and (5) a gateway to X.25,
the long haul environment, with access to DSO up to T3 lines. The students are
designing, installing, and testing various LAN configurations and preparing to
configure a company-wide local area network. This hands on education gained in
the laboratory is preparing Southern Tech Electrical and Computer Engineering
Technology graduates to contribute immediately to today's communications
industry.
