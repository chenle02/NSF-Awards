Archaeological investigations will be undertaken in a prehistorically densely
populated area of southwestern Colorado. Two large 13th century Anasazi sites
will be surveyed to look at the development of the settlement system and the
relationship of the sites to the environment. This project will examine the role
of local and regional interaction networks as a society's response to increasing
social and environmental stresses. The researcher will test the idea that social
networks become localized and more circumscribed and that a group of people use
a smaller area when stresses increase. Larger area networks will be replaced by
increases in trade in nonessential goods. In addition to providing new
information on the Colorado Plateau, this research will help us understand the
variety of responses humans use in order to buffer themselves against
uncertainty, risk, and environmental and social change. This research has
relevance in helping us understand how societies respond to environmental
stress.
