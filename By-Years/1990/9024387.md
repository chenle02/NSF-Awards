Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) provides the capability to obtain information
in a nondestructive mode on the elastic properties of materials at a resolution
comparable to that of high magnification optical microscopy. SAM also permits
such studies in materials opaque to light, thus allowing studies of sub-surface
as well as surface properties. Structure-property measurements at high
resolution are important in attempting to understand the distribution of local
inhomogeneities, both surface and sub-surface, on bone properties. SAM is also
important to improve the understanding of the effects of implants at bone-
implant interfaces. Finite element analyses (FEA) are being used by many people
in their attempts to design new implant prostheses, and data obtained by SAM are
expected to dramatically improve such design calculations.
