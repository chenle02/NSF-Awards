Modern synchrotron x-ray scattering techniques will be employed and evolving
structures found in novel condensed matter systems. The ultimate goal of this
research program is to extend our "first principles" understanding of
statistical and solid state phenomena to the realm of inhomogeneous, non-
equilibrium systems.
