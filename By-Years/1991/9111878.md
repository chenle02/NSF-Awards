This project involves the conceptual formulation, design, fabrication, and
testing of a wave-driven artificial upwelling device that can draw nutrient-rich
deep ocean water (DOW) to the ocean surface as a precursor to commercially-
viable, open-ocean mariculture. The device will ba a 1:20 scale model of the
prototype that will eventually be constructed and deployed in the open ocean in
subsequent research and development efforts. This project is part of a larger
research effort of the University of Hawaii, the ultimate goal of which is to
develop the technology for open ocean mariculture. The research task of this
project will be conducted in three phases. The first phase includes the design
of hydraulic experiments and the construction of the hydraulic model. A
laboratory-scale, wave-driven artificial upwelling device will be designed and
fabricated at the University of Hawaii's Look Laboratory. Wave energy conversion
theories will be examined, and modifications of existing formulas may be made to
make them compatible with the special physical environment conditions related to
artificial upwelling. A series of hydraulic modeling experiments will then be
designed based on theoretical derivation to investigate the upwelling depths and
flow rates as functions of various design parameters. The second phase covers
the actual hydraulic modeling experiments. In this phase, the calibration of the
hydraulic model and instrumentation will first be conducted to test the
hydrodynamic performance of the device and make necessary modifications to the
original design. The final phase is the analysis of experimental data and the
design of a prototype wave-driven artificial upwelling device. Experimental data
will be analyzed and compared with the theoretical results.
