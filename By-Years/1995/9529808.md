9529808 Melville Funding is provided to the Marine Physical Laboratory at
Scripps Institution of Oceanography to develop and test instrumentation for
measuring entrained air and bubble size distributions in the ocean surface layer
beneath breaking waves. Bubbles in the ocean surface layer play an important
role in air-gas transfer, in the generation of aerosols, in biological
processes, and in the acoustics of the surface layer. Laboratory data and
preliminary field data suggest that air entrained by breaking waves may be
dynamically significant through the work done against buoyant forces. The
instrument will be a broad band (2kHz -200kHz) system for in situ measurements
of the bubble size distribution in the surface layer by inverting direct
measurements of sound speed and attenuation over path lengths of 0.1 - 1m. The
research will be split into two phases, a laboratory development and testing
phase, followed by a field instrument and testing phase.
