Many of the precambrian shields or cratons are transgressed by "mobile belts"
that have been the loci of deformation and metamorphism subsequent to craton
formation. These belts are generally consistent with an origin by plate
collision at former plate margins, however, the style and relative displacements
associated with these collisions are not well constrained. This renewal will
continue a paleomagnetic and Ar/Ar age dating program from rock units on
opposite sides of the Brasilian mobile belt. Results, combined with existing
data from the extension of the Brazilian belt in west Africa, the Pharusian
belt, will allow assessment of the displacement and timing associated with a
possible late Proterozoic continental collision.
