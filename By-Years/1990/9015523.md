This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Professor
Jeremy Teitelbaum of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Dr. Teitelbaum will
pursue his studies of the geometry and arithmetic of the p-adic upper half
plane, guided by the Exceptional Zero Conjecture, which relates the values of
certain functions, namely p-adic L-functions, to the analytic geometry of
certain curves. In addition, he will continue his study of the computational
complexity of algorithms from algebraic geometry. Arithmetic algebraic geometry
is a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number
theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as divisibility
of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have
in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past quarter
century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic
algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is
having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.
