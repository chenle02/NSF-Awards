Abstract

Award: DMS-0636646 Principal Investigator: Ezra Getzler, Boris Tsygan, Eric
Zaslow

Modern mathematical physics increasingly draws its techniques from a broad array
of mathematical disciplines. Differential geometry plays a vital role in the
study of quantum field theory through index theory, microlocal analysis, and
mirror symmetry. Homotopy theory has become an essential tool in the study of
geometry and physics, through the tools of A-infinity categories and derived
categories. Representation theory and number theory have been developing links
with conformal field theory through analogies between the Langlands program and
the geometric Langlands program. Northwestern University is fortunate to have on
its faculty world leaders in each of these directions of research. It is the
ambition of this group to attain national leadership in training students and
postdoctoral researchers in these fields.

The physical world writes its laws in the language of mathematics, and progress
in physics is intimately connected to progress in the development of
mathematical methods and theories. In contemporary mathematical physics,
geometry, in many different forms, and representation theory (the study of
symmetry) play a central role. The mathematical physics group at Northwestern is
particularly well-placed to attain its goal of increasing the number of US
citizens who pursue careers in mathematical physics: the university attracts a
particularly strong group of undergraduates (through its renowned Integrated
Science Program, for example); the graduate program has become more selective;
and the mathematics department has developed a postdoctoral program, which has
been consistently successful at attracting women and has consistently placed
postdocs in successful academic positions.
