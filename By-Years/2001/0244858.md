A long-term goal at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is to increase
the number, participation and leadership status of women in academic science and
engineering through institutional transformation. Fundamental to this goal is
the commitment and active participation of UIC administration at the highest
level, leaders working closely with faculty and staff to create and actualize
individual departmental programs in the eleven disciplinary areas of science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The practices to be developed
for these disciplines will have broader use and implications across campus.
Under this award, UIC will focus its energies on instituting practices in the
STEM disciplines to promote gender equity and leadership with a special focus on
increasing the recruitment, promotion and tenure, and retention rates of STEM
women faculty and advancing them into leadership positions. This will be done
through the training and efforts of dedicated faculty facilitators in each of
the disciplines. In addition, current efforts to improve networking, mentoring,
and evaluating support services for women in STEM disciplines will be augmented.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The
goal of the ADVANCE program is to increase the participation of women in the
scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and
advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. To meet this
goal, the ADVANCE program provides award opportunities for both individuals and
organizations and seeks to support new approaches to improving the climate for
women in U.S. academic institutions and to facilitate women's advancement to the
highest ranks of academic leadership.&lt;br/&gt;
