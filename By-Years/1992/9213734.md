Research will be concerned with theoretical elementary particle physics. From
particle accelerators a great deal has been learned about the fundamental
behavior of the quarks that compose protons even though the quarks have never
escaped from protons. However, calculations show that at extremely high
temperatures (1010 times room temperature) and extremely high densities (1015
times normal), protons will melt into a fluid composed of unconfined quarks.
These conditions occurred in the very early universe and will be recreated in
accelerators now being built to collide heavy nucleii. This project is intended
to help develop reliable methods for calculating the behavior of quarks and
gluons under these extreme conditions. This is important to our efforts to
achieve an understanding of the early universe and of the behavior of nuclear
matter at high temperatures and densities.
