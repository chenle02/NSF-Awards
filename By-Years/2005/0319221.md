This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to focus
on the development of a biosensor for the rapid and reliable field detection of
pathogenic organisms. This biosensor will couple the sensitivity and specificity
of DNA hybridization with direct electronic detection. The biosensor consists of
a microchip with oligonucleotide probes attached to paired electrodes.
Preliminary research has shown that DNA will specifically hybridize to the
probes forming DNA bridges, which link the electrodes. The focus of this
proposal is to assess palladium-catalyzed nickel chemistry as a method of making
these DNA bridges conductive so that they can be detected electronically. This
biosensor is fundamentally different from all other technologies currently
available and will provide significant improvements in sensitivity, speed,
portability, ease-of-use, and cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial commercial
applications of this project will be in the areas of public safety and bio-
defense (i.e. for detection of biowarfare pathogens such as anthrax). Later
versions of the device will be targeted towards applications in clinical
diagnostics. &lt;br/&gt;
