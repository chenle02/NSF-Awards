This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Carnegie Mellon University for the
renovation and repair of the Mellon Institute Building which houses the research
and research training activities of the Chemistry Department. This building was
constructed in 1933 and last renovated in 1937. The ARFMP grant of $1,600,000
and $1,600,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize
these research and research training facilities. This project will address the
need to improve the current research infrastructure by upgrading all building
services and providing adequate fume hoods so that the facilities will meet
current health and safety standards and will be compatible with the use of
modern research equipment and procedures. The renovated facilities will increase
the quantity and quality of research conducted in a wide range of important
areas, including polymer and materials sciences, biological chemistry, and
nuclear and theoretical chemistry. This award contributes to the infrastructure
of science by providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and
for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students. The Chemistry
Department at Carnegie Mellon University explicitly recognizes that faculty
research, graduate student research and education, and undergraduate research
training and education form a cohesive whole in a strong department and,
conducted accordingly, can make a particularly significant contribution to the
future of our nation's science.
