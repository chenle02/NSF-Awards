Computational methods complement experimental and theoretical methods as a means
for advancing chemical knowledge. Therefore, it is essential that the
undergraduate chemistry curriculum include a meaningful computational component.
In general chemistry, students are using software packages to enhance their
understanding of microscopic properties and the relationship between microscopic
and macroscopic properties. In an introductory computational chemistry course,
students are being exposed to different computational methods and the practical
applications of electronic structure methods. In organic chemistry, these skills
are being applied to studies of the relationship between reactivity and
electronic structure. The spectroscopic applications of computational methods
are being emphasized in physical chemistry, while students in inorganic and
biochemistry courses are undertaking more complex, multifaceted projects
involving structural predictions based on DFT-gradient optimizations, crystal
structure visualizations, and drug binding affinity to active sites.
