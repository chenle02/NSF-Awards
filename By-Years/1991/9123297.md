The objective is a two-way coupling pseudo-spectral method for the direct
numerical simulation of turbulent flow of suspensions near a wall. A particle
following Lagrangian - Eulerian approach will be adopted. The particle effect
will be introduced by a combined two-step successive computational. In the first
step, the fluid flow field will be simulated, and then the flow about each
particle. The results will be compared to two-phase flow visualization results
in a boundary layer. The computer program can handle a large number of particles
within a turbulent field. The proposed direct numerical simulation may lead to
an improved understanding of the two-phase flow microstructure, as well as
provide different statistics on two-phase flow useful for the constitutive
relationships in the averaged flow equations.
