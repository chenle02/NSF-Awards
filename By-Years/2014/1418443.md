This project examines traditional methods of processing and preserving Arctic
subsistence food products through the means of aging and fermentation. In
collaboration with resident experts of the Bering Strait region, the project
team will conduct ethnographic fieldwork and develop a systemic framework for
understanding the role of fermentation in Arctic societies and the multiple
factors that affect the methods and processes of fermentation. Among those
factors are interactions of the built environment and physical geography,
household dynamics, and generational perspectives on diet and health.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project involves utilizing
the novel approach of exploring fermentation as a domain of local ecological
knowledge. The project will advance research on the relationships between Arctic
food preparation practices, public health, housing, and social/environmental
conditions. This study will contribute to the momentum of the emergent interest
in infrastructure within Arctic scholarship and across several fields of
engineering and science. Broader impacts include student training and public
outreach, and insights that may inform the development of architectural designs,
construction materials, and community planning that function in greater cohesion
with the cultural needs of the Arctic societies.
