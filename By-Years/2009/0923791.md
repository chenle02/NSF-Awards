Understanding human evolution requires reconstructing the past and identifying
the adaptive basis of primate traits. How can this be achieved for behavior,
culture, life history, and other traits that lack a clear fossil record? The
development of computer generated tree-based comparative methods has provided
new insights to our evolutionary past, and advances in the last five years have
greatly improved the statistical rigor of comparative studies. The proposed
research will develop training opportunities and analysis tools to make
phylogenetic comparative approaches more readily available to biological
anthropologists. These resources will include a new evolutionary tree of
primates that can be used to control for phylogenetic uncertainty and a freely
available database on primate behavioral and ecological traits. The principal
investigator also will apply the methods to investigate a fundamental hypothesis
in primate ecology, namely that sociality increases parasite risk. In addition
to providing new insights to primate social evolution, the goal is to
demonstrate the methods, investigate their value relative to previous
approaches, and exhibit the data and analysis resources developed in this
proposal. The broader impacts will involve two major educational activities.
First, a major outcome of this work will be a yearly Workshop on Comparative
Methods in Evolutionary Anthropology to provide training for graduate students,
postdoctoral researchers and faculty. Each workshop will include three invited
instructors from evolutionary biology and biological anthropology. In addition
to teaching the methods, the workshop will create a network of researchers
interested in applying comparative approaches to questions in biological
anthropology. Second, in each year of funding a Harvard graduate student will
collaborate with the PI on one of three predictions related to the hypothesis
that sociality increases parasite risk. This will provide hands-on training in
statistics, phylogenetics and scientific writing for the graduate student.
