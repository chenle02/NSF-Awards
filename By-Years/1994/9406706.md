9406706 Byers The focus of this research is the development of new carbon-carbon
bond forming reactions using free-radicals generated from organoselenides. Due
to the specific reactivity of the phenyl selenide group, this methodology will
be utilized to synthesize several important classes of organic compounds such as
the amino acids, the butanolides, and the tetronic acids. With this Renewal RUI
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jeffrey
H. Byers of the Department of Chemistry of Middlebury College. Professor Byers
will focus his research on development of new carbon-carbon bond forming
reactions, one of the most important classes of reactions in organic chemistry,
using free-radicals generated from organoselenides.
