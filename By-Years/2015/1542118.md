Synthetic biology holds great promise as a scientific discipline that can answer
fundamental biological questions as well as contribute to many practical
applications. A key obstacle for this field is the concern about escape of an
engineered organism into the environment. To address this and other concerns,
this research consortium that engages researchers in the US, UK, France and
Spain will engineer an independently replicating element (called an episome,
which is not integrated into the DNA of the host cell) that consists of non-
natural nucleic acids. These episomes will have genetic material based on TNA
(threose-based nucleic acid) along with a system that replicates and expresses
proteins from the episome. An autonomous TNA-based episome could not be
propagated in nature (outside the laboratory) because TNA precursors do not
occur naturally. The consortium of investigators each will develop specific
components to be incorporated into the TNA episome, which will be transferred
into a bacterial host. The research project, while high risk, is anticipated to
generate high impacts in terms of providing enabling technologies to advance a
synthetic biology-inspired bioeconomy. It will also generate insights into the
evolution of genetic material. The training potential of this project is
exceptional in that the students and junior researchers will gain valuable
transdisciplinary and international training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
this project is to re-structure the central dogma of molecular biology by
developing an all-TNA episome based on bacteriophage Phi29 that can replicate in
vitro and eventually inside living cells using an orthogonal cellular machinery
engineered for this purpose. The engineered system will store protein-coding
information in TNA polymers that will replicate independently of the cellular
genome. The TNA coding information will be transcribed by an evolved RNA
polymerase that can recognize the TNA template and produce natural messenger
RNAs for translation into functional proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is funded through a transnational funding mechanism between the United States
National Science Foundation and European Funding Agencies that are part of the
European Commission endorsed Research Area Network in Synthetic Biology. The
United States component of this project is co-funded by programs in Systems and
Synthetic Biology (Directorate for Biological Sciences) and Biotechnology and
Biochemical Bioengineering (Directorate for Engineering).
