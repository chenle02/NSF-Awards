COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Calibrating the Cryogenian in the
Yukon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Francis MacDonald.1148499, Harvard University;

University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Snowball Earth hypothesis
has galvanized broad interest in Neoproterozoic geology; however, the hypothesis
remains controversial largely due to uncertainty about the timing, duration, and
initiation mechanism of global glaciation. With previous and preliminary
studies, we have demonstrated that the age of Sturtian glacial deposits in the
Yukon is indistinguishable from the age of the Franklin large igneous province
(LIP), which was emplaced on the eastern margin of Laurentia, in the tropics, in
an ideal position for being chemically weathered. This is intriguing, because
basalt is more weatherable than average continental crust, and it has been
proposed that Snowball Earth events were initiated by an increase in
weatherbility and a concomitant increase in CO2 consumption. However, the age
range and error bars on the Franklin LIP are still too large to determine if the
volcanism was long- or short-lived, and if the glaciation occurred during,
before or after the main pulse of volcanism. With the proposed research PIs
intend to constrain the timing and duration of the Sturtian glaciation and the
Franklin LIP in the Yukon with high resolution U-Pb ID-TIMS dating of magmatic
zircons and LA-ICPMS dating of detrital zircons that bracket the glacial
deposits.
