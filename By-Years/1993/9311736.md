This Engineering Faculty Internship is a collaborative effort between the
University and an industrial partner. It will result in a computer system that
will provide human-machine integration within the production environment. The
system, will use standard statistical process control methods for quality
assurance plus Bayesian Analysis and will integrate the entire manufacturing
facility under a user-friendly, multi-user, custom-made, data- base. This
project has the potential to greatly enhance the quality assurance effort of the
corporation. //
