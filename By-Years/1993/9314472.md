9314472 Reed This award is a renewal to a previous grant to permit analysis of
seismic data collected in 1990 off Taiwan. The region is being studied as a
typical example of collision between an island arc and a continent. Analysis of
the seismic data will address questions concerning the structure and tectonic
processes involved in the collision, and how those compare with processes in
nearby areas of subduction. The results will have implications for the
understanding of earthquakes in Taiwan.
