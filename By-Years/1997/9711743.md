ABSTRACT EEC-9711743 University of Minnesota "Connecting Laboratory and
Conceptual/Theoretical Components of Undergraduate Core Engineering Courses" D.
Fennel Evans, PI and Karl Smith and Vaughan Voller, Co-PI This award funds the
Engineering Research Center at the University of Minnesota entitled the Center
for Interfacial Engineering to develop computer based instructional materials
for use in core undergraduate courses in transport phenomena. These materials
will include basic content modules in fluid flow and heat transfer and
interactive fluid flow and heat transfer laboratory simulations. These
simulations will allow students to assemble and conduct their own experiments.
Examples will be drawn from the Center's systems level research and industrial
applications, e.g., a coating flow machine, polymer impregnation, atomization
processes, industrial water purification and waste treatment system, reactive
blending of immisible polymer systems, and production of polyurethane foams.
Materials will be produced on CD-ROM and the World Wide Web. Distribution will
be enhanced by accompanying teaching guides and supporting workshops for
engineering faculty.
