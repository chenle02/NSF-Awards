A Bayesian statistical approach and size-exclusion DNA microarray
experimentation, which complement each other, will be developed to achieve the
complete mapping of operons. With the precise operon structures determined, the
regulational analysis can accurately address the regulation on each mRNA
species. This project addresses the fundamental issue of deducing regulatory
circuitry at the genomic scale. It is one of the early attempts for combining
prior mechanistic knowledge with large amounts of DNA microarray data. The
project also attempts to represent the genome-wide regulation features by a
smaller subset of regulatory proteins.
