The project aims at developing geometric methods to solve a variety of
&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;problems regarding various combinatorial
structures. The problems &lt;br/&gt;include&lt;br/&gt;enumeration of lattice
points in certain sets (such as sets defined by &lt;br/&gt;formulas of
Presburger arithmetic), asymptotic counting of &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial
structures of a&lt;br/&gt;given type (such as bases in matroids), and
understanding metric and &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial properties of some universal
convex bodies (such as the &lt;br/&gt;convex cone of non-negative multivariate
polynomials). The proposed &lt;br/&gt;approaches include developing
computationally efficient techniques of &lt;br/&gt;working with multivariate
rational functions, understanding properties &lt;br/&gt;of very large finite
metric spaces, and applying methods&lt;br/&gt;from convex
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In combinatorics, we are interested in working
with finite, although &lt;br/&gt;very large, sets,&lt;br/&gt;where methods of
classical analysis often fail because the main objects &lt;br/&gt;are no
longer&lt;br/&gt;smooth but discrete. The project aims at developing efficient
&lt;br/&gt;computational methods&lt;br/&gt;for some previously intractable
problems dealing with exact or &lt;br/&gt;approximate&lt;br/&gt;enumeration in
very large sets and finding maximum (minimum) of &lt;br/&gt;functions
defined&lt;br/&gt;on large sets. Many of the considered problems are of interest
to &lt;br/&gt;statistics, physics&lt;br/&gt;and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;
