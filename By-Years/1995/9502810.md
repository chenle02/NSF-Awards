ABSTRACT Denis Wirtz This work is aimed at studying a variety of issues
associated with magneto-rheological fluids. Such fluids are analogous to the
more widely studied electro-rheological fluids which undergo dramatic changes in
their viscous properties when and electric field is applied. Many applications
have been proposed for such materials, such as clutches and shock absorbers. The
principal aim of this work is to study the microstructure evolution when
magnetic field is applied and also when both a magnetic and a shear field is
applied. Video microscopy and small angle light scattering will be used to probe
the microstructure.
