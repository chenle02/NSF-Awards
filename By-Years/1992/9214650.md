Climate modeling research has shown that the polar regions of the global
climate system are the most sensitive to climatic perturbations. Therefore, it
is felt that global climate change will first be evident in those regions of the
Earth. In this research program the results of an experiment with a modified
version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (GENESIS/CCM1) that includes sea
ice, leads and sea ice transport, will be used to determine the sensitivity of
the climate to sea ice variations, and to identify variables that, through
monitoring, could provide an early warning of global climate change. In this
project an analysis of the results of experiments with the GENESIS/CCM1 will be
used 1) to determine if the mechanisms of climate change identified in the
previous model studies the CCSI model Study occur in the more complex modeled
system, 2) to determine the impact of sea ice on the energy and moisture fluxes
at the ocean-atmosphere interface and their effect on climate both globally and
regionally, and 3) to examine the possibility that the monitoring of variables
associated with sea ice, including lead fraction, snowfall, temperatures, and
energy and moisture fluxes, could help provide a prediction of future global
climate change.
