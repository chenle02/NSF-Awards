Equipment will be acquired for a standard compression test frame with the
following features: 600 K compression capacity, closed-loop load and strain
control capability, hydraulic actuator, digital function generator, 70 gpm
hydraulic power supply, and electronic controllers and x-y recorder. The
research for which this equipment is primarily intended deals with high
strength, high performance fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (concrete,
mortar, slurry paste). High strength implies a ductility (or toughness) one to
two orders of magnitude larger than that of the unreinforced matrix. The main
objective of this research is to understand the fiber reinforcing mechanisms of
these composites and develop constitutive models to predict their stress-strain
response under monotonic and cyclic loadings. The experimental program
necessitates the use of a large capacity (600 kips) compression testing machine
with feedback control capablity.
