The purpose of this research is to develop an Artificial Intelligence model
which will predict the occurrence of task related injuries. Proven ergonomic
principles will be incorporated into the knowledge base of the expert system.
The goal of the system is to provide assistance in employee placement, reducing
task related injury, and improving workplace conditions. The expert system will
use fuzzy set theory to make decisions about the level of risk associated with a
particular individual and/or task. The three components of input required are
personal characteristics, workplace conditions, and environmental factors.
