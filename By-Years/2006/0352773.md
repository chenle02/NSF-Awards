Between high silica glasses and normal glasses such as soda-lime glasses, there
should be special glasses having a fictive temperature-independent specific
volume. These glasses would exhibit no changes in volume, density, refractive
index, ionic diffusion, electric conductivity, bulk modulus and hardness during
the heat-treatment. It is the objective of the proposed research to produce such
glasses and investigate their unique properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
glasses to be developed in the proposed research would be useful in producing
the non-shrinkage flat panel displays needed for large flat TVs and computers.
They would also be useful in clarifying the mechanisms of strengthening of
glasses and radiation damage of glasses.&lt;br/&gt;
