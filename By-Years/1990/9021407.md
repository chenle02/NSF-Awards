The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a multisubunit protein with an integral
ion channel. The binding of acetylcholine to its receptor site, on excitable
membranes of nerve and muscle cells, causes the ion channel to open, allowing
small cations to enter the cell. As a result of cation entry, the cell membrane
becomes depolarized. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has a number of
binding sites for ligands that regulate the receptor's function. The purpose of
this research project is to understand the molecular events that occur during
channel activation, by studying the relationship between the structure and
dynamics of acetylcholine-like molecules, known as agonists, and the specific
steps leading to the opening of the ion channel. Experiments utilizing
radioligand binding, electrophysiological recording, nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and computational chemistry techniques will be performed to study
the detailed molecular interactions between agonists and receptor. Because the
acetylcholine receptors and number of structurally related ligand-gated ion
channels are important transducers of information in the nervous system, a
better comprehension of the molecular events associated with channel activation
is crucial to the understanding of the nervous system in general.
