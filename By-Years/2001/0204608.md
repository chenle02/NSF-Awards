The work in this proposal is aimed at furthering our understanding of the basic
laws and forces of nature. New ideas and techniques in string theory will be
developed. String theory is currently the most succesful attempt to combine
quantum mechanics and gravity into a unified framework with the strong, weak and
electormagnetic forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard model of particle
physics has had many experimental successes, but it must be replaced by a more
complete theory at higher energies. Supersymmetry, a relation between particles
with different spin, is an important ingredient in many theories of particle
physics at higher energy scales. This work should lead to new insights into the
role of supersymmetry in string theory and particle physics. This work is also
likely to have applications to areas of mathematics concerned with geometry and
singularities.&lt;br/&gt;
