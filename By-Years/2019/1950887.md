The Interactive Systems Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
focuses on the fact that as intelligent systems become increasingly pervasive as
wearables (e.g., smart watches and phones, medical devices) or in the
environment (e.g., smart homes, on-line educational systems), they will interact
more intimately with people. The process of designing cyber-physical and data-
assisted educational systems for humans-in-the-loop is often an afterthought,
but the reality of future intelligent systems in that their value will be
reduced if they are not easy to use. As human behavior can be difficult to
model, much of the focus is on how to easily guide people to interact in
productive ways with the system. The REU addressed these important research
issues and is designed based on our expertise working with undergraduates in a
novel cycle of research, teaching, and mentoring together with a body of
literature that examines undergraduates’ experiences in science and engineering.
Our approach facilitates development of a tight-knit cohort of undergraduate
researchers engaging in forefront research, allowing them to become more
independent as their competence increases. Our established mentoring community
is vital to increasing student competence, developing collegial relationships,
and improving collaborative interactions. Participants also participate in the
southern California “meeting of minds” conference. It provides a venue for
students to be exposed to a much broader range of research than can be seen in a
single program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site will impact both the
scientific and educational research communities. The intellectual focus of this
proposal is on the development of interactive systems in domains such as cyber-
physical systems and data-assisted education. As systems integrate more sensing
and signal processing, tighter interactions with people are enabled. Tools and
procedures produced in the summer REU site will be further extended in regular
courses, including senior design, to harden the designs through exposure to
larger populations. In this way a much larger of group of undergraduate students
will participate in research, with tools that are refreshed in each academic
year. This research will have multiple benefits: increasing students’ skills,
knowledge base, and preparation for future study; and contributing to research
breakthroughs with scientific and social relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
