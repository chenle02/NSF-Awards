9308900 Berman In this proposal, we outline a model and a mechanism for
scheduling large-scale scientific applications on a non-dedicated heterogeneous
network of computers. To obtain efficient schedules, our system will consider
both domain-and application- specific information as well as system-wide
characteristics. We seek a scalable and portable scheduling system with
applicability to a wide variety of computational environments. We plan to use
two important scientific applications with diverse computational requirements
(global climate modeling and PACVHM) to test our scheduler. The initial
implementation will use PVM as the underlying control mechanism. Our intent, is
that the scheduler will be able to use any distributed task control as it
foundation. ***
