9355540 Scahill This three year project is to provide training in micro- and
macro-economics over two, four week summer workshops (1995, 1996) for 25
teachers selected from the state of Pennsylvania. The project will be located on
the University of Scranton campus and will begin during the summer of 1995.
These newly trained teachers then become important parts of the resource for the
nine centers for economic education at various colleges and universities across
Pennsylvania. The newly enhanced teachers will in turn provide at least 100
hours of inservice work for an additional 500 teachers during the second and
third year of the project in conjunction with the Centers. The newly enhanced
teachers will assist in teaching using a video course called "Economics USE"
produced by the Annenberg Foundation. An additional traditional course will fill
out the requisite minimum of 100 hours of training. The outreach activity will
begin during the second year of the project and will extend through the third
year. The participants will meet at a regional meeting at least once each year
to discuss their courses and share their experiences.
