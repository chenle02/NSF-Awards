This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the fields
of chemistry and biochemistry. For a three-year period beginning in 1992, each
of eleven undergraduate students will do "hands-on" research under the direction
of a faculty member who will be matched with the student. Students will be
immersed in an intensive 10-week summer program which has been carefully planned
to provide a positive working environment and to enhance: (1) the students'
interest and fascination in chemistry and biochemistry; (2) the students'
technical skills in the laboratory; (3) their ability to design and interpret
experiments; and (4) their ability to communicate verbally and in writing. The
research experiences will extend beyond the summer and continue throughout the
academic year, with a second full-time laboratory period during the semester
intersession.
