Funds are provided to convene a MARGINS TEI (Theoretical and Experimental
Institute) for ~ 100 participants to focus on the role of volatile compounds in
subduction zones. The workshop will bring together geochemists, geophysicists
and modelers to discuss the current state of our knowledge on the budget of
volatiles (H2O, CO2, N, F, S, Cl and noble gases) at the two MARGINS focus sites
of Izu-Bonin-Mariana and Central America. The sponsorship of the TEI is mainly
tied to the Subduction Factory initiative of MARGINS though there is also a
shared interest with the SEIZE and RCL groups within the Program. The workshop
will ne held at Mt. Shasta in the fall of 2009.
