This grant supports students to travel to the 2023 Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on
the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE). ESEC/FSE is a major
conference in the field of Software Engineering. It will be held in San
Francisco, California December 3 - 9, 2023. The travel grant will be used to
increase participation of US students. The intellectual merit of the grant is
the technical exchange of information and research conversations/collaborations
made possible by the conference, as well as advances in the field made possible
by these interactions. The broader impacts stem from education, training and
mentoring received by the participants. The international nature of this
conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of researchers and educators
within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of
Software Engineering.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
