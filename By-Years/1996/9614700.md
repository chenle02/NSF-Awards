Abstract/Balsley 9614700 We propose to use the Jicamarca Radio Observatory near
Lima, Peru to examine a variety of multiple-receiver techniques that can be used
for vertical wind measurements in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. These
studies will use a series of sub-modules of the Jicarmarca antenna in
conjunction with a number of receivers. The observations require only low-power
transmitters and minimal hands-on operation. We will intercompare a number of
existing (and some new) techniques in order to assess their strengths and
weaknesses for vertical wind measurement. The Jicamarca observations will be
complemented by modeling studies. We anticipate that our results could
ultimately serve as a basis for improving conventional wind profiling techniques
to provide improved vertical wind measurements.
