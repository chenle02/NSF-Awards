This award enables Wellesley College to attach its campus-wide network to
NSFNET through a 56,000 bit per second line to NEARNET, the New England Regional
Network. This connection allows Wellesley's researchers to login to
supercomputers and other remote comuters from their own networked office and lab
computers so they can access scientific statistical, linguistic and other
specialized data bases, special purpose software not available on computers at
Wellesley, and research library online catalogs. These features plus the high-
speed file transfer capabilities of NSFNET facilitate collaboration between
Wellesley faculty and their colleagues in colleges and research universities on
the Internet.
