Ion transport across the plasma membrane by proteins such as ion channels and
ion pumps is vital to cellular functions such as signal transduction and volume
control. Despite increased information about the molecular structure of
transport proteins from the cloning of the respective genes, mechanisms
underlying the cellular regulation of ion transport by channels and pumps are
not well understood. This research will focus on the regulation of
mechanosensitive ion channels and a proton pump in the plasma membrane of the
model eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mechanosensitive channels will be
analyzed using patch-clamp electrophysiology to determine the relationship of
membrane deformation and specific ions to the activation and adaptation of
mechanosensitive channels by combined measurements of membrane capacitance and
conductance. Another goal of this proposal is to determine the number and
function of proteins which functionally interact with the proton pump, either as
modulators or as parallel ion transport mechanisms such as channels. Isolation
and genetic characterization of mutants affecting proton extrusion by the pump
will be followed by biochemical, electrophysiological, and molecular genetic
studies to determine exactly how pump regulation is altered in the mutants. Ion
channels and ion pumps are of great fundamental importance to the physiology of
cells since they control the traffic of specific ions across the membrane. The
proposed combined application of the powerful techniques of molecular genetics
and sophisticated electrophysiology to study ion channels and pumps in yeast
will make it possible to develop parallel knowledge of their molecular structure
of the channels and their function.
