The strength of paper will be studied as functions of microstructure and
polymer-fiber adhesive interactions. Structure layering will be quantized and
correlated with both wet and dry strength. In addition, resin retention will be
determined for a number of ionic conditions and strain rates. The experimental
work will be supplemented with computer simulation of fiber motion during sheet
forming as determined by electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces.
