Professor Alan Rocke research, focusing on events in France but having a strong
comparative dimension toward Germany, promises to shed important new light on
such general questions as how local knowledge becomes universal; how research
schools exercise (or fail to exercise) influence more broadly; the reality and
significance of national styles in science; the operation of nationalist and
internationalist pressures in the pursuit of science; and the interaction of
socio-cultural and internal factors in the development of scientific ideas and
applications. He is addressing these issues in the context of his study of the
rise and fall of synthetic chemistry in France and Germany. The remarkable power
of modern chemistry--"power" intended in both a scientific and a technological
sense--is founded on synthetic methods in organic chemistry, but our
understanding of how those methods developed historically is still in a fairly
rudimentary state. Two episodes are apt to come to mind upon mention of this
subject: early classic examples of chemical syntheses by Friedrich Wohler and
his student Hermann Kolbe; and the exploration of an entire series of such
reactions by Marcellin Berthelot a few years later, culminating in his path
breaking work of 1860, Chimie organique fondee sur la synthese. Viewed thus in
national terms, both German and French scientists were intimately involved with
the birth of this field. It is ironic that the publication date of Berthelot's
book marked the very point when the Germans began to exert extraordinarily
powerful influence in synthetic organic chemistry. German chemistry, especially
organic, attained a sort of take-off point in the 1850s, a movement that was not
paralleled in France. Ironically, the Germans' success can be related to their
rapid adoption of reforms begun in France, namely the new atomic weights and
unified molecular magnitudes championed by Auguste Laurent and Charles Gerhardt.
These reforms led to the creation of a powerful sort of chemistry gu ided by
structural organic theory. Not so, however, in the home of the reforms, France,
which provides an interesting conundrum. The differential experience in the two
countries must have been due largely to social, cultural, and institutional
factors, for the French had equal access to the same scientific publications of
the early 1850s that so quickly converted their German neighbors. What was it,
then, about the French that led to such differences from the German experience?
This is the central question for the project to explore. By exploring this
central question, Professor Rocke promises to elucidate many of the issues that
determine continuing leadership among nations in science and technology.
