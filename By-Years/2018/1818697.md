Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance
the quality of their preparation by strengthen education and research. The
project at Grambling State University seeks to build on previous successful
efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM
disciplines. The goal of the project is to implement a holistic approach to STEM
education that will impact the retention and graduation rates of STEM
undergraduate students, particularly in critical fields of mathematics, physics,
and data analytics. The project will impact all STEM majors at the institution,
but it directly supports forty-five students annually as researchers, peer
tutors or academic coaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the objectives
to: implement a big data training program to support the expansion of the
education STEM students receive in data analytics; restructure the mathematics
and physics curriculum; enhance the soft skills of STEM students, such as resume
writing, preparing for interviews, and communications skills; and implement a
research study that examines the interventions and develops a model that can be
replicated by other institutions. Each objective is supported by a set of
evidence-based strategies and activities, some of which will be studied for
effectiveness in the setting of this university. The project will be advised and
evaluated for effectiveness by internal and external advisory boards and by an
evaluator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
