The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to offer a low cost, personal device to fight
obesity and its related chronic associated conditions by tracking metabolic
rate. This is particularly important as modern society as a whole adopts a
sedentary lifestyle. There is clear correlation between overweight and increased
risks of many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers,
metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure, and over 140 million people in the
US alone are overweight or obese.

The proposed project tackles this challenge by providing a tool that can track
metabolic rate (to determine energy used and amount of food required), anaerobic
threshold, and peak oxygen consumption rate (to optimize amount and types of
activities). Such a tool has not been available until now due to multiple
technical challenges that require sensitive and miniaturized sensors for
detection of carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in breath with sub-second
resolution and <1% accuracy, and would also require measurement of breath flow
rate over a wide dynamic range under minimal flow resistance. To address these
challenges, first, chemical sensors based on a hierarchical sensing material
approach will be developed. This approach organizes sensing materials at
different length scales, from nm to mm, into hierarchical structures to achieve
fast and selective detection of the analytes. Second, to measure breath flow
rate, a novel low-cost, power-free acoustic sensor will be developed, which
converts breath into an acoustic signal that can be detected and analyzed with
the built-in microphone of a cell phone. Finally, a prototype device will be
calibrated and validation to demonstrate its functionality against expensive,
bulky stand-alone gold standard reference methods.
