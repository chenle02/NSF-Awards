The focus of this project are organometallic compounds in which the metals
cobalt, rhodium or iridium are bound to macrocyclic ligands, i.e. organic
molecules which provide several donor atoms for binding the metal and whose
structures contain several rings. Such compounds show considerable promise for
use in the reductive coupling of carbon monoxide, a process in which carbon
monoxide is converted to more complicated and useful organic molecules. A series
of organometallic reactions that achieve measurable equilibria will be used in
deriving thermodynamic parameters for subsequent use in estimating M-H and M-C
bond energies. Variation of the reaction environment by solvent effects, zeolite
encapsulation and addition of Lewis acids and bases will be exploited as a means
of altering reaction thermodynamics and kinetics in order to promote new
organometallic reactivity. Rhodium and iridium porphyrin species have an
extraordinary breadth of organometallic reactivity, which encompasses the areas
of C-H bond activation, alkene coordination and oxidation, formation of
heterobimetallic complexes, reductive coupling of carbon monoxide, and the
formation of species with carbene, formyl or hydroxymethyl species bound to the
metal. A major effort will be made to discover non-porphyrinic macrocycles and
chelate ligand systems which emulate metalloporphyrin reactivity, but which have
improved reaction rate characteristics.
