A better understanding of the behavior of enzyme modified biosensors requires a
more detailed picture of the heterogenous surfaces. This information is not
limited to enzyme modified electrodes, but can be extended to other organized
assemblies such as lipid molecular coatings. The proposed research will
characterize the surface properties of amperometric biosensors utilizing
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and will also prove the feasibility of
using the STM technique to microfabricate biosensors. Fundamental STM studies
will be used to establish structural/reactivity correlations. An understanding
of these correlations will facilitate the productive design of biosensors,
particularly in producing the effective links between the monitoring
biocomponent and the structural features of the biosensor.
