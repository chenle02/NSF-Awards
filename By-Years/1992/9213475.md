The Larch Workshop is intended to bring together international users and
developers of the Larch family of specification languages and tools. The three-
day workshop, organized by Professors Ursula Martin (European coordinator) and
Jeannette WIng (US coordinator) will be the first meeting ever of those who have
over the past 11 years designed the Larch languages, built tool support for
them, and used them to specify and reason about software and hardware systems.
The group includes users and developers of the Larch Prover (LP), one of the
Larch tools that distinguishes Larch from its competitors in formal methods. The
invited participants include researchers from the United States and Europe who
are active in the area of formal specification and verification. The workshop
will be held at Endicott House, approximately 15 miles from MIT, in Dedham,
Massachusetts. The award is pursuant to the NSF-ESPRIT agreement.
