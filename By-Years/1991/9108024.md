With the exception of psychology and the health sciences, women continue to
represent only marginal participants in the continuing flow of new doctorates
into the U.S. science and engineering talent pool. The output of graduate
training directly affects the pools of talent available to research
organizations; colleges and universities; civic, governmental, and religious
entities; businesses; and elementary and secondary education. As William Bowen
said, At their best, those who earn graduate degrees in the arts and sciences
contribute not only their own ideas to society, but also a capacity to educate
and prepare those who will exercise leadership on a broad scale. Clearly, the
extent to which women can be players in this labor market rests on their number
emerging each year from graduate training. The factors that affect the level of
participation of women in graduate training and in the labor force are well
known and include the availability of adequate financial support, interactions
with role models and mentors who can provide guidance in potential career
choices, support of family members and peers, opportunities to interact with
women scientists and engineers in similar academic programs or employment, and
even women's own confidence in their ability to "do" math and science. The role
of a continuing committee would be to identify the factors that can be
influenced rapidly and efficiently and to generate an action plan to do so. The
action plan to be developed by the Committee on Women in Science and Engineering
of the National Research Council (NRC) will respond both to needs identified by
Federal and private sponsors as well as by the expert opinions of the committee
of leaders in this area.
