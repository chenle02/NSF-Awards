Mass spectrometry is a chemical analysis tool that has played an important role
in the advance of cell biochemistry and large-scale methods to study biological
systems. This workshop, Mass Spectrometry Big Data to Knowledge, will seek to
identify new mathematical and computational frameworks to advance the use of
data produced by mass spectrometry. As specific software tools and methods can
be drivers and enablers of new experimental paradigms, this workshop will also
consider next generation ideas, for example questions that are not possible to
answer now, experimentally, but may be enabled by new mass spectrometry-based
approaches. This workshop is sponsored by the Division of Chemistry, the
Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive
Sciences, and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mass Spectrometry Big Data to Knowledge
Workshop, led by Professor John Yates III of the Scripps Research Institute,
will examine the current challenges in bioinformatics and their relationship to
mass spectrometry technology. The areas of discussion will include: 1)
Bottlenecks in data analysis- where people spend their time; 2) Assessment of
current methods to translate data to knowledge, and discussion of their
limitations and challenges associated with application of these methods to mass
spectrometry data sets; 3) The flexibility of current algorithmic methodologies
in the face of changing landscapes of both instrumental and computational
technologies, and 4) Where does mass spectrometry data fit in biological
studies, including the discovery of mechanisms of disease?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conclusions of this workshop will be disseminated to
the scientific community through websites and a workshop report.
