University of New York, Farmingdale, in conjunction with SUNY Small Business
Development Center, area industries and the New York Network is proposing an
ambitious, well-thought-out program to establish a regional center for work
force education. The proposal features video conferencing, television
production, and distance learning in innovative ways. There is a strong
commitment and focus on factory floor education. The participants plan to train
1500 individuals per year. Pilot efforts to date for this program have attracted
strong industry participation and financial support. ***
