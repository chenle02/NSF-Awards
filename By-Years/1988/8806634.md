This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will be used to upgrade the MicroVAX
II system of the Department of Electrical Engineering to serve both as a
computational resource and as a local area network server for PC's, terminals,
and new graphics workstations. This will provide the Department with an
efficient link to a Cyber 205 supercomputer on campus which can be used
effectively by faculty and students to extend their ability to perform research
at a more advanced level. The goal is to pursue numerical procedures and
techniques for the solution of 3- dimensional electromagnetics problems
involving objects of both arbitrary shape and arbitrary material composition.
Such problems generally require 1) extensive volumetric geometric input data,
which can only be practically generated and checked using graphics techniques in
many cases, 2) massive computational resources for the numerical solution, and
3) extensive graphics output capability to represent results in a manner
convenient for interpretation, evaluation, and presentation. Without the
proposed graphic workstation capability, this type of advanced electromagnetics
research cannot be easily pursued at the University. Efficient access to
appropriate computational resources is also necessary.
