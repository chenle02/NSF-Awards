This project involves the investigation of a pre-estimation procedure to modify
the structure of the power network equation so that a linear programming (LP)
type state estimator will consistently reject the existing gross errors. A
rotational transformation is shown (by way of a single variable example) to
restructure the estimation equations in the desired manner such that an LP
estimator in the transformed coordinates rejects the previously accepted bad
data. The feasibility and practicality of an extension of this approach to the
multivariate case will be studied. The problem areas and the associated tasks to
be accomplished are identified. The results of the proposed work will be
comparatively tested against the plain LP estimator. A computer program will be
developed and documented for this purpose.
