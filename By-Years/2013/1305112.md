There are both harmful and benign bacteria and viruses all around us. Scientists
use a technique called metagenomics to characterize these organisms by
extracting DNA from a sample, and deciphering the genetic code of all of the DNA
sequences. The scientific approach typified by metagenomics is to generate data
and rely on large, fast, computers to solve complex problems. The Computational
Enhancement of Analytical Metagenomics Systems award supports this work with
computational infrastructure and training.

Intellectual Merit: The team working on this project are world-leaders in the
development of tools and analyses for metagenomics data. The computational
infrastructure enabled by this award continues their leadership in this area for
the coming decade. The computing infrastructure is also used by researchers at
both San Diego State and other Universities in California, the United States,
and around the world. The infrastructure enables the researchers to tackle
really difficult problems that they couldn't approach before. An ~500 core
computer cluster including machines with lots of memory and disk storage space
allows the scientists to run their massive computations required to analyze this
data to protect our nation, develop new therapeutics and understand our world.

Broader Impacts: This proposal directly supports an NSF Transforming
Undergraduate Education in Science program that teaches genomics and
metagenomics to undergraduate students at San Diego State University, an
Hispanic-Serving Institution. Over the last six years SDSU has improved the
graduation rate of all students by providing access to cutting edge research
equipment like that proposed here.
