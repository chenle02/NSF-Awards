The primary objective of this proposal is the development of a new low-cost,
wireless, unpowered resonant sensor net that can be used to monitor large areas
in civil infrastructure systems. A critical new area of research relates to the
coupling of individual elements in the net to produce collective, crystal-like
behavior, allowing large area coverage with high sensitivity to damage.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The buildings, bridges, dams, and lifelines that comprise
the civil infrastructure present unique challenges for sensor development due to
their large size, unique designs, continuous exposure to the environment,
infrequent inspections, and long design life. For most real-time health
monitoring systems that attempt to address all these concerns, the costs
associated with the installation, maintenance, and interpreting the data are
prohibitive for the overwhelming majority of infrastructure systems in the US.
In contrast, the proposed wireless sensor net should provide a cost-effective
alternative to real-time health monitoring systems. The proposed sensor net will
greatly enhance the type and quality of information that may be obtained about
the condition of large areas of an infrastructure system during a routine
inspection. Here particular emphasis on collective sensor nets suitable for
diagnosis of problems encountered is placed in reinforced concrete
structures.&lt;br/&gt;
