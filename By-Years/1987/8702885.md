The proposed research is a continuation of experiments on mechanisms of
temperature acclimation in freshwater fishes. It has been previously established
that fish compensate for shifts to cold or warm temperature by changes in
metabolism. Recently the applicant discovered that cultured liver cells can show
compensatory changes in activities of enzymes but that these isolated liver
cells fail to show the changes in capacity for protein synthesis that we have
observed in vivo. The applicant proposes to test a variety of hormones for their
effects on tissue cultures of fish liver cells. Previously, results indicate the
region of the brain (preoptic hypothalamus) controlling behavioral temperature
regulation in fish is the same region that integrates regulation in mammals. He
hypothesizes that this same region of the brain senses temperature and triggers,
probably via hormones, the compensatory changes in tissue metabolism. Two
approaches are to be used. Lesions to the preoptic hypothalamus will be made
under anesthesia and the fish allowed to recover. Preliminary evidence indicates
that lesioned fish do not show the biochemical acclimation shown by the
controls. He has previously recorded electrical activity in the hypothalamus and
found temperature sensitive neurons. He plans to continue such recordings over
longer times in an effort to learn the changes that occur when a fish adapts to
an altered temperature. The proposed research has general significance with
respect to adaptation of animals to environmental stress and concerning the
temperature center in the brain.
