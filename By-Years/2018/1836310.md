The American Institutes for Research in the Behavioral Sciences (AIR) proposes
to enrich and deepen its support for computer science (CS) preK-12 teachers with
its CS for All Teachers virtual community of practice (vCoP) that provides
assistance to 5,800+ members through a resource collection, discussion groups,
webinars, and other supports. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this funding, AIR will
continue to maintain the vCoP, and develop its functionality around (i)
Connecting novice computer science teachers with the resources and people they
need to learn rudimentary CS knowledge and skills, (ii) Cultivating a deeper
sense of learning for intermediate computer science teachers to improve their
teaching practice, and (iii) Challenging veteran computer science teachers to
enhance their leadership skills to support their colleagues and advocate for
computer science education. In addition, the project will conduct social network
analysis to improve our understanding of how best to support computer science
teachers virtually and provide opportunities for research on online communities
for CS teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
