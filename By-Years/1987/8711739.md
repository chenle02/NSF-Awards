Abstract Narrative: The fundamental activity of historical linguistics is
reconstructing the nature of an ancient language, no longer spoken, on the basis
of the properties of its present-day descendants. Based on such a
reconstruction, one can determine a great deal about the historical
relationships between the present-day languages, and the peoples who speak them;
one can also move closer to a general theory of language change, one of the
primary goals of linguistic science. The first major step in linguistic
reconstruction is to identify cognates, words in the related languages which
have a common origin in the ancestral language. Getting to the stage where this
can be done in a comprehensive and reliable way can take years, even generations
of research on the present-day languages, but until this stage is reached,
reconstruction can only be sketchy and speculative. The Cushitic and Omotic
language families, subfamilies of the Afroasiatic family of languages, have now
reached the stage of description where a systematic identification of cognates,
preparatory to reconstruction of the proto-languages of these families, can be
undertaken. The aim of the project is to carry out this effort, using newly
developed computational tools which should make the process much faster and more
reliable than has been the case in the past. These families comprise more than
eighty languages of northeast Africa, and a historical account of their
development and their subgrouping would be of great value to the field. The
Principal Investigator is a noted historical linguist and lexicographer, who has
been engaged in research on Cushitic and Omotic languages for some fifteen
years. He has a firm command of the relevant literature, the theoretical issues
in linguistic reconstruction, and the computer techniques to be employed, all of
which equip him thoroughly to carry out the project successfully.
