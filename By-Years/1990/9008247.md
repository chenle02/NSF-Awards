The main goal of the research is to construct a theory of testing that leads to
provable statements about programs. This theory shows that testing can "prove"
that certain programs are error-free. The class of programs that this theory
applies to includes a number of important programs. However, the theory does not
provide absolute correctness. It does prove that a computation is correct with a
certain probability. Since this probability can be made as close to l as
desired, this suffices for practical purposes. It is important to note that this
probability is not an empirical statement: it is a rigorous statement about
mathematics.
