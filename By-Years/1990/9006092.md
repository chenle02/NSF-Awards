The principal investigator will continue his research in two areas of spectral
geometry. The first involves isospectral three dimensional manifolds with
curvature assumptions but no restriction on conformal class. In the second
project he will develop a trace formula and Selberg zeta function for arbitrary
geometrically finite discrete groups whose fundamental regions have infinite
hyperbolic volume. The principal investigator will extend his theories of
isospectral manifolds which are not necessarily isometric. In two dimensions,
isospectral manifolds are surfaces which sound alike when struck. In higher
dimensions, examples are known of hypersurfaces which sound alike but which are
not isometric; that is, they do not have identical shapes.
