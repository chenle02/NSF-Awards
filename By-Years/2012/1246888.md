The innovation is a new method for forecasting the demand for spare and service
parts whose demand is intermittent or slow moving. Intermittent demand consists
mostly of zero values, with nonzero demands of random sizes mixed in at random
times, making it extremely difficult to forecast. The innovation will allow
parts providers to operate in the "sweet spot" that balances the costs of
keeping unused parts on the shelf against the costs created by not having parts
available when needed. The research will develop the new forecasting algorithm,
embed it in a prototype software product, and document its greater accuracy
compared to conventional methods. The evaluation of accuracy will be based on
extensive computational experiments using both synthetic data (to discover which
data features are critical) and a library of over 100,000 real-world demand
histories provided by existing customers.

The broader/commercial impact will be reduction of a multi-billion dollar drag
on the US economy: mismanagement of parts inventories. Parts inventories are the
second largest item on the balance sheets of many companies, and spending on
them amounts to roughly 8% of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Improved
parts forecasting can lead to increases in parts availability by over 10%, and
simultaneous reductions of over 15% in inventory costs. These improvements will
benefit not only the vendors of parts but their customers, whose supply chains
will become more reliable and whose operations will have reduced down time.
