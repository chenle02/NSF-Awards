Diversity, equity, access, inclusion, and belonging-related change is often
difficult to achieve in organizations. In the context of Informal STEM Learning
(ISL), this results in inequitable opportunities for both ISL professionals and
learners to engage in STEM environments and experiences. For people to thrive in
these settings, creative and innovative approaches that address historical and
current realities of intersectional marginalization and inequitable norms within
informal STEM institutions are necessary to disrupt conventions, institutional
barriers, and patterns of inequities. TERC and the Detroit Zoological Society
will develop and implement an ISL Equity Resource Center (the Center). The
Center will advance equity within the ISL field by cultivating a multi-sector,
diverse learning community that designs and conducts evidence-based research and
practice, including but not limited to equity-focused leadership, decision-
making, theory, methods, project topic selection and design, and budget
management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will cultivate lasting change in
the ISL and broader STEM learning ecosystem via (a) sharing more inclusive,
culturally relevant, and responsive ISE research and practice; (b) identifying
scalable, equity-focused research findings useful in ISL programming; and (c)
promoting greater public awareness of the importance of broadening participation
in STEM. The Center's primary stakeholders are ISL professionals, including
researchers, practitioners, and evaluators. The Center will maintain and expand
a digital infrastructure to support innovation and sharing across the ISL field.
Through its combined efforts, the Center will raise the visibility and impact of
ISL equity-focused research and practice and its contributions to the overall
STEM endeavor. The Center will also organize and host the biennial AISL Awardee
Meeting. The Center is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program,
which seeks to (a) advance new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of
the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments; (b)
provide multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM
learning experiences; (c) advance innovative research on and assessment of STEM
learning in informal environments; and (d) engage the public of all ages in
learning STEM in informal environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
