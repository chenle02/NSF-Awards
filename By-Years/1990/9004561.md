The long term aim of this project is to determine at atomic resolution the
three dimensional structures of various forms of hemocyanin, an oxygen transport
protein found in invertebrates, with the intent of understanding the intricacies
of oxygen binding by these copper-containing proteins. The specific objectives
are: (1) the determination of the crystal structure of the oxygenated and
deoxygenated forms of subunit II of Limulus polyphemus hemocyanin; (2)
Comparison of the oxy and deoxy structures, based on data from a single crystal
if necessary, for the elucidation of the active site geometry, including the
orientation of the molecular oxygen with respect to the two copper centers and
protein ligands; and (3) The crystallization of other interesting hemocyanins,
such as subunit IIIa, another subunit of Limulus hemocyanin with an active site
chemistry much more like a typical molluscan than arthropodan hemocyanin, the
whole molecules of Limulus hemocyanin and hybrid and cooperative Limulus
hexamers in forms suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis.
