9728779 Reiter Lay Abstract The cell walls of plants play numerous protective
and growth-regulating roles during the life cycle of a plant. Furthermore, plant
cell wall material represents the most abundant renewable source of biomass on
earth, and represents the raw material for many products such as wood, textiles
and paper. Accordingly, the investigation of the synthesis of plant cell walls
is of considerable interest both from a basic and applied point of view. Plant
cell walls consist of many different components such as cellulose, pectins, and
many minor polysaccharide and protein components. Although most of the
photosynthetically fixed carbon is ultimately incorporated into the
polysaccharides of the cells wall, the biosynthetic pathways leading to the
synthesis of these complex carbohydrates are poorly understood. This project
utilizes a genetic approach to unravel the complexities of these in the model
plant organism, Arabidopsis thaliana. The project will focus on two cell wall
mutants, mur2 and mur3, which affect the bisynthesis of a class of important
cell wall cross-linkers called xyloglucans. The mutants will be used to obtain
the affected genes by so-called "positional cloning", a procedure that permits
the isolation of genes based solely on their location within the genetic
material. Once these genes involved in the synthesis of the plant cell wall
polysaccharides have been obtained, they will be used to determine their
function and to identify other components of the cell wall biosynthetic
machinery in higher plants. In the long term, this knowledge is likely to permit
the genetic manipulation of cell wall synthesis with the goal o f improving the
properties of agriculturally important plants. ***
