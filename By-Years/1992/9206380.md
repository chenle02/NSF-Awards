This award will support the participation of more than 30 scientists from the
United States at the International Symposium on Multivariate Analysis and its
Applications which will be held in Kowloon, Hong Kong, in March, 1992. The
Symposium will emphasize the application of multivariate models in medicine,
economics, the social sciences, and industry and on computational aspects of
high dimensional data. The Symposium will be preceded by a series of short
courses and will be followed by two workshops, to be held in Guangzhou and
Kunming. The Symposium will involve participation of mainland Chinese
scientists. This award will support the participation of more than 30 scientists
