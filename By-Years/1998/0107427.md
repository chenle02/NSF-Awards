Dissertation Research: Role of a Dominant Grazer in a Headwater Stream Food Web

The proposed research addresses a fundamental question in ecology: what
determines the structure of food webs? In general, a suite of manipulative field
experiments is designed to quantify the control that herbivorous species can
exert on stream food webs. Manipulations of the abundance and phenology of a
dominant grazing invertebrate (Glossosoma), in combination with stable isotope
analyses, will determine if the presence and density of Glossosoma control the
use of algae and detritus (alternative energy sources in streams) by other
species of consumers. Because Glossosoma is relatively invulnerable to predation
as a consequence of its morphology (a stone case), it may prevent predator
species from exerting controls over herbivores. This will be quantified with
regard to a common predator, the Giant Pacific Salamander (Dicamptodon
tenebrosus). The proposed work will test in a rigorous manner, the hypothesis
that herbivores exert "intermediate control" over the structure of food webs.
