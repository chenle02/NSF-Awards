Award number: 0229809&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robin R. Murphy&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
University of South Florida&lt;br/&gt;Title: Adaptive Shoring for Robot-Assisted
Search and Rescue&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal for this project is to contribute
to the science and engineering that will enable development of a network of
distributed shoring mobile robots. Each robot would be able to position itself
in the rubble pile in places where humans and other tools could not go (mobile),
adapt the pressure in the air bags to shifts in the structure as well as
identify better positions to provide support (adaptive), and would work in
concert with other shoring robots to maintain stability (distributive). This
type of system would be an important addition to urban search and rescue teams
and has been specifically requested by FEMA and regional response teams in the
aftermath of the WTC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While immediate progress in shoring
can be made by simply coupling air bags with man-packable robots (such at those
used by the PIs at the WTC), a true breakthrough depends on advances in sensing,
distributed control and communications technology. The adaptive shoring
application is both novel in its demands on distributed, real-time cooperative
control of robots and its need for sensors for damage assessment. As a result,
there is a high risk that a traditional multi-year research project is premature
because the demands of the domain and the relevant state of the art are
unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year exploratory project will investigate
the feasibility of contact and remote sensors for local adaptive shoring (e.g.,
load on the air bag) and for dynamic placement of the robots (e.g., location of
the load based on damage). Laboratory and field experiments with a distributed
team of two air bags and robots will also be conducted. The results are expected
to be a trade study of sensing, an assessment of the requirements of adaptive
shoring for sensing, distributed control and communications, and prototype
equipment that will be available for use in real emergencies. The lessons
learned will be captured through journal publications for both the robotics and
structural engineering communities and, should the data support it, as a full
proposal.&lt;br/&gt;
