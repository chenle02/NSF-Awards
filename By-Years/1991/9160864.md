This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is in the
general area of instrumentation development in the subfield of mass
spectrometry. The combination of gas chromatography with mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) provides the best general purpose analytical instrument for sensitive
characterization of complex mixtures. It is used in fields of science and
technology. In most cases, the gas chromatograph separates the starting mixture
into its constituent compounds prior to analysis by the mass spectrometer. The
separation step is the most time-consuming part of the analysis, often taking an
hour, while mass analysis for each constituent is complete in a second or less.
This project provides a method for the direct mass spectroscopic analysis of
mixtures and can speed overall analysis time by reducing the degree of
chromatographic separation. The investigators use a novel ionization modulation
scheme that increases the amount of chemically useful information obtained from
a mass spectrometer. The system is automated and supports computerized
deconvolution of the resultant two-dimensional spectra. The Phase I program
addresses optimization of the instrument design by maximizing the data
acquisition rate (while maintaining good signal-to-noise ratios over a large
dynamic range), determining the limits to sensitivity, determining the optimum
electron energy resolution and selecting the best algorithm for computerized
data reduction.
