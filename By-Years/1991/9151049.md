The goals of this project are to integrate critical thinking and problem solving
skills into the biology program for majors and non-majors, increase student
participation in independent research, and enhance the access of pre-college
women and minority students to careers in the biological sciences. These goals
are being supported with the acquisition of MacIIsi computer work stations
installed in introductory biology laboratories and in a computer facility that
students will have access to at other hours. The computers will be used for
interactive analysis of data from laboratory experiments, simulated analyses of
experiments that are too expensive or too dangerous to perform in the teaching
laboratory, for independent study, and for writing assignments.
