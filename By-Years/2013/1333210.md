Title: Planning Visit Proposal in Support for High Performance Computing for
Econometrics Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the planning
visit is to establish a collaborative research program in the multidisciplinary
area of econometrics and high performance computing. Unlike scientific computing
which has been mostly the focus of parallel computing, the econometrics area
does not get much attention by computer scientists. As part of this planning
visit, we will identify what are the major computational challenges in the
econometrics domain and how computer science and high performance computing can
help in addressing these challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lack of software to
use large scale computing power for econometrics applications has forced
researchers to make either some approximations in quantitative analysis of
economics data or not fully validate the theories they develop to explain an
economic phenomena. Developing tools and libraries that help researchers in the
area of econometrics to use massively parallel computing power will enable them
to make basic science advances in econometrics that were not possible otherwise.
The outcome of this planning visit would be a proposal in this area to NSF.
