9600195 Chomet The 38th meeting of the Maize Genetics organization will be held
at Pheasant Run Conference Center from Thursday, March 14 through Sunday March
17, 1996. This is a meeting which has been supported for most, if not all, of
the years during which it has grown from a small group of dedicated scientists
working with corn usually meeting in a university setting, to the large numbers
of attendees which now must be accommodated in a conference center. Many
scientists working with corn gave their first talk at this meeting which covers
both basic and applied areas of the genetics, biochemistry, cell biology and
biotechnology of maize research. Students at all levels are encouraged to go and
encouraged to interact with the established attending scientists. ***
