This project will study the Raman and electronic spectra of selected transition
metal complex ions in aqueous solutions to determine their molecular structure
and thermodynamic properties at the conditions of formation of hydrothermal ore
deposits. This work is also of fundamental chemical interest because relatively
little is known about the physical chemistry of concentrated electrolyte
solutions at higher temperatures and pressures. The proposed research is part of
a continuing collaborative project involving the Chemistry and Geology
Departments at Princeton.
