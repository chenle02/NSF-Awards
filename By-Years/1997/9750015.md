Abstract DBI 9750015 Daniel Oppenheimer This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Using baculovirus vectors to study the
evolution of segmentation in arthropods." Although expression patterns of many
developmental genes in a wide range of arthropods are known, the functions of
these genes are not known. This research uses baculoviruses which infect a broad
range of arthropods to control the expression of specific developmental genes in
many insect and crustacean species. Evolutionary relationships of gene function
will be made by comparing effects of gene misexpression in different species.
