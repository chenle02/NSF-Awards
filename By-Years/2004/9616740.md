This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
libraries and museums. It provides partial support for two years for a totally
wireless system to connect a small museum to the Internet. Wireless also will be
used within the museum to connect a laptop equipped with a camera to allow
innovative ways for remote users to view the museum displays.
