The objective is to demonstrate the use of a nondestructive method called the
Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) to evaluate, 1) the degree of damage
to the structural and foundation elements, 2) location and extent of damage, and
3) the extent and quality of repair. One of the key thrusts of research will be
the integrated study of both body and surface stress waves.
