Researchers have been able to genetically engineer protein-based materials with
novel properties. For instance, silk-elastin-like proteins (SELPs) have been
synthesized by fusing polypeptide sequences, derived from native silk of
superior mechanical strength, and human elastin, which is remarkably resilient,
into single proteins. However, recombinant proteins, like SELPs, still cannot be
assembled into robust micro/nanoscale biomedical structures via ?green?
processes. In contrast, spiders can spin silk fibers of superior strength at
ambient temperatures, low pressures, and with water as the solvent. The
objective of this proposal is to understand the assembly mechanism of
recombinant proteins under ?green? conditions and to characterize the structure
and mechanical properties of assembled protein fibers. In particular, a micro-
fluidic device will be used to investigate the influence of protein solution
variables (e.g., pH, salt concentrations), fabrication variables (e.g., flow
rates), and protein sequences on the controlled assembly and fiber formation of
SELPs. The mechanical properties of assembled SELP fibers will be characterized
and mathematically modeled. In addition, the secondary structures of SELP fibers
will be analyzed using Fourier transform infrared Raman spectroscopy.
&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide the necessary first step toward
the development of ?green? fabrication processes for producing high-performance
protein fibers for a variety of biomedical applications. Results from the
research will be integrated into the combined undergraduate and graduate course
entitled Micro-Biomechanics. Undergraduate and graduate students performing the
research, including underrepresented minorities and women, will receive training
in the emerging areas of biomechanics, nanotechnology, and
biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
