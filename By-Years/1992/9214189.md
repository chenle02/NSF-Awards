PROGRAM: Academic Research Infrastructure Program Summary: The Academic
Research Infrastructure (ARI) program supports 1) acquisition or development of
major research instrumentation, and/or 2) repair, renovation, or in exceptional
cases, replacement of obsolete science and engineering research facilities. This
proposal from Florida State University (FSU) requests funds to purchase an
isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a Gas- Chromatograph (GC) interface and a
microvolume inlet system. The instrument will be operated as a shared-use
facility to support research efforts of scientists in the FSU Departments of
Geology, Oceanography, Biology, Chemistry and Anthropology. FSU will provide 50%
matching funds for acquisition of this instrument. //
