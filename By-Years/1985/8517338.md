This research is aimed at formalizing, and eventually automating, much of
structural design. The work will be focused mainly on the development of one or
more abstract hierarchical models for physical structures that are capable of
supporting automatic analysis and interactive and automatic design. Data
structures used to support VLSI design will furnish a starting point, but these
will require enhancement or redesign to reflect the richer ensemble of
dependencies that are obtained in physical structures. Some work will also be
devoted to automatic structural analysis (e.g. finite-element mesh definition)
using the data model, and to automatic design-rule checking.
