This research project is undertaken by an experienced team: a philosopher who
specializes in environmental risk assessment and the ethics of scientific
research and a biologist who specializes in habitat evaluation and ecological
restoration. The project has four objectives: to examine and clarify the ethical
dimensions of two dominant paradigms of ecological risk assessment; to discover
major ethical assumptions built into the paradigms, so as to clarify the
normative dimensions of these procedures; to assess the ethical consequences,
for ecological research and environmental management, of alternative stances on
questions about the normative foundations of these paradigms; and to evaluate
the ethical adequacy of important applications of these assessments. The
research plan involves careful reading and analysis of ecological risk
assessments that incorporate the animal-toxicity and the ecological health
approaches to identify and clarify their value assumptions and ethical
implications. The investigators will consider such questions as whether
ecological risk assessment should include ethical goals or advocacy, economic
measures of welfare, public preferences, or standards of ethical rationality.
Related questions include, whether the burden of proof should lie on ecologists
or risk imposers and which assessment paradigm is likely to lead to greater
good. Through presentations and publications, the project teams expects to
participate in on-going debates about the ethical aspects of ecological research
and its environmental applications and about the contributions that ecologists
can make to ethical debates about environmental issues. The project will result
in articles and presentations, and a book length monograph.
