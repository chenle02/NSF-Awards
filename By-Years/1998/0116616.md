University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI: Development of Haptic
Instrumentation and Software for Computer Science Research and Training Using
Surgical Simulation as the Application&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal
for instrumentation development under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)
program to support research and student training in the area of haptic human-
computer interaction using surgical simulation as the application. The design
and development of haptic surgical instruments which attach to a commercially
available device will enable users to practice virtual surgery and will enhance
the human-computer interface in realistic simulation applications. &lt;br/&gt;
