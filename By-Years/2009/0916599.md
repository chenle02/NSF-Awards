The goal of this project is to extend methods of extracting general knowledge
from texts, so as to obtain not only simple "factoids"&lt;br/&gt;such as "A door
can be open" or "A person may respond to a question"&lt;br/&gt;(exemplifying the
millions of outputs of the U. Rochester KNEXT system), but also general,
conditional knowledge such as that "If a car crashes into a tree, the driver may
be hurt or killed".&lt;br/&gt;Such conditional knowledge is crucial for
intelligent agents that can understand language and make commonsense inferences.
The approach employed in the project involves bootstrapping of two principal
sorts: (1) abstraction from simple factoids, both individually and collectively;
(2) use of already-derived factoids to boost the performance of a natural
language parser/interpreter, enabling&lt;br/&gt;(a) extraction of more complex
conditional facts from miscellaneous texts, and (b) direct interpretation of
general conditional facts stated in English in sources such as Common Sense Open
Mind or WordNet glosses. The evaluation methodology for the derived knowledge
involves both direct human judgement and judgement of inferences automatically
generated with the aid of the extracted knowledge, using the EPILOG inference
engine at U. Rochester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general knowledge obtained in
this work will be made available to the broader AI community, and will advance
the state of the art both in natural language understanding and in knowledge-
dependent commonsense reasoning (for example, in question answering). It will
also provide evidence relevant to the hypothesis that language understanding is
a process dependent not only on a few thousand syntactic rules, but also on
millions of pattern-like items of general knowledge that bias the parsing and
interpretation process.&lt;br/&gt;
