A critical challenge for development of the Internet is how to support
efficient and effective multicast communication in response to the intense pace
of growth of the Internet and the concomitant demand for communication services
from its users. Current multicast protocols, while well-suited to local or
smaller scale communication, have suffered from serious shortcomings with
respect to scalability, stability, and inter-domain coordination. Our approach
to the multicast routing problem involves the introduction of new graph
theoretic structures as underlying abstract communication topologies for
multicast and the integration of these new structures with current technologies.
There are two key elements to our new multicast architecture: a) 3-layer
hierarchical multicast protocol and b) a virtual topologies model. Together
these two elements provide a flexible architecture for multicast that has the
potential to overcome the shortcomings described above. In this proposal, we
focus on the virtual topologies element of the architecture. Certain graph
structures have great potential to serve as underlying topologies for multicast
communication, due to properties of connectivity, symmetry, limited vertex
degree, and small diameter. Under the proposed model, an abstract communication
topology, such as the k-tree or the k-ary n-cube, is used as basis for the
execution and routing of the multicast protocols. The mapping of the virtual
topology to physical routes in the Internet occurs dynamically, as is done under
current, shared-tree approaches to multicasting. More robust topologies can be
expected to provide greater flexibility and fault tolerance than simple tree
structures. Scalability comes from the fact that these virtual topologies are
limited to intradomain application. Our proposed 3-level, hierarchical multicast
protocol follows the Internet domain structure, interconnecting domain-specific
virtual topologies into an overall multicast structure. We plan to develop new
pr otocols for multicast under the architectural model described above and to
test their feasibility and performance through simulation. Our interdisciplinary
team of researchers in graph theory, parallel computing, and networking brings a
new synergy to the multicast problem. Our theoretic work will be guided by an
understanding of the pragmatic issues involved in today's Internet protocols. We
hope to define and develop fundamental new multicast structures and algorithms
that can ultimately serve as the foundations for a realistic, effective
multicast architecture for the Internet.
