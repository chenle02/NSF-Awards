Funds are provided for instrumentation for deep level transient spectroscopy
(DLTS) studies in semiconducting ceramic oxides. DLTS has not been studied
extensively in ceramic oxides and therefore the information will be a useful
first step in understanding the defect structure of such oxides. The equipment
will complement a new research start to study shallow traps in ceramic oxides.
Further, the instrumentation will assist Alfred University in developing a well-
equipped laboratory for electronic ceramics.
