Complex-valued random signals arise in many areas of science and engineering
such as communications, radar, sonar, geophysics, oceanography, optics,
electromagnetics, and acoustics. If the cross-covariance function of the signal
with its complex conjugate vanishes, the signal is called proper, otherwise it
is improper. If the underlying signals are improper, much can be gained in
performance if they are treated as improper. If it is not known apriori whether
a signal of interest is proper or improper, this information must be obtained
from its noisy measurements. Existing approaches to determination of propriety
are limited to the case where the measurements consist of a sequence of
independent random vectors. Practical real-life signals do not typically consist
of independent measurement samples. This research focuses on approaches designed
to handle dependent data.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Novel, efficient approaches are
investigated in this research with emphasis on frequency-domain, improper
signals, and applications. The signals are modeled as stationary but are not
necessarily Gaussian. The following thrusts form the core of this research. (1)
Testing for impropriety of dependent multichannel data with arbitrary
distribution unlike past work which is limited to independent sequences,
typically assumed to be Gaussian. (2) Comparison of random complex signals
involving statistical tests to ascertain if two multichannel random signals have
the same second-order statistics. Application of such tests for user
authentication in wireless networks is investigated. (3) Detection of
multichannel complex signals in noise using a generalized likelihood ratio test
formulation is studied, without requiring a structured model or Gaussian
assumption. (4) This research also involves reexamination and modification of
all aforementioned approaches to be robust with respect to additive or
innovations outlier model.
