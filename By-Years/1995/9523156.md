9523156 Hollis Planar linear motors, often called forcers, provide low friction
motion in a large workspace with few moving parts. Because they operate as open
loop steppers, they are: susceptible to losing steps, affected by external
disturbances, and cannot provide controlled forces or high stiffness. Feedback
control can compensate for these deficiencies if reliable and unobtrusive
position sensors are available. This project will investigate two unobtrusive
sensing techniques for planar motor systems with 1 micrometer positioning
resolution. One proposed sensor uses the AC magnetic field drive flux to induce
a field in a sensing tooth on the mounting platen. The other approach also uses
platen teeth, but is based on optics. A when a tooth coated with a florescent
dye material is illuminated by light of one wavelength, it emits light at a
longer wavelength; the intensity of this secondary wavelength is function of
position. Research issues for both sensors are spatial and temporal noise, cross
talk, and sensor-forcer integration. Using these sensors, a model based and a
variable structure robust control scheme will be designed to deal with nonlinear
magnetic fields, payload effects and model uncertainties. This research will
enable increases in speed and payload for planar linear motors, making them
attractive as actuators for next generation machines and equipment that need one
micrometer positioning over a large planar workspace. ***
