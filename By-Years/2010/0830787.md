Computational Complexity excels at posing fundamental questions with far-
reaching consequences regarding the nature of computation, but so far it has
been not nearly as successful at answering them. To propel the field forward,
broadly useful tools and techniques must be cultivated, and new ones
invented.&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to significantly broaden the reach of
error-correcting codes as a powerful tool to attack central problems in
Complexity (and one fundamental problem in Algorithms). Error-correcting codes
lie at the core of some of the deepest results in Complexity; recent
developments in the area reveal possible routes to a number of further
breakthroughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will pursue research organized in the
following three&lt;br/&gt;thrusts: (1) developing a generalization of Parvaresh-
Vardy codes possessing a crucial feature -- local decodability -- often
exploited in Complexity applications, with applications to derandomization and
surrounding problems; (2) devising a real analog of error-correcting codes
possessing an approximate version of the defining feature of error-correcting
codes -- that two codewords that differ in one coordinate must differ in most
coordinates -- with a concrete application to proving circuit lower bounds in
the complexity class MA; and (3) utilizing error-correcting codes to bridge the
gap between "approximate" and exact algorithms for matrix multiplication, with
the intention of obtaining an optimal algorithm for matrix multiplication using
a group-theoretic approach developed by the PI and
coauthors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal is to develop new tools and
techniques around error-correcting codes, while attacking well-motivated and
significant problems in different application domains. Resolving fundamental
problems in Complexity and Algorithms in turn enhances our understanding and
mastery of efficient computation.&lt;br/&gt;
