A new computer-based method for automated design sensitivity analysis of dynamic
mechanical systems is developed. The equations of motion are formulated in terms
of a minimal set of relative coordinates. An adjoint variable method is used to
compute variations in dynamic performance measures due to changes in design. The
equations of motion and the adjoint equations, which are systems of
differential-algebraic equations, are integrated using a generalized coordinate
partitioning method based on singular value decomposition of the constraint
Jacobian matrix. Symbolic processing language MACSYMA is used to develop the
required equations and to implement them in FORTRAN subroutines.
