This award provides funds to the Department of Psychobiology at the University
of California, Irvine to continue to sponsor a successful undergraduate research
experience in Neural Plasticity and Brain Function. The program originated with
a one-week undergraduate Summer Institute that was expanded with NSF funding.
The eight-week summer program begins with a one-week lecture/seminar series
designed to introduce the students to the field and to the research of the
various faculty. This is followed by an active research experience in faculty
laboratories on a defined project tailored to the goals of the student and their
advisors. Throughout this period, students continue to interact with faculty in
both formal and informal meetings. At the end of the program, students present
their findings to other students in the Department and to the faculty.
