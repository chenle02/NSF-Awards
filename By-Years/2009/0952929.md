****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early CAREER award funds
research to investigate magnetization dynamics as well as the damping of the
magnetization in magnetic nanostructures. A better understanding of the
magnetization dynamics and its damping in magnetic nanostructures is of
fundamental importance for the research area of spintronics, which targets the
use of a quantum mechanical property of the electron known as "spin" to develop
electronic devices with new functionality. In this context the damping of the
magnetization will be a key factor, for example, to minimize the overall power
consumption of spintronic devices. This project will investigate established
material systems as well as new materials, but will also investigate the
feasibility of high frequency biosensing using magnetic nanoparticles, which
would have a number of possible applications. This project will seamlessly
integrate education activities at all levels of education through research
experiences for local high-school and undergraduate students and training of
graduate students. In addition online educational material pertaining to this
CAREER project will be designed and developed and will be made accessible for
the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL
ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the magnetization dynamics and damping in
magnetic nanostructures is of fundamental importance for many aspects of
spintronics, a research area that targets the use of the electron spin to
implement new electronic devices. This Faculty Early CAREER award funds research
to investigate the magnetization dynamics and damping in magnetic
nanostructures. Broadband ferromagnetic resonance techniques will be used to
investigate the magnetization dynamics and damping in: (a)
ferromagnet/antiferromagnet structures including systems modified using ion
irradiation, expected to provide new insights in the role of two-magnon
scattering in these structures; (b) new spintronic materials including B2
ordered alloys, aimed at providing guidance for the future development of low
damping materials; (c) magnetic nanoparticles, aimed at investigating the
feasibility of high frequency biosensing. This project will seamlessly integrate
education activities at all levels of education through research experiences for
local high-school and undergraduate students and training of graduate students.
In addition online educational material pertaining to this CAREER project will
be designed and developed and will be made accessible for the general
public.&lt;br/&gt;
