This project focuses on the development of anthropomorphic robots that interact
with people using natural social cues. Socially-competent robots would have
great practical impact; users could interact with these robots in a more natural
and effortless way, could command them through social instruction, and could
integrate them into daily life. This project seeks to address both the technical
challenges involved in constructing these robots and the ways in which they can
be used as tools to study human social development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
technical challenges of building social robots are substantial. The design and
construction of a robot that can produce gestures and utterances which can be
easily interpreted by a human observer is a challenging mechanical design
problem. A more difficult technical challenge will be to build machines that can
recognize human social cues such as pointing gestures, direction of gaze, and
tone of voice. Existing research succeeds in recognizing a few of these cues in
structured situations, requiring visual scenes that have a constant background
or audio signals that contain only the voice of a single speaker. This project
proposes to build on existing work by integrating techniques from multiple
sensory modalities and using models of human social development as a roadmap for
constructing more complex social behaviors. A final engineering challenge will
be the implementation of a computational infrastructure to support these
algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;
