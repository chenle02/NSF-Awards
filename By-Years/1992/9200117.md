Eight undergraduate students from the Rocky Mountain and Southwest Regions of
the United States will participate in a ten week, comprehensive research
experience at the University of New Mexico during the summer of 1992. In
accordance with his/her interests, each student will participate as a team
member in one of the following four research groups: 1) design, construct and
operate a small-scale permeable barrier for groundwater aquifer remediation; 2)
investigate fracture in rock and concrete using laser interferometry and conduct
numerical simulations using an interactive graphical method; 3) construct small
scale models of hydraulic structures and test these models in an open channel
flow facility; and 4) assist in numerical simulations and experimental
observations of granular soil under shear using 2D elliptical disks. The
students will become familiar with their projects through early contact with the
research faculty. Each student can expect to learn to work independently over
the course of the summer, will present a final seminar on the research, and will
assist in writing a publication describing the work.
