One of the major goals of the CEDAR program is to develop a global technique
for determining the height distribution and its variation with time of the
different atmospheric constituents in the upper atmosphere. One promising
technique which is being pursued is to use the variation in emission intensity
associated with atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen during twilight to provide
this information. The work outlined in this project will use modeling techniques
to invert these twilight observations into constituent density height
distributions. The success of this approach will lead to a simple technique
which can be widely used around the globe to determine the compositional
dynamics of the upper atmosphere. 3/3/89//
