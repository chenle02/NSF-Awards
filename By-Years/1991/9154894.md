Macalester College will conduct a three-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Mathematics for 35 students entering grade 9. The curriculum includes
topics from number theory, probability and statistics, modelling, discrete
mathematics, and other areas not commonly taught in high schools. Visits will be
made to industrial labs of companies in the Minnesota High Technology Council
and to the newly established National Research Center for Geometry at the
University of Minnesota.
