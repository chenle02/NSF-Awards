9315999 Fu This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Fu's Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry award. The focus of the research deals with
the use of indenyl-metal complexes to direct catalytic processes. Specifically,
ring slippage of the metal-bound indenyl ligand will be exploited to open up
coordination sites on metal systems to provide the necessary coordinatively-
unsaturated reactive intermediates for catalysis. An important feature of this
mechanism is enhanced stereocontrol of the reaction due to the high level of
organization in the transition state. Initial studies will explore
indenylrhodium complexes in catalytic olefin hydrogenation, hydroboration and
hydroformylation. %%% This research on directed catalytic reactions will provide
fundamental insights into reactivity as well as new methods for synthetic
organic chemistry. ***
