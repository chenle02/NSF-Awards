In this project, we will develop computational tools for modeling the complex
interactions between the microbiological, architectural, and mechanical
properties of bacterial biofilms. The tools will combine models for multi-
species biofilm growth and development, elasticity properties that depend on the
different species and their products, e.g. EPS, and the interaction of the
biofilm with overlying fluid flow. As a test case, the tools will be used to
study the behavior of heterotroph/autotroph two-species biofilms commonly used
for nitrogen removal in activated sludge reactors. These biofilms exhibit
complex behavior in their tendency to develop stratified colonies where the fast
growing heterotrophs cover the slow growing and brittle autotrophs. The
heterotrophs protect the autotrophs from fluid stresses, and also consume the
products generated by the autotrophs as they remove nitrogen from wastewater.

Biofilms are a ubiquitous form of life that impact humans in many ways. Biofilms
are responsible for nitrogen loss from agricultural fertilizers, deplete oxygen
in streams, cause disease in humans and plants, and foul pipes, heat exchangers,
and ship hulls. It is estimated that biofilms cost the U.S. billions of dollars
annually in equipment and product damage, energy losses, and human infections.
The tools developed in this project will be general enough to be applied to a
wide range of multi-species biofilm communities, and will be useful in improving
our understanding of these complex systems. In this project, the tools will be
applied to activated sludge reactors, which are systems used for the treatment
of wastewater. In this system, bacteria and other microorganisms remove harmful
substances for purposes of water reclamation. For maximal efficiency of these
reactors, the right balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria must be
found. The tools developed in this project will improve our understanding of
this system and aid in the identification of the optimal operating conditions.
