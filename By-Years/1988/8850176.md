The departments of Biology and Chemistry at Bethany College have designed a six
week summer program to expose 20-25 high school students (grades 10 and 11) to
an interdisiplinary study of a watershed environment that is influenced by
agricultural, mining, and societal factors. The project goal is to encourage
students from schools with limited facilities or who lack contacts with
scientists to consider a career in science or engineering. Each participant will
become part of a research team composed of a senior researcher, a high school
teacher and college student. After classroom instruction in scientific research
methods, the students will gather samples in the field and analyze them in the
laboratory. Class topics will include the effects of sewage treatment and mine
and agricultural runoff on water quality. Experts in many science disciplines
will present seminars on factors that influence water quality.
