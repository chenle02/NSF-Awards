An automated radon monitoring instrument developed at Drexel University for the
direct analysis of atmospheric radon in the remote marine atmosphere has been in
operation in Bermuda for more than a year. The purpose of the proposed project
is to perform a series of studies in the laboratory and in the field to
characterize fully the instrumental and sampling attributes affecting the
overall analytical efficiency of the field radon instrument in order to validate
the methodology and the analytical results. The characterization studies are
designed to provide: 1. Assessment of the efficiency of radon sampling and its
dependency upon operating temperatures. 2. Calibration of the counting
efficiency of each of the six Lucas cells which have been operational in the
Bermuda instrument. 3. Calibration of the Bermuda instrument and a second new
instrument using double blind standard additions. 4. Intercomparison, using an
independent referee, of both field and laboratory analyses by the two Drexel
instruments with instruments of the Environmental Measurements Laboratory of the
Department of Energy, the Australia Nuclear and Technology Organization, and the
Centre des Faibles Radioactivities, CNRS, France. //
