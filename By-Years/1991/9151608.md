The existing Industrial Robotics Laboratory provides undergraduate students in
three required courses and six technical elective courses with adequate
educational demonstrations and experiments. The focus has been on the basic
principles of industrial robotic technology. The workstation augmentation will
permit enhancement of the laboratory experience through addition of topics such
as concurrent engineering design of robotic solutions, integration of robotic
devices in Computer Integrated Manufacturing systems, off-line task level and
application oriented programming, and computer- aided design of essential
robotic applications that are difficult to include in a university lab, such as
welding and painting. The equipment used includes a color graphic work-station
with an integrated CAD software package for robotic work-cell design, kinematic,
dynamic and graphic simulation, and off-line task programming.
