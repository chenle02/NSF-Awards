Lichens are symbiotic organisms composed of both an alga and a fungus. They
dominate approximately 8% of terrestrial ecosystems and are important
contributors to mineral cycling in many areas. Also they are important
biological indicators of pollution hazards such as sulfur dioxide. Dr. Thomas
Nash of Arizona State University is studying the species of lichens of the genus
Xanthoparmelia in South America, in order to determine reliable morphological
and biochemical characters by which to recognize individual species and further
to attempt to determine the evolutionary affinities of these taxa. Hundreds of
novel chemical compounds (so called "lichen substances") have been identified in
various lichens, and used at times as species markers. Dr. Nash will test
whether these chemical types are stable features of particular species or
whether the chemistry varies with environmental conditions under which the
lichens grow. His taxonomic work on South American lichens will complement
projects underway or completed on this genus for South Africa, Australasia, and
North America, covering ultimately nearly 400 species.
