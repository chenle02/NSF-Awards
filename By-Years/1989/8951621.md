The objective of the ENVISION project is to provide an environment for computer
science and engineering majors that will enhance student interaction with
computers and increase student involvement in learning the key concepts of
computer science. The plan is to establish a new computer laboratory and to
develop an integrated set of tools to illustrate the material covered in major
courses of our undergraduate curriculum. Computer graphics has become recognized
as a convenient basis for user interfaces, and as powerful aid to understanding
abstract and dynamic processes through visualization. They intend to develop a
coordinated set of graphics routines and packages tailored to specific courses
that will allow students to incorporate sophisticated graphical animation aids
into their programming projects without having to worry about programming the
low level details. The equipment will be used as a teaching vehicle where the
instructor can demonstrate and illustrate important concepts. Moreover, the
laboratory will provide students an opportunity for hands-on practice
implementing or experimenting with the fundamental ideas presented in class.
