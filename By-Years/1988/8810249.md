There are three thrusts to the work that will be performed: electronic structure
calculations, dynamic magnetic susceptibilities, and exact solutions of some
model Hamiltonians of many body theory as defined on a finite cluster. The
structure calculations emphasize three and four dimensional transition metals
with expanded lattices and/or different atomic arrangements from equilibrium.
Some calculations have been completed, others are planned. The magnetic
susceptibility studies attempt to provide models for the interpretation of
inelastic neuron scatering experiments in the paramagnetic region. Studies of
nickel have been completed, and calculations for iron will be made because there
are excellent theoretical reason to expect significant differences. Finite
clusters have become a theorist's laboratory for investigating exact solutions
of many body problems. This work is new, interesting, and important. The complex
case of the lattice Anderson model is under investigation. These techniques are
being applied to the study of electron interactions in high temperature
superconductors.
