The role of organic carbon in hydrocarbon-bearing deltaic environments is
dependent upon taphonomic processes affecting resident biotic communities. Crude
oils recovered from the Mahakam Delta, Indonesia, have been shown to be derived
exclusively from type III kerogens (humic organic material of terrestrial and
woody origin). The project is centered on the identification and
characterization of phytotaphonomic processes responsible for the accumulation
and alteration of terrestrial plant parts with the Holocene and Neogene
depositional environments in the Mahakam Delta. The sampling program will
involve recovery of plant macrodetritus from vibracores, box cores, and detrital
peat beach ridges. A reconnaissance vegetational survey of biotic communities
will be undertaken to identify the principal contributors of canopy parts to
these deltaic sediments. The recognition of the taphonomic processes involved
will contribute to our assessment of the principal sites and potential
preservational modes of macrodetritus in plant- bearing deltaic regimes. Results
from the project will provide significant insight into the role played by
tropical lowland vegetation in the genesis of recoverable Tertiary hydrocarbons.
