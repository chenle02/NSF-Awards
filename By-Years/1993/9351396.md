Undergraduate science education for students majoring in science and
engineering, and students who are non-science majors must evolve to bring all
students in contact with the tools needed to grasp critical and emerging
scientific issues. In 1991 the University of Arizona started a two-semester
sequence Introduction to Global Change to teach non-science majors about the
earth system. The course teaches basic scientific principles in the context of
global problems and challenges facing scientists, policy makers and citizens
alike. This proposal provides for the computer equipment needed to fully
implement the laboratory exercises that we have developed and are continuing to
improve. Besides this introductory course, undergraduate classes in global
change, remote sensing, and hydrology will use the computer laboratory to
enhance and expand their laboratory experiences. This multidisciplinary teaching
effort is part of the University of Arizona's commitment to the study of global
change.
