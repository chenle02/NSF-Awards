This Planning Grant will explore the feasibility of calculating upper ocean
transports from paired vertical profiles of oxygen isotope ratios in benthic
foraminifera. Depth transects of cores from the east and west sides of the
Florida Straits, will be sampled for modern through last glacial periods,
density profiles constructed from the foraminiferal oxygen isotope ratios, and
estimates of geostrophic transport derived. Special attention will be given to
estimating the magnitude of error introduced by various assumptions.
