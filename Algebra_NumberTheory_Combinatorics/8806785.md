This project is concerned with research in algebraic K-theory. The principal
investigator will verify the special lambda-ring identities for the general
lambda operations which have recently been defined. Work will also be done on
equations among modular forms of weight one and generalizations to K-theory.
This project is in the general area of algebraic K-theory. K-theory concerns the
evolution of ideas of vector space, basis, linear mapping and general linear
group to a context where the scalars are from a commutative or noncommutative
ring. In this context, K-theory can be utilized in algebraic geometry and other
mathematical models involving coefficients from rings.
