This award supports the research of Professor M. Cordero- Vourtsanis to work in
combinatorics. She intends to study a class of finite affine planes
coordinatized by nonassociative algebras. She intends to classify finite
translation planes of rank 3 and odd dimension over their kernel, those with
specialized orbits in the line at infinity, and a class that admits a
p-primitive Baer collineation. This research is in the general area of
combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely
important to modern communications, for example the design of large networks as
in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer science.
