This proposal requests support for six junior US scientists to attend an
international conference "Dynamical Chaos in Classical and Quantum Physics"
which will be held at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk,
Russia, August 4-9, 2003. In Dynamical Chaos a deterministic dynamical system
can exhibit random behavior even though there are no random parameters in the
equation of motion. This phenomenom has been found to occur in physics, biology,
economics and other disciplines. This conference will attempt to give an
overview of the many classical and quantum aspects of the field. It is being
held in Novosibirsk as a tributre to Boris Chirikov, one of the founders of
dynamical chaos.&lt;br/&gt;
