Professor Jacqueline Gervay-Hague of the University of California-Davis is
supported by the Chemistry Division to support approximately 20 people at an
October 2004 workshop entitled Molecular Basis of Life Processes. The workshop
has three objectives: (1) science drivers, framed as grand challenge questions,
for the Molecular Basis of Life Processes (MBLP); (2) ways to mentor CAREER
applicants on constructing the education section of their proposals; (3) views
on opportunities associated with mid-range instrumentation. Professor Gervay-
Hague is assisted in the organization of the workshop by Professor Jeffery Saven
of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Michelle Buchanan, director of Oak
Ridge National Laboratory's Chemical Sciences Division. ORNL is the location for
the workshop. Discussants are a diverse group of former and current CAREER
awardees having research programs at the chemistry/biology interface. Several
observers from funding agencies as well as from the European council of chemical
society presidents, CERC3, will also attend. The workshop report will be widely
disseminated for additional community comment. The inclusion of objectives (2)
and (3) in the workshop is responsive to recommendations by the 2004 NSF-CHE
Committee of Visitors that the views of the community be sought.
