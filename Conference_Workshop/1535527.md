This grant provides travel funds for U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers to attend the 3rd Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in Heidelberg,
Germany from August 23-28, 2015. The HLF brings together Laureates of the most
prestigious awards in mathematics and computer science (the Abel Prize, the
Fields Medal, the Turing Award, and the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize) to spend a week
interacting with 200 early career researchers. In addition to the scientific
exchanges with the Laureates and each other, participants at the Forum gain a
valuable global perspective on computer and mathematical sciences -- early
career researchers represented 47 countries at the 2014 Forum. Modeled on the
Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, the HLF provides graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers with extraordinary access to a group of scientific role
models through lectures, small group discussions, and casual conversations. Such
experiences can have a profound impact on the development of an early career
researcher. For more information about the Forum, please see www.heidelberg-
laureate-forum.org Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) will recruit a
highly qualified and diverse applicant pool for the Forum. There are many
exceptionally promising early career researchers who have little or no
opportunity to interact with the Laureates of the major prizes in the computer
and mathematical sciences. The HLF is a unique opportunity for these
individuals, one that can energize and steer future research. The recruitment
and selection of participants will emphasize the potential benefits of the
opportunity for the researchers, as well as the overall goal of ensuring a
broadly inclusive group of participants. ORAU will provide logistical support
both prior to and during the forum and also continue to perform an assessment of
participant experiences to document the impact of the Forum. For more
