DMS-0104592 Zhiqin Lu, Bennet Chow and Peter Li

This award provides partial support for active research mathematicians with
limited means of support to attend and participate in the Southern California
Geometric Analysis Seminar to be held in the winter quarter of 2002, 2003, and
2004. The seminar will be held at the University of California, Irvine in 2002,
the University of California, San-Diego in 2003, and the University of
California, Irvine in 2004. The potential speakers will be M. Gromov
(IHES/Courant), K. Grove (Maryland), T. Mrowka (MIT), P. Sarnak (Princeton), E.
Witten (Princeton) and S.T. Yau (Harvard) for the winter 2002. The Seminar will
typically be held over a weekend with 3 main (one-hour) lectures on Saturday and
another 3 main lectures on Sunday. The schedule will be arranged so that there
will be ample time for the participants to interact with the speakers and other
participants. A social event will also be arranged for Saturday evening to
promote further interaction.
