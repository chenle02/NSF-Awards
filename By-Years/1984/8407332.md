This research project is concerned with obtaining a probability distribution for
a system performance measure when component states are dependent random
variables. The interaction of correlation structure in the component states with
the system structure will be investigated to determine its impact on algorithms
for computing the distribution of the system performance measure. The research
will be initiated by considering a specific model derived from shocks that
affect several components of a 'binary coherent system.' It is expected that the
results will identify classes of correlation structures which will permit the
development of useful algorithms for calculating the distribution of the system
performance measure. This theoretical research has the potential of yielding
better techniques forevaluating the reliability of complex systems arising in
diverse fields such as computer networks or automated manufacturing.
