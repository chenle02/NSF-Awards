This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
focusses on the development and experimental calibration of a time-of-flight
(TOF) mass spectrometer for the simultaneous determination of the size and
chemical composition of aerosols. During the tenure of this three year
continuing grant, Professor Prather and her students at the University of
California at Riverside will draw upon their expertise in laser spectroscopy to
develop a unique instrumental capability with which fundamental chemical issues
underlying atmospheric environmental chemistry can be addressed. The combination
of multiple lasers with TOF mass spectrometry enables the intricate timing and
high sensitivity necessary for the simultaneous size and composition analysis of
aerosols. This instrument development project will provide environmental
scientists with the ability to simultaneously determine the size and chemical
composition of aerosol particles which are major determinants of atmospheric
quality. It is expected that this instrumental design will be rapidly
incorporated into commercial instruments.
