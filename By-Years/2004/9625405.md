9625405 Shuler The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to fill the need for a
more rational approach to optimization of production conditions for new
compounds derived from plant cell cultures. They plan to exploit evolving
knowledge of signal- transduction pathways in plants with experiments using
metabolic transport inhibitors, precursors, and signaling compounds (e.g.
elicitors and plant hormones). This approach is to lead to working models of
TAXOL synthesis, release, and degradation in Taxus sp. cell cultures. The PIs
believe the proposed approach should be generalizable to compounds other than
TAXOL that are derived from plant cell cultures, and provide biochemical
engineers a tool to achieve rapid production of novel therapeutic compounds from
plant cells. ***
