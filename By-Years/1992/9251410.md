The Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
has developed a unique university-industry laboratory experience for its senior
students. This laboratory course is unusual in that it is not concerned with a
series of rigid experiments that is repeated each semester but rather deals with
experiments periodically solicited from local and national industries.
Participating industries contribute state-of-the-art experimental problems plus
the equipment to be investigated (usually part of their product line), and, in
return, they receive a copy of the completed student laboratory report. The
project will allow the expansion of this effective and successful course into
the complex field of high speed dynamic measurements. This enhanced laboratory
experience will help to educate new engineers with up-to-date knowledge and
competence with high-speed measurement methods.
