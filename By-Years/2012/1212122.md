The PI plans to observe the magnetic field and rotation properties of low mass
stars throughout their pre-main sequence phase. He will make use of the Zeeman
Effect as seen in high-resolution optical spectra of young stars obtained with
the NASA?s IRTF CSHELL and McDonald Observatory IGRINS spectrometers. The Zeeman
Effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines that is observed in the
presence of a magnetic field. The goal of this work is to test dynamo models of
young stars, which has broader impacts to understanding the solar dynamo,
extrasolar planet-star interactions. This project will also train a graduate
student in research techniques.
