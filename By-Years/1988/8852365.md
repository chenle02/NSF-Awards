Instruction in aerospace design has changed radically with the acquisition of
numerous computer programs which speed up the formerly tedious computational
work involved. As a result, many more aspects of aerodynamics structural
analysis can be included. Each design team now also constructs and tests its own
wind tunnel model. At the same time drafting skills, which are no longer taught,
must by replaced by computer graphics in order to give a current visual display
of the configuration being studied and modified in the iterative design process.
Accurate estimation of wetted areas and applications of panel methods also
require good geometrical data in numerical form. The recording and manipulation
of the wind tunnel data will be greatly facilitated by small-laboratory,
dedicated-computer networked to the work stations used in design. Industry will
provide a proven design software package of great flexibility. The new resources
will provide the work-stations necessary to implement this plan.
