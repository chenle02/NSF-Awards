The goal of this project is to address a documented regional and national need
for Aviation Maintenance Technicians. Maysville Community and Technical College
(MCTC) will develop enrollment strategies and a certificate program designed to
attract rural students and veteran populations into MCTCâ€™s Aviation Maintenance
associate degree program. MCTC will partner with area high schools offering
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association or STEM programs, airport boards,
Experimental Aircraft Association chapters, and aviation maintenance employers
to create an aviation maintenance educational pathway through outreach
activities and by aligning existing high school programs to the MCTC Aviation
Maintenance Technology associate degree program.

This project has two goals: 1) Address the documented needs of the aviation
industry for maintenance technicians by aligning and streamlining secondary,
postsecondary, and adult education pathways into the workforce 2) Address the
documented needs of rural populations matriculating to technician programs
through the creation of engagement and outreach activities for regional
community exposure to educational and career opportunities in the aviation
maintenance industry. Program evaluation includes both formative evaluation for
refinement of project activities and summative evaluation to establish outcomes
that will be used to improve the recruitment of rural student and veteran
populations into aviation maintenance technician programs. This project is
funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the
education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the
nation's economy.
