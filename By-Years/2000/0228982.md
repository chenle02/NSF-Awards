This research proposes to identify and validate constructs associated with the
successful transition of IT professionals (within companies whose main products
or services are not software or IT services)in response to changing demands.
Such companies are moving from legacy system technology to distributed and
advanced technology; from ad hoc work practices to software engineering
discipline; and from work products "thrown over the wall" to products developed
with in-house customers as full participants and business partners. Because IT
professionals are in short supply, the successful transition of existing
employees is especially important, yet the dramatic and discontinuous change
companies and their IT personnel face render prior work on retraining and
retention of employees less useful. Both quantitative and qualitative methods
will be employed, so that managerial and organizational contexts can also be
assessed, and new factors and relationships can be uncovered through causal
mapping. Operationalization of the dependent construct, Achievement in the
transition role, will be drawn from the case studies. Survey instruments will be
used to capture longitudinal change information and either verify or disconfirm
the model developed in earlier stages of the research.
