Two of the most pressing and related problems in computer vision research are
motion analysis and the correspondence problem. To date, most of the studies
deal with these two problems sequentially. The paradigm of conventional methods
is a three-step model in which motion analysis (e.g., estimation of motion
parameters and surface structure) rely on the result of the correspondence
problem but not vice versa. One is therefore forced to resolve correspondence
based on the properties of featured elements in successive image frames, but not
on their geometric considerations which might allow a motion interpretation. If
these two problems are treated on the same level simultaneously, then several
advantages for understanding time-varying imagery could emerge. This research
builds on previous work using this approach. The particular topics to be
investigated include 1) correspondence and motion analysis in realistic models;
2) three or more view problems; 3) the use of line segments for motion
estimation, and 4) motion analysis from perspective projection under restricted
assumption.
