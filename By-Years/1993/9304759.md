In orogenic zones affected by multiple deformation events, it is common for
structural features such as faults to be reactivated, although documenting
multiple movements, of the same or different displacement styles has proven to
be difficult. This project will address this classic problem by looking at
spatial variations in facies and thickness of syn-deformational sedimentary
units in proximity to faults of the Bisbee Group (Early Cretaceous) in two key
areas where the section appears to be anomalously thick. These rocks
subsequently were deformed by Late Cretaceous to Paleogene age were deformed by
Late Cretaceous to Paleogene age (Laramide) compression. If the Laramide
structure was previously a major normal fault in early Cretaceous time,
characteristics of the Lower Cretaceous strata (paleocurrents, thickness
variations etc) should record proximity to the fault. Results have the potential
to unambiguously separate the effects of the two tectonic events superimposed on
this area, and by extension may provide sedimentologic and structural criteria
to resolve multiple fault reactivations elsewhere.
