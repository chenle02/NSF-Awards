In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Garth Simpson of Purdue Universty will investigate the
chirality of biological molecules on surfaces using nonlinear optical techniques
based on surface second harmonic (SHG) generation and sum frequency generation
(SFG). SHG polarization measurements are by several orders of magnitude more
sensitive to interfacial chirality than traditional absorbance-based methods.
The goal of this research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the
nonlinear optical properties of biological interfaces and thereby establish a
foundation for interpreting future studies of such systems. The research
component of this project consists of three specific tasks: 1) to elucidate the
mechanisms responsible for the large chiral effects in nonlinear optical
measurements of ordered chiral films; 2) to develop nonlinear optical null
ellipsometry as a novel and robust approach for acquiring and interpreting
nonlinear polarization measurements of oriented chiral and achiral surface
systems; and 3) to make nonlinear optical measurements of model lipid and
proteolipid interfaces to provide a context in which to interpret nonlinear
optical measurements of more complex biological systems. Graduate and
undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral research associates will
participate in the research.

In addition to these fundamental investigations Prof. Simpson will develop laser
instrumentation modules suitable for use in K-12 Education through the Purdue
University Science Bound pilot program. This program targets 7th through 12th
grade students in the Indianapolis Public Schools by means of three components:
1) after school programs; 2) follow-up activities; and 3) mentor teacher
professional development.
