This project is to develop a computer graphics laboratory using Tektronix
computer graphics terminals. The laboratory will support a new computer graphics
course and an on-going program of student research. The new course will
emphasize the applications of mathematics to computer graphics and will enable
students to study and experiment with the algorithms and mathematical techniques
of two and three dimensional graphics.
