The New York Hall of Science and the Brooklyn Historical Society will develop
an interdisciplinary set of Exhibits, classroom materials and activity kits
about the history of commercial penicillin production. The materials will be
appropriate for social studies, health and life science classes in grades 4
through 7. The purpose of the exhibits and materials is to incorporate the
perspective of the history of penicillin into local science teaching and to
incorporate a scientific perspective into local history teaching. The proposed
project links science, history and the history of science and technology by
setting scientific facts and events in a meaningful historical context. The
project will use this mix to enhance curriculum of both history and science in
the New York region. The New York Hall of Science annually serves 140,00 school
children on class trips and has a strong commitment to teacher training. The
Brooklyn Historical Society annually serves 20,000.
