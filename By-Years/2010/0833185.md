KC-TEACH is a collaboration involving the University of Missouri-Kansas City
(UMKC) College of Arts and Sciences, Schools of Education and Biological
Sciences, and the Kansas City, Missouri School District (KCMSD), seeking to
increase the number of high school science teachers in the KCMSD. Scholarships
are available for undergraduate students who have 2-3 years to complete both
their undergraduate degree in biology, chemistry, geology, or physics and
science certification requirements, which obligates the recipients to 4-6 years
of teacher service in a high-need district. Stipends are also available for STEM
professionals enrolled in the UMKC science bachelor's recipient /second-career
program, enabling participants to complete high school science certification in
one year and then obligating them to 2 years of teacher service in a high-need
district. The project is preparing 28 new science teachers in biology,
chemistry, earth science or physics over five years by equipping candidates to
provide high-quality science instruction and placing them in a high-need urban
high school. The project provides early field experiences for freshmen and
sophomores in high school science classrooms of master teachers. KC-TEACH
program completers are supported in their first three years of teaching through
careful first-year placement and mentor selection and new teacher orientation,
classroom management support, and socialization into the teaching profession.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Research associated with the project is investigating the
effectiveness of inquiry instruction at improving content knowledge, reasoning,
and attitudes of science students and preparing teacher candidates who are well
equipped to provide high-quality science instruction in high-need areas. A major
contribution of this research is the identification of factors and
characteristics that can be used to predict retention of science teachers in
high need areas beyond contractual obligations.
