The investigator and collaborators propose to develop a new class of Immersed
Boundary-based methods to investigate the interaction of a large number of
immersed structures in 2D and 3D with a complex (non-Newtonian) fluid. These
innovative methods will have the computational efficiency demanded by some
outstanding, formidable problems of flow-structure interaction in complex fluids
and will establish new paradigms in the modeling and simulation of these type of
systems. To achieve this, the investigator and the project's participants will
introduce fundamentally innovative approaches for the fast computation of the
influence of the structure on the flow, for the rapid solution of robust,
implicit discretizations, and for model building and computation in the presence
of a complex fluid in important applications. While the new approaches will be
designed with concrete problems in mind (collective sperm motility in a complex
fluid and peristaltic pumping), their applicability will be broad.

A myriad of technologically and scientifically important problems can be
described as the interaction of a flow and immersed structures that could be
elastic or rigid and could come in a broad range of shapes and length scales,
from nano to macro. The swimming of micro-organisms like cellular and flagellar
locomotion, sperm motility, insect flight, aerodynamic design, cardiac fluid
dynamics, and processing of polymeric materials are just a few important
examples. There is now a recognized, pressing need to investigate these dynamics
in more realistic fluid environments which take into account the frequent
viscoelastic character of the underlying complex flow. The project focuses on
the development of fluid models and efficient computational tools to investigate
this important class of problems. Research and education will be vigorously
integrated in a multi-disciplinary environment with a sustained effort to
promote and broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, with the
active participation of undergraduates, with innovative pedagogic initiatives
and modes of collaboration, and with ties with the industrial sector.
