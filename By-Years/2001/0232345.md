This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on applied
research. The goal is to create a commercial Web-Based International Trade
Knowledge Discovery System based on the TurboRAD Inc. innovative copyrighted
software also known as TradingCubeTM. TradingCube is a Web Based Large Scale
Information Application requiring only a standard browser to be used. With
TradingCube, a decision maker can easily navigate the dynamic analysis of world
markets for a wide range of product groups as well as specific products.
TradingCube enables the functionality of a novel combination of tools including
data management technologies, web technologies, knowledge discovery,
econometrics and statistics. It requires the creation, storage, retrieval, and
display of large volumes of international trade information effectively and
efficiently. TradingCubeTM provides an intuitive interface and rapid results
expressed in textual and graphic ways that do not require specialized knowledge
to be understood by the user. The potential market includes any commercial,
private or public enterprise or entity with the need to evaluate international
trade opportunities.
