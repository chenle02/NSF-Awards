This research is directed at gaining a deeper understanding of the microscopic
structure of nuclei. Collective modes that characterize strongly deformed
systems in the intermediate to heavy nuclei are explored using group theoretical
techniques and ideas that are important in spectroscopic analyses. An expected
ancillary results are computational algorithms for large calculations not only
in nuclear physics but also on related problems in other fields.
