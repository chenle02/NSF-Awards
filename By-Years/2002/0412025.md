ABSTRACT

Proposal Number: 0412025/0412029 Principal Investigator(s): Schulzrinne,

University of New York Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: 7DS - A Mobile
Broadband Dis-tributed System

In an ideal world, mobile users would be able to enjoy affordable broadband
Internet access everywhere, including in public transportation vehicles (buses,
trains and planes), in outdoor spaces not covered by Wi-Fi access points, and in
disaster areas where the broadband wired infrastructure may be broken. Unfor-
tunately, such Internet access Nirvana will not be available in the foreseeable
future. Neither the broadband Internet nor the emerging 2.5-3G cellular data
networks will provide Internet access that is at once broadband, affordable and
ubiquitous.

This project prototypes and deploys 7DS, a distributed system which brings us-
ers a significant step closer to Internet access Nirvana. Bridging the gap be-
tween the broadband Internet and the cellular data networks, 7DS exploits the
increasing density of roaming devices that are endowed with both gigabyte stor-
age and short-range, broadband wireless communication capabilities. Using
asynchronous communication, 7DS provides a means for roaming users to ob-tain
content affordably and at high peak rates; it also provides a means for roaming
users to send content into the Internet, again affordably and suitable for large
objects. The expected results include (i) a comprehensive prototype for 7DS,
demonstrating the feasibility of the 7DS system; (ii) new algorithms and
protocols for 7DS, which will be disseminated in major conferences and jour-nals
and implemented in the prototype; (iii) actual deployment of the 7DS sys-tem on
university campuses, demonstrating how 7DS can bridge the gap be-tween localized
broadband Wi-Fi access and ubiquitous narrowband cellular data access.
