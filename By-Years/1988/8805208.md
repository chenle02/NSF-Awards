This is a Phase II SBIR award. Under Phase I, the technical feasibility of
producing an optical force sensor using pressure- induced birefringence has been
demonstrated. This research demonstrated that a small force/pressure sensor
could be made that has a large dynamic range, low noise, and low sensitivity to
isotropic environmental changes such as temperature and pressure. The Phase II
research will include the fabrication of an integrated optical tactile array
made of gallium arsenide/gallium aluminum arsenide. To accomplish this, the sub-
elements required for the array will be modeled, characterized and tested. These
elements include waveguides, reflectors, wavelength-specific beam splitters,
N-way splitters, lenses, and optical interconnects. The fabrication will be done
using molecular beam epitaxy. The optical tactile transducer will be a 3X3 array
with sensing sites on 1 mm centers and will be capable of resolving forces of
less that one milli-Newton.
