Geometric variational problems are used to describe the behavior of systems
driven by surface tension energies, like crystals or soap bubbles. Classical
examples are the isoperimetric problem (find the solid of minimal perimeter
enclosing a given volume) and the Plateau problem (finding the surface of
minimal area spanning a given boundary curve). In the last 50 years, geometric
variational problems have found a number of surprising applications in both pure
and applied mathematics. Their solutions can describe the equilibrium
configurations of physical systems in Mathematical Physics, the behavior of
black holes in General Relativity, or they can provide preferred representatives
in homology and homotopy classes in Differential Topology. For solutions of
geometric variational problems, the presence of singularities is unavoidable and
it is linked to the physical behavior of the systems they model or to the
concentration of topological obstructions in geometric problems. A fine
description of the regular and singular set is of fundamental importance in our
understanding of the underlying problem. This project aims to enhance our
understanding of the qualitative and quantitative behavior of solutions of
geometric variational problems by addressing a series of basic questions
concerning their regularity and the description of their singularities. The
answer to these questions will require the development of new methods and
techniques, which will also be valuable in other areas of mathematics. The
project will provide research training opportunities for graduate and
undergraduate students.

Despite the great amount of study dedicated to geometric variational problems,
several basic questions concerning the regular and singular behavior of their
solutions are still poorly understood. This project is intended to address these
questions and to develop new tools and techniques to tackle them. The project
involves work on four deeply interconnected directions of research: boundary
regularity for mass minimizing currents, regularity of critical points of
anisotropic surface tensions, regularity of solutions to spectral optimization
and free boundary problems, and the structure of PDE constrained measures. Their
study will require the interaction of techniques coming from different areas of
mathematics, such as Partial Differential Equations (PDE), Geometric Analysis,
Geometric Measure Theory, Topology, and Harmonic Analysis, as well as the
introduction of new ones.
