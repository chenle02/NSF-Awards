This award supports graduate students and young researchers to participate in
the Chapman Conference, "Atmospheric Absorption", to be held August 13-17, 2001
at Estes Park, Colorado. The purpose of the conference is to bring together a
small number of experts from a wide range of disciplines to focus attention on
the fundamental concepts of measuring and modeling atmospheric absorption of
solar radiation in an effort to solve a problem that has plagued the atmospheric
sciences community for a number of years. This is the so-called "excess
absorption" issue, i.e., theoretical models under-predict atmospheric solar
absorption when compared with (some) published measurements. The parenthetic
"some" is the basis for the intense controversy that surrounds this issue. This
is an important issue because the "excess absorption" is thought to be
relatively large, ~25-30 watts/m2, and so would have a strong impact on the
details of atmospheric heating and circulation in climate model simulations.
