There are three major architectural models used in high-performance signal/image
processing: (1) VLSI- signal processing - high- throughput VLSI architectures
for low-cost application-specific implementations used in applications such as
communication systems, speech, video/HDTV, and radar; (2) parallel signal
processing on massively parallel computers - parallel algorithms for complex
signal/imaging systems used in computer vision, medical imaging, and the
processing of vast amounts of data in deep space exploration; (3) distributed
signal processing on high-speed networks - used in applications such as document
image processing, multimedia, automatic signal processing in manufacturing, and
medical signal/image processing. This research will focus on the development of
efficient algorithms and architectures for each architectural model, and in
comparative studies of the advantages and disadvantages of these different
computing schemes. The goal is to investigate which signal/image processing
problems can be carried out optimally under different computing and
communication schemes.
