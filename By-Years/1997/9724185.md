An MRI award will support purchase of an excimer multigas pulse laser with 157
to 351 nm wavelength range(F2,ArF,KrF,XeCl,XeF), and with 300 mJ maximum pulse
energy,as well as the related optics and accessories. The equipment will be used
for research in the fields of polymer engineering and crystal growth, in
particular polymer machining, metal substrate adhesion pretreatment by ablation,
control of crystal growth processes, and multiphase interface control
applications in general. Additionally, in response to the rapid growth in the
usage of laser processing of polymers in the electronics and precision and
micro-machining industries the equipment well also be used in the training of
graduate and undergraduate students, as well as affiliates from relevant
training centers.
