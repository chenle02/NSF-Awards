The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of technology to assist the general public, military, first
responders, and medical professionals with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
For over 25 years, guidelines for chest compressions during CPR have relied on
compressing an arrest victimâ€™s chest a set amount of inches and gauging this
depth by the naked eye. The goal is to sharpen these guidelines by making
available easy-to-use technology that guides the rescuer and provides real-time
feedback about their CPR performance. By improving critical performance metrics,
the proposed technology may improve survival of cardiac arrest both in and out
of the hospital. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of ultrasound technology that has been streamlined and specifically
purposed to detect blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). By
tracking blood flow through target blood vessels, the proposed technology is
designed to provide users with specific instructions and real-time metrics about
the performance of their CPR. The goal is to improve chest compressions, which
may lead to greater blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, heart, and
other vital organs. The proposed technology has been validated by initial pilot
studies aimed at comparing the proposed technology to the current invasive blood
pressure monitoring during controlled cardiac arrest. Future development may
improve the focus and function of the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
