The PI will address the question of how large-scale dynamics, and in particular
baroclinic eddies, contribute to the maintenance and variability of the
hydrological cycle of the troposphere. The PI will study: (i) how important
baroclinic eddies are relative to mean circulations in transporting water vapor
and in maintaining the global-scale water vapor distribution; (ii) how water
vapor transport by baroclinic eddies depends on circulation characteristics such
as the pole-to-equator temperature gradient and the thermal structure of the
troposphere; and (iii) how the presence of water vapor and latent heat release
affects scales, structures, and transport properties of baroclinic eddies. The
PI will address these questions by means of analyses of observational data and
simulations with an idealized general circulation model. A postdoctoral
associate and a graduate student will participate in this research.
