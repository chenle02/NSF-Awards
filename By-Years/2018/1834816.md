The collision of celestial objects can be so powerful that they create
distortions in spacetime, known as gravitational waves. Albert Einstein
predicted their existence more than 100 years ago, but the effects are so tiny
that even Einstein thought they could never be detected. After decades of hard
work, the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) finally
observed these waves for the first time in September 2015 and this triumph was
recognized with a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017. This award will support the
attendance of US scientists to the COFI International Workshop on Gravitational
Waves, to be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The workshop will convene scientists
from across the globe to discuss current and future research in gravitational
wave detection, giving priority to the attendance of graduate students and young
researchers as part of their formation in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop will gather the world experts to discuss the motivation and the
experimental challenges of future measurements of gravitational waves. The
discussion will include: Overview of recent detections and prospect for upcoming
LIGO/Virgo observing runs, the landscape of electromagnetic follow up programs,
science implications to cosmology, tests of general relativity and understanding
of low mass binary stars and mergers, and the future of LISA. The agenda for the
three days workshop includes about twenty-five presentations summarizing the
state of the field in that many aspects of research and data
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
