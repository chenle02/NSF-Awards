The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will conduct a proposal
development workshop aimed at increasing the development and awareness of
grantsmanship opportunities related to the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship
Program at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). The workshop will include two-
person faculty teams from 20 MSIs interested in developing a competitive Noyce
proposal. Participants will also engage in a series of post-workshop
individualized sessions that will provide additional proposal guidance. The QEM
workshop and post-workshop interactions will provide participants feedback on
their required project summaries to assist them in developing their ideas into
competitive Noyce proposals. MSIs are uniquely qualified to address the issue of
recruiting, retaining, and developing STEM teachers for high-need schools. As
such, the project's workshops will help develop stronger MSIs, in general, and
teacher preparation programs, specifically, to meet the nation's needs for a
more productive science and technology workforce.
