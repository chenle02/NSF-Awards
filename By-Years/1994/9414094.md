A major public policy dilemma arises in the aftermath of virtually every
damaging earthquake: What to do about buildings which are still standing but
structurally weakened, or are of a confirmed suspect type, and which therefore
pose a threat to public safety in the event of another earthquake. This project
will study how the City of Oakland, California faced precisely this problem with
several dozen major structures in its downtown area after the October 17, 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake. The methodological approach will include interviewing
key decision makers and the analysis of relevant documents.
