9315761 Moon This award of $190,000 is for curriculum development in adding new
approaches in nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear controls into undergraduate
engineering education. Current analysis tools taught in undergraduate
engineering curriculum center upon linear dynamics and control. However,
mechanical and electromechanical design based solely on linear models fail to
analyze properly many important physical effects that are inherently non-linear.
This proposal will develop teaching, software and experimental modules to
introduce methods in nonlinear analysis, with specific applications that include
design of a flexible robot arm, structural design with nonlinear materials,
nonlinear control of smart machines, and the use of chaos theory to avoid
machine noise.
