Funds from this project have purchased research-grade electrochemistry
instrumentation so that several electrochemistry experiments can be preformed as
part of the year-long laboratory techniques course required of chemistry majors.
The goal of this project is to teach students both the theory and practice of a
variety of electrochemical techniques used in contemporary chemical research and
to encourage the students to use appropriate electrochemical techniques in
subsequent research projects. The equipment purchased is microcomputer-
controlled which gives students valuable experience with modern instrumentation.
The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
