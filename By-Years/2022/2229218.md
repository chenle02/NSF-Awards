The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a remote stoma monitoring and management technology to encourage
telehealth for routine wound, ostomy, and continence (WOC) care consultations in
order to reduce the burden on nurses, keep patients and the nurses safe from
respiratory infections like COVID-19, and reduce the use of painful personal
protective equipment (PPE) during routine checkups. This product may be adapted
to wound care applications and used to monitor clinical wound healings with the
use of 3D imaging. The product seeks to improve the precision of wafer fit and
overall ease of stoma management while simplifying the appliance-fit process and
empowering patients with easy-to-use tools to manage their stomas. The mobile
technology could be used as a scanning device as well as a healthcare package to
support individuals that have undergone an ostomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on the development of a software-based stoma-wafer
inspection and fit tool that improves the precision of wafer fit and the overall
ease of stoma management. In this system, a 3D model of the stomal area will be
processed on a cloud-based backend, and an “ideal” aperture contour will be
generated and used for automatic, high-precision wafer cutting. The product
could be a reference for rethinking medical imaging technology that typically
requires expensive image acquisition systems such as computed tomography (CT)
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While the initial focus of the product is
to provide an affordable stoma care management system for patients, the
technology could be applied to a wide range of other wound care products and
fasteners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
