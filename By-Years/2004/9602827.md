Hunter College, the largest senior college of the City University of New York,
is a public urban institution with a diverse student body. The College plays a
vital role in providing a quality education, both graduate and undergraduate for
first generation college students in New York City. One of the College's
objectives is to increase the number of minority faculty who can serve as role
models, since a large percentage of the student body consists of women and
minorities. The Department of Biology has been very instrumental in developing
young research scholars, and is emerging as a center of research excellence. In
order to maintain this momentum, the research capabilities of the faculty must
be enhanced, and this involves the renovating of laboratories and the creation
of core facilities. Funding received from the ARI Program will be used to assist
Hunter College in this endeavor by renovating a faculty research laboratory, and
establishing a Bio-Imaging facility for research training in the 1940 North
Building. The renovation of existing research and training space into an
integrated Bio-Imaging facility and research laboratory is critical to current
research involving studies of the molecular organization and the molecular
interaction of cellular components, including nucleic acid-protein, protein-
protein, and protein-ligand interactions. These underlie ongoing studies for
gene structure and function, signal transduction, nerve regeneration, immune
cell differentiation, the cytoskeleton, and neuropharmacology. The facility will
provide a centralized location for the consolidation of existing bio-imaging
equipment, and will provide a dedicated area where students can receive
invaluable training by learning modern research techniques. This renovation
project, in conjunction with Hunter's participation in the NSF Alliance for
Minority Participation Program, will contribute to the institution's mission in
preparing qualified scientists for the 21st century.
