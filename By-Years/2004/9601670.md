Infrastructure: Development of Specialized Communications and Terminal Equipment
for Research in Information Technology and Education Technology This Academic
Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a networked human
factors experimental facility. The projects supported by this equipment include:
1. Multimodal human-computer dialogue. 2. Computer sensor instrumentation and
their integration. 3. Accessibility to large multimodal databases by novel query
methodologies. 4. Experimentation with various virtual environments in
collaboration with psychologists and educational researchers. 5. Experimentation
and development of software engineering environments to support human-computer
interaction software development and usability assessment.
