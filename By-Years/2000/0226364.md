&lt;br/&gt;The performance of particle-polymer composite systems is critically
dependent on the nature of the solid-matrix interface. Methods to integrate
different surface chemistry and functionality on small particles will play a
vital role in next generation composites. This work explores the utility of a
novel FR-plasma conformal particle coating technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
work will encompass both the effects of monomer sources and reactor conditions
on coating composition, thickness and uniformity. These attributes will be
investigated using FTIR (-ATR), TEM and XPS. Work will also explore the effects
of coating composition on the dispersion and rheological behavior of highly
filled A1N and BN/polymer systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The preliminary work
has been sponsored with seed funding from the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Micro-Engineered Materials at the University of New Mexico.
