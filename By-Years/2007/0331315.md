DMS-0331315&lt;br/&gt;Angela Gibney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The moduli space of
curves is an algebraic variety (more accurately a&lt;br/&gt;scheme or a stack)
whose points parametrize isomorphism classes of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic curves of
genus g. In studying the behavior of families of&lt;br/&gt;curves, it is useful
to consider each curve as a point in the moduli &lt;br/&gt;space, or in the
natural projective closure (called the Deligne-Mumford
&lt;br/&gt;compactification) whose points correspond to curves with at most
&lt;br/&gt;nodal singularities. The components of the boundary are the images of
&lt;br/&gt;maps from moduli spaces of stable n-pointed curves. In fact, it turns
&lt;br/&gt;out that the birational geometry of these various moduli spaces of
&lt;br/&gt;curves frequently reveals interesting properties of families of
curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most fruitful ways to study the
birational geometry of&lt;br/&gt;projective varieties is to investigate the
divisors and curves on them. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, it is a fundamental
problem to describe the effective &lt;br/&gt;and nef cones of divisors, and
hence the effective cone of curves of &lt;br/&gt;these spaces. The research
program to be pursued is a many faceted &lt;br/&gt;attack on this problem. The
goal is to provide further clarification &lt;br/&gt;of the nature of these
cones, the relationships between them as well &lt;br/&gt;as to provide a
collection of rich examples which would deepen &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the
birational geometry of the moduli spaces and &lt;br/&gt;also broaden general
knowledge about cones of curves and divisors.&lt;br/&gt;
