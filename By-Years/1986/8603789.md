This is one of the three projects supported to study the state-of-the-art
methods for earthquake-resistant, reinforced concrete buildings in design,
safety, and evaluation on the basis of the March l985 Chilean earthquake. Three
damaged and three selected buildings with light damage will be used to calibrate
methods for analysis (at various levels of sophistication) and for structural-
detail requirements. The methods are evaluated in terms of the vulnerability of
the damaged buildings, as well as the safety of the buildings that were not
damaged. Hardware and software to store, retrieve, and disseminate large amounts
of text, numerical data, and drawings are designed. The studies are conducted in
cooperation with the Chilean investigators to produce methods of analysis and
detail requirements for construction in zones of moderate, as well as high
seismicity.
