Computational techniques are revolutionizing the way in which research is
conducted in science and engineering. However, even in domains that seem closely
liked, such as biology, medicine, and drug discovery, research advances are not
broadly disseminated and do not become widely known. This conference would bring
together computational scientists from these three areas and foster
collaborations. A set of outstanding researchers from around the world have
agreed to structure this new effort. The three day meeting meeting, in Orland
Florida, would have participation by students through travel grants. This
building of the next generation of computing science in different application
areas is one of the key outcomes of this meeting. In addition, the selected
papers will be made available online. In addition, some of the papers will be
published through BioMed Central, which has reduced the costs for this new
meeting. Bringing together academic and industry researchers to consider the
latest advances in computational methods will promote the rapid transfer of
results from research to products and technologies.
