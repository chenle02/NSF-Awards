The present study concerns how the acquisition of social information,
specifically knowledge about personal characteristics, influences young
children's ability to recall and report information. Two forms of social
knowledge will be systematically examined, familiarity and stereotypes. Research
on stereotypes and generalized event representations in particular suggests that
development differences exist in semantic-memory dependence for recollection,
with younger children at times being more semantic-memory dependent than are
older children. The present study examines this notion in the context of
children's memory for a one-time event. One hundred forty eight 4- to 5-year
olds will participate. The study will conform to a 2 (age) x 2 (stereotype
treatment) x 2 (familiarity treatment) x 2 (interview session) factorial design.
Results will have theoretical and applied implications relevant to memory
development generally and to child eyewitness memory specifically.
