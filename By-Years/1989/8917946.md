The primary objective of this U.S.-Romania cooperative research project between
Dr. Floyd McDaniel of the University of North Texas and Dr. Valerie Zoran of the
Romanian Central Institute of Physics is to measure and calculate the main
atomic processes involved in inner-shell vacancy production in asymmetric ion-
atom collisions. These processes include direct ionization, electron capture,
and inter-and intra-shell vacancy transfer. In addition to refinements of
perturbed stationary state theories, results should yield shell ionization
probabilities for target and equilibrium charge states of ions, in solids over a
large ion energy range. This project in atomic physics fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
