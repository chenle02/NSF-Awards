This project will develop a model for preparing science and mathematics
teachers for elementary school. The model is comprehensive, beginning with the
students' first preservice courses through the first years of teaching. Project
faculty will develop courses that integrate content, learning theory, and
teaching strategies. Field experience and student teaching will take place in
the classroom of teachers whose philosophy and pedagogy are consistent with
project goals. A support network to ease the transition time from preservice to
inservice teaching will be developed among school administrators, university
faculty, educational service personnel, lead and mentor teachers, and graduates
of the project. This network will, at the same time, develop a broad base of
support for the project goals. Such a network of committed people involving so
many levels of our educational institutions will insure the continuation of the
project goals. The project will have approximately 25% cost sharing from the
institution.
