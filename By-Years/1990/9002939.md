This award supports the research in number theory of Professor Hendrik Lenstra
of the University of California at Berkeley. Dr. Lenstra has proposed to
continue his research in several directions. In primality testing and
factorization of large integers, he will study the newest factoring algorithm,
known as the Number Field Sieve, and work on the practical implementation of a
primality test. In algebraic number theory, he will investigate the existence of
governing fields and study the class group structure of abelian fields. Except
for counting, number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole
numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics. In modern days, problems in number
theory have furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the
fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most
astonishing applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer
science and coding theory.
