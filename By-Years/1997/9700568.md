EEC-9700568 Hendrickson ABSTRACT This award provides funding to Carnegie Mellon
University under the direction of Dr. Chris Hendrickson, for the support of a
Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Curriculum and
Educational Materials for Environmentally Conscious, Green Products and
Processes." This project's goals are to develop a series of project and topic
modules on green design and manufacturing that would be tested in the classroom
and documented in a manner to permit widespread dissemination and adoption. The
modules developed can be inserted in conventional design and environmental
courses within several engineering disciplines, including Chemical, Civil,
Electrical, Computer, Environmental, and Mechanical Engineering. Several modules
will also be developed suitable for business, history or society/technology
courses. Research results obtained from an on-going collaborative research
effort in green design supported by several industrial partners and Federal
agencies will be integrated into the curriculum.
