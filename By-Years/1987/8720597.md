This Accomplishment-Based Renewal award will enable Professor Golledge and his
collaborators to continue their research on how children and adults acquire,
process, and store information about new geographical environments. The purpose
of this research is to determine how people acquire the knowledge they need to
navigate in cities and other areas. Geographical knowledge acquisition and use
for navigation is analyzed in both field and laboratory settings. The previous
work on this topic conducted by Professor Golledge and his research team is
highly regarded. It has increased our understanding of how people identify
landmarks, learn routes, and integrate such knowledge into mental images of
neighborhoods and cities. This award will permit the investigators to elaborate
those understandings. Research findings resulting from this project have
important implications for theories and models of how children and adults learn
about spatial relationships generally and how they come to mentally visualize
local and larger areas.
