NSF SGER Proposal CMS-0422045&lt;br/&gt;Characterization and Modeling of Strain
Localization in Metal Foams&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kathleen A. Issen&lt;br/&gt;Clarkson
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research explores the hypothesis that localized planar compaction band formation
in high porosity materials is a common, perhaps inevitable, deformation mode,
analogous to the buckling of long, slender columns. Surface strain mapping
examines the transition in deformation behavior of uniaxially compressed
aluminum foams, from diffuse compaction to band formation. Scanning electron
microscopy and X-ray computed tomography are used to characterize the
microstructural deformation processes. Compaction bands are modeled as a
bifurcation from uniform deformation, due to a constitutive instability.
Therefore, theoretical work models the pre-localization inelastic response,
using continuum and micromechanics approaches. Combining results from this
project with the PI's sandstone research will enable development of a model to
predict compaction localization in various natural and manufactured porous
solids, with diverse microstructures and a broad range of applications. Strain
localization is a fundamental solid mechanics problem, and porous solids are an
economically and socially important class of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
