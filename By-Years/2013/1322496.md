This award provides support for students to attend the OSG User School and the
XSEDE-13 conference in San Diego. The participants will&lt;br/&gt;learn about
the advances and increased sophistication of research that are being enabled by
XSEDE and OSG.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will be through the direct
engagement of students who may, in the future, become&lt;br/&gt;researchers,
including underrepresented students, including those at Minority Serving
Institutions (MSIs)&lt;br/&gt;and smaller colleges and universities across the
country
