synthesis of these major approaches.

Second, it is the intent to develop a research methodology that can be adapted
for classroom use. Recent work by Li-Ping Ma has called attention to the ideas
of depth and connectivity of mathematical knowledge. The PI hopes to develop a
blend of qualitative and quantitative methods that can be used to analyze the
depth and connectivity of a student's mathematical knowledge. With the current
affordability of powerful computers, there has been a new push to use computer
analysis to gain insight into qualitative data. Existing software like Sacks
Conversation Map and Krackplot of social network theorists will be evaluated for
use in the math education setting, and new software will be developed as
necessary.

Third, the research results will be disseminated not only using the traditional
avenues of conferences and published papers, but also over the Internet in a
web-searchable database. The PI has considerable experience in such projects and
already runs two such servers: one is a database of educational resources for
the national community of Treisman workshop leaders and another one holds for
math and statistics education papers for the Special Interest Group on
Undergraduate Math Education of the MAA. Among the indexed and posted contents
will be classroom instruments along with examples of student work.

As a final benefit, student research assistants will play important roles in the
research, either graduate students or motivated advanced undergraduates. The
experience will be designed to cultivate an interest in math education in the
math majors chosen to work on the project, with an eye towards encouraging them
to pursue careers in math teaching or math education research.
