Dissertation Student, Jeffrey Brautigam; Dissertation Title: "Reading
Biometrika: An Inquiry into the Creation and Uses of Historical Identity in
Science." Under the direction of Dr. Frederick Gregory, Mr. Brautigam is
studying the formation and development of the biological and statistical
journal, Biometrika (first published in 1901), in order to learn about the
process by which identities are fashioned through various literary and
rhetorical strategies, for both scientific researches and their subjects. Mr.
Brautigam is examining the papers, correspondence, and notes of the founding
editors of Biometrika, to discern the way in which an ideologically charged core
identity of a "biometrician" was created. He is using the analysis of archival
materials to supplement and contrast an analysis of the icons, metaphors, and
historical narratives published in Biometrika, which attempted to communicate
that identity to its reader-contributors. He is also examining the notes of the
founding editors which pertain specifically to articles published in the journal
in order to reveal the ways in which the editorial policy of the journal created
and enforced certain notions of the proper biometric "subject." This archival
analysis compliments an analysis of the presentation of the "subjects" (men,
women, deviants, criminals, geniuses, etc.) in the journal itself.
