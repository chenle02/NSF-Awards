Almgren will continue his long term program of research in the geometric
calculus of variations and its applications. The objective is to seek a better
understanding of the geometric structure of surfaces minimizing the integrals of
parametric integrands. A specific example would be certain area minimizing
surfaces. He will also study the evolution of surfaces towards such minimization
and the feasibility of constructing algorithms with which to compute the
mathematical framework for these analyses and their applications in continuum
mechanics. A considerable effort will be devoted towards making many significant
results more accessible. Geometric measure theory has proved extremely powerful
in the hands of such practitioners as Almgren, but the techniques employed still
remain unknown to the majority of researchers. Amongst the new directions to be
followed will be investigations of relationships between area minimizing
currents and various energies of mappings from the ambient space to spheres.
Also work will be carried out into flows in spaces of rectifiable currents and
varifolds.
