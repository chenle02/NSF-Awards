9813520 Durrett There are many interesting mathematical problems that are
motivated by a desire to understand the workings of various biological systems.
In order to facilitate and stimulate interdisciplinary research, a workshop on
"Mathematical Problems in Biology" will be held at the Fields Institute for
Research in Mathematical Sciences, Toronto, Canada from June 14 to 24, 1999, as
part of a special year long program on Probability and its Applications.
Eighteen prominent biologists, mathematical biologists, and mathematicians, all
of whom are talented expositors, will give two one-hour lectures to an audience
of mostly young (postdoctoral) researchers. This award will allow fifteen US
postdoctoral researchers to participate and train themselves for research in
these exciting and important areas.
