This award by Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supports work by
Professor Yu Xia at Purdue University to develop and validate instrumentation
for implementing biomolecule ion/radical reactions on a linear ion trap mass
spectrometry (MS) system. A pulsed pyrolysis nozzle will be used to form and
transfer intense radical beams to a linear ion trap, where peptide ions are
stored for reactions. The performance of the modified instrument will be tested
from reactions between disulfide linked peptide ions and allyl or phenyl
radicals. It is a high risk/high reward project where efficient formation and
transfer of radicals into high vacuum is a challenging task. Yet the learned
knowledge will not only enable better understanding of biomolecular ion/radical
reactions, but also provide a viable platform to study other gas-phase reactions
important to combustion processes and atmospheric chemistry.

The proposed research and education activities emphasize the role of integrated
fundamental scientific research and instrumentation, which establishes excellent
training ground for both graduate and undergraduate students in analytical
chemistry. Female and minority students will be mentored in this program and be
participating in Purdue AGEP (Midwest Crossroads Alliance for Graduate Education
and the Professoriate) events.
