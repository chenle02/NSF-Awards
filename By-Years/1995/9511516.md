9511516 Hiltner This award provides funding for a collaborative effort ("TIE"
project) between two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers. The
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Sensors and
Actuators (BSAC) will be developing an Acoustic Microsensor to be mounted on
plastic and composite test panels for space applications by the I/UCRC for
Applied Polymers (CAPRI). The I/UCRC for Sensors and Actuators at the University
of California, Berkeley will build upon its experience to develop and evaluate
an advanced micro-acoustic sensor for detecting and monitoring space particle
impact in low earth orbit. The sensors will be mounted on plastic and composite
panels by the I/UCRC for Applied Polymers at Case Western Reserve University for
space flight tests on the materials flight experiment carrier, MFLEX. The
researchers are internationally recognized scientists and are well qualified to
perform this project. The Program Manager recommends Case Western Reserve
University be awarded $50,000 for two years for this "TIE" project with the
University of California, Berkeley.
