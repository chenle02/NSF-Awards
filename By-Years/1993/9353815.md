9353815 Holland This proposal requests partial funding for a four-day workshop
of selected members of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) to develop a
strategic plan for the recruitment and retention of women and minorities in the
field of ecology. ESA is the major scientific society for ecologists in the
United States with a membership of approximately 7,000. The impetus for this
proposal was a survey of the association membership which indicated that women
and minorities are underrepresented in this field. ***
