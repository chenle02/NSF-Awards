DMS-9500491 Shiffman Shiffman will continue his research on complex varieties
and meromorphic mappings. He will investigate the Kabayashi-Royden infinitesimal
pseudometric and Kobayashi pseudodistane with a goal towards obtaining a better
understanding of the concept of hyperbolicity for projective manifolds. He will
also return to the topic of value distribution theory and will seek new defect
relations for meromorphic maps and for sections of vector bundles. Several
complex variables arose at the beginning of the century as a natural outgrowth
of studies of functions of one complex variable. It became clear early on that
the theory differed widely from it predecessor. The underlying geometry was far
more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity with
partial differential operators of first order. It thus grew as a hybrid subject
combining deep characteristics of differential geometry and differential
equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in the last three
decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic
mathematical forms.
