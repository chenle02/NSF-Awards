9316015 Aupperle This proposal requests $586,000 for twelve months to establish
a node ("CNSS") on the ANSNET Backbone at Albuquerque, with tail circuits to
end-nodes ("ENSS") at Phillips and SNLA. Funding for this effort is being
provided entirely by the Air Force and the Department of Energy. Since the
traffic to be carried over this segment of the ANSNET Backbone is entirely for
the purposes of research and education consistent with the NSFNET Backbone
Services Acceptable Use Policy, full connectivity will be established with the
rest of the NSFNET; the node in Albuquerque becomes therefore essentially
another connection for the NSFNET Backbone Service. IN addition to supporting
the open networking needs of its sponsors (USAF and DoE), this project is
intended to be used by New Mexico's higher education, pre-college, and informal
education communities to support the general goals of the National Research and
Education Network (NREN) program; it is also consistent with Presidential and
Congressional intent for the National Information Infrastructure.
