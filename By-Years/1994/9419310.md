9419310 Licht This project will examine the molecular biology and physiology of
an unusual dual-function blood binding protein. Based on preliminary data, this
protein has structural similarity to vitamin-D-binding protein (VDBP), but Dr.
Licht has determined that it also serves as a high affinity thyroid hormone
binding protein (TBP); normally these two hormones are transported by very
different types of protein. He will attempt to identify the structural features
that permit this mixed function and study how the synthesis of the binding
protein in the liver is regulated by hormones in order to test the hypothesis
that it may be involved in the thyroidal regulation of growth or vitamin D
utilization. ***
