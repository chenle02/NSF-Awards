9322083 Vanasupa Recent technological developments in microelectronic processing
demonstrate that electrolessly deposited copper(Cu) is a viable replacement for
aluminum (A1) alloys as an interconnect material for large scale and ultra-large
scale integrated circuits. Most of the studies concerning this material have
focused on the resulting electrical properties of electrolessly deposited Cu
films. This project uses atomic force microscopy to study the physical
deposition mechanisms (nucleation and growth) of the films in situ. Scanning
tunneling microscopy and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction will provide
additional crystallographic information. The electrical performance of the films
will also be evaluated. Through this study we will gain insight into the
relationship between the deposition conditions and the resulting microstructure
and properties. A greater understanding of the physical deposition mechanism of
the electrolessly deposited Cu will allow better control of the deposition
process and the film properties. ***
