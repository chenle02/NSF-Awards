This award funds a five-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
at Boston University for 15 undergraduate students per year for research
opportunities within the context of ongoing research programs in the Biomedical
Engineering Department. Student participants will work on individual projects as
members of research teams in the laboratories of participating research
investigators. During the program, group sessions will be used to provide a
forum for presentations and group discussions of topics intended to supplement
the research experiences and encourage the interns to pursue graduate training
in biomedical engineering. Session topics will include presentations on how to
pursue independent research; the available options for graduate study in
biomedical engineering; the myths and realities of research careers; and how to
make oral and written presentations. The goal of the program is to provide
stimulating and intellectually challenging hands-on opportunities in biomedical
engineering research to undergraduates in a supportive environment. Students
will be recruited from colleges and universities from around the country.
Applications will be especially encouraged from students from population groups
underrepresented in research fields in engineering.
