The explicit modeling of rain and all its applications, such as basin.scale
hydrology, require complete description of the structure of the rain field in
both space and time; an accurate determination of the temporal and spatial
scaling parameters is therefore important. Previous research in the spatial
domain suggests that the rain field exhibits an anisotropic scaling
characterized by an elliptical dimension of about 2.22. Under this project,
Professor Tsonis will extend the fractal analysis to the time domain. The
analysis will provide necessary scaling parameters for characterizing the
evolution of rain and will also serve as a direct test of Taylor's hypothesis of
"frozen turbulence".
