The development of a thin film vacuum deposition process suitable for the
fabrication of superconducting microwave circuit elements based on high Tc
yttrium-barium-copper-oxide is proposed. The dual ion beam fabrication method
will facilitate low temperature deposition of dense epitaxial films of uniform
stoichiometry on semiconducting or insulating substrates. As such, this
technology will alleviate many of the complications implicit in present high Tc
deposition techniques such as high process temperatures and limited
applicability of compatible substrate materials. Since most high performance
devices will require the achievement of high critical current densities in
deposited films, a method is proposed by which continuity, epitaxy, and
stoichiometry are encouraged in the growth of the superconducting film. Ion and
neutral beam assisted deposition will be used to promote low temperature
epitaxial growth achieving dense films with the desired (001) texture and
appropriate cation and oxygen stoichiometry. The deposition scheme will avoid
high temperature annealing so that high critical current density films can be
grown directly onto a variety of important substrates without harmful
interdiffusion effects. Device structures and superconducting properties
appropriate for Josephson junction devices, microstrips, and chirp filters will
be sought.
