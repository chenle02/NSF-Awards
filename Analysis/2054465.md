This research project covers a range of questions central to classical analysis,
spectral theory, and partial differential equations. The project focuses on
rigorous underpinning of mathematical models for some essential phenomena in
physics, such as electromagnetic and acoustic wave propagation in rough or
random media. The goal is to develop analytical tools with a range of
applications, including the fields of probability and the theory of stochastic
processes. The project will employ tools from harmonic and complex analysis
including wave packet decomposition, weighted estimates for singular integral
operators, and time-frequency analysis. Mentoring students and junior
researchers will be an integral part of the project.

This project will investigate the properties of several classical orthogonal
systems and the operators generated by them. This includes studying the size of
orthogonal polynomials for different types of measures, understanding the
connection between spectral theory of Jacobi matrices on trees and the concept
of multiple orthogonality, and generalization of one-dimensional results to the
case of multiple orthogonality. A significant part of the project will focus on
developing the Szeg√∂ theory for de Branges canonical systems and Krein strings
and possible application of these results to nonlinear evolution equations.
Scattering theory for elliptic equations in higher dimensions will also be
investigated, and related questions of energy cascade in linear evolution
equations will be considered.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
