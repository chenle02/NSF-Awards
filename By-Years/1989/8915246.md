This project will conduct preliminary investigations of biosensors based on
biological receptor proteins capacitively coupled to solid-state devices.
Building on earlier work by Eldefrawi, it will try to simplify the underlying
design, and explain the successes achieved so far in this approach. Biosensors
of this class are quite novel, and could have applications to sensing functions
as broad in scope as those of biological sensors--which detect light, gasses,
etc. The protein used in these experiments will be rhodopsin.
