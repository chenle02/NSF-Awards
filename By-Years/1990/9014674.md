A collaboration will be established between the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, under the direction
of Dr. Larry Smarr, and Computational Molecular Biology Group at Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory, under the direction of Dr. Thomas Marr. This collaboration
will demonstrate how advanced computing technology and software tools can be
applied to solve a variety of problems in molecular biology. Immediate attention
will be directed to building a program interface and a user interface into
geographically distributed biological databases. The program and user interfaces
will provide a unified environment for query, retrieval, and analysis of data
residing on geographically separated computers. Specifically, the project will
involve building a Macintosh-based front end system to permit relatively
computer-naive scientists interactive access into the full information content
of the new, relational version of GenBank, running on a remotely located server
accessible over a T-1 internet connection. In addition, investigations will be
made into the feasibility of using object- oriented database technology for
managing genomic data.
