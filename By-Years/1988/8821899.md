The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst, supports interactive and inter- disciplinary research related to
polymer science and engineering. The research is organized into three primary
thrust areas. Research on pattern formation in polymer systems involves
investigators from chemistry, polymer science and engineering and chemical
engineering and emphasizes the dynamics of pattern formation in polymers rather
than the morphology itself. The thrust on ordered polymeric solids brings
together faculty and students from chemistry and from polymer science and
engineering to address questions of order in crystalline and liquid crystalline
polymers, periodic morphologies in polymer blends and block copolymers, and
synthesis of new polymers with precisely defined structures. Research on
polymers in restricted geometries addresses polymers at surfaces, thin films,
the dynamics and behavior of polymers in ordered and disordered systems, and
transport phenomena, and involves investigators from physics, chemical
engineering, and polymer science and engineering. The MRL also supports the
development, operation and maintenance of major central materials research
facilities on the Amherst campus, and provides seed funding for new faculty and
high-risk research related to its overall program. The program presently
involves 15 faculty members, 5 postdoctoral research associates, 2 other
technical professionals, 16 graduate students and 6 undergraduates. The MRL at
the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, is under the direction of Professor
Shaw Ling Hsu.
