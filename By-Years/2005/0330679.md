This award provides partial support of a workshop intended to contribute to the
development of a strategic plan for use of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
Jasper Ridge has a history of combining a core of long-term research with a
variety of short-term projects representing a broad range of disciplines and
diverse community of researchers. Areas of research strength include: multi-
disciplinary studies of global change; biological invasions; biogeochemistry;
conservation biology; and landscape and community ecology. Increasing demand for
research, education, and public outreach access have raised important questions
about the balance and integration of efforts in all three areas. Thus the
University has convened a strategic planning committee to develop a plan for the
Preserve. As part of this effort, the workshop supported through this award will
bring seven outside researchers and educators to the Preserve for discussion of
the management challenges facing the Preserve in the coming years. The
participants, researchers and field station managers of national or
international stature, will produce a written report to the planning committee
with an assessment of the adequacy of Preserve resources and recommendations for
improvements in Preserve management and policy.&lt;br/&gt;
