The purpose of this project is to conduct a longitudinal study that will
investigate, over a period of two years, teh constructive paths that children
generate when solving problematic situations that deal with fractional numbers,
and the communication patterns that they develop in their efforts to explain
their solutions. Twelve children will participate in the study when they are in
third grade and again when they are in fourth grade. The researchers will
develop models of the children's constructive processes in generating fractional
numbers and will also develop models of the communication patterns of student-
student and student-teacher social interaction. Several research questions form
the basis of this longitudinal study: Is children's ability to construct and
operate with different composite units essential in the construction of part-
whole relations that children can quantify fractionally using the multiplicity
of the parts in the whole? Does conventional symbolization of fractions require
a priori developmental constructive processes of the concept of fractions before
it becomes meaningful to a child? Do children generate their own algorithms to
operate with fractions? Are these algorithms similar to the conventional ones?
What do children gain cognitively from social interaction and under what
circumstances? What aspects of social interaction contribute to children's
advances of their fraction concepts? Are there differences in the role of social
interaction depending on the child's age? The results of this project will
contribute to the understanding of 1) children's conceptualizations of fractions
over a long period of time (two years); 2) the influence of their knowledge of
natural numbers on the constructive development of fractional numbers; 3) the
role of social interaction (with peers and teacher) in the construction and
evolution of children's concepts of fractions; 4) the cognitive demands required
to symbolize concepts that had been developed mentally and verbalized using
natural language.
