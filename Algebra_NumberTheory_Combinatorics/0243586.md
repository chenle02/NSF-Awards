Abstract for award of Hindman DMS-0243586

The principal investigator and his students will continue the investigation of
the algebraic scructure of the Stone-Cech compactification of a discrete
semigroup and its applications to Ramsey Theory. Significant progress continues
to be made in both areas, but much remains to be done. Among the major algebraic
problems which is still unsolved is whether there is a nontrivial continuous
homomorphism from the Stone-Cech compactification of the positive integers to
its remainder, N*. That question can be stated equivalently as whether there is
a finite subsemgroup of N* whose members are not all idempotents.

The proposed algebraic studies have significant potential applications to Ramsey
Theory -- that part of combinatorics which establishes the existence of highly
regular substructures of given structures that are partitioned into finitely
many classes (or "finitely colored"). One of the earliest applications of the
algebra of the Stone-Cech compactification to Ramsey Theory was a simple proof
of the following statement: If the positive integers are colored red and blue,
then there is either a sequence all of whose sums (without repetition) are red
or there is a sequence all of whose sums are blue. Additional applications
continue to be discovered.
