Bass&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0106655&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to
partially support a two-day workshop entitled "Phase Transitions and Mantle
Discontinuities". The workshop will be held on April 5-6, 2001, at the
GeoForschungsZentrum in Potsdam, Germany. The aim of this workshop is to bring
together researchers from a variety of disciplines to examine what is known, as
well as what is not understood, about seismic discontinuities in the mantle and
their implications for the state of the Earth's deep interior. The scientific
program will include presentations in the areas of seismology, mineral physics,
geodynamics, and geochemistry, each of which provides an opportunity to present
and debate new results with colleagues in related but distinct disciplines, and
to summarize the state or our understanding in several areas related to the
Earth's mantle. A high degree of cross-fertilization between disciplines is one
of goals of the workshop. Funds will be allocated primarily to offset expenses
associated with the travel and participation of U.S. graduate students in the
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;
