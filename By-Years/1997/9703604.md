In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Scoles will apply double resonance infrared molecular beam
laser spectroscopy to the study of various chemical problems. Work will continue
on Intramolecular Vibrational Relaxation (IVR) applied to molecules at
increasingly higher energies, and new work will commence applying helium droplet
isolation infrared spectroscopy to examining loosely bound complexes and free
radicals in order to understand three-body forces and solute-solvent
interactions. Molecules to be investigated include linear hydrogen-bonding
species, complexes containing oxygen atoms, and simple molecules like propyne
which are solvated by helium. In these studies Scoles will be examining
molecules which are highly energized in terms of the internal motions of the
atoms relative to one another. Such molecules are usually more reactive than
they are in their unenergized state. This work will also shed light on the
effect of solvents on such fundamental atomic and molecular interactions as
chemical reactions. Hence, this project will be able to shed some light on many
different types of chemical processes, from combustion to surface oxidation and
catalysis.
