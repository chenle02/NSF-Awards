9453072 Keller The project is a dissemination/communication activity related to
written, electronic, and human resources that promote science education for
students with disabilities. The project is designed to provide the more than 20
thousand K-12 science teachers and administrators attending the 1995 annual
conference of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) with information
that promote inclusion of students with disabilities in precollege science
education. The dissemination activities are to be conducted at the Convention
Exhibition Area during the 1995 NSTA Conference in Philadelphia. Project
participants have extensive experience and expertise in science education for
students with disabilities. Members of the Science Association for Persons with
Disabilities (SAPD) will assist in staffing the exhibit. (Many of these experts
have disabilities.) Project participants will accumulate and reproduce materials
for distribution at the meeting. Other materials will be exhibited and requests
for copies will be taken and subsequently mailed. Records of the materials
disseminated and other activities including on-site interactions during the five
days of the exhibit will be maintained and reported. The project should result
in heightened awareness of K-12 science teachers to the abilities of students
with disabilities to perform successfully in precollege science, and knowledge
regarding the availability of resources should result in increased inclusion of
these students in science education.***
