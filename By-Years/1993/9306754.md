9306754 Pielke The poorly understood impact of a variety of land/surface factors
on the atmosphere is one of the major uncertainties limiting atmospheric
predictability. The Principal Investigator will continue an ongoing research
program studying land/surface processes with the following four specific goals:
1. Validation of a vegetation/soil parameterization and exploring coupling of a
mesoscale atmospheric numerical model to an ecosystem dynamic model. 2.
Investigation of the effect of landscape patchiness on: boundary layer
structure; development of mesoscale thermally-forced flows and deep cumulus
convection. An emphasis will be placed on effects of Amazon deforestation. 3.
Evaluation of the predictability of atmospheric flows as a function of spatial
scales of land/surface patchiness. This includes further investigation of the
hypotheses that inhomogeneous land/surface features can improve predictability
as compared to a homogenous surface. 4. Development of a parameterization of
landscape effects for large-scale atmospheric models. If successful, this
research will produce better land/surface parameterizations which will lead to
improvements in atmospheric numerical modeling including both short term
forecasting (mesoscale) and climate modeling. ***
