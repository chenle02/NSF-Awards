Formalizing diagnostic reasoning is a necessary aspect of creating useful
diagnostic tools. Even though much progress has been made, there are several
deficiencies in the existing formalization. These include the definition of
diagnostic reasoning as a single- stage process which is independent of the use
of the diagnosis, of tests which can be done to clarify the hypothesized
diagnoses, or of the utility associated with the treatment of the abnormalities.
This research proposes a sequential decision framework for diagnostic reasoning
which overcomes many of these deficiencies. A key new intuition for this
approach is modeling diagnostic reasoning as a process which consists not solely
as a single step of computing a diagnosis (as there is considerable controversy
over what a diagnosis actually is, even given the same input data); instead, it
is a multi-stage decision process in which decisions about testing and
treatment, as well as scarce resource and utility considerations, are crucial
parts of the model. This framework extends most existing formalization of
diagnostic reasoning to incorporate important aspects of the diagnostic process.
Two applications of the framework to diagnostic systems are investigated in this
research. The first application (which has been implemented) is a Markov
decision network model for the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain. The second
application is a sequential process of consistency-based diagnosis interleaved
with tests, for diagnosing Boolean circuits. //
