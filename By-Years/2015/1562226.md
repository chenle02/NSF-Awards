Superhard, wear resistant materials are widely used by the automotive,
aerospace, oil and gas, and any manufacturing industry that relies on drilling,
cutting, and grinding. Yet, the synthesis of most materials employed for these
applications, such as polycrystalline diamond, require high temperatures and
extreme pressures, which escalates their cost. A class of materials known as
transition metal borides are more easily processed making them viable
alternatives; however, they contain expensive and exceedingly scarce metals.
This award supports the fundamental research necessary to discover new, low-cost
synthetic processes for novel superhard, wear resistant materials that
incorporate earth-abundant elements. Achieving these research goals will require
the integration of materials engineering, chemistry, computational physics, and
data mining. This coordinated approach will not only lead to higher performance
materials but it also has the potential to transform many manufacturing
processes by replacing current systems with sustainable, cost-effective
alternatives. Further, this award will be used to teach undergraduate and
graduate students how to address materials design problems through a multi-
disciplinary, holistic picture that includes both performance and resource
considerations. Teaching the next generation of STEM students how fundamental
chemical research can lead to applied materials engineering is essential for
global competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;Â &lt;br/&gt;The development of earth-abundant,
superhard materials will employ informatics and computation to screen ternary
intermetallic boride and carbide phase space. In combination, this approach will
guide the experimental identification of novel crystal structures with
outstanding mechanical properties. The research team will develop energy
efficient microwave heating, induction heating, and solution-based synthesis to
overcome the conventional high temperatures and pressures required to prepare
these materials. Additionally, novel mechanochemical experiments using in-situ
nanoindentation coupled with IR spectroscopy, in conjunction with first
principles electronic structure theory, will establish the fundamental
mechanisms of mechanical deformation. These experiments will serve to validate
the computationally screened compounds as well as reveal opportunities to
optimize chemical bonding interactions further enhancing the mechanical
response. The result will inform the future advancement of engineering materials
by producing a methodological framework to understand the mechanics of disparate
classes of complex inorganic solids.
