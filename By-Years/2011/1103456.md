This is a Post Doctoral Fellowship project for Dr. Medea Csobas-DeHass to study
with Arctic Ethnohistorian Dr. Sergei Kan at Dartmouth College. During her
tenure at Darmouth, Dr. Csoba-DeHass would work closely with the Sugpiaq
communities in the Lower Kenai Region of Alaska to compile an ethnohistory of
the Sugpiaq that would include an analysis of their epistemological views of on
their own cultural history. In addition, Dr. Csoba-DeHass would create K-12
educational materials for use in local schools. While at Dartmouth University
she has been invited to participate as a visiting fellow in the Institute of
Arctic Studies, which will give Dr. Csoba-DeHass the opportunity to participate
in IAS activities that highlight Arctic scholars and their research.
