This dissertation research grant will support an anthropology graduate student
investigating peasant responses to state divestment and reprivatization of the
Mexican sugar industry. The Mexican state recently sold the majority of its
sugar mills to national and transnational corporations, thus weakening the
relationship between the cane producers unions and the state. The research will
examine how this divestment affects local peasant producers. Hypotheses to be
tested are that credit will be distributed more unevenly, socioeconomic
differentiation will increase in general, local level decision making over
production will decrease, and that the state will mediate between unions and
mill owners. Methods include a census of one village, participant observation of
producers, unions, and mills, structured interviews, oral histories, archival
data. This research is important because it will help us understand the
strategies rural producers adopt in the face of changes in corporate ownership
of economic institutions. This knowledge is critical to the resolution of
political unrest attendant on increased societal problems associated with debt
restructuring in the Third World.
