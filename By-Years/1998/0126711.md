Mathematical Sciences (21). An "investigative classroom" is being established to
give students writing space, personal access to Internet connected computers,
space for collaborative work, and visual access to a SMART Board. The approach
blends active learning, collaborative work among students, instructor led
electronic demonstrations, and a minimal amount of lecturing. Instead learning
activities are being implemented that exploit a variety of applications-oriented
materials developed for calculus I and II over the last eight years under the
aegis of NSF and other institutions. Collaborative, investigative exercises that
start in class are used to generate longer-term group projects; and a computer
algebra system, Maple, and the TI-89 calculator are used as aids to
visualization and exploration.
