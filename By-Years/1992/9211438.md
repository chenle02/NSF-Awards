The investigator is developing a calculus of stochastic partial differential
equations (SPDEs) for the distribution of particles and vortices. These SPDEs
are partial differential equations (PDEs) of parabolic type which are corrected
by an additional fluctuation term. The fluctuation term has to be derived from
the particle distribution. One of the advantages of this approach is that all
quantities in the SPDE can be interpreted in physical terms, and conservation
laws will hold for the SPDE if they hold for the underlying physical model. The
investigator is developing a method of studying stochastic systems which arise
in theoretical physics, fluid dynamics, chemistry and various fields of
mathematics. The quantities in the models can be interpreted in physical terms,
which should help in the analysis.
