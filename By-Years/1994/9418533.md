9418533 Rajala The North Carolina State University Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Computing and Communication is becoming
a multi-university Center with the addition of a research site at Duke
University. Four companies are becoming part of the Center inconjunction with
Duke University becoming a research site. The research agenda of the new multi-
site Center will address high- speed networking, reliable and fault-tolerant
systems, digital communication systems, distributed systems, and algorithms and
digital image processing algorithms. The researchers are well qualified to
perform the Center's research program. The Center is being co-funded with Dr.
Yechelzkel Zalcstein in the Division of Computer and Computation Research. The
Program Manager recommends North Carolina State University be awarded $55,000
for the first year of a five-year continuing award. This includes $5,000 for an
evaluator for the Center. Funding for the second year is to be at the same level
amount. Funding for years three through five will be at $30,000 per year
(including $5,000 for an evaluator.) Near the end of each 12-month period the
Program Manager and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Education Center
Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria
requirements, including the following: 1) the extent to which the
industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the
support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a robust research program
is developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend
support for the next period of this continuing award.
