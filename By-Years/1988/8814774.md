This award will support international collaborative research to be carried out
by Dr. Stuart A. Stock, Georgia Institute of Technology, Dr. D. K. Bowen,
University of Warwick and Dr. J. C. Elliot, London Hospital Medical College,
University of London. The objective of the joint work is to gain understanding
and knowledge about the development of x-ray microprobes based on intense
synchrotron radiation sources. Application of synchrotron radiation to materials
research has been an active and vital field of research and has received
attention by a wide range of scientific professionals, including physicists,
chemists, engineers, biologists and medical doctors. The proposed work will
focus on the development of novel x-ray methods (microtomography, topographic
EXAFS, and synchrotron x-ray fluorescent trace element analysis and mapping) and
will have a significant impact on the non-destructive characterization of a
great variety of material systems. The British collaborators have a strong
commitment to the development of state of the art technique in topography,
microradiography and microtomography and are international leaders in these
areas.
