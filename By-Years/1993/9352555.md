Sixteen Apple Mac IIvx computer stations are used in an introductory laboratory
curriculum for undergraduate non- scientists to improve the knowledge, skills,
and enjoyment of non-science students by placing laboratory activities into more
relevant contexts and providing a variety of methods by which learning can take
place. Hands-on investigative activities are the central focus of each lab
session. By integrating computer-based multimedia instruction into the
curriculum the active learning that occurs through experimentation is extended
and the understanding of biological principles furthered.
