This U.S.-Brazil award will help to support the travel of students from the
United States and several developing countries to the 2003 International
Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) School/Workshop on Instrumentation in
Elementary Particle Physics to be held. The school will be held on the island of
Itacuruca near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on December 8-19, 2003. Organized by Dr.
Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, together with Professor
Joao dos Anjos of the Centro de Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF), Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, the goal of this school is to encourage instrumentation skills by
developing-country physicists at their home institutions, and to foster
collaboration between U.S. physicists at an early stage in their careers with
their peers from elsewhere in the world. It is expected that this workshop will
provide researchers from the hemisphere with instrumentation skills useful for
particle, nuclear, medical and other subdisciplines of physics.

The previous nine schools/workshops in the series have been held in Europe,
Asia, and the Americas. This activity helps foster possible future research and
collaborations in elementary particle physics between young U.S.-based
researchers and young researchers from developing countries. Applications to
medicine and industrial processes of the instrumentation discussed in this
school include imaging, fast communication, and massive data acquisition and
retrieval. This award is funded by the Americas Program in the Office of
International Science and Engineering and the Elementary Particle Physics
Program in the Division of Physics.
