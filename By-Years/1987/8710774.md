This award supports a three year program to measure new production in the
eastern equatorial Pacific and to quantitatively test models that predict new
production from other indexes of surface water production. The field work will
be done as part of on an already funded project by NOAA and in collaboration
with other NSF investigators. New production is related to the amount of carbon
lost from ocean surface waters and the eastern equatorial Pacific is thought to
be a very active area for new production. This work forms part of evolving
efforts in Global Ocean Flux Studies (GOFS) that are partially supported by
Biological Oceanography.
