This project, carried out at the phonetics laboratory of the University of
California, Los Angeles, provides a formal phonetic basis for the features used
in phonological theory by making a full account of the complete range of the
linguistic phonetic events in the world's languages and their articulatory-
acoustic relations. It builds on previous research carried on at the laboratory
and fills in existing gaps. It will provide a computer model that interprets
linguistic descriptions in terms of features and specifies the corresponding
articulatory and acoustic events, thereby making evident what an adequate
phonological theory must encompass.
