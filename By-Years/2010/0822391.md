The project addresses the relatively poor mathematics achievement of students
who are not proficient in English. It includes research on how English Language
Learners in beginning algebra classes solve math word problems with different
text characteristics. The results of this research inform the development of
technology-based resources to support English Language Learners? ability to
learn mathematics through instruction in English, including tutorials in math
vocabulary and interactive assistance with forming equations from word problem
text. RAND-Education serves as the evaluator for formative and summative
activities, guided by an advisory board of experts in mathematics education and
English Learner education.
