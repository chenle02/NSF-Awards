This study proposes to investigate how computer and communications technology
can influence teaching and learning paradigms in engineering education in the
next decade. Recognizing that (1) pedagogical models for engineering education
have remained relatively unchanged for almost half a century and that (2)
advances in computer and communication technology make possible the
restructuring of the way engineering education is delivered, this study will
explore and contrast the ways in which technology can facilitate the delivery of
engineering education. The focus of the project is on how technology permits
more rapid and comprehensive delivery of engineering education, for example, by
using multimedia, distance education, intensive simulation experiences, virtual
realities and teamwork experiences. An emphasis is placed in this study on
understanding the relationship between predicted technology capabilities and how
these capabilities can influence pedagogical outcomes. Data are to be secured
from both academic and industrial groups and multiple scenarios are to be
evaluated in order to make recommendations about how public policy should be
formulated to best influence future directions in engineering education.
