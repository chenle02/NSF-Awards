A course, part of the new Manufacturing and Systems Engineering program, will be
developed. This laboratory based course, Quantitative Materials Measurement and
Assessment, will be taught in January, 1988. It will use the student's materials
manufacturing and statistics background to investigate state of the art
materials measurement techniques and their applications in manufacturing process
control. Students will test their knowledge of fundamental material phenomena
through projects, utilizing computer aided measurement and analysis equipment to
asses manufacturing process parameters. The equipment requested in this proposal
is a state of the art high resolution, computer driven image analysis system, a
dead weight loading micro hardness tester and precision diamond saw. Using this
equipment, the students will learn that the control of in- process and final
product quality begins with detailed knowledge of the material.
