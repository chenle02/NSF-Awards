The Third World Congress of the International Brain Research Organization
(IBRO) brings together outstanding neuroscientists from all over the world for a
week of symposia, lectures, and workshops in all areas of neuroscience. It
provides a valuable opportunity to promote or enhance international
collaborations, to enrich the international dialog on current issues, and to
exchange information on the latest techniques in this fast- moving,
interdisciplinary field. The Society for Neuroscience will use this support to
provide funding for travel to allow young investigators, particularly for
minority, women, or other underrepresented groups, to take advantage of this
major event to enlarge their horizons and career opportunities.
