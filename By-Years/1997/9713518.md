9713518 Runger This award provides funding to develop guidelines for a data
structure for multivariate statistical process control. A process control
algorithm should detect a process anomaly as quickly as possible, without
incurring excessive false alarms. However, in practice, (1) one can often select
from among many variables (even hundreds) that are available, (2) the time order
of the original data is not suitable for direct input into the algorithm, a
synchronization of variables is needed, (3) variables have different measurement
frequencies, (4) some variables are more responsive to process upsets than
others, (5) some variables can be computed as functions of the others, and (6) a
partition of selected variables is important to reduce complexity, improve
performance, and simplify the interpretation of the control algorithm. A
mathematical description of process data and process upsets will be used to
develop recommendations for preprocessing the data to address these issues.
Process data will be used to validate recommendations. If successful, this
project will affect the type and structure of process data that is collected for
process control. This will include the process measurements that are recorded,
the frequency of measurements, the time ordering of measurements, as well as how
the measurements will be allocated (or partitioned) to particular control
algorithms. Preliminary research has shown that a data structure is an important
element of a process control strategy that becomes a critical element as the
number of variables under analysis increase. Recommendations from this project
will provide a synergy between the data structures and the control algorithms to
increase the usefulness, application, and performance of control methods. The
results will also apply to data structures in areas such as neural networks,
data mining, and signal processing, as well as process control.
