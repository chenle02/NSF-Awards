The principal investigators will experimentally and theoretically investigate
cation and anion distributions in minerals, primarily using X-ray and neutron
diffraction techniques. They also will compile a large computer data base of
mineral crystal structure determinations, and in turn use the data base to
generate X-ray powder diffraction patterns for the same minerals. The results of
these efforts will provide basic data that is of interest to many earth
scientists, especially mineralogists and petrologists, as well as to
investigators in other disciplinary areas such as materials science.
