The discharge of nematocysts on sea anemone tentacles is regulated by
vibration-sensitive mechanoreceptors (VSMs). These VSMs have the useful
attribute of being tuned to lower frequencies by chemoreceptors for N-acetylated
sugars, and to higher frequencies by chemoreceptors for amino compounds. Thus,
frequency responsiveness can be modulated upward or downward depending on the
presence of different chemical agonists. Furthermore, the morphology of the VSMs
is significantly affected by the agonists. Exposure to N-acetylated sugars
induces the VSMs to elongate, whereas exposure to amino compounds induces the
VSMs to widen at the base. Hence, agonist effects on VSM structure can be
analyzed in relation to agonist effects on VSM function. In this project,
parallel studies will be conducted in which VSMs are measured, and nematocyst
discharge is tested after exposing sea anemeones to specific chemical agonists.
The resulting data will be used to develop models predicting frequency and
amplitude responsiveness according to the morphology of the VSMs. In addition,
the effects of agonists on the ultrastructure of stereocilia comprising the VSMs
will be determined. The proposed research will examine the relationship between
structure and function for dynamic VSMs, and open the door for investigations on
the molecular basis for VSM tuning. This project addresses a topic of
fundamental importance to the survival of primitive animals, in that the
research has direct implications for understanding how sea anemones select and
capture prey. The VSMs on the tentacles of sea anemones are similar in
morphology to the VSMs of the acousticolateralis system of vertebrates, in that
in each case the VSMs comprise a bundle of stereocilia. Because the sea anemone
VSMs are induced by chemoreceptors to alter their shape and responsiveness to
vibrations, they are ideally suited for evaluating structure in relation to
function. Furthermore, the project has relevance to the broader topic of
biosensors.
