Continental Scientific Drilling is an essential activity of programs within the
DOE, NSF, and USGS. The present U.S. Continental Scientific Drilling Program
consists of a coordinated set of these activities that is also consistent with
the missions of each agency. Because the programs of the participating agencies
are related in scientific interests, a coordinated interagency effort in
continental scientific drilling is both cost effective and highly beneficial.
The Interagency Coordinating Group for Continental Scientific Drilling (ICG),
formally in existence since the signing of the Interagency Accord on Continental
Scientific Drilling in 1984, provides this coordination. This action provides
funds in the form of an interagency transfer to the USGS to cover NSF's share of
ICG expenses (Annual Report to Congress, ICG staff, workshop reports, etc.).
Specifically, these funds will be used to pay NSF's share of expenses related to
the Environmental Impact Statement for the Katmai Scientific Drilling Project
which is being coordinated for the ICG by the USGS.
