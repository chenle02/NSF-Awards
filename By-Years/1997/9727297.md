9727297 Considine The steel industry provides a classic example of an evolving
industrial ecosystem, recycling large amounts of by-product gases and more than
half of industry output. Further environmental progress depends upon new
technology adoption. Integrated steel producers are adopting new technology to
compete with scrap-based minimills. In addition, both industry segments face
more stringent standards for emissions of toxic air pollutants. In meeting these
economic and environmental challenges, steelmakers must choose among several new
technologies, including new iron feedstocks, coke oven designs, and iron and
steel making technologies. This proposal addresses an integrated assessment of
new technology adoption in the steel industry. Analysis will be based upon a
revised and expanded version of the mathematical programming model of the steel
industry developed by the PI. The new framework will include a life cycle
assessment (LCA) of steel production from virgin ore and primary fuel to the
plant gate, estimating pollutants for each process at each stage of production.
This information will be very valuable to steel-using industries conducting LCAs
of their products. The model will also endogenously estimate optimal rates of
steel scrap recycling and investments in new steel-making technologies. This
model will be used to estimate how the industry responds to carbon mitigation
policies, including taxes and permits, and examine how these policy impacts
interact with toxic pollution control policies. This project could be very
useful for more aggregate integrated assessments of global climate change
policies. This project will provide insights into the tradeoffs between cost and
environmental objectives, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, toxic
discharges, and acidic residuals.
