Over the last decade the fields of laboratory safety, occupational health, and
chemical waste handling have undergone substantial evolution. During the same
time period, there have been significant new regulatory developments, laboratory
standards and additional environmental restrictions on chemical waste handling
and atmospheric emissions. In response to these changes the National Research
Council will organize a committee, composed of experienced scientists from
academia, industry, and government to prepare an updated report that is
responsive to current knowledge and regulations. This report will encompass the
subject content of two original reports, "Prudent Practices for Handling
Hazardous Chemicals" and "Prudent Practices for Disposal of Chemicals from
Laboratories" and will expand to include new topics not covered in the earlier
reports. The report will be valuable for all laboratory personnel who handle
hazardous chemicals in laboratories and provide leadership for laboratory safety
for the 1990s.
