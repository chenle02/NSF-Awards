This research is motivated by the need for robust and intelligent clinical
procedure of 'catheterization' which is widely used in medical communities. In
this research, the fundamental framework to develop active catheters using an
electro-active polymer called Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC). The research
work includes the design and fabrication methodologies of robotically controlled
IPMC catheters as well as shape controls needed for use in complex passages. The
research results will be disseminated in technical conferences and workshops as
well as prototype demonstration. Knowing that the catheter based medical
therapy/diagnosis is one of important medical technologies and all existing
catheters in the market are based upon human operations, this active catheter
technology will pave the way to a new biorobotic medical tool that can
significantly contribute to improving quality of life.
