In a famous essay, S.A. Forbes (1887) likened lakes to self-sustaining
microcosms. While this micrcosm view has persisted, disparate research shows
that the metabolism, carbon storage, and even food webs of lakes are linked to
subsidies from their terrestrial watersheds. These linkages affects the carbon
balance of regions and even the globe. This area is ripe synthesis which will
weave the disparate threads above into a cohesive cloth. The main activity in
this OPUS proposal is to complete a book on Inland Waters and the Carbon Cycle.
The book, which is nearly finished, will be published in the Excellence in
Ecology Series of the Inter-Research Publishing Company in Oldendorf, Germany.
This OPUS grant will allow a modest amount of quiet, funded time to complete
this book and produce two review articles on the topic.

The book itself is a broader impact in that it will make the PIs perspective on
terrestrial support of aquatic systems available to a broader range of
ecologists. The ECI Book Series does a good job of promoting these books to the
larger ecological community. Additionally, the PI has a great deal of data that
is not yet in any formal data management system. The PI will spend part of his
time organizing these data and then making them available to the public. Cole
will use material from this synthesis in Cary's radio program "Earth Wise", a
one minute spot that airs daily on WAMC and covers environmental topics for the
public. Finally, Cole will use his work on terrestrial support of the Hudson
River Food web to augment the Cary program "Changing Hudson", a project that
uses one large river to teach both teachers and K-12 students about ecosystem
ecology. Further Cole will contribute material to Cary's bi-weekly column, "Eco-
focus" in the Poughkeepsie Journal.
