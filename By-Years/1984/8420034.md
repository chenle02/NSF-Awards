Liquid hydrogenations are often effected in slurry reactors using a finely
powdered suspended catalyst. The catalyst is easily washed out with the exit
fluid. Present practice is to filter the exit stream and then backwash the
filter to recover the catalyst. Increased pressure drop due to pore plugging of
the filter seriously limits the use of this method. Research in magnetic
filtering is being conducted to address this problem.
