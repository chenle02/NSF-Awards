We propose to upgrade our current technical microcomputer. DNA- protein
interactions are the key for our understanding of the mechanism of regulations
of DNA replication, neuronal-glial differentiation and mammary epithelial
differentiation. We need a powerful computer system to analyze data and present
the results graphically. The computer will be used in the following projects: a)
Molecular biology of DNA replication in Bacillus subtilis which studies the role
of membrane association of chromosomal and plasmid replication. b) Molecular
biology of neuronal-glial differentiation using a rat neuronal-glial stem
derivative cell types with an approximate frequency of 10-5. Two of them are
neuronal-like cell types and the third is a glial- like cell type. c) Analysis
of the effect of growth factors on the growth and differentiation of mammary
carcinoma cell lines.
