The proposed study will explore magma transport rates in the middle to lower
crust of convergent margin volcanoes and therefore address one of the most
fundamental questions in geodynamics: How do magmas move from their source
region in the mantle wedge to the surface? Furthermore, results from this study
will provide first-order controls on arc magma petrogenesis, connecting the
mantle source and melting process with the crustal plumbing system as well as
provide insights on the aggregation of mantle-derived melts beneath arc
volcanoes. The project is designed to use an integrative approach combining
constraints from geochemistry, seismology, and fluid dynamics. The project will
lead to a better understanding of magma transport beneath active volcanoes and
improve our interpretation of monitoring dataset from such volcanoes.

Current models for magma transport in convergent margins suggest the prolonged
storage and evolution of mantle-derived melts in the crust. This project will
test whether a fast mode of magma transport even for large, long-lived arc magma
systems exists and what conditions may facilitate such rapid ascent from the
mantle to the surface. The time-integrative nature of geochemical data often
precludes a direct comparison to geophysical signals that record transient
processes. However, geochemical speedometers employing fast elemental diffusion
in zoned magmatic crystals may bridge this observational gap and advance the
application of geochemical tools to short time scale magmatic processes
otherwise only investigated through geophysics. Such techniques have been
successfully employed for near-surface magmatic processes; this projects aims at
extending such approaches to the entire crustal magma ascent path.
