This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Impacts of ultraviolet radiation on
amphibian populations- assessing the importance of habitat and community
structure." Increased exposure to UV-B radiation is hypothesized to be a
contributing factor to the global decline of amphibian populations. Changes in
population dynamics due to UV-B exposure could have severe consequences on
aquatic communities. This research seeks to quantify amphibian response to
multiple environmental stressors across populations and elevations in the Oregon
Cascades.
