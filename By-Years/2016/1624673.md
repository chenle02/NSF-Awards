This award will support the travel and housing expenses of students selected to
participate in the AAAI Spring Symposium on Intelligent Systems for Supporting
Distributed Human Teamwork, which will be held on March 21-23, 2016, in Palo
Alto, California. The symposium is part of the annual AAAI Spring Symposia
series. The symposium will bring together researchers studying teamwork in
different fields, including artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction,
and the social sciences. For student participants, this experience will provide
a unique opportunity to interact with researchers from multiple disciplines and
learn about research in different fields. Students will receive feedback on
their own research and will work closely with senior researchers and other
students to shape a new research agenda for the development of intelligent
systems for supporting human teamwork. The symposium will be a starting point
for forming a new cross-disciplinary community of researchers who are interested
in the development of intelligent systems for supporting teamwork. New
approaches and systems for supporting teamwork are needed for supporting
increasingly more complex distributed teamwork in such areas as healthcare,
education and disaster relief.
