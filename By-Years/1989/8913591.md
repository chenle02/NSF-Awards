The principal investigator will expand his cooperative research on fundamental
mental-organic chemical vapor deposition, MOCVD, growth mechanisms with the Army
Research laboratories at Fort Monmouth. This will be accomplished using in situ
infrared emission spectroscopy to observe the gas phase reactions. Fort Monmouth
will play a critical role in this research. As with our previous cooperative
research project, Fort Monmouth will complete detailed surface analyses
including SEM/EDAX, XPS and TEM. These analyses will give a better understanding
of the mechanisms involved in the MOCVD growth. Also this work should foster
other synergistic interactions with other groups at Fort Monmouth doing off line
infrared studies and theoretical calculations of the structures of molecules in
MOCVD reactions.
