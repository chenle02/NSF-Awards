This U.S.-Hungary Joint Fund research project on "Pollutant Photodegradation
Mediated by Clay-Organocomplex-Incorporated Semiconductors" will be conducted by
Dr. Imre Dekany of Attila Jozsef University and Dr. Janos H. Fendler of Syracuse
University. Semiconductors mediate the efficient photodegradation of pollutants.
Well-characterized alkylammonium and alkylpyridinium surfactant-modified clays
(clay organocomplexes), developed by the Hungarian investigators, will be used
as hosts for the semiconductors. Judicious selection of experimental conditions
will allow the adjustment of interspace distances between the surfactant
molecules and the preparation of size-quantized colloidal semiconductor
particles therein. In this project, size-quantized semiconductor particles will
be in situ generated and used to mediate the photodegradation of pollutants.
Size- and dimensionality-controlled semiconductor particles will be generated in
the interlamellar spaces of the clay organocomplex particles. Absorption
spectroscopy, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical
measurements will be used to characterize the structures of the systems
constructed. Fundamental information on photoelectron transfer will be obtained
by steady-state and picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy. The obtained
knowledge will, in turn, be used to optimize pollutant photodestruction. The
project could point the way to an economically tractable approach to useful
methods of environmental cleanup. This research in materials theory fulfills the
US-Hungary Joint Fund's objective of advancing science by enabling leading
experts in the United States and Hungary to combine complementary talents and
pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
