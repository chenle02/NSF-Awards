Retired scientists and engineers will be recruited through scientific and
professional societies to serve as volunteers in schools to support math/science
teaching programs. The program will be carried out in cooperation with the
Baltimore school system. Three teachers will be placed in each of four Baltimore
schools after approriate training and orientation. Under the guidance of school
system personnel, they will be used in ways deemed most useful by the teachers
and administrators. The program will run for the academic years 1988-89 and
1989-90. Performance of the volunteers will be carefully monitored and
evaluated. On the basis of this evaluation, literature will be prepared for
dissemination to schools, professional societies, and businesses outlining
successful procedures which could be duplicated elsewhere. Cost sharing by the
NESC and the Baltimore School District will equal 115% of the NSF funding.
