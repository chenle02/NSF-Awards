This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the
environment with cleaner diesel engine exhaust. Diesel engine manufacturers
currently cannot precisely control their exhaust after-treatment systems due to
the lack of widely deployable sensors that can differentiate between oxides of
nitrogen (NOx) and other species in the exhaust stream. This project advances a
novel on-board sensor for detecting NOx in diesel exhaust streams with
sensitivities and molecular specificity unmatched by existing technologies. It
can result in 10% greater fuel efficiency while matching new stringent NOx
emissions standards. Fleet-wide fuel economy improvements and NOx emissions
reductions enabled by this technology will lead to reduced carbon emissions and
healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level ozone, and
acid rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project advances
a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which probes the unique
spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-species
interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower detection
thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the harsh
high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments, all while
maintaining a form factor similar to those used in existing diesel
aftertreatment systems. This Phase I research will leverage novel manufacturing
techniques to fabricate and demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity
laser-based NO sensor capable of surviving high-temperature, oxidizing,
intensely vibrating, and particulate-laden flows characteristic of vehicle
exhaust gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
