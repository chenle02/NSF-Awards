This Americas Program award will support a meeting organized by the American
Association for the Advancement of Science for the purpose of planning
initiatives to expand regional science and technology cooperation in the
Americas. The conference, scheduled to take place in Washington, DC on May
28-29, 1993, will get together key leaders from the science and engineering
communities of the western hemisphere to review the needs and opportunities for
research in those nations of the hemisphere with emerging science and technology
capabilities, and identify problem areas where new or enhanced regional
scientific and technology collaboration would be especially useful in achieving
solutions. Approximately two thirds of conference participants will be from
Latin America, with the reminder coming from Canada and the United States. The
conference will address common goals in specific fields of research: science
education and scientific exchanges, scientific communication networks, the
possibility of a Pan American Science Foundation, and the role of non-
governmental science and engineering associations. Conference results will be
disseminated through a published report, presentations at international
meetings, and other means.
