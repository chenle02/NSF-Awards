EAR-0318213&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding will supply 75% of
the salary required for three years for a new technician in the Radiogenic
Isotope Lab at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, which is required to staff
a new $ 1M lab that includes a new multi-collector, inductively-coupled plasma
mass-spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) [Micromass IsoProbe]. The remaining 25% funding
for the full-time technician position will come from university sources. The new
technician position will provide core technical support for NSF-EAR research
projects on stable isotope variations of Fe, Cu, Zn, and Hg, as well as
radiogenic isotope studies of the Lu-Hf, U-Th, and U-Pb systems, as applied to
problems in geomicrobiology, geochemistry, water chemistry, metamorphism,
volcanism, and planetary evolution. The research plan the technician position
will support is quite broad, spanning the fields of geology, microbiology, water
chemistry, and space science. Students will be involved at all levels, from
undergraduate students to senior post-docs. In addition, the research will
involve collaborators from a large number of other institutions. Several of the
projects involve work that is directly pertinent to societal issues, including
water quality and volcanic hazards, as well as those that involve a broader
scope, including the origin and evolution of life.&lt;br/&gt;
