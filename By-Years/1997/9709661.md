Abstract ATM-9709661 Hughes, Malcolm K. University of Arizona Title: A
Multimillennial Temperature Reconstruction from Far North-Eastern Eurasia This
award supports the reconstruction of an annual resolution history of summer
temperature in far north-eastern Eurasia. This is at the center of the largest
longitudinal sector of the Arctic lacking such a record. The annual rings of
larch trees from the Lena-Indigurka coastal lowlands contain a remarkably clear
and strong summer temperature signal. Approximately 66% of the variance of
summer temperature is accounted for by the tree ring series, and there is reason
to expect adding maximum latewood density data will increase this. A tree-ring
series for this region has already been established back to AD 1200, and a
temperature reconstruction back to AD 1400. Wood preserved in permafrost has
been identified as being from several earlier periods, particularly the first
millennium AD and the first millennium BC. Extending this reconstruction to two
or more thousand years length will allow natural climate variability in Arctic
summer conditions to be placed in the context of time scales from interannual to
centennial.
