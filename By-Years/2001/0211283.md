During the past twenty years, the field of micro-electro-mechanical systems
(MEMS) has developed remarkable capabilities and the possible applications are
only beginning to be grasped. The combination of micro technology with optics to
form micro-optical-electro-mechanical systems, or MOEMS, has already borne a
considerable number of applications, projection technology being the most
prominent. Recently, these devices have proved invaluable for switching in
optical networks.

The MOEMS technology that we are most concerned with here is the digital
micromirror array. These devices consist of a chip covered with an array of
small mirrors, each of whose orientation may be separately controlled. We
propose to use this type of technology for the purposes of imaging, rather than
projection. By using mathematical tools developed for omnidirectional sensor
design in computer vision, these arrays may be dynamically configured to mimic
the behavior of curved mirrors. Additionally, due to their small size,
micromirror arrays can change state very rapidly. The potential applications of
such a technology are numerous, including as omnidirectional sensing, high
resolution image acquisition and surveillance.

This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
