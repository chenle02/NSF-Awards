There is strong evidence that the targeted use of interactive instructional
content creates an immersive, non-linear environment that engages students and
improves learning and understanding. The project advances the creation and
adoption of interactive instructional materials within the ATE community
simultaneously providing students engaging, interactive content and addressing
spiraling textbook costs. Workshops and a self-paced online course will train
educators to create interactive content using free and relatively inexpensive
tools and empower them to develop their own interactive, immersive and engaging
learning elements and share what they have learned and developed with colleagues
and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will positively impact teaching
and learning by infusing interactivity with purpose to help students grasp
difficult concepts and increase the number of students successfully completing
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs. Existing NSF
centers and projects and industry contributors will be solicited to provide
content for interactive materials and review the materials developed.
Significant efforts will also be made to engage faculty and institutions that
serve underrepresented populations. Collaboration with five ATE national centers
will impact a significant number of students and faculty, including the
participating subject matter experts (SMEs) and their students as well as
colleges, high schools and individual faculty associated with these centers and
the ATE community at-large. Underrepresented populations will be reached through
existing outreach efforts of these partners, face-to-face workshops at
predominantly minority-serving institutions and via promotion of the self-paced
online course to organizations, publications and social media connected with
educators and institutions that serve traditionally underrepresented
populations.
