The acquisition and use of this molecular imaging instrument will enable new
research directions and educational opportunities and programs that will
significantly contribute to the intellectual base of knowledge in these
disparate but unified areas, and do so on national and international levels. The
five research areas include (1) monitoring dynamic chemical reactions within
advanced self-healing materials, (2) tracking nanoparticle biodistribution and
visualizing their incorporation into the physiological processes of living
organisms over time, (3) following the homing pathways of stem cells and their
functional significance, (4) investigating metabolomics to understand the
biological and physiological basis of nutrition, and (5) monitoring the dynamic
three-dimensional distributions of materials, chemicals, and microbes in
environmental samples. The acquisition of this molecular imaging instrument will
not only enable the rapid expansion of existing research programs, but also
provide the opportunity for new directions of investigation.
