The proposal requests funds for the purchase of a scanning electron microscope
for the benefit of six faculty members as well as for undergraduate students who
will now have an opportunity to gain technical skills and become involved in the
conduct of research. The microscope will be used for research ranging from plant
pathology and plant biology to oceanography and marine biology. Considering the
relative isolation of this campus, the quality of the researchers, and the
opportunity to strengthen then the research and training program, support is
recommended.
