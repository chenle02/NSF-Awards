The Appalachian Cohort for Engineering (ACE) program is supporting cohorts of
highly talented full time students studying Engineering and Computer Science at
Ohio University. Through early career mentoring and peer support structures the
program is building STEM workforce capacity in the local community. The project
serves an underrepresented population in STEM, those in the Appalachian regions
of Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The work can become a
national model for institutions serving other underrepresented groups.
Investigators are disseminating results nationally so other institutions can
benefit from their lessons learned.
