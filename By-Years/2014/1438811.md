This award supports participation in the "Tenth Mississippi State Conference on
Differential Equations and Computational Simulations," which provides a forum
where mathematicians, engineers, and scientists from academia and industry
exchange research and education ideas involving theoretical, applied, and
computational developments in differential equations and associated simulations.
The conference will be held October 23-25, 2014 on the campus of the Mississippi
State University. The website for this conference is
http://www.ccs.msstate.edu/deconf/de2014.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference
is a collaborative endeavor between the Department of Mathematics and
Statistics, and the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS), a High Performance
Computing Collaboratory (HPCC) member center, at Mississippi State University.
The majority of the grant funds will be used to provide travel support to
graduate students and recent doctoral recipients. The conference will provide
these future research leaders an opportunity to present their work, to meet and
collaborate with other researchers, educators, and practitioners, and to learn
about recent developments in this interdisciplinary field.
