The Numerical Anlysis group of the School of Mathematics of the Georgia
Institute of Technology will purchase three workstations and related software.
The new equipment will be entirely dedicated to the support of the research in
Numerical Analysis. The acquisition will greatly decrease the load on the
existing computing facilities, and it will allow the group of numerical analysts
and their graduate students to carry out several research projects, including in
particular: 1. Approximation of Invariant Manifolds, 2. Aspects of Adaptive
Integration of IVPs of ODEs, 3. Adaptive Numerical Methods for Reaction-
Diffusion PdEs, 4. Front Tracking and Domain Decomposition Techniques for Free
Boundary Value Problems, 5. Numerical Apsects of the Hysteresis Phenomena.
