9314467 Kintsch This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in information sciences between Walter Kintsch of the University of Colorado and
Guy Denhiere of the University of Paris, VIII. The investigators specialize in
systems that mediate between computers and humans, specifically, in natural
language understanding. The objective of their research is to develop a new
computer architecture for cognition suited to the study of comprehension
processes. Their proposed model is a hybrid that combines a production system
based on weak rules with a constraint process that stimulates the formation of
mental representations. Weak rules, for example, are word identification rules
that lead to more than one possible meaning of a word. U.S. and French
complementary expertise in theory and experiment will advance this effort. A
joint experimental program to test the new model through computer simulations is
proposed. This project will advance understanding in natural language
processing. ***
