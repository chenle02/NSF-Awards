With colleagues in several Brazilian institutions, Dr. Lena Struwe of Rutgers
University is studying the systematics and phylogenetic relationships of
tropical plants of the gentian family, specifically of the tribe Helieae, with
an estimated 220 species currently placed in 22 genera. These are distributed
widely in South America but with concentrations on the ancient Guayana and
Brazilian Shields and with relatives in regions of the younger Andean mountains
and Brazilian lowlands areas. The major goal is to construct a phylogenetic
framework for all the genera of the tribe, and in turn to use that genealogical
"road map" to explore likely routes of biogeographic diversification and timing
of divergences in the origins and spread of the plant genera across the South
American landscape. Molecular DNA sequences from nuclear and chloroplast genes
are primary targets for new data, and these will be integrated with traditional
taxonomic information on these plants to construct the phylogenetic
framework.&lt;br/&gt; Collaboration with scientists in Brazil will be fostered
by the research in conjunction with institutional cooperation between Rutgers
University and the University of Sao Paulo. A U.S. graduate student will receive
travel support to work with Brazilian colleagues in herbarium and laboratory
research on the plants. Efforts will continue to develop a website initiated by
Dr. Struwe that serves researchers studying the family Gentianaceae, the Gentian
Research Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
