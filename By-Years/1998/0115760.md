With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa will acquire
digitally-enhanced data collection and processing systems for nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) equipment. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
studies on a) macromolecular protein and DNA/PNA solution structure
determinations; b) dendrimer characterizations; c) paramagnetic chemical
systems; and d) synthetic chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a
number of areas including biochemistry and materials chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
