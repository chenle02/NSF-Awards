9417239 Ivory This project is on research to study separation of
polyelectrolytes by coupling electrophoresis and ultrafiltration. The basic idea
is that competition between electrophoretic transport, caused by an electric
field, and convective transport across a porous barrier (a membrane), caused by
pressure flow and electroosmosis of solvent, can be used to separate charged
macromolecules such as proteins on the basis of their electrophoric mobility.
Preliminary work has been done with one solute and one porous barrier. The
proposed research would investigate and develop a system with multibarriers and
multicomponent solutions, with the objective of fractionating a mixture of
proteins into different compartments bounded by two porous barriers. In addition
to this apparatus, the research will develop a model of the electrokinetic
phenomena inside and outside of the membrane pores. ***
