The regional centers in manufacturing and information technology in the ATE
program are to work closely with regional industry to increase the numbers of
well-educated technicians. This collaboration should change the way community
colleges educate technicians and increase employer satisfaction with those
students who become employees. The Community College Research Center documents
and evaluates the activities of the ATE regional centers in information
technology and manufacturing to determine the extent to which and under what
circumstances the regional centers are achieving the goals. Among issues to be
addressed are the structures and mechanisms to adapt and implement exemplary
instructional materials into new contexts; the role of faculty as change agents
in reform of programs, departments, institutions, and systems; and the process
by which institutions build their capacity to address the challenge of educating
a highly qualified technical workforce. The methodology is a mix of quantitative
measures, which use the data generated by the Evaluation Center at Western
Michigan University, and qualitative measures, that include site visits to the
regional centers interviewing students, faculty and administrators and also
employers. The report should be helpful to community colleges in their role in
providing educational access to productive, long-term occupations and further
education for a diverse population of students.
