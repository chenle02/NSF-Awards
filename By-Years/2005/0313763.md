This collaboration provides faculty at 5 Wisconsin campuses with development
opportunities in the topics generally referred to as Cyber Security. Each campus
has coordinated their activities to take advantage of the synergies available
through cooperation, while selecting activities that best suit their own campus
faculty and take best advantage of their own local resources. The training is
robust, and includes the contribution of the US Army Readiness Reserve Training
Center at Ft. McCoy, Wisconsin. They offer an intensive 2-week training session
for this faculty. A variety of intra-campus, internal, and commercial training
opportunities are included. From this project, significant results are reported
to other institutions considering similar needs.&lt;br/&gt;This project raises
the capabilities of over 29 faculty members throughout the state. In addition,
course development is taking place on every campus, increasing the offerings in
this area. Finally, course development keeps in mind the modular approach
adopted by the collaboration, so that specific elements can be exchanged and
shared among these campuses, and other campuses in the United States. Lead for
this collaboration is the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, College of
Engineering and Applied Science, Center for Cryptography, Computer and Network
Security. Collaboration members include: Universities of Wisconsin-Madison,
LaCrosse, Parkside, Stevens Point, and&lt;br/&gt;Superior. For this project, US
Army Readiness Reserve Training Center at Ft. McCoy and Lac Courte Ojibwa, a
tribal college, join the project.&lt;br/&gt;
