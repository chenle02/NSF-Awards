This ongoing project is designed to examine the behavior of water and carbon
dioxide (the most abundant volatile components in terrestrial igneous rocks) in
model and natural igneous systems. These components have significant effects on
the behavior of silicate melts, and a knowledge of these effects is fundamental
to understanding magma origin and evolution. The proposed work involves
application of experimental petrology and analytical techniques to measure the
bulk concentrations of H2O and CO2 and the concentrations of individual H- and
C- bearing species in synthetic and natural glasses. The specific problems to be
addressed include: mixed volatiles in silicate melts and glasses at elevated
pressures; 13C/12C fractionation between vapor and silicate melts; measurement
of the H2O and CO2 concentrations of natural volcanic glasses; measurement of
H2O/CO2 ratios of individual bubbles in volcanic glasses; and experimental
investigation of the effect of water on the degree of partial melting of mantle
peridotite.
