Understanding the evolutionary pressures that shaped the human lineage requires
an understanding of complex, dynamic interactions between multiple selection
pressures, species' anatomy and locomotor control, and the environment.
Evolutionary modeling using computer simulation is well-suited to this type of
investigation because it is inherently dynamic and quantitative. However, it
remains an underutilized approach in biological anthropology.

This project will harness recent advances in computer science and machine
learning to develop and validate the techniques underpinning a new approach for
investigating locomotor control and evolutionary change in chimpanzees, humans,
and extinct hominins. Specifically, the project will develop computational
optimization techniques for use in the open-source OpenSim modeling and
simulation framework. These techniques, coupled with forward dynamics
simulations of complex musculo-skeletal systems (such as humans), will be used
to learn the best gait for a given optimization criterion, such as minimizing
metabolic cost. The resulting gait, along with the force data generated by the
simulation, will be compared to data obtained from the measurement of live
subjects to ensure the validity of the approach.

This pilot project focusing on modeling human locomotion is a first step towards
a fuller investigation of the control regimes and morphological optimization of
chimpanzees, humans, and fossil hominins. Understanding the control regimes
(e.g. minimizing cost, maximizing stability, or speed) underlying human and
chimpanzee gait is critical for reconstructing locomotor evolution in hominins
and hominoids.
