In this U.S.-Brazil cooperative research award, William W-G. Yeh of the
University of California, Los Angeles will develop a practical optimization
model to assist operators to manage and operate a large-scale regional water
distribution system. Together with his Brazilian collaborator, Dr. Paulo S.
Barbosa of the State University of Campinas, UNICAMP, Yeh will study the Sao
Paulo Metropolitan Water Distribution System, currently managed by the Sao Paulo
government agency SABESP. SABESP is one of the largest water systems in the
world, delivering water from eight major reservoir systems to 17 million people
in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large water supply
systems are prone to major failures (analagous to that recently experienced by
the electric grid in the Northeastern U.S.), and the proposed work would make a
valuable contribution to system design to prevent this eventuality. This
Brazilian water system offers a unique site that would be difficult to duplicate
in the U.S. for developing and testing alternatives. The project will result in
state-of-the-art modeling of such systems, advancing knowledge in both
countries. &lt;br/&gt;
