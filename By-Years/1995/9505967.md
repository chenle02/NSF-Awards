Sarkis 9505967 The objective of this project is to organize and sponsor a
workshop on benchmarking for agility. This workshop is meant to address issues
that face those parties that have interest in the research, development and
implementation of agile manufacturing concepts and technology within industry.
The specific emphasis is to help agility management, researchers and other
stakeholders define and determine the process of development, planning,
acquisition, and use of benchmarks, with a discussion on needs, lessons learned,
effort and utility of various benchmarking processes and techniques. This
workshop is to be composed of speakers and participants from academia,
government and industry. The experiences of these individuals and results of
this workshop will help those involved with agility programs, including the
NSF/ARPA sponsored agile manufacturing research institutes, the agility forum
(AMEF), TEAM, interested agile pilots representatives, and various government
agencies. This workshop is also intended to increase the awareness and
definition of agility and its related performance measures.
