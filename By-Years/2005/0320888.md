This proposal from an EPSCoR state, facilitating partnerships among several
organizations (Institute for Scientific Research, Inc. (ISR), West Virginia
University (WVU), Fairmont State College (FSC), and Alderson-Broaddus College
(AB)), seeks to acquire a production quality cluster computing grid that will
link the state's colleges, universities, and research institutions. The work
aims at performing collaborative research in various areas, including: a. Grid
Computing, b. Scientific Data Visualization, c. Virtual Environments and
Haptics, d. Algorithm Development for Solution of Integral Equations, and e.
Modeling and Simulation in Material Science and Chemistry.

With the cluster computing grid, the project will introduce educators and
students to cluster and grid computing, attracting CS, biology, chemistry,
physics and engineering students. Aiming at training and retraining future
generations, the project should particularly impact the bio-informatics programs
while enhancing interdisciplinary and collaborative research efforts
