AST-0309649 Steffes

Demand for access to the radio spectrum continues to grow with the daily
introduction of new radio services. The demand for spectrum access in excess of
bands allocated to the passive services (radio astronomy and remote sensing) is
also growing, e.g. one of the proposed new generation radio telescopes, e.g. new
radio telescopes under construction or in the design stages, such as the Allen
Telescope Array or the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) require access to the
spectrum between 100 MHz and 12 GHz, and 100 MHz and 20 GHz, respectively.
Increased demand for spectrum access leads, of necessity, to more spectrum
sharing, and new techniques that facilitate such sharing must be developed.

This award funds the development of a high sensitivity spectrum monitoring
system in the 500 MHz to 6 GHz range. The spectrum monitor will then be used for
temporal monitoring of spectrum usage patterns in diverse settings (urban,
rural, etc.). Spectrum monitoring will include polarization and azimuthal
characteristics related to multipath propagation. The measured data will then be
compared with predictions arrived at by modeling, that uses available
transmitter databases and propagation models.

The award includes support for a student working towards a PhD degree in
Electrical Engineering. ***
