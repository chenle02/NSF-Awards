9452142 Thiel State of the art equipment supports a program which systematically
integrates biotechnology into the undergraduate biology curriculum taken by all
biology students, including some future teachers. New laboratories relevant to
biotechnology are integrated into a two-semester introductory biology course and
an undergraduate genetics course. These lower-level undergraduate laboratories
form the foundation for the students' understanding of the concepts that
underlie biotechnology. Emphasized throughout the courses are: a) the basic
concepts that underlie biotechnology, b) hands-on experience with some of the
techniques used in biotechnology, and c) the potential uses and limitations of
this technology.
