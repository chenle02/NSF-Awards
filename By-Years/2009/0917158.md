Tuning software for improved performance/power is often extremely difficult
because one cannot easily observe the entire inner workings and power
consumption of running hardware at a fine time resolution. Thus, determining the
root cause of performance and power issues can often only be done by careful
crafting of experimental code, running that code, and measuring the limited
information that can be observed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research is
aimed at designing a new class of very fast and accurate simulators that, with
proper instrumentation, can provide significantly more visibility than the
modeled hardware. However, such simulators can result in information overload,
making finding the issues difficult. Thus, the PI proposes to investigate
methods to effectively and automatically find such issues so that they can more
quickly and easily be addressed. Such methods could result in more efficient
computer systems that can solve problems faster and/or use less energy,
potentially impacting hardware and software developers and users alike.
