CHE-1412064: Cooperative Pulse Waveforms in Quadrupolar NMR

In this project funded by the Chemical Measurements and Imaging program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Alexej Jerschow of New York University is
developing new nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques for the
efficient measurement and characterization of sodium in materials or tissues.
These techniques could eventually be used in magnetic resonance imaging
applications, and in materials characterization techniques, quality control, and
diagnostics for cancer. This project focuses on the design of new radiofrequency
waveforms, designed by optimal control theory techniques, to obtain sensitivity
enhancements in the measurements of sodium nuclei, as well as, to increase the
specificity of such techniques with respect to the characterization of these
nuclei in different environments.

In a broader context, Professor Jerschow also works on the development of
spectroscopic and imaging techniques in the arts conservation field, in
collaboration with Professor Eleonora Del Federico and Professor Cindie Kehlet
from Pratt Institute. This activity allows to foster collaborations between
conservators, arts students, and chemistry students and researchers in
addressing problems of arts conservation science and to reach out to a diverse
student population.
