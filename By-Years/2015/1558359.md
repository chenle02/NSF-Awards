The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is
to advance routing methods in hazardous materials (hazmat) transportation to
mitigate the risk of hazmat accidents and provide fundamental building blocks to
bring the current research and practice up to the next level. Despite
significant advances in risk management theory, current research and practice in
hazmat transportation heavily rely on very simple risk measures. This should be
unacceptable for risk-averse routing. In addition, a serious issue of data
uncertainty has not been well addressed. This project will provide essential
theory and algorithms of Spectral Risk Measures (SRM) applied in hazmat
transportation, which have the potential to radically change current research
and practice in government planning for safer management of infrastructure. This
project will deliver routing methods based on the SRM concept under data
uncertainty and time dependency. SRM will be shown to be effective in low-
probability, high-consequence applications. If successful, this project will
provide the most advanced risk mitigation methods for hazmat routing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the research will be tested with real-world cases,
the results have great potential to be applied to other real-world hazmat
transportation problems. This project will also have an impact on other
transportation problems of a similar nature. The risk measure, models, and
solution procedures are also applicable to gas-emission reduction, supply-chain
disruption management, humanitarian logistics, and the design of reliable
networks. This project will also contribute to building research and teaching
infrastructures. The web-based simulation system will be used for teaching and
testing research ideas, demonstrating the nature of hazmat transportation, and
training practitioners. This project will educate and train students from
underrepresented groups as well as local high school students.
