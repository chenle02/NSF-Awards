Researchers have developed a tissue-on-tissue test that allowed discovery of
significantly enhanced lubricant-based relief for "dry mouth" sufferers and plan
to further improve a lubricant for the relief of "dry mouth". Improved
scientific understanding of the interactions of living tissues in contact has
emerged from choice of a tissue-on-tissue frictional test, producing results
that significantly differ from all prior tests of bio-lubricity that employed
synthetic material counter-faces. Human subject trials, following numerous in
vitro tests with cells in culture, have validated these predictions for
ophthalmology uses, and substantial promise is now shown for extension to relief
of "dry mouth" symptoms of elderly, medicine-influenced, and irradiated cancer
sufferers.

Society has come to depend upon numerous therapeutic and prosthetic
interventions to extend and improve their quality of life and their ability to
engage in productive work. Older citizens have difficulty swallowing their
necessary medicines, and negative side effects of "dry mouth" from these
medicines (as well as from necessary cancer treatments). Interrupted sleep
results from tissue desiccation during these long periods of salivary flow
reduction. The proposed formula to be developed through this I-CORPS program has
the potential to provide 8-times the lubricious relief to tissues normally
bathed in overnight-absent saliva.
