This grant will provide continued support for research on the D0 Experiment
(E740) at Fermilab. D0 is an all-purpose particle detector. The research will
include the first data run of the D0 Experiment starting in early 1992 along
with efforts to extract competitive physics results from these data. Searches
will be made for the top quark and other new phenomena such as super-symmetric
particles. Tests of quantum chromodynamics and measurements of W/Z boson
properties will be carried out. The research will also include some work on
upgrading the D0 Detector so that it will be able to handle the increased
luminosity to be provided by Fermilab's Main Injector and extend the physics
reach of the experiment.
