9311735 Raymond The premise underlying this research is that the essential
dynamics of convective systems in the tropical atmosphere can be represented by
a combination of a nonlinear balance model and parameterizations for cumulus
convection, solar and thermal radiation, and surfaces fluxes. The principal
investigator argues that conceptual framework of the balanced model can be used
to study a variety of scales of atmospheric motion related to convection in
tropical regimes, and has the potential for providing new insights into the
dynamics. Predictions of a nonlinear balance model will be compared with some of
the observations from three different tropical field programs, each of which
focused on a different tropical phenomena: the Hawaiian Rainband Project
(orographically forced rainbands), the Tropical Experiment in Mexico (tropical
cyclogenesis), and the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (Madden-
Julian oscillation, westerly wind bursts, and equatorial troughs). The support
for this project will be shared by the Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology,
Mesoscale Dynamic Meteorology, and Climate Dynamics Programs. ***
