This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
nanoparticle imaging agents for diagnostic applications in clinical pathology.
Currently, fluorescent imaging agents are used to image cells and tissue samples
in both solid (biopsy) and liquid (blood sample) forms and to identify markers
that indicate disease state or progression. These imaging agents have several
limitations, including poor stability and reduced brightness, especially over
time. Nanoparticle imaging agents can provide brighter images over longer
periods of time, potentially enhancing diagnostic ability. Further, nanoparticle
imaging agents may permit multiple markers to be imaged simultaneously reducing
the amount of blood/tissue required for analysis. This proposal will examine the
potential of fluorescent nanoparticle quantum dots for pathological diagnostic
imaging by (i) showing that nanoparticles can be produced in sufficient volume
to meet market need, (ii) demonstrating that nanoparticles can be used to
identify standard markers in blood cells and (iii) comparing their performance
and stability to products currently used in the clinic. This research and
development will thus validate the potential of nanoparticle quantum dots in the
clinical pathology market, and could lead to enhanced diagnostic tools for
earlier disease detection with reduced blood/tissue sample requirements.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project primarily impacts the
pathology imaging market, which could have substantial benefits to society.
Although diagnostic imaging agents are a $2.86B market, nanoparticles represent
just $183M of that market. There is thus tremendous opportunity to enhance
nanoparticle market share. Currently, few fluorescent nanoparticle agents are
used in pathology because of a lack of stability. These research and development
activities will evaluate the potential of nanoparticle imaging agents to improve
diagnostic capabilities of disease. The proposed product, the Multidot, exhibits
superior stability to current nanoparticle imaging agents potentially elevating
a commercialization roadblock. If successful, the Multidot should provide a
brighter signal, increasing disease detection capability, and also permit
multiple markers to be imaged simultaneously. The latter not only reduces the
amount of tissue required for imaging, but could enable additional diagnostics
based on pairs or groupings of markers, enhancing personalized medicine
approaches. Together, these benefits, will enhance clinical care by providing
new types of diagnostic imaging agents with superior performance to those
currently employed.
