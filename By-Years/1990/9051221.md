With the advent of the special-purpose graphics processor, graphics system
design is feasible in a university undergraduate environment. This project
serves to strengthen the curriculum in the areas of graphics, image processing,
microprocessor-based design, and capstone design through the creation of a
graphics system design laboratory facility and the creation of a new graphics
design course. The facility and the new course are based on the TMS34010
graphics processor. The equipment required includes eight student stations where
the design, testing, debugging and documentation of laboratory exercises take
place. The laboratory course consists of a series of structured exercises
culminating in a term project which integrates all of the preceding exercises
into a graphics system. This provides for teaching state-of-the-art graphics
system design, as well as fundamental microprocessor-based design. The award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
