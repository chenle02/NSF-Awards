The purpose of this study is to summarize and critically discuss soot
nucleation, growth, and oxidation. The soot physical appearance and
microstructure, as well as the nature of the soot nucleus are also treated at
some length. The present effort focusses on a number of points, some of which
have not yet been satisfactorily resolved. They include: 1. Chemical species
that are important in the prenucleation stage. 2. Nature of the nucleus (ionic
or radical). 3. Relative importance of fuel composition and amount of oxidizer
to the flame temperature. The present study will also include a discussion of
the effects of additives and of selected work involving hydrocarbon
decomposition. The overall gain to be expected from this review is a
clarification of the research problems worthy of NSF support in the soot
generation area. The current situation is one of contention and
overspecialization. A broad redefinition of objectives is urgently needed; this
review would provide a solid technical base for such an effort.
