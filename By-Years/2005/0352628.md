The Arctic Ocean Boundary Current (AOBC) is a relatively narrow current that
flows mainly along the upper continental slope around much of the Arctic Ocean,
serving as the major pathway by which water properties, such as heat, salt,
contaminants, and tracers are distributed around the Arctic perimeter and
delivered to the intermediate depths of the deep basins. The AOBC originates in
the Greenland-Norwegian Sea, where relatively warm Atlantic waters flow into the
Arctic via two branches, one through Fram Strait and one across the Barents Sea.
Along its path, the AOBC encounters regions of complex bathymetry, where the
current is altered, redirected and partially mixed into the deep basins. Funds
are provided to investigate the fundamental dynamics of the AOBC at three key
locations: St. Anna Trough, the Lomonosov Ridge, and the Mendeleyev
Ridge/Chukchi Borderland. A high-resolution, three-dimensional, primitive-
equation, numerical model will be used in both idealized and realistic
configurations to understand the details of the adjustment of the AOBC to the
bathymetry. Existing observations will be used both to provide realistic inflow
conditions and to compare with the numerical results. The dynamics of these key
locations are poorly understood, and large-scale pan-Arctic models do not
resolve their details, so the time is ripe for such a regional process study
