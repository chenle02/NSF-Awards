Developing a systematic and rational approach to an understanding of the
underlying physical and chemical principles involved in information transfer by
peptide hormones and neurotransmitters is a fundamental problem in science.
Intercellular communication is central to life and an understanding of the
systems involved in communication is necessary for further understanding oflife
processes and how they might be controlled and modulated. The approach Dr. Hruby
has been developing over the past several years has led to peptide hormones and
neurotransmitters with unique biological activities. He is continuing to develop
the relationships of conformation and topology to various aspects of peptide
hormone and neurotransmitter biological activity. In particular, those features
which define and distinguish receptor recognition and binding, transduction of
information and prolonged receptor- related biological activity will be studied.
Those peptides with interesting or unique biological properties or specific
conformational features will be examined by NMR, CD and other biophysical
methods for specific insight into their conformational and dynamic properties.
