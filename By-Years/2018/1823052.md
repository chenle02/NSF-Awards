The proposal is a request to support participants from underrepresented groups
to attend the 2018 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing
Conference, scheduled from September 18 to 22, in Orlando, Florida. The grant
funds will provide student scholarships (undergraduate and graduate students
from groups underrepresented in computing) and faculty from Minority Serving
Institutions. This is a continuing conference effort which the PI has led for a
number of years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Richard Tapia Celebration of
Diversity in Computing Conference is the main conference
for&lt;br/&gt;celebrating the diversity that exists in computing. The conference
mission is to bring together&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students,
professionals, and faculty in computer science and computer engineering from all
backgrounds and ethnicities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
