Building high performance interactive computer systems requires the
understanding of the cognitive processes by which users interact with such
systems. Unfortunately, capturing and interpreting this information is very
difficult. Current user protocol collection strategies are either obtrusive or
capture data at too low a level (e.g. individual key strokes). Previous work has
shown that a formal cognitive grammar can be a powerful tool in capturing and
analyzing users' interaction. Parsing a low level interaction protocol with this
grammar can reveal the user's higher level cognitive strategies. Unfortunately,
such cognitive grammars are complex and very difficult to develop. The goal of
this research is to develop a set of tools an procedures for creating cognitive
grammars. The research has three components. The first, is to build a
computerized environment for developing cognitive grammars. Second, is to
include in that environment facilities to capture and analyze user protocols.
And finally the implications of this work in the study of human-computer
interaction will be examined.
