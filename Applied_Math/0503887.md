The Ginzburg-Landau model serves as a basic paradigm for a broad spectrum of
subjects in pattern-forming systems in general and in superconductivity in
particular. The investigator studies several fundamental theoretical problems
related to this model. Some of the specific problems that he examines lie at the
heart of the Ginzburg-Landau formalism. These include the understanding of time-
dependent formulation and of thermal fluctuations, together with the elucidation
of the behavior of superconductors near the sample's boundary. Other problems
studied are related to transport phenomena in thin wires with Joesphson
junctions. Such structures are crucial in several basic superconducting devices.
The investigator suggests a research direction that leads to the introduction of
novel junctions. Finally, he analyzes the existence of stable patterns in
different systems (including liquid crystals and superconductors with
impurities) where the stability is not generated by an acting external force,
but by the topology of the sample.

One aspect of the project is to enhance the fundamental understanding of
superconductivity. A second aspect of this project is to study transport in
extremely narrow networks. While the main motivation is to consider such
transport processes in superconductors, these types of problems are relevant to
many areas. For example, quantum wires are among the current leading models for
quantum computers, microchannel chips are developing into fast and efficient
tools in chemical analysis, etc. The work in this area will have an impact on
certain directions in nanotechnology. A major theme of the project is to exploit
the similarity between the mathematical methods used in different applications,
such as optics, liquid crystals, and superconductivity, in order to apply
techniques developed in one of these areas to another one.
