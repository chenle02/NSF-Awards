This award is for a year of development of U-, Th-disequilibrium analyses
utilizing high precision thermal ionization mass spectrometry in the Keck Center
for Isotope Geochemistry at UCLA. The requested funds will largely support
personnel critically needed at this stage to develop protocols for the Th
isotope analyses, and to perform and interpret the first generation of analyses
on the new dual sector mass spectrometer. Using Th isotopic analyses, the PIs
will evaluate the temporal and chemical evolution of magma processes for the
lava fields of Craters of the Moon, Idaho, and Pisgah crater, California. Both
fields have been interpreted as erupting from magma chambers which have
undergone crustal assimilation, albeit of silicic material in the case of the
former and mafic material in the case of the later. They will then investigate
paired Th-Pb isotope systematics of selected lavas from diverse tectonic
settings in the western U.S. for their utility in characterizing lithospheric
(crust and Mantle) versus asthenospheric components to magmagenesis.
