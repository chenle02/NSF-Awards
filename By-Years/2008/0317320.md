This project will examine the role of three-dimensional diffusion in the
energization and transport of relativistic electrons in the earth's radiation
belts. There are three primary objectives of the research: (1) A diffusion
tensor which will describe the diffusion process and allows all three of the
adiabatic invariants to be broken will be derived using an analytical phase-
space Lagrangian approach. This diffusion tensor will include the effects of VLF
(Very Low Frequency) wave-particle resonances as well as bounce and drift
frequency (ELF and ULF) wave-particle resonances. (2) A new computer code will
be developed to solve the 3-D, time-dependent phase-space diffusion equation.
This new code will be able to incorporate a variety of diffusion tensor elements
including the newly derived tensors mentioned in task 1. (3) The newly developed
code will be run using a variety of transport coefficients to evaluate which
transport processes dominate under different conditions. This will include
comparison of the model results with other radiation belt simulations and with
spacecraft data. The project will involve a PhD graduate student and the results
will be useful in space weather nowcasting and forecasting.
