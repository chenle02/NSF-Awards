This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
will provide partial travel support for eight U.S. participants in an
international workshop on polyoxometalates to be held in Germany in summer 1992.
The topic of the workshop is "Polyoxometalates: from Platonic Solids to Anti-
Retroviral Activity." The title recognizes that applications of these materials
have undergone recent, rapid growth and now include areas ranging from catalysis
to medicinal. An edited volume with a chapter from each of the twenty-four
invited speakers will be produced. Participants from nine countries are
expected. The U.S. organizer is Dr. Michael T. Pope of Georgetown University.
