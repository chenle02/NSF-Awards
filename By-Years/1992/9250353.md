This Department of Physics is purchasing equipment for weather monitoring and
forecasting to support a course in Introductory Meteorology which is taken by
non-science majors to meet graduation requirements. The lab includes a
computerized local weather station and satellite receiving system to take
advantage of low cost, real-time data sources. Additionally, a meteorological
workstation has dial-up access to a meteorological database to demonstrate the
extensive data and analysis available. Students and instructors use the lab's
sources to create daily weather briefings for class. Live local weather
conditions and satellite imagery are displayed in the Physics Department hall
display case to create interest in weather and science for the general student
population. Topics of atmospheric stability, surface weather map analysis, upper
air analysis, frontal analysis, atmospheric motion, instrumentation, and
radiative energy exchange are taught in the lab, enhancing the student's
understanding of the physical processes that influence daily weather.
