This project will introduce electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy into the
undergraduate chemistry curriculum at the University of South Alabama. ESR is a
spectroscopic tool used for research in many different areas of chemistry,
ranging from chemical synthesis to the study of magnetic properties of
molecules. The instrument will be used in three phases of the laboratory
curriculum. In physical chemistry, the type of information obtainable by ESR
will be studied using organic radicals as examples. In instrumental analysis,
the characteristics of the spectrometer will be studied. The ESR system will
also be used to demonstrate the technique of computer interfacing, since the
instrument can be driven by computer and the resulting output can be recorded
and analyzed by computer. Additionally, the instrument will be used in
undergraduate chemistry research projects involving the effects of various
ligands on the magnetic properties of transition metal complexes.
