Wolbachia pipientis is one of the most widespread endosymbiotic microorganisms
known. First characterized in mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex, it has
since been found in greater than 20% of insect species and about 25% of
Drosophila melanogaster used in genetic research. Wolbachia has specialized in
the manipulation of host reproduction. In Drosophila, Wolbachia primarily causes
cytoplasmic incompatability (CI), a form of reproductive isolation. The
expression of CI renders infected males unable to father offspring when mated to
uninfected females. While infected males mate normally, transfer sperm and the
sperm fertilize the egg, the egg fails to complete karyogamy and dies.
Reciprocal crosses between uninfected males and infected females are viable, but
since Wolbachia are transmitted vertically through the female, all resulting
progeny are infected. The research project will attempt to understand the
genetic basis of Wolbachia distribution in Drosophila melanogaster testes and
the resulting effects on CI. Deficiency mapping will identify loci with large
effects on Wolbachia distribution and density within D. melanogaster testes.
Deficiency stocks will be screened for the presence of Wolbachia. Those strains
with dissimilar patterns of Wolbachia distribution will be studied further for
their ability (or inability) to cause CI as well as the for the host genetic
basis of differential bacterial distribution. Following identification of
important candidate loci through deficiency mapping, alleles with different
levels of penetrance will be studied for their impact on bacterial distribution
and CI. &lt;br/&gt;The identification of genes and biochemical pathways involved
in determining Wolbachia distribution patterns will advance the understanding of
how Wolbachia manipulate host reproduction in Drosophila and spermatogenesis in
general. It may also provide clues as to what pathways are manipulated when
Wolbachia infect more distantly related insects, particularly insect pests that
cause human diseases (for example, malarial diseases transmitted by mosquitoes.
Such knowledge will also aid in the design of effective pest management programs
utilizing Wolbachia.&lt;br/&gt;
