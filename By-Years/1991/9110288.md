Roots in nature produce an astonishing variety of secondary metabolites, many of
which have been used as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, flavors, fragrances, etc. A
recent experimental system, "hairy root" cultures obtained by transformation
with Agrobacterium rhizogenes, has been developed and become a useful tool for
understanding basic root biology. The "hairy root" approach also has several
advantages over other plant tissue culture systems for the production of plant
chemicals: fast-growth as organized cultures, higher and stable yields of
secondary metabolites, production of both intra- and extracellular metabolites,
and direct amenability to genetic engineering. The goal of this proposal is to
integrate expertise in the biological and engineering sciences towards the
development of commercially viable plant root systems.
