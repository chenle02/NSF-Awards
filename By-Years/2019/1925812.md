The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a
new re-use option for waste tires and, at the same time, provide an economical
solution to remove siloxanes in landfill gas prior to combustion for electricity
generation. This novel technology for the treatment of landfill gas/biogas to
remove siloxanes uses the smallest size fraction of waste tire rubber particles
as the adsorption media. The innovation of this technology will make electricity
generation from landfill gas more sustainable and more attractive economically.
In addition, the development of a new reuse market for waste tires will reduce
the burden of tire disposal across the U.S. By providing an economical solution
for siloxane control as well as creating a reuse option for waste tires, the
well-being of communities near landfills will potentially be improved.

This I-Corps project will help to propel electricity generation from landfill
gas by removing one of the major obstacles to its use. A major challenge to the
use of landfill gas as a renewable energy source comes from trace contaminants,
namely 'silica containing compounds' called siloxanes which are converted to
silicon dioxide, a glass like substance that reduces engine efficiency, reduces
heat transfer, increases scour and abrasion, and accelerates equipment
deterioration. This innovation is the development of a new siloxane adsorption
process using waste tire rubber particles. Using this approach, the siloxane
nuisance in landfill gas to electricity plants will be mitigated. Currently,
there are limited options for the reuse of the rubber material from waste tires.
The development of an effective adsorption process using the smallest size
fraction of waste tire rubber particles represents an exciting entrepreneurial
opportunity to turn this waste product into a marketable adsorbent that can
compete with activated carbon adsorption for siloxane control.
