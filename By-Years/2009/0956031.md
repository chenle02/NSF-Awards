This project, from the Board on Science Education of the National Research
Council, proposes a Roundtable on Climate Change Education. Roundtables create
opportunities for analysis and engagement with the issues rather than provide
advice. This Roundtable will foster ongoing discussion of the challenges to and
strategies for improving understanding of climate science and climate change
among federal officials, the business community, policy makers, educators, and
scientists. The Roundtable will meet five times over the two-year grant period,
and will call for commissioned papers and organized presentations on critical
issues related to climate change education. Each year, the Roundtable will hold
a public workshop in conjunction with one of its meetings. A workshop summary
report will be written for each workshop and published by the National Academies
Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project responds to a Congressional mandate
that NSF create in 2009 and 2010 a program on Climate Change Education, and a
recommendation that NSF consult with the National Research Council as part of
that effort. The project will focus on four critical areas and the challenges,
opportunities, evidence, and stakeholder groups related to each: public literacy
and action; formal education; the scientific, technical and educational
workforce; and decision makers.
