The purpose of this research project is to develop a mathematical understanding
of a number of scientific phenomena that are modeled by nonlinear integro-
differential equations. The main thrust of the project concentrates on solutions
of nonlinear problems involving anomalous (in particular integral) diffusion
processes arising, for instance, in phase transitions, fluid dynamics, game
theory and optimal control. Specific examples of the type of phenomena being
studied include, in the continuum mechanics side, the analysis of equations
modeling surface phenomena, like ocean-atmosphere interaction (the
quasigeostrophic equation) or planar dislocation propagation, and diffusion at
multiple scales, like polymers or turbulent flow, while on the probability side,
problems of optimal control in game theory and finance, involving random
variables that jump discontinuously (Levy processes or Levy walks) in changing
environments. The issues to be investigated in this research project have a
certain universality in the sense that the same paradigm reappears from geometry
and analysis, to fluid dynamics and material sciences, to financial mathematics
and more recently biology and stochastic geometry. The proposed research program
will improve the interplay between modeling and phenomena in these areas.
Understanding their basic structure will promote interdisciplinary research.
