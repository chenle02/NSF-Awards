Prof. Eugene Chen, Colorado State University Chemistry Department, is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program for his work
devoloping a mechanistic understanding of the diastereospecific ion pair-
catalyzed polymerization of functionalized vinyl monomers. Diastereospecific
ion-pairing catalysis departs from conventional polymerization catalysis by
utilizing both the cation and the anion in the independent, diastereomeric
polymer chain growth as well as in the exchange of the growing polymer chains.
An important implication of this new concept is the production of functionalized
polymers with unique stereomultiblock microstructures.

This research on new catalysts for the polymerization of functionalized vinyl
monomers will provide polymer chemists with a tool for producing novel
stereoblock microstructures. This research will produce both fundamental
knowledge and novel stereoblock microstructures in polymeric materials for new
applications through the formation of self-organized, morphologically unique
stereocomplexes. Potential uses of the new materials generated through this
program include thin films, catalyst and enzyme immobilization, molecular
recognition, and smart microgels. Students will receive excellent training and
research experiences in a forefront synthetic inorganic chemistry program
focused on catalysts for the preparation of novel polymer materials.
