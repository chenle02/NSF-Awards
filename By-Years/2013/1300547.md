Motivated by various problems from other disciplines and also from the internal
development of discrete mathematics, the demand steadily increases to understand
"optimal" extreme structures and "typical" random structures in discrete
mathematics.This project will investigate basic combinatorial questions about
structures and will look for various applications of discrete mathematics in
computer science, biology, and engineering. The principal investigators build on
their previous work in combinatorics and graph theory in the areas of extremal
graph, hypergraph and poset theory, graph visualization and graph drawing,
random graph models and probabilistic combinatorics to attack fundamental
questions in extremal set theory, extremal graph theory, and in areas closely
related to them. These fundamental questions include the 70 years old Turan
problem, one of the toughest problems in extremal combinatorics; the excluded
subposet problems, results on which are just solidifying into a theory; and
building a Turan hypergraph theory bridging the two areas above, offering new
insight for both. Notwithstanding the efficacy of spectral methods in graphs
theory and different analogues of it for hypergraphs, there is not yet a
coherent spectral hypergraph theory. Lu and Peng made an attempt to unify
different versions of Laplacians for hypergraphs. A key direction of the project
is building further the spectral analysis of uniform hypergraphs based on their
Laplacian. For 40 years, the Lovasz Local Lemma has been the tool to find the
proverbial needle in the haystack. The principal investigators introduced a
technique to use the lopsided version of the Lovasz Local Lemma for asymptotic
enumeration of combinatorial objects. The project will extend the range of
asymptotic enumeration problems where this method applies, by finding new
classes of problems where the lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma applies. The study of
crossing numbers of graphs, and of the structure of generalized Sperner families
is also among the goals of the project.

The applied prong of the project is expected to have an impact on other
sciences. In particular, investigating models for sequence evolution and
phylogeny reconstruction is relevant for the mathematical foundation of
bioinformatics, investigating extremal and structural properties of tree indices
has relevance for mathematical chemistry, working on crossing numbers of graphs
in different models of drawing is relevant for computer science. Some
probabilistic and spectral results of this project will be relevant for network
science. The principal investigators continue their interdisciplinary
collaborations with colleagues from engineering, biology, statistics, and
computer science, and continue the training of successful graduate students.
