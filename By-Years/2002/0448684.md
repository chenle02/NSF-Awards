0448684&lt;br/&gt;Fisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;
br/&gt;The investigation of molecular signal expression and transport within
synthetic tissues of great importance. The overall goal of this project is to
develop a fundamental relationship between the properties of synthetic matrices
and cell encapsulated signal expression and transport that can be incorporated
into bioengineering applications. The study of enhanced cell signaling within
synthetic tissues is vital for applications including tissue engineering, tumor
growth modeling and drug discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
