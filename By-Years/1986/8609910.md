The objective of this research is to assess the potential for using living
neurons in a new type of sensor for biotechnological processes. The neurons will
be responsible for both the detection of chemical substances (i.e., aliphatic
hydrocarbons like low molecular weight alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, and
carboxylic acids) and the relaying of an electrical signal to a suitable
measuring device (such as a microelectrode or field effect transducer). Sensors
of this type are expected to be extrememly sensitive to small concentrations of
target substances and should allow measurements to be made instantly and
repeatedly.
