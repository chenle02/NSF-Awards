9355631 Humphrey The Exploratorium is developing a model program that
demonstrates the vital role science museum exhibits can play in supporting
formal science education reform. The development of exhibitions and enhancement
activities is based on the Science Framework for California Public Schools and
the emerging National Science Education Standards. The project includes: A
series of four museum exhibitions (with a total of 60 exhibits) based on the
Science Framework themes of Patterns of Change, Stability, Scale and Structure,
and Systems and Interactions Publications (Exhibit Guides and Pathways) for each
collection A series of workshops and evening events for teachers, families and
students A symposium, video and Internet resource for museum and education
professionals An important feature is an information desk and resource kiosk to
inform teachers, parents and the general public about science education reform
efforts. The project aims at 5,000 teachers, 32,000 parents and caregivers,
140,000 students and 1,320,000 members of the general public. ***
