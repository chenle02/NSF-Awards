Recent work in political science has investigated constraints imposed by the
executive and legislative branches on the U.S. Supreme Court, the nature of
presidential and senatorial influence on judicial selection, the influence of
the solicitor general on Court proceedings, and interest groups' use of the
courts to pursue their political agendas. Yet understanding the nature and
implications of the interactions between the modern Court and other political
actors has been an ongoing intellectual challenge. The key problem is the
difficulty of comparing the policy preferences of political actors across
institutional boundaries. Bailey and Maltzman propose a three-part research
design to address these needs. First, they propose undertaking extensive
original data collection of cross-institutional position taking. These data
provide the foundation for comparing preferences of justices, legislators, the
president, and interest groups. Second, Bailey and Maltzman propose analyzing
these data with novel preference measurement techniques to create ideal point
estimates that are comparable across institutions. Third, they propose using the
measures to model the influence of external actors on Supreme Court decision
making.
