The objective of this research to develop at Drexel University the capability of
etching of high aspect ratio micro- and nanostructures in various polymers,
silicon, and glass by acquiring an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etcher
system. The development of such capabilities will benefit several nanotechnology
projects at Drexel University and at the University of Pennsylvania. These
projects include 3 NSF sponsored NIRTs on programmable assembly of
nanocomponents and on carbon nanotube based nanofluidics. It will also benefit
research on novel liquid crystal devices and soft condensed matter. It will be
highly instrumental in NSF sponsored research on effects of surface morphology
on cellular adhesion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of the proposed ICP
etching capability at Drexel will have a broad impact. No similar tool is
available in the Philadelphia region and the proposed ICP system will be
available to academic institutions and corporations in the entire Philadelphia
region and beyond. Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania are
within one city block from each other and effectively form one contiguous
university campus. The proposed ICP system will be part of a network of
equipment for nanotechnology research and education being established within the
two universities/one campus framework. It will directly benefit the NSF IGERT
project to establish nanotechnology education within this framework. Drexel
University and Penn are located in an urban school district and reaches many
underprivileged students through effective outreach programs. Advanced
instrumentation such as the proposed ICP system helps increase exposure of
traditionally underrepresented groups to exciting advanced technologies.
