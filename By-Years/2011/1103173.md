This BioTEKS project is designed to prepare biotechnology laboratory technicians
with the skills needed to be successful employees in plant and animal research
laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The need for this
program was established with the assistance of Manhattan Chamber of Commerce and
KansasBIO. The objectives of the project are to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Adapt
traditional biotechnician coursework for delivery in a blended format through a
postsecondary collaborative model; &lt;br/&gt;(2) Develop and facilitate
professional development for instructors from partner institutions to orient
them to the laboratory portions of the biotechnology curriculum as well as for
new faculty transitioning from industry to teaching; and &lt;br/&gt;(3) Create a
handbook on Guidelines for Effective Collaboration document based on research of
best practices and institutional experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The BioTEKS project is: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Providing new opportunities for
training to students in a high wage, high demand field and providing an
innovative education model that can be replicated. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Adapting
effective curriculum models developed and used by other technical and community
colleges. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Using a blended instructional model that engages
students and provides scheduling flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Involving industry
in developing training that meets specific competencies and workplace needs.
&lt;br/&gt;(5) Disseminating a blended instruction collaborative model and the
handbook via presentations, conferences, workshops, and symposia, and
publication in a variety of media.
