Professor Edwin F. Hilinski and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Florida State University are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) or twelve (12) weeks each summer
actively engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from studies
of adsorption in aquatic sediments to investigation of performance
characteristics of polymers. Students will begin their summer laboratory
experience with a safety orientation. Weekly seminars and interaction with
faculty mentors are designed to encourage students in research careers.
