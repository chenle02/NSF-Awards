The PI received a postdoctoral fellowship in 1998 (DBI 9804178) to explore how
changing climate might affect the long-term demographic strategies of plants and
red deer in Norway. Dr. Post collaborated with Dr. Stenseth in Norway on
quantitative aspects of the project. The PI in now in a tenure track position at
The Pennsylvania State University. He proposes to use highly resolved field data
at multiple spatial and temporal scales to resolve the interactions between
climate and trophic structure (predators, herbivores, and plants) using cutting-
edge individual-based models. This project will advance ecological understanding
in that hypothesis-driven and process-oriented perspectives will replace current
approaches involving retrospective time-series analyses. The integration of well
designed field studies of wolves, moose, and vegetation in the environs of
Denali Park in Alaska, and advanced quantitative modeling will facilitate
development of a unifying theory regarding the effects of climate change on
community stability.
