This award provides funds for the equipment needed to receive and display near
real-time meteorological data products through the UNIDATA network. The
Wisconsin/PC-McIDAS (Man-Computer Interactive Data Access System) system will be
used to support instruction and research activities in the undergraduate
meteorology concentration at Central Michigan University, eventually replacing
the current facsimile service. The ease of use and flexibility of the system
will allow its integration into the core synoptic and dynamic meteorology
courses intended for general education students. Weather information and
forecasts are currently broadcast to the city and campus community through a
local public broadcasting system and a student-organized campus TV station.
Information products derived from color enhanced radar and satellite imagery
from PC-McIDAS will be made available to these stations.
