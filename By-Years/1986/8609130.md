A conference and workshop will be held on the applicability of recent advances
in computational techniques that promise to overcome impediments to engineering
design of systems for management of water. Topics to be considered in water
resource management include quantity and quality considerations of water
supplies, conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, drainage systems for storm
and wastewater, and reservoir design for flood control and water supply.
