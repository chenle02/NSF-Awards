This five-year research project would study the impact of emphasizing formative
assessment strategies in concurrent undergraduate methods courses and STEM
content courses on the subsequent teaching practices of these pre-service
teachers and their students. The study focuses on future middle school STEM
teachers. It will include two treatment cohorts and a control group from Temple
University, an urban institution with a 33% minority enrollment. The mixed
methods research design will examine the impact of the treatment on teachers'
practices during their practicum and induction years and on the STEM achievement
of their middle school students.
