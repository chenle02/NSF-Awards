The process of star formation is an area of great interest in astronomical
research. It is an area in which the interest has been recently enhanced with
developments in instrumentation and techniques for observations. Because of the
presence of obscuring material, the depths of star forming regions can only be
probed with observations in the submillimeter and far infrared regions of the
spectrum. This grant supports a program of submillimeter wavelength observations
using a versatile camera/polarimeter which has been developed by Drs. Hildebrand
and Harper at the University of Chicago. The observations will be carried out
primarily at the California Institute of Technology Submillimeter Telescope on
Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The principal scientific areas of interest for these
observations are: (1) the formation and evolution of stars and circumstellar
disks; (2) the evolution of galaxies; (3) the magnetic field structure of
interstellar clouds; and (4) the intrinsic properties and alignment mechanisms
of interstellar dust. The grant will also support continuing improvements to the
camera/polarimeter to ensure that the operating characteristics are maintained
at a state-of-the-art level.
