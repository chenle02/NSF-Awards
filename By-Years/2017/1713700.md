The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
food safety and reduce the incidents caused by food-borne pathogens. This
project will: (i) help ensure that the U.S. food supply is safe by providing
food facilities and consumers with effective diagnostics tools, (ii) advance the
commercialization of a portable food monitor, and (iii) provide timely
protection against consumer microbial hazards and eliminate unnecessary product
recalls. This sensor will directly benefit society by providing a new diagnostic
tool that may empower users to take control of the safety of the food they
consume.

This I-Corps project will further develop a biosensor technology that functions
via a synergy between conducting poly (amic) acid (PAA) and metal nanoparticles.
Nano-sized nanoparticles have a high electron affinity and can strip off
electrons from the surrounding PAA matrix. The technology is designed to detect
the 'notorious five' pathogens namely, Salmonella, E. coli, Norovirus,
Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria (Sensal) all within 5 minutes at 5
colonies forming unit/mL or less. Unlike enzymes, DNA or lipids, the recognition
ligands are more robust and specific for the pathogen. The biosensor device is
similar to a glucose strip. When samples containing the pathogens are exposed to
the strip, concentration-dependent recognition results in visible color change
on the membrane strips indicating positive results for E.coli or other
pathogens.
