This engineering education award to the University of San Diego will develop an
innovative model for undergraduate engineering that is customized to the needs
and strength of veterans. A particular emphasis will be on the success of women
veterans. The results will also be presented on the web, at technical
conferences and published in professional journals. Also the project will hold a
one day workshop for the 15 universities in Southern California with engineering
programs to discuss the results, to share best practices and to further promote
and develop customized engineering education opportunities for veterans. The
project is expected to assist veterans' transition to civilian life and to
enhance the number of students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to
fill engineering jobs or start new high tech businesses.
