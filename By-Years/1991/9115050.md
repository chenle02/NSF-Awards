This award primarily supports U.S. participation in a U.S.-Latin American
Regional Workshop on Molecular Approaches to Membrane Biophysics, held at the
Centro de Estudios Cientificos de Santiago (CECS), Chile, November 20-December
7, 1991. Organizers are Michael White, University of Pennsylvania, and Pedro
Labarca, CECS. The purposes of the workshop are: to convene U.S.- Latin American
researchers in membrane biophysics and biochemistry, for exchanging ideas; to
introduce Latin American participants to basic principles of molecular biology
applied to membrane biophysics; and to develop collaboration between Latin
American biophysicists and U.S. researchers using molecular biological
approaches to membrane biophysics. The U.S. side will benefit from establishment
of Latin American contacts to develop research themes for future projects. The
Latin American participants will gain information about molecular biology
applied to membrane biophysics, and from exchanging ideas for future U.S.
collaboration. The workshop's topics and agenda fulfill goals of the Science in
Developing Countries program.
