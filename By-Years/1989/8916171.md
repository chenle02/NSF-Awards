This award is in support of a program to reacquire and study the pulsar recently
discovered in the LMC supernova 1987A (Kristian, Pennypacker, Middleditch et al,
1989). Funding is being provided for the purchase of two high-capacity 8mm tape
drives, which are the final components of a new data system that has already
been built. The new system will provide longer stretches of continuous phased
data at higher sampling rates in order to study the detailed structure of the
pulses.
