9601577 Brown This grant provides $136,000 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) for trace
elemental and isotopic ratio analyses for studies in limnology and
paleoclimatology at the University of Minnesota - Duluth, Large Lakes
Observatory. Specific research will focus on anthropogenic influences on heavy
metal (particularly Pb and Cu) distributions and their subsequent diagenetic
remobilization in sediments of Lake Superior and studies of redox sensitive
metals, trace metal ratios (i.e. Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) in ostracode tests and the Pb and
Sr isotopic variations found in lithic fragments from East African Rift Lake
sediments as proxies of climatic and provenance changes over time. This
instrument will provide a new regional capability for trace elemental analyses
of environmental samples and will benefit undergraduate and graduate students
conducting limnological and geochemical research. ***
