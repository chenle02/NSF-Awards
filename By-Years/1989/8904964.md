This research attacks one of the most difficult seismological problems -
predicting strong high-frequency ground motion from complex faulting, and
inverting observations for a source model. The analysis will use extensive
seismic data sets from the California Whittier Narrows earthquake of October 1,
1987, and from earthquake areas in Taiwan. The research has direct and important
application to the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program in predicting
the particularly damaging local high-frequency ground motions during an
earthquake.
