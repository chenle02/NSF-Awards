This proposal requests support for CoFE 2001 conference that will focus on
identifying food engineering priorities for the 21st century and on integrating
this field with other major engineering disciplines and promoting interaction
among engineers from various engineering discipline areas. The Conference is
designed to help guide future research priorities and is organized around the
major topical tracks including: (1) physical chemistry of foods, (2) transport
processes, (3) food processing and packaging, (4) food engineering education,
and (5) university and industry interaction. This Conference will provide a
forum for consideration of future research directions of food process
engineering in critical need, especially those research challenges emerging from
the food industry. This Conference will be the 8th one of its series. It will be
a topical conference within the annual meeting of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers (AIChE) to be held in Reno, Nevada during November 5 - 9,
2001. The organizing committee plans to submit a final report of the Conference
to the National Science Foundation soon after the
Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
