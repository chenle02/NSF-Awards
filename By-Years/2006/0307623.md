0307623&lt;br/&gt;Librescu&lt;br/&gt;Travel support is provided for nine
graduate students and three keynote speakers from Eastern Europe to attend the
Fifth Congress on Thermal Stresses and Related Topics at Virginia Tech during
June of 2003. The students will be selected based on open e-mail notifications
and on the research to be presented. The congress will address a number of
topics in thermal stress science and applications, including computational and
analytical modeling. The broader impact of the congress lies in great importance
of thermal stresses in very many industries and in the participation of graduate
students in the deliberations and presentations.&lt;br/&gt;***
