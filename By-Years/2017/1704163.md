The Finger Lakes Probability Seminar grant will cover the years 2017-2020,
according to the following schedule:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;April 21-22, 2017 at
Syracuse University &lt;br/&gt;April 20-21, 2018 at University of Rochester
&lt;br/&gt;April 19-20, 2019 at Cornell University &lt;br/&gt;April 17-18, 2020
at SUNY Binghamton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For additional information see the
conference website: http://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/cmlr/Finger-
Lakes/.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference is aimed at professors, graduate
students, and advanced undergraduates. Its purpose is to facilitate
communication between the probabilists near the Finger Lakes in Upstate New
York, as well as to introduce graduate students and advanced undergraduates to
the latest developments. Probability is a rapidly developing area with many
applications, and it is hard to be aware of all developments in the field. In
past years professors and graduate students from more distant locations such as
Toronto, Boston, and New York City have also attended.
