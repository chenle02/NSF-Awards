9520704 KERFOOT Groundwater exchange across the bottom of lakes plays a crucial
role in the structure of the benthic community at this interface. This project
will utilize a novel in situ chamber designed to determine the importance of
groundwater fluxes on benthic communities and processes. The chamber allows free
exchange of water, or the chambers allow blockage of this exchange across this
dynamic interface. Translocation experiments will be performed with these new
chambers to determine how nutrients delivered by groundwater influence the biota
at the benthic interface and how this process affects within-lake biodiversity.
