How do we construct maps of the real world in our brain? Apparently there is a
structure called the hippocampus that contains a spatial map that is laid down
through experience. Dr. Walsh has devised a novel behavioral test to assess how
various chemical inputs affect the behavioral function of this structure. With
this NSF grant he will manipulate the chemical environment of the cells that
provide major inputs to the hippocampus. By measuring the number and types of
errors made in a spatial maze after each manipulation he will be able to
determine whether his chemical manipulations have improved or interfered with
hippocampal function. The results of these experiments will improve our
understanding of the neurobiological foundations of learning and memory. The
future applications will include drugs that can be used to improve memory or,
alternatively, reduce the influence of unwanted, intrusive memories.***//
