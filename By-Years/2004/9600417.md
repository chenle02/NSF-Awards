9600417 Rapaport This Americas Program award will support a collaborative
research project between Dr. Jacobo Rapaport, Ohio University, and Dr. Francisco
Brieva, Universidad de Chile. The researchers intend to address basic issues
related to the understanding of the reaction and excitation mechanisms in
nucleon induced inclusive reactions. The purpose of the planned experiments is
to provide high quality data on spin transfer for subsequent theoretical
interpretation and analysis. The objectives are to develop a theoretical
framework to interpret the data in terms of couplings between reaction and
excitation mechanisms and to study the dependence on the nucleon-nucleon
interaction. The experiment might eventually lead to a much more fundamental
understanding of nuclear phenomena in terms of a microscopic theory. The
microscopic understanding of simple nuclear phenomena relating to the structure
and reaction degrees of freedom has been greatly enhanced in the last few years
both from the experimental and theoretical approaches. However, there still
exist important and troubling questions about how a nucleus responds to certain
classes of external stimuli. The proposed experiments, to take place at the
Indiana University Cyclotron Facility, should provide a complete set of data to
test more deeply the different theoretical models. The group of the University
of Chile will develop new theoretical calculations to explain the data by
working on the development of a microscopic theory for reactions. They will then
construct the codes for calculating the corresponding observables. The results
of this collaborative effort could be a major contribution to the field of
charge exchange in nuclear reactions. ***
