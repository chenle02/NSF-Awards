The objective of this research is to develop an understanding of the
microstructural aspects of contaminated clays. Specific objectives are: 1. to
quantify the physical adsorption of contaminants by clay particles; 2. to
quantify the change in physico-chemical forces between clay particles as a
result of change in pore fluid chemistry; 3. to investigate the change in fabric
resulting from the change in physico-chemical forces; 4. to investigate the
change in engineering properties resulting from the above factors. The
properties investigated are physical adsorption, stress-strain strength
relation, compressibility and hydraulic conductivity.
