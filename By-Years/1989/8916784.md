There are apparent differences in the style of deformation between various
foreland fold and thrust belts. Despite these differences, the overall topology
of foreland belts is remark- ably similar in that both thrust belts and fold
belts show, (1) a cratonward decreasing systematic spacing of major structures,
(2) a shared regional decollement and (3) multiple lesser internal decollements
levels. The fundamental differences in style (folding vs. faulting) can be
related to the strength, stacking order and rheology of the stratigraphy. By
applying an analysis of the flow instability of a layered sequence for a non-
linear viscous fluid, the initiation and localization of first order structures
in both fold-dominated and fault-dominated fold/ thrust belts will be
determined. This theory will predict the spacing of major structures, whether
folds or thrusts, within a layered sequence for a range of geologically
plausible represen- tations of the stratigraphic sequences of the Plateau
Province of Pennsylvania and the Idaho-Wyoming-Utah thrust belt. Further
analysis of the finite evolution of these structures for a non- linear rheology
will focus on the transition from folding to faulting that may be responsible
for the observed deformation in the Idaho-Wyoming-Utah thrust belt. Thus, this
study will attempt to unify the mechanisms for the origin of foreland fold and
thrust belts.
