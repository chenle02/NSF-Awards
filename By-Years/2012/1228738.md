This NSF MRI award funds the acquisition of a state-of-the-art rock triaxial
testing system, which is the centerpiece of the Geo-Mechanics and Geo-Imaging
laboratory at the University of North Florida. The testing system couples
hydrological, geophysical, and mechanical (static and dynamic compression)
testing capabilities under triaxial conditions. The rock triaxial testing system
augments existing specimen preparation equipment, pre-test characterization
equipment, index test equipment, and acoustic emission monitoring equipment to
create a unique experimental rock characterization facility at a predominately
undergraduate institution. Projects to be supported by the testing system
include characterization of the properties and behavior of brittle macroporous
materials; addressing technical issues that will allow engineers to design
economic; sustainable subsurface infrastructure in weathered Florida limestone;
and developing knowledge that will allow engineers, scientists, and policy
makers to assess the potential for geologic carbon sequestration in the state of
Florida. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The triaxial testing system supports cutting edge
instruction, education, and research in geological material characterization at
the University of North Florida. Possessing this unique experimental
characterization system enhances numerous multidisciplinary collaborative
research projects with researchers within and outside of the state of Florida.
Experimental data generated using the rock triaxial testing system is
disseminated to researchers and educators using a dedicated web-based digital
library. Beyond students, faculty and researchers, the broader community which
benefits from this system includes high school students who participate in
outreach activities within the University of North Florida's School of
Engineering and state policy makers who decide upon state endeavors into
geologic carbon sequestration.
