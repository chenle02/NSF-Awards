CRYPTO is the Annual International Cryptology Conference, sponsored by IACR
(International Association of Cryptologic Research), in cooperation with the
Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara. The
first CRYPTO was held in 1981, and since then CRYPTO has been IACR's flagship
conference, attracting researchers in the field of cryptology from all over the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of research papers accepted to CRYPTO
range from theoretical foundation of cryptology to application and
implementation of cryptographic schemes. This grant supports student attendance
at CRYPTO. Students will have the opportunity to interact with many of the
luminaries in the field during conference presentations, special tutorial
sessions on hot topics, as well as in more informal settings including a
reception and banquet dinners.
