Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to
perform a systematic study on the nanocarpet behavior of aligned nanorod array
surfaces with different structures and morphologies. When high aspect ratio
nanorod arrays are treated by liquid and dried, the original morphological
structure could suffer a permanent change, which will alter the performance of
the nanostructure arrays. By exploring the detailed relationships between the
clustering of the nanocarpet effect and the mechanical properties of individual
nanorods with different heights, shapes, materials, and the liquid properties,
the proposed research seeks answers to the following fundamental questions: (1)
How does the mechanical stability of nanostructures affect the nanocarpet
effect? (2) What process causes the nanocarpet effect (and the pattern
formation), and how to prevent this effect? (3) What will be the novel fluidic
properties for nanorod array substrates and how can we use it for different
applications? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This transformative research has a potential
to obtain fundamental knowledge on liquid-nanostructure interaction and help to
design robust nanostructures for applications in liquid environment such as
sensors, nanofluidic systems, etc. The success of the project would have a large
and immediate impact in the areas of: i) nanostructure fabrication and
engineering, ii) fundamental surface science, iii) mechanical properties of
nanostructures, iv) sensor design and implement, and v) bioanalytical
applications. The lab-based nanotechnology course module will help undergraduate
and high school students to obtain hands-on experience with nanofabrication.
This project will also establish a rigorous material physics, mechanical
engineering, and nanotechnology education and training opportunity for both
graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
