funded in parallel with a substantially identical one by Professor Axel Scherer
of California Institute of Technology. In a collabo rative UCLA/Caltech effort
the PI proposes an experimental program to develop and test the technology for
making 3 dimensional dielectric/metallic photonic crystal structures on the
scale of optical wavelengths. These should lend themselves to practical
implementation in opto electronic technology and might be generically useful in
optical science. ********
