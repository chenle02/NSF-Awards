Benack Union College is a private liberal arts college known for the strengths
of its science programs and its incorporation of engineering into a traditional
liberal arts curriculum. The Psychology Department is one of the largest and
strongest departments on campus. Currently the department is located in the
North Colonnade, a 177 year old structure that was last renovated in 1945.
Research space in this building is grossly inadequate to support the
department's research activities. Space is small, poorly designed for
experimental work and in a state of extreme deterioration. Electrical and
heating systems are antiquated, making it impossible for equipment to function
properly. Faculty have been forced to abandon some research areas to conduct
many research projects in classrooms and offices not suited for these
activities. To correct this situation, the college will relocated the department
to Bailey Hall, providing much needed space and first-class laboratory
facilities. This award will provide funding for the replacement of 2216 nsf of
research and research training space in Bailey Hall currently occupied by the
psychology department in North Colonnade. Space will be configured to support
research activities and will be made to meet code and access requirements. Five
laboratories will be modernized to form the center of a more vigorous and
diverse program of research activities for both faculty and students. With the
provision of dedicated space for data collection with multiple subjects,
research will be able to proceed more efficiently. Most importantly the
relocation will place the department in proximity to the other sciences,
promoting the development of interdisciplinary work, the sharing of facilities,
more efficient use of computer facilities, and joint supervision of student with
interdepartmental majors.
