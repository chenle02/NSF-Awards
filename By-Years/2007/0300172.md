Abstract Speh/Barbasch

This proposal is concerned with the study of automorphic forms, representations
of reductive groups and their applications. Dan Barbasch, together with various
coworkers, is proposing to continue investigations of the unitary dual of real
and p-adic groups. In particular he will study necessary conditions for
unitarity. He will also continue the study of unipotent representations, in
particular their associated cycles. Joint with various coworkers he will study
occurences of representations in the dual reductive pairs correspondence, and
for p-adic groups he will study the Bernstein center. Birgit Speh, together with
various coworkers, will continue the study of cohomology of locally symmetric
spaces. In particular she will study representation theoretic descriptions of
modular symbols. She will also work on proving uniform convergence of terms in
the Arthur-Selberg trace formula. It is expected that the results of this
proposal will contribute significantly to the understanding of the geometry and
topology of locally symmetric spaces. Graduate and undergraduate students as
well as postdoctoral faculty are expected to be involved in studying problems
generated by this research. Many problems in number theory and mathematical
physics are concerned with functions that are solutions to differential
equations which have certain symmetry properties. These properties are expressed
in mathematics as saying that the solutions form a unitary representation of a
reductive group. A major part of this proposal is concerned with the
determination of the building blocks which are called unitary irreducible
representations. The aforementioned functions relevant to number theory are
called automorphic functions and have expansions in terms of unitary irreducible
representations. These expansions can be thought of as generalizations of
classical Fourier series. The problem of convergence of these expansions is
important for applications to number theory, and forms an important component of
this proposal.
