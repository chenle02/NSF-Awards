This project will address problems in mathematical ocean and atmosphere
sciences, related to weather and climate prediction. Two classes of problems
will be investigated. The first one is that of the boundary conditions for
limited area weather models for which physical models do not provide natural
boundary conditions. This problem is as old as numerical weather prediction
itself, and it is expected that inappropriate boundary conditions will introduce
spurious modes, in particular as improved computing capabilities allow better
spatial and temporal resolutions. The aim is to derive boundary conditions that
lead to mathematically correct problems, and that are computationally
satisfactory in the sense that they let the waves move freely inside and outside
the domain of computation. The PI will continue his investigations in this
direction. The second class of problems is that of moist convection,
precipitations and clouds. Our limited understanding of the physics of clouds is
one of the primary causes of uncertainty in the current weather and climate
predictions. The difficulties are in part due to the large differences in
scales, ranging from cloud sizes of hundreds of kilometers to particles
(droplets of water, ice or aerosols) of a few microns. There is a similar range
of time scales. The project will study this physical problem using mathematical
tools from convex analysis and variational inequalities. Numerical multilevel
methods will be used as well to study the interaction of clouds and topography
near the equator; and finally the tools of convex analysis will also be used for
the very modeling of the changes of phase in the clouds. These studies will be
conducted in close collaboration with physicists. The project will involve
graduate students and post-doctoral associates who will be trained in this
important interdisciplinary area.

This research project will study fundamental problems in the numerical
prediction of weather and climate, as well as problems in the mathematical
modeling of clouds and evaporation. The project component related to numerical
weather prediction addresses the problem of using information from coarse
featured global weather data for fine grained local and regional predictions. If
the coarse data are not coupled correctly to the regional model that has higher
resolution, then spurious systematic errors (e.g. "ghost" weather fronts) may
arise. The project will investigate the mathematical foundations of this
problem. The project component on the modeling of clouds and evaporation will
use advanced mathematical tools to contribute to the understanding of a set of
basic open problems in weather and climate research: Do clouds help cool the
planet (because they reflect sunlight) or do they contribute to warming (because
they can hold thermal energy)? Weather prediction and climate modeling are
objectives with important human, social and economic interest. The project will
also train young scientists at the interface of mathematics, geophysical fluid
mechanics, and scientific computing.
