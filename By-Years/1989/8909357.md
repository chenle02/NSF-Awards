The purpose of this project is to investigate timestamping as a paradigm for
synchronization. The methodology is to develop a branching time scale which
permits the specification of sequential and concurrent activities, which in turn
can be performed either atomically or non-atomically. This time scale will then
be used as the basis for deriving the semantic properties of blocking and
timestamping forms of synchronization and identifying the differences between
them. With this new semantic framework, new language level synchronization
primitives which can automatically generate timestamping information will be
suggested. Finally, the practicality of embedding this sort of timestamping
mechanism in systems for distributed computation will be investigated. The
result of this project may suggest new ways in which computer programs can make
efficient use of geographically dispersed computing resources.
