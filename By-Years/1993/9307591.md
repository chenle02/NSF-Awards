9307591 May The results of the proposed work will have benefits to basic and
applied research. The benefits to basic research are that these data will
contribute to our understanding of the evolution of mating genes. Basidiomycetes
mushrooms have mating genes like Coprinus cinereus and constitute a major part
of the world's flora. In addition, similar evolutionary pressures are thought to
affect plant mating genes. The system I have chosen is an extreme example of
molecules that must simultaneously conserve functions function and expand
diversity. Consequently, by understanding the evolution of this mating gene, I
will obtain results bearing on a central problem in biology today; how do new
gene functions evolve? %%% Potential benefits to applied research are apparent.
C.cinereus is representative of a large class of fungi, many of which are
economically important. To name a few, Ustilago maydis, a pathogen of corn and
Phanerochaete chrysosporium, a fungus currently used for biopulping of wood
products, are both Basidiomycetes fungi. Their mating systems are much like that
found in C. cinereus. As humans need to manage and control these and other
fungi, they need to know how the organisms move from one location to another and
how fast they evolve. Mating genes, because of their incredible variability
provide very good genetic markers for migration. Because of their inherent role
in the evolution of such organisms, studying their ev olution will be important
to understanding organismal evolution.
