Under an SGER grant (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) a test for local
isotropy of turbulence will be carried out by an NSF grantee at a large Reynolds
number windtunnel at the NASA Ames Research Laboratory. The experiment will use
special miniature multielement hot-wire probes, and the test for isotropy will
be based on velocity gradient data. The experiment will help settle the question
of how valid is the commonly held assumption of universality at the fine scales
of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, and the range of validity of this
concept. Th concept forms the basis of present models of turbulent flow in
various engineering systems, and improvement in such predictive models requires
clarification of this basis.
