The Fellow would participate in the development of marine and terrestrial
protected area management plans and in the development of policy positions on
environmental protection in Antarctica, including marine areas. Projects would
also include reviewing and preparing environmental impact assessments for U.S.
science and operational activities in Antarctica. Some work would involve
environmental assessments of science activities in the Arctic. The skills gained
would include an understanding of interagency and international governance
within the context of the Antarctic Treaty system, understanding the
relationship between marine and terrestrial components of complex ecosystems,
proficiency in environmental impact assessment process and in the development
and preparation of management plans. Ultimately the Fellow would gain an
understanding of a broad range of environmental protection activities and their
interrelationship with scientific research and operational activities in
Antarctica. The deliverables will include final draft management plans of
protected areas for international review and position papers for senior
management on a range of environmental, ecosystem management, and protection
issues within the Antarctic Treaty system. Work would include in activities
related to the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection and
the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.
