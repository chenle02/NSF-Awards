9729950 Channing Numerous biotechnological applications rely on the function of
proteins in the vicinity of or confined to interfaces. Examples include
biocompatible materials, protein chromatography, solid phase immunoassays, and
biosensors. While protein-protein interactions at interfaces have been exploited
in these technologies, and are prevalent throughout nature, little is known
concerning the mechanism by which such interactions lead to protein self-
organization. A better understanding of the factors involved in two-dimensional
biomolecular ordering would aid the development of these technologies. This
project is to investigate the influence of intermolecular forces on two-
dimensional protein crystallization, and to calculate the energetics of two
dimensional crystals. ***
