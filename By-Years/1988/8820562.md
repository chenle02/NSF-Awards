This application requests funds to support the purchase of instrumentation
capable of carrying out protein and peptide sequencing. This will be part of a
multiuser, multidisciplinary molecular biology facility. Eight core users with
federal grant support will benefit. Research projects housed in different
academic divisions of the School of Basic Life Sciences with the availability of
this instrumentation will study: 1. Molecular structure and function of proteins
in solution and in membranes; 2. Proteoglycan turnover in bone forming cells; 3.
Intracellular protein traffic and protein engineering; 4. Regulation of
expression of heart acetylcholinesterase; 7. Mechanism of acylation in membrane
phospholipids; 8. Protein-DNA interaction in viruses. All projects depend upon
the availability of this instrumentation capable of rapidly and reliably
sequencing small amount of peptides.
