Knowing whether acute stress results in stronger in-group preference is
important for policymakers inside and outside of Africa. This research project
provides evidence for whether ethnic tensions are likely to be heightened if a
society experiences acute stressors, such as economic, social, or environmental
shocks. Examples of these might be natural disasters, droughts, political
conflicts, riots, and protests. These findings are also important for a better
understanding of the importance of groups, which are a fundamental aspect of
human behavior. The new knowledge should also be important for helping
governments understand how best to alleviate inter-group conflict in the face of
macroeconomic shocks that increase acute stress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research project aims to better understand the determinants of ethnic
preferences within the African context; specifically, how they are affected by
acute stress. It is hypothesized that in-group preferences might become stronger
during times of heightened stress. The study tests this by examining the
consequences of acute stress induced by the provision of hydrocortisone pills to
experiment participants. For a randomly chosen treatment group, the researchers
directly increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol by pharmacologically
administering its physiological precursor, hydrocortisone. A randomly chosen
control group receives an identical-looking placebo pill. Participants in both
conditions then undertake standard behavioral games that test whether there is
greater trust, trustworthiness, altruism, or generosity towards coethnics. By
comparing the behaviors of those in the stress condition versus those in the
control condition the research team can assess whether stronger coethnic
preferences arise during episodes of heightened stress. The structure of the
experiment also allows the research team to test whether acute stress affects
other forms of in-group preferences such as own-age or own-gender
preference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
