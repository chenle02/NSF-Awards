9406965 Delaney This project will test the hypothesis that sites of hydrothermal
discharge may represent the confluence of up flow zones fed from two adjacent
convection cells. A program of 30 ALVIN dives on the Juan de Fuca Rise in the
northeast Pacific is designed to confirm whether mixing between fluids derived
from two different sources explains the gradients of temperature and salinity
across the Main Endeavour field, examine whether the same mechanism operates at
the High Rise vent field, develops regional context of these systems by defining
the spacing for all active sites of high temperature discharge, and establishing
what chemical characteristics of fluids are shared on a segment scale. ***
