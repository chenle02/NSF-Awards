The James E. Gleason Memorial Building, constructed in 1867, is home to the
College of Engineering on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Technology.
Facilities within the building are inadequate to support research and training
activities in engineering. As a part of an overall project to renovate the
building, ARI funds will specifically provide support for the modernization of
33 research laboratories for the Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering,
Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering Departments. The renovation
addresses three major constraints to effective research and research training:
poor organization of space, resulting in a significant underutilization of
available space; inadequate environmental control and mechanical systems, which
adversely affect instrumentation; and outdated service facilities that impact
equipment upgrades, ADA requirements, and safety and security concerns.
Renovations will enhance existing research projects and enable the initiation of
new research activity in diverse topics including: advanced manufacturing
technologies, neural networks, optical communications and human machine
interfaces. The modernization will permit the college to meet the changing needs
of its industrial and government partners, better prepare students for continued
study, and enable students and faculty to pursue research that cannot be done in
the existing research infrastructure.
