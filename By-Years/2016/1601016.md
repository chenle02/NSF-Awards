This award will be used to organize a Finger Lakes Probability Seminar to be
held at Cornell University on April 22nd and 23rd of 2016. Home to Syracuse
University, the University of Rochester, and Cornell University, and centrally
located amongst a number of other premier research institutions, the Finger
Lakes region of New York State has a long tradition of outstanding scholarship
in probability theory and related fields. In the past, conferences such as the
Cayuga Triangle Probability Seminar fostered collaborative relationships between
researchers at these institutions, and events like the Cornell Probability
Summer Schools helped establish the region as an international center of
research and education in probability. The proposed seminar will build on the
successes of these past endeavors and help revitalize probability in the Finger
Lakes region. In addition to bringing together researchers from diverse areas of
study to share insights and initiate new research projects, the seminar will
have a broader impact by educating students and young researchers in preparation
for careers in science, finance, and other industries.

Probability is one of the most widely used mathematical tools in applications of
all sorts, and it is of paramount importance that the younger generations have
the skills and knowledge to employ it correctly and to continue increasing our
understanding of how to deal rigorously with the uncertainties faced in the
natural and social sciences. The Finger Lakes Probability Seminar will expose
students from a wide variety of backgrounds to the probabilistic way of thinking
and to cutting edge developments in the field, and will help integrate the next
generation of researchers into the broader probability community. The conference
will focus on several different sub-topics within the field of probability,
including Integrable Probability, Random Matrix Theory, Large Deviations,
Schramm-Loewner Evolution, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, Spin
Glasses, Percolation, and Markov chain Mixing, as well as the application of
probabilistic methods to other disciplines such as biology, economics,
statistics, and computer science. For more information, please see the
