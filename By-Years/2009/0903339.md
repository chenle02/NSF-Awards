To address a shortage of civil engineering graduates, much of the work currently
done by civil engineers in agencies and industry can be performed by engineering
technicians. Work such as field and laboratory data collection, elementary
analysis and construction quality control could all be performed by engineering
technicians. This project develops a cadre of engineering technicians by
offering a curriculum which reduces the higher order mathematics requirement for
an engineering degree and substitutes for these courses more practical courses
suitable for engineering technicians. Courses such as material properties,
construction testing, data gathering and statistical quality control are
included in the curriculum. Additionally, the program enlists the help of
industry to provide jobs during summers and part-time work during the school
year. This practical training enables students to experience real world
applications of their coursework. Industry supervisors mentor students and train
them to be employees of value as civil engineering technicians. Scholarships are
also offered to selected candidates in order to allow them to take full course
loads. This rigorous practical education coupled with concurrent on-the-job
training prepares a technician workforce capable of meeting the demands of the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
