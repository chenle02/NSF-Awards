This award will support the participation of US-based mathematicians, especially
women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in "Dynamical Systems II,
Denton 2009," a conference that will be held at the University of North Texas
from May 17-23, 2009.

This conference has four major scientific themes: holomorphic dynamics;
continued fractions, dynamics, and number theory; random dynamical systems;
hyperbolic dynamical systems and transfer operators. The format of the
conference is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak.
