Principal Investigator: Selman Akbulut

Abstract: The principal investigator will investigate the topology of smooth
4-manifolds. By decomposing smooth manifolds into complex pieces, he will use
the techniques of complex and symplectic manifolds to understand the restriction
this decomposition imposes on the topology of smooth 4-manifolds. The principal
investigator hopes to apply the techniques from the solution of the `Scharlemann
problem' and Fintushel-Stern constructions to the problem of constructing
4-dimensional fake s-cobordisms, and to the problem of constructing a fake copy
of `three-sphere crossed with circle'. He would like to study topology of
Horikawa surfaces and hopes to give affirmative answers to various branched
covering conjectures.

The principal investigator intends to study generalized 4-dimensional spaces
(4-manifolds); he hopes to find new ones. These spaces arise naturally in
physics: relativity (space-time) and quantum field theories. Recently there have
been exciting developments about the structure of these spaces coming from the
ideas of physics, but we still don't know if certain basic exotic 4-manifolds
could exist. If they exist they will be basic building blocks of the known ones.
We would like to investigate possible constructions which could give their
existence.
