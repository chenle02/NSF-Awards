A key goal of ecology is to understand how ecosystems process materials and
energy. In this proposal, we focus on the energetic importance of terrestrially-
derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) for lake ecosystems. Using laboratory-
based studies, we will assess how terrestrial DOM quantity and quality influence
the production and growth efficiency of pelagic bacteria. These two processes
ultimately dictate how much terrestrial DOM enters lake food webs. We will then
incorporate the laboratory data into a simulation model that will predict
conditions under which terrestrial DOM is likely to be energetically important
for higher trophic levels. We are particularly interested in using the model to
assess terrestrial carbon flow in lakes with contrasting food webs and trophic
states. Finally, we will test model predictions by examining the stable isotopic
signatures (delta 13 C) in zooplankton from a wide array of New England lakes.
Results from this study will clarify the energetic importance of spatially
linked ecosystems and broaden our understanding of how allochthonous inputs
influence food web dynamics. In addition, our studies will aid in decision-
making regarding land use activities that modify carbon export to lakes such as
agriculture, shoreline development, forestry, and wetland delineation.
