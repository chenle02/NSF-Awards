9619638 The research proposed focuses on algorithmic aspects of programming
language theory and pragmatics, continuing the research agenda of the principal
investigator. Further investigation is targeted on the area of optimal
evaluation for lambda-calculus, concentrating on relevant cost models, the
necessity of and possible improvements to bookkeeping for sharing, with
applications to linear logic and game semantics. A long-range goal is to
investigate optimal evaluation as a possible implementation technology for
functional programming. In addition, work will be continued on syntactic
approaches to parametricity and reasoning about polymorphic programs based on
their types, on fixed-rank type inference, typed lambda-calculus as a venue for
capturing complexity classes, and intensional properties of contraction of
proofs to programs as a general technique for program synthesis. Some of the
work will also be relevant to curriculum development, even at the undergraduate
level. ***
