9730304 Petrenko This project addresses photoplasticity, dislocation motion and
interaction in II-VI materials. Most of the research will be conducted with CdS
and ZnSe with emphasis on identifying and developing greater understanding of
the physical mechanism of the x-ray plastic effect (XPE). Under certain
conditions, this phenomenon can cause significant material hardening, for
example causing a doubling of yield stress and a decrease in rate of plastic
deformation by two to four orders of magnitude. In these studies, this effect
will be used as a tool to study mechanisms of dislocation motion. %%% The
project primarily addresses research issues in materials physics. The research
will contribute basic knowledge at a fundamental level to a somewhat narrow, but
unique phenomenon observed when materials are exposed to X-rays. The basic
knowledge and understanding gained from the research may contribute to improving
the performance and stability of advanced devices such as blue lasers and light
emitting diodes (LEDs). ***
