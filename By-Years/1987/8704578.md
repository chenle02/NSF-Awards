Capital Equipment funds will be used for the purpose of upgrading the
University of Rochester high energy physics group's computing facility from a
VAX-780 based system to a VAX-8500 based system. In addition to this award for
$73,000 from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy is
awarding $320,000 for the project. This research is also partially supported
under grants PHY-8515429 and PHY-8415447.
