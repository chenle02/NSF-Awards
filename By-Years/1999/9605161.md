*** Wootters This grant will provide research opportunities for ten
undergraduates for each of the next three summers (1997- 1999). Half of these
students will come from Williams and half from other schools. Each student will
work at Williams for ten weeks, as a member of a small research group consisting
of between two and four undergraduates and advised by one faculty member. The
particular projects offered are in the following areas: laser cooling, ultrafast
lasers, precision atomic measurements, fiber-optic lasers, theory of open
systems, and quantum information theory. In addition to their research projects,
students will participate in other activities including weekly seminars, field
trips to other research facilities, and social events. ***
