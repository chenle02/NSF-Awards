Abstract for award DMS-0701029 of Matthias Flach

The aim of the project is to define and study a new Grothendieck topology (the
"Weil-etale topology") in connection with special values of Hasse-Weil
L-functions of varieties over number fields (the "Tamagawa Number conjecture").
The idea of such a topology, as well as a first definition, is due to
Lichtenbaum who also shows the expected relationship to the L-function in the
simplest case of a zero-dimensional variety. However, truncation of the complex
computing Weil-etale cohomology is necessary because in even degrees greater
than two the cohomology group is nonvanishing and of infinite rank. One goal of
the project would be to redefine the Weil etale topos of the ring of integers of
a number field so that it has bounded cohomology as well as a number of other
properties such as a map to the etale topos and to the classifying topos of the
real numbers. A second goal is to find a definition of the Weil etale topos for
higher dimensional arithmetic schemes of characteristic zero (the case of finite
characteristic is already well understood due to work of Lichtenbaum and
Geisser). A third, more speculative goal would be to reprove the analytic class
number formula using the Weil-etale topology with the aim of generalizing it to
Artin L-functions. One interesting aspect of this project is the interaction of
topos theory and logic with more classical and well established number theory,
such as the analytic class number formula.

Diophantine equations and their solutions have occupied the imagination of
mathematically interested people for centuries but they also have found real
world applications in coding theory. Modern mathematics provides a bewildering
array of techniques, ranging from the disarmingly simple to the highly abstract,
to study diophantine equations. The geometric perspective, viewing the solution
set as a "space", has been particularly useful. The project aims to contribute
to this line of thought by defining and studying a new cohomology theory for
diophantine equations.
