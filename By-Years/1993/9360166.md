This research is on a novel technique to increase the capacity of mobile
cellular communications systems. It uses a small array of antennas to separate
multiple co-channel signals, parametric modeling of the FM/PM signals impinging
on the array, and makes use of both spatial and temporal information to separate
the signals. Efficient estimation of the model parameters is achieved by using
the recently developed Discrete Polynomial Transform (DPT) - a nonlinear
transform for estimating the parameters of multi- component, polynomial phase
signals. Phase I efforts include the development of DPT-based signal-selective
array processing technique for separating 2 or 3 signals, and performance
studies by analysis and computer simulation.
