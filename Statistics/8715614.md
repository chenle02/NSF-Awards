This research will study three problems. The first set is called bandit
problems in sequential design and scheduling. A multi-armed bandit problem
selects between k independent stochastic sequences at every stage n according to
a specified rule. The "index rule" selects a sequence with maximum "Gittins
index". These indices are not easily computable. The investigator will continue
to develop simple approximations to the optimal stopping problems. The second
set of problems uses the boundary crossing theory for sample means to find
useful approximations to certain Bayes tests. The investigator has already found
such approximations for general exponential families. Now he proposes to extend
the results beyond the exponential families and to higher dimensions. The third
set of problems deals with stochastic regression and adaptive control. The
classical stochastic adaptive control is the optimal regulation of the output
when it is designed as a linear combination of previous p outputs and q inputs.
The output is regulated according to various criteria such as mimimizing the sum
of squares etc.. The investigator already has several results in this area and
he plans to pursue these problems further.
