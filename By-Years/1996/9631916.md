Proposal Number: ECS-9631916 Principal Investigator: Charles Falco/University of
Arizona Title: Advanced Multilayer Coatings in the Extreme Ultraviolet Abstract
This research will develop techniques for producing new kinds of multilayer
mirrors suitable for several applications in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
wavelength region: projection lithography, soft x-ray microscopy, astronomy and
lasers. The approach involves mirror formation by layer-by layer molecular beam
epitaxy of materials combinations which is a substantial departure from the use
of diffractive optics/zone plates. Interface roughness is the central problem
for these short-wavelength multilayers; therefore emphasis is placed on
characterizing and controlling roughness. transmission electron microscopy
scanning tunneling microscopy atomic force microscopy and low angle x-ray
diffraction experiments are planned to study how the interface roughness evolves
from the substrate up through the multilayers. Reflectance high-energy electron
diffraction and low-energy diffraction will be used in-situ to study the
roughness evolution for the MBE-grown samples. Development of the multilayer
mirror technique is a very flexible approach , which can be implemented widely
for many applications.
