9318984 Reid This award provides for continued technical support for the second
Palomar Sky Survey, a photographic survey of the Northern celestial hemisphere
in three passbands -- blue-green, red, and near-infrared. The project is
entering its final phase, and it is expected that plate taking will be completed
in late 1997. This award helps maintain the photographic standards of the survey
through support of a photographic specialist.
