9524770 Guttorp The problem of subgrid scale variability in general circulation
models, and the generally poor quality of the precipitation part of such models,
indicate the need for precipitation models based on large-scale atmospheric
processes. A realistic stochastic model of precipitation can be based on
meteorologically homogeneous weather states, each driving a simple stochastic
model of precipitation. In order to determine appropriate weather states, a
variant of canonical correlation analysis, appropriate for dependent data, is
developed. Statistical theory allowing a space-time decomposition of atmospheric
fields with attendant standard error assessment is developed. When applied to
the leading canonical variates, such a method can isolate spatial and temporal
scales of interest. A slightly different approach uses a hidden Markov model,
driven by atmospheric data in a less explicit form than expressed above. This
model is fairly accurate on relatively small spatial scales, and for temporally
homogeneous parts of the year. This hidden Markov model approach is extended to
a seasonal model, and its performance compared with the weather state approach,
as well as with general meteorological forecast models. %%% The general
circulation models used to assess climate change have relatively poor
performance when it comes to precipitation. Furthermore, in order to assess the
effect on regional hydrology of climate changes, models with a finer resolution
than the circulation models are needed, since the hydrologic processes usually
operate on a much smaller scale than the large-scale atmospheric processes that
dominate the global climate models. Rather than developing precise deterministic
models of rainfall, the researchers build a partly probability-based class of
models, and compare it with meteorological forecast models and applied to both
weather data and circulation model outputs. ***
