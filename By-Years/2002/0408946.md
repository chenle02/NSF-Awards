Under appropriate conditions the interaction between volcanic magma and surface
water is explosive; however, volcanologists lack a fundamental understanding
about the prerequisite phase mingling. To study this problem, investigators are
performing sophisticated experiments that simultaneously employ particle image
velocimetry (PIV) and laser induced fluorescence (LIF). Mingling mechanisms will
be determined by superposing phase boundaries (from LIF) with velocity fields
(from PIV) under varying flow conditions and geometries. LIF and PIV images are
captured on separate cameras focused on a single image plane with the aid of a
beam splitter and optical filters.&lt;br/&gt;The research is a collaborative
effort administered by Dr. Peter Friedman a mechanical engineering professor at
the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and Dr. Steve Carey, a volcanologist
at the University of Rhode Island. The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth is
a state university with a young but promising graduate education program serving
the ethnically diverse communities of Southeastern Massachusetts. The research
has potential cross-disciplinary applications including nuclear safety, metal
processing, and cryogenic cooling of superconductors.&lt;br/&gt;
