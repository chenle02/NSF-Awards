The study of habitat fragmentation has been built upon an understanding of how
lost habitat, isolation of habitat patches, and increased habitat edge lead to
declines in populations. This understanding has, in turn, formed the foundation
for principles of resepve design in conservation biology. In order to design
reserves in the future, traditional studies of fragmentation must be augmented
to include: (1) the effect of variation in patch quality in the habitat
remaining on individuals in the population, and (2) how these effects over time
affect population growth or decline. In the arid west, and throughout much of
the world, several factors including irrigation and domestic water use, have
combined to result in a general trend toward salinization of water available for
wildlife. High salt levels have been shown to pose serious health threats to
wildlife, especially young birds. This project will determine the capacity of
young water birds to withstand various salt loads. The results will allow water
management to predict the costs to wildlife of increased salinization.
Eventually, results can be integrated into population models as factors
affecting survival. These modeling results will allow for major improvements in
wetland reserve design.
