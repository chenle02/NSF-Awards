This proposal's immediate objective is measuring the solar wind near the Sun
using radio remote-sensing techniques. The PI's observations made under a
previous grant suggest the main acceleration of the fast polar streams takes
place closer to the Sun than previously expected. In addition, prior
observations show a component of enhanced density fluctuations at scales just
above the proton Larmor radius. Both of these results are important for the
heating of the corona and acceleration of the solar wind, but they will have to
be confirmed by additional observations. This research will primarily contribute
to a fundamental understanding of the Sun in general and solar wind in
particular; i.e., space weather forecasting. Moreover, the techniques employed
may be useful for the study of the marine boundary layer, important for short
range radio communications over the ocean.
