The Fields Institute in Toronto will host and fund (Canadian $200,000) a
Thematic Program on The Mathematics of Drug Resistance in Infectious Diseases",
July-August 2010. This application seeks support for junior U.S. researchers
(graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty) to participate in
the program.

Drug resistance by bacteria and virus has been regarded as one of the biggest
threats to public health in the new century. The proposed two-month thematic
program at the Fields Institute will focus on the Emergence of Drug Resistance
in Infectious Diseases and will bring together leading researchers in
mathematical epidemiology/immunology from around the world in order to stimulate
major progress in this area. The program will consist of two main sub-themes
that are of fundamental importance to understanding and predicting the emergence
of drug resistance: (a) Mathematical Immunology: from In-host to Population
Modeling; (b) Transmission Heterogeneity in Infectious Diseases. Each of the
above sub-themes represents an important area of current research interest and
importance to public health, and each also provides ample opportunities for the
advancement of mathematical theories and techniques.

This award is being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and
by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).
