Emerging contaminants (ECs) generally refer to chemicals and materials recently
detected in the environment, and which may have potential or real threat to
human health or the environment. The challenge of ECs intersects several
industries including the pharmaceutical and personal care products industries,
producers of nano-sized materials, as well as entities that treat wastewater and
drinking water. A planning meeting will be held to investigate the proposed
establishment of a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Emerging Contaminants. The lead location of the proposed center will
be at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, with a second site at Villanova
University. The mission of the proposed center is to address sensing and
remediation of emerging contaminants (EC).

The proposed center will pursue research projects of importance to a broad range
of U.S. companies seeking to avoid becoming a major contributor to pollution.
The center and its research activity will involve faculty researchers, graduate
and undergraduate students working together with industrial representatives. The
center will further enhance the ongoing efforts at both institutions of
integrating research in classroom teaching.
