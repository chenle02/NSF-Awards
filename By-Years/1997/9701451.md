Sneddon, Christopher University of Minnesota The doctoral dissertation research
will examine water quality and water resource development in Thailand. The core
of the research involves two case studies of water development in northeast
Thailand- the Nam Pong and Lam Takhong river basins. Using a combined
historical-empirical analysis of ecological and socio-economic changes with
interviews focusing on water conflict, the research will assess the
sustainability of past and current strategies of water resource development in
the region. The data collection scheme involves interviews and archival work to
reveal information about state decision making that affects resource development
and resulting conflicts.
