The objective of this research is to prepare and thoroughly characterize series
of polymers and copolymers of the unusually highly strained monomer, ı1.1.1!
propellane, which has only recently become available in substantial amounts.
These polymers will have unprecedented structures. Due to the presence of
bicyclo ı1.1.1! pentane rings, they will contain up to 14 kcal/mol strain energy
per carbon atom. This high energy content, combined with the instability of
cations derived from the bicyclic ring system, suggests them as candidates for
e-beam and X-ray resists and, with suitable doping, optical storage materials.
Moreover, the rigid-rod nature of poly ı1.1.1! propellane segments and their
tendency to crystallize, discovered in preliminary experiments, promise other
interesting properties. A major goal is to modify the polymerization process and
the structure of the products so as to produce tractable polymers.
