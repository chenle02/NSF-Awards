This proposal requests funds to purchase two multi-user instruments for
oligonucleotide and peptide synthesis. An Automated Oligonucleotide Synthesizer
would allow uninterrupted core DNA service by replacing an old, undependable and
inefficient instrument. A Multiple Peptide Synthesizer would allow improvements
in basic research projects currently hampered by the expense and time required
for synthesis of a large number of peptide analogs. The major users would be
NIH/NSF funded researchers in the Colleges of Agriculture, Arts and Sciences,
Medicine, and the Arizona Research Laboratories (an interdisciplinary division).
The instruments would be housed in the Macromolecular Structures Facility
established by the Division of Biotechnology. Skilled personnel will operate,
maintain and train other users. THe specific research that would be enhanced by
these instruments includes: the molecular biological basis for cell
differentiation and morphology; plant gene expression and responses to
biological stresses (salt, low water, heat); heat shock proteins; RNA
processing, protein transport and gene expression in chloroplasts; yeast mRNA
stability; gene transcription regulation and self-processing; cytokeratin
immunology and biochemistry; expression of insect protease inhibitors; insect
endocrinology; insect protein, lipid, and structure function studies; total
immune system evolution; electron transport protein biochemistry and studies on
peptide/protein conformational constraints, hormone receptor recognition and
structure/function studies.
