The State University College at Cortland is offering a three-component program
to improve science education in grades K-3 in school districts within a 60-mile
radius of the University. The program includes one-day science Exploratoriums
for educators and the public to focus on the needs and possible solutions for
improved science education, an intensive two-week Summer Institute for four-
member teams consisting of K-3 teachers and an administrator from 10 regional
participating school districts, and an implementation project which will promote
and support quality science instruction in the District's primary grades. The 84
participants will be involved through hands-on inquiry experiences with
multidisciplinary science concepts, methodologies which encourage basic skills
through science instruction, activities which encourage participation of girls
and minorities in science, and the innovative use of technology to enhance K-3
instruction. Experienced peer teachers will be involved in the instruction as
well as in the follow-up on-site visits. An interesting part of the project
involves the training of parents and intermediate-age school children as lab
aides to further assist the classroom teacher in conducting a good experiential
program for the primary grade children.
