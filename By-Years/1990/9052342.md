The quality of undergraduate education in Computer Integrated Manufacturing
(CIM) is enhanced by the acquisition of state-of- the-art laboratory equipment
that demonstrates and stimulates experimentation with every relevant computer
integrated manufacturing concept. The equipment will be used to support
engineering education improvements in design, experimentation, manufacturing and
computer integration of the enterprise. This project is significant and of vital
importance because it will enable undergraduate students to perform laboratory
experiments within the context of a computer integrated manufacturing
environment while acquiring training in robotics, vision systems, computer
numerically controlled machines, automated material handling, instrumentation,
microprocessor applications, computer networking, and office automation. Twenty-
one courses involving eight full-time faculty in mechanical engineering,
electrical engineering, and industrial engineering will utilize the laboratory
to improve the quality and quantity of Computer Integrated Manufacturing
instruction in undergraduate engineering education.
