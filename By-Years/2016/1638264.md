A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of
the 37th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and
Implementation (PLDI), one of the premier conferences in the area of programming
languages and compilers. The conference will be held in Santa Barbara,
California. This grant will support approximately 15 students to attend the
mentoring workshop plus the PLDI conference. This proposal is intended
specifically to target women students and students from underrepresented groups
and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader
significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden
participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from
leading members of the programming languages community, and build the next
generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important
research arena.
