Miami University Middletown, in partnership with the major chemical industries
in Ohio and a regional consortium of two-year and four-year colleges and high
schools, is establishing a regional consortium for Chemical Technology
Education. By bringing academic courses into closer touch with today's
industrial chemistry, the project is attracting additional students to careers
in chemistry and improving the quality of education of chemical technicians.
Four categories of activities are envisioned for the project: 1) Curriculum
Development; 2) Instructional Materials Development; 3) Faculty and Teacher
Enhancement; and 4) Student Enhancement and Outreach. High school and college
faculty are eligible for a Teacher Industrial Internship Program in which
participants spend a summer or part of an academic year working in partner
industries. Similarly, master high school teachers and two-year college faculty
are working in collaboration with industrial chemists in developing curriculum
and instructional materials. Symposia and special topic seminars are also being
organized on a regular basis. The project is being built upon the nationally
known eight-year old Partners for Terrific Science industrial/academic
partnership and programs housed in the Center for Chemical Education at Miami
University Middletown, as well as existing collaborative efforts of the
consortium members. This project is serving as a model for regional and national
development of improved chemical technician education.
