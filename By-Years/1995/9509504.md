Abstract ATM-9509504 Anderson, David M. University of Colorado Title: Extending
the Baseline of Climate Variability Using Laminated Sediments from Semi-Isolated
Marine Basins in Southern Chile This award supports the recovery and analysis of
laminated marine sediments spanning the last few thousand years in southern
Chile. Annually-resolved paleoclimate information from southern South America is
needed to understand the regional signal of global warming, and also to
understand the teleconnections between tropical and mid-latitude regions of the
southern hemisphere. Proxy records of temperature and precipitation (related to
the southern westerly winds) derived from marine sediments can substantially
improve the inventory of baseline climate records in this region where
instrumental data are sparse. Marine records provide a valuable complement to
terrestrial proxy records derived from tree-rings and lake and bog sediments,
and a direct proxy (d18O) for rainfall driven by the southern westerly winds.
