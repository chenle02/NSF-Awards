This proposal requests support for a group from the University of Wisconsin to
develop a portal to facilitate the seamless access to the world-wide grid with
computers that are not specially configured for the use of a particular project.
The techniques developed will have general applicability to various computing
intensive projects, including the high energy physics experiment CMS (at the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Switzerland). It will leverage the tools
developed by the GriPhyN (Grid Physics Network), iVDGL (international Virtual
Grid Laboratory) and the PPDG (Particle Physics Data Grid)
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities are to develop an object
IO model that allows local caching and organized streaming of data to central
servers; to adapt a CMS simulation program to take advantage of an abundance of
CPU resources; and to establish an on-demand CMS simulation facility using the
above items. The deliverables will be implemented in such a way that
generalization to other projects is possible and the validated software tools
will be made freely available.&lt;br/&gt;
