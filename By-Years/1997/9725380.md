9725380 Williams Crenulation cleavage is the most common type of cleavage in
multiply deformed rocks, but many questions remain about how it is formed. This
project will investigate the Moretown Formation in Western Massachusetts where
small-scale folding and crenulation cleavage is well-exposed. Additionally, this
area also features a gradient between uncrenulated domains, to domains with
classic crenulation cleavage, to schistose high-strain domains, and individual
compositional layers can be traced across the fabric transitions. The work will
integrate analysis of folds and cleavage, geochemistry related to mass balance
and possible volume changes and compositional imagining to document mass
transfer. Results shoud understanding of deformation mechanisms involved in
crenulation cleavage.
