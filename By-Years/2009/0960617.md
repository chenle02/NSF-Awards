Research on organized American religion has focused almost exclusively on
congregations and denominations. This research aims to explore an understudied
but increasingly significant type of religious organization: 'parachurch' or
nonprofit religious organizations (NROs). The investigators draw upon previous
work on the creation of organizations to develop hypotheses about how spiritual
entrepreneurs start new religious enterprises, as well as how community contexts
might affect rates of NRO creation. A data set will be assembled that will allow
the exploration of the sources, processes and consequences of spiritual
entrepreneurialism. The investigators will survey two cohorts of newly
registered NROs about their founders, founding decisions and activities, and the
current status of their organization such as whether it remains viable and, if
so, its size, structure and focus. Finally, a sub-set of respondents will be
contacted for more extensive open-ended telephone and in-person interviews.

Broader Impacts The research has the potential of illuminating an important
domain of religious and nonprofit activity in the U.S. that contributes
importantly to its religious and social vitality while at the same time
integrating the study of profit making entrepreneurialism with spiritual
entrepreneurialism.
