The nations economy, well-being and security are linked to engineering-driven
innovation and the future of engineering is inextricably linked to broadening
participation in the field. As stewards of the profession, Deans of engineering
are acutely aware of these linkages and uniquely positioned to provide
leadership in the development of a diverse cadre of engineers who are
innovators, leaders and problem-solvers. In particular, as a group, the
engineering deans serving on the NSF Directorate for Engineering Advisory
Committee, AdCom serve as intermediaries between NSF and the broader engineering
community and help guide investments in engineering research and education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Engineering Deans Forum on Broadening Participation
anchored by the Engineering AdCom Deans as a backbone organization within a
collective impact framework, serves as a national network for sharing and
disseminating, convening, and building partnerships toward the training and
preparation of a diverse engineering workforce. The goals of the Forum are to 1)
increase the percentage of underrepresented groups in engineering, 2) achieve
diversity and inclusion in engineering research and education, and 3) provide an
ongoing mechanism to achieve the aforementioned goals. Through its activities,
the Engineering Deans Forum guides the development and implementation of
innovative approaches to diversity and inclusion and helps bring evidence-based
practices to scale across institutions leading to a diverse and agile
engineering workforce representing the full range of talent in the country.
