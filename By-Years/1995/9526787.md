9526787 Hager This project involves a multi-disciplinary investigation of the
deep structure and kinematics of deformation of the Tien Shan, the largest and
most active intracontinental mountain range in the world. The objective is to
understand the dynamic processes responsible for intracontinental mountain
building, using the Tien Shan as a laboratory to ask: Why and how such
deformation occurs where it does within continental regions, how such
deformation evolves with time, what bounds does the deep structure place on flow
in the mantle, and how do such possible flow and pre-existing geological
heterogeneity relate to the observed deformation of the upper crust? This award
provides a modest amount of funding for scientific and logistical planning to
develop a phased approach and sound management plan for this complicated
project. ***
