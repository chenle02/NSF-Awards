9505845 Magliveras This research explores a new lossless image compression
technique. The method is based on optimal non-linear codes of spanning trees.
Maximum compression rates occur for codes of a certain critical covering radius,
whose value depends on the statistical characteristics of the image. The method
utilizes variable image-scanning using codes of spanning trees to maximize
compression ratios. Compression rates are expected to be significantly better
than those achieved by previous methods. ***
