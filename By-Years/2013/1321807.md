An important building block of DNA and proteins, nitrogen (N) often limits plant
growth in natural ecosystems. Still, the source of N to northern conifer forests
is a long-standing ecological mystery. In these ecosystems, N accumulation in
the soil and plants is much higher than expected given the known N input
sources. Bacteria called endophytes, which live inside plant tissue, may provide
part of the explanation. Although some forest conifers can grow in extremely
nitrogen limited soil, they are not generally believed to cooperate with
bacteria that can reduce, or 'fix' atmospheric N2. This project is designed to
determine if endophytic bactera fix N in the aboveground tissues of forest
pines. To do this, the investigators will use a method called Nanometer-Scale
Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (NanoSIMS), an instrument suited to measure,
visualize and quantify the distribution of elements and their stable isotopes
within cells. The investigators will expose pine needles to the stable isotope
15N, which only makes up a fraction of naturally occurring N. NanoSIMS will then
be used to visualize endophytic bacterial cells that have taken up 15N, as well
as nearby plant cells containing 15N. The researchers expect this project to
provide the first quantitative and direct demonstration that bacterial
endophytes provision host plants with fixed atmospheric N, and identify a
potential source for missing N inputs to forests. The amount of N available to
forest trees affects how much carbon is stored on land and how much remains in
the atmosphere, therefore, discovery of a new forest N input pathway will
improve our ability to predict future climate-change. The project will provide
scientific training to a diverse group of students at UC Merced, a university
with a large percentage of students from underrepresented backgrounds, and to
K-8 students in a rural, low-income area of California.
