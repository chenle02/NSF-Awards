The purpose of this research is to increase our understanding of the factors
that influence climate in urban areas, particularly those involved in energy
exchanges between the "canyons" formed by tall buildings on the one hand, and
the atmospheric layers that overlay the "canopy" formed by clusters of adjacent
tall buildings on the other. Professor Arnfield will measure energy flows within
selected urban canyons and at their tops. A numerical model will then be used to
simulate the energy budget of such canyons and to relate them to atmospheric
features overlying building canopies and to other aspects of urban climates.
This research is important to understanding the relationship between the
microclimates of urban canyons and the broader climatology of cities.
