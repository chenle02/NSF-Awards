The goals of the Magnetics Information Consortium (MagIC) are to develop an open
community digital data archive for rock and paleomagnetic data with web portals
that allow users free access to archive, search, visualize and download these
data to improve research capabilities in the Earth sciences. Much progress has
been made, with data from more than 4,000 scientific publications in its
holdings and a state-of-the-art user search interface.

With this award,the principal investigators extend their current 2-year grant
into a 5-year overall project to bring MagIC into the realm of modern-day
interoperability with other Earth Science databases (e.g. with GPlates and
IODP), and with initiatives like EarthChem and Geochron, to provide seamless
access to geochemistry information and radiometric ages on the sample data
stored in MagIC. They also will focus on streamlining data entry, providing a
personal workspace, an online review system, simple web services, providing
advanced visualization tools from Google and involving more researchers in the
archiving and reviewing uploaded data in order to maintain the reliability of
the archive.
