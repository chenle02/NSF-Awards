The High-Tc Superconductivity Information Exchange has been designated by the
President as the national Superconductivity Research Basic Scientific
Information Center. It provides a centralized site for quickly disseminating up-
to-date information to researchers in the rapidly evolving field of high-
temperature superconductivity. The project's goal is to enable US scientists to
keep abreast of what other researchers here and abroad are doing and to provide
a coordinated communications network for the high-Tc research community. The
Information Exchange has two parts: the High-Tc Update, which is published twice
a month, and the information clearinghouse. The twice-monthly High-Tc Update is
available as hard copy and as electronic mail (e-mail). The complete, hard- copy
newsletter includes preprint lists, high-Tc news, meeting summaries, coming
events, resources, funding information. The shorter, e-mail version consists of
the preprint lists only. E-mail is also used to send high-Tc news flashes and
important, last-minute announcements. Clearinghouse activities include
responding to individual inquiries and providing basic scientific information
upon request. Research news spreads rapidly in this volatile field, and
scientists, the media, and industry contact the Information Exchange for up-to-
date, reliable information.
