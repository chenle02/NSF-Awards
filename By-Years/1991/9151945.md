Students at Ohio State University are studying calculus in a computer lab
containing NeXT computers and running MATHEMATICA. The materials they are using
are being developed as part of the Calculus & Mathematica project of H. Porta
and J. Uhl at Illinois and W. Davis at Ohio State. The project provides a
"living textbook", total immersion, singularly tutorial approach to learning
calculus to students. The textbook is being written and piloted at Illinois and
Ohio State, and being adopted by several other institutions now. The focus of
the project, in the eyes of the developers, is on the Mathematics of Calculus,
and the appropriate teaching of the subject.
