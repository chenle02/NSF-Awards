The problem of the origin of granulites is of interest to a wide cross-section
of Earth Scientists because present-day surface outcrops are believed to give
clues to processes operating, past and present, in the lower crust. It is
proposed to study the causes of granulite metamorphism and to identify the
geochemical effects of hornblende breakdown. The breakdown will be studied in
two places in the contact aureole of the Laramie Anorthosite. In one locality
hornblende breakdown due to simple dehydration, while in other breakdown is in
response to CO2-fluxing from adjacent marble. Both of these mechanisms of
hornblende decomposition have been proposed as causes of granulite metamorphism.
The results of the Laramie Anorthosite investigation will be applied to
interpreting the origins of charnockites in the Wind River Mtns. An attempt will
be made to determine the origin of granulite selvages in the country rock of
charnockite dikes. Criteria will be established for distinguishing igneous
charnockites from granulite gneisses metamorphosed in the granulite facies. The
research will use field mapping, petrology, electron microprobe analyses, stable
and radiogenic isotope analyses to deduce the processes of granulite formation
and their geochemical signatures.
