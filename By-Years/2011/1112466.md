The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the collaborative research program of Prof. Barney Ellison and
Prof. Daily of the University of Colorado and Prof. John Stanton of the
University of Texas at Austin. This interdisciplinary collaborative team of
investigators and their students will develop a novel biomass spectrometer that
combines tunable vacuum ultraviolet photo ionization mass spectrometry (VUV
PIMS) detection with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to study the
fundamental chemical processes of forest fires. The project will combine state-
of-the art spectroscopic methods to characterize the organic chemistry of
reactive carbon species formed during biomass burning (Ellison), advanced
spectral analysis methods to analyze infrared and mass spectra (Stanton) and
computational fluid dynamics calculations and Monte Carlo simulations (Daily) to
model the fluid dynamics of the planned biomass spectrometer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biomass spectrometer will enable the group to study
the mechanism of biomass cracking during forest fires by identifying chemical
intermediates and by-products of biomass burning. The project will solve a very
difficult and complex chemical problem and enable the interpretation of highly
complex field data which is obtained during forest fires. The project will
provide excellent interdisciplinary training opportunities for students who wish
to pursue a professional scientific career in an area of great environmental
importance.&lt;br/&gt;
