The purpose of this project is to identify a study group and to convene a
workshop of a select group of scientists to address the issues definitions,
references, and survey techniques on the demography of scientists and engineers
with disabilities. The participants will prepare an agenda and strategy for the
development of an implementable methodology to study the demography of disabled
scientists and engineers, and suggest interventions to increase the numbers of
disabled individuals in science and engineering. The workshop is a first step in
fully utilizing a group of individuals who are currently underutilized and to
increase their participation in educational programs leading to employment in
science and engineering. The papers produced by the workshop will be widely
publicized to researchers in the areas of questionnaire and other sampling
issues, as well as to the affiliated scientific and engineering societies of
AAAS. An additional component of the workshop is a third day to be held in
conjunction with the U. S. Bureau of the Census, at which a select sub-group of
the participants in the first two workshop days will meet with a number of
individuals from the Bureau of the Census to discuss the phrasing of the
questions concerning disability in the 1990 Census. These discussions will help
in the final formulation of the Census questions concerning disability. These
activities have important implications for the current and the future scientific
and technological health of the United States. The identification of under-
employed, disabled scientists and engineers will help to alleviate present
shortages if such persons are appropriately employed. The motivation of young,
disabled students will help to increase the shrinking cohort of 22-year-olds
from which we will get our future supply of scientists and engineers.
