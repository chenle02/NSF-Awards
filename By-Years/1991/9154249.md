Science and technology faculty members from some of the Virginia Community
Colleges will form small interdisciplinary Learning Groups with science faculty
from James Madison University to work on team-oriented projects. Each project
group will consist of three or four participants and a Group Leader. The
emphasis will be on learning particular methods, techniques, and/or
instrumentation use which can be utilized in undergraduate classes. Particular
areas include: Protein Purification, DNA Probes, Elemental, Ion, and Crystalline
Analysis, Polycrystalline Fabrics, Microprocessing Programming, and Plant Tissue
and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Development of Instructional Materials using
both case studies and computer-driven courseware authoring have been built into
the program. Priority will be given to faculty from the Virginia Valley
Consortium. but others will be considered on a space available basis.
