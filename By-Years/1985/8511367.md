administration of the travel grant and will constitute a committee of scientists
that will screen the requests for travel support and make recommendations for
funding. During the meeting the assembly will discuss the engineering issues
related to: snow melt - induced processes and forecasting; changes in water
quality and presence of pollutant in snow and snow melt waters; and surface
water - groundwater quantitative and qualitative interactions.
