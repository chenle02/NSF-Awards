In this project, the goal is to investigate the distribution of random variables
arising from practical problems such as solving linear systems of equations or
finding the roots of high degree polynomials. These problems are critical in
many developments in computer science and engineering. Finding roots of a
polynomial is, in particular, a classical and fundamental problem with
widespread applications. The main focus of the project is to prove that many
natural distributions of random variables do not have large mass on a single
point. With this new tool, the investigator hopes to provide answers to long-
standing questions such as: In a typical case, how many roots of a polynomial of
degree n are real? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator aims to
develop a theory for the anti-concentration phenomenon. Anti-concentration
inequalities have been playing an important role in many areas where probability
is involved. Recent new insights in the field have led to a significant
refinement of several classical results with a broad range of applications. The
investigator plans to extend the new results to a more general (nonlinear)
setting. Achievements in this direction will have an immediate impact in
different fields. Another part of the project continues the study of random
discrete structures, in particular, random matrices and random polynomials. The
PI will investigate various basic problems, such as properties and distribution
of random determinants, the non-existence of multiple eigenvalues and its
relation to the QR algorithm, and the classical question: How many roots of a
random polynomial are real? He will also investigate sum-set problems in
additive combinatorics (for example, an old question of Erdos and Moser on sum-
free sets in a group).
