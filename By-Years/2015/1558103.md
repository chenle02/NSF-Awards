To understand how our brains work, we must understand how groups of neurons work
together to perform computations on environmental inputs to produce behavior.
When neurons in a circuit compute, their activity and the output from the
network can often be described by a series of mathematical operations, like
addition, subtraction, and multiplication. A canonical example of neural
computation is the eye's detection of visual motion, which employs mathematical
operations that are present in many circuits in the brains of many animals. This
research investigates the mathematical operations that describe the output of
this neural computation, as well as how those operations are implemented by
specific neurons in the circuit and how the selection of specific operations
changes the performance of the circuit. The broader impact of this project
focuses on high school outreach, where it will teach a module on visual
perception and illusions. The project will also focus on bringing high school
and undergraduate students into lab to perform research in an accessible
experimental system.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the small
circuit of motion detecting neurons in the eye of the fruit fly Drosophila. The
fruit fly's eye is an ideal target for study because its circuit is small and
increasingly identified; genetic tools allow us to manipulate and measure from
individual, identified neuron types in order to test hypotheses; and a long-
standing modeling framework can be used to interpret results. To understand the
details of the circuit's computation, we will use behavioral psychophysics and
in vivo calcium imaging to record circuit responses to specially designed visual
stimuli that isolate specific neural computations. We will use responses to
these stimuli and others to simulate circuit responses to visual stimuli.
Genetic silencing will allow us to identify neurons that are involved in the
motion computation. These experiments will lead us to an understanding of which
nonlinear operations are implemented in this circuit, and how those operations
affect the circuit's performance.
