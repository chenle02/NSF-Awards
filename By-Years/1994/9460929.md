The work proposed here will result in the development of a new type of infrared
detector utilizing very recent developments in microcantilevers.
Microcantilevers that are 50-200 (m long, 10-40 (m wide, and 0.3-3 (m thick are
commonly used in scanning force microscopy (SFM) to detect forces in the range
of 10-12- 10-9 N. Such devices can be mass produced using micromachining. Using
the bimetallic effect and geometrical optimization, cantilevers can be designed
that are capable of measuring temperature changes as small as 10-8 K. Cantilever
deflections less than a few tenths of a nanometer can be accurately measured
using optical, piezoresistive, or capacitive techniques. For infrared detection,
these microcantilevers can be coated with infrared absorbing materials. An array
of these microcantilevers with specific coatings can be used to detect and
characterize a wide range of radiation. Reference microcantilevers can also be
used to compensate for temperature fluctuations in sensor devices. If a stress-
or thermally-responsive coating is used then deflections can also be measured as
changes in resonance frequency. The objective is to develop an infrared detector
that is sensitive, miniature, and can be mass produced. The proposed work would
provide a highly significant advance in detector technology with implications in
many areas.
