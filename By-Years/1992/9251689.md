This project develops an instrumentation laboratory for machinery diagnostics
and condition monitoring to meet the need for imparting hands-on, technical
skills related to the dynamic characterization, detection and prediction of
incipient failures of machine components. Diagnostics concepts such as resonant
and off-resonant response, Fourier spectrum, transfer function, coherence and
cascading of vibration signals are demonstrated, as well as introduction to the
selection of transducers and their computer interface for rapid data acquisition
and analysis. Instrumentation applications for machine diagnostics is central to
this project. The laboratory enables cohesive and effective instruction of basic
vibration principles and their application for machine diagnosis, to the four
year upper level undergraduate engineering technology students of Texas A&amp;M
University. The laboratory is used in three interrelated courses, namely Applied
Vibrations, Instrumentation, and Electro-Mechanical Systems. Nearly 150 students
annually from the mechanical, manufacturing and electronics engineering
technology specialties will benefit.
