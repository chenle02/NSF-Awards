&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0239179&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Li Shi&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation:
University of Texas&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: CAREER: Thermal transport and
thermoelectric measurements of nanotransistors, nanowires,and
superlattices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This career-development program proposes to
investigate thermal transport of nanotransistors that are influenced by
ballistic charge transport, and to characterize thermoelectric properties of
nanowires and superlattices with potentially superior thermoelectric figure of
merit. Techniques for nanoscale quantitative mapping of temperature and electric
fields will be developed for studying heat dissipation and local hot spots in
sub-100 nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and SiGe metal-oxide-semiconductor field
effect transistors (MOSFETs), and in single wall carbon nanotube (SWCN) devices.
A suspended micro- device will be used to characterize thermoelectric properties
of nanowires and to investigate quantum thermal transport in SWCNs. The PI will
further develop a technique for nanoscale mapping of Seebeck coefficient across
individual quantum well and barrier layers of Si/Ge and GaAs/AlAs superlattice
coolers. &lt;br/&gt;The PI will adopt effective models for micro-nano scale
engineering instruction. He will integrate micro-nano scale thermo-fluids
teaching with existing undergraduate courses via a curriculum reform effort
focused on Project-Centered Education at his home department. Further, the PI
will develop a new graduate course on micro-nano scale thermal/fluid science and
technology, and an introductory laboratory section for use in regular summer
workshops organized by the PI's institution for K-12 teachers, women and
minority students.&lt;br/&gt;The award is supported by the Thermal Transport and
Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems
Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
