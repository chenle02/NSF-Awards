The ability of systems to assemble and organize without direct control or
intervention is fundamental to biological and non-biological systems. Materials
such as complex polymers may self-assemble into a wide variety of forms, and
have many nanotechnology and biomedical applications. This project studies
models of material self-assembly to develop theoretical insight and predictive
capabilities. Formulas are developed that connect microscopic molecular
properties to mechanical and morphological behaviors at larger scales.
Computations are employed for predicting novel behaviors and custom-tailoring
inputs for engineered nanostructures. The award provides research and
educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project broadly investigates polymer,
amphiphilic, and particle-based systems, and processes fundamental to the
creation of nanoscale materials. Models describing formation of nanoparticles
and amphiphilic structures in heterogeneous polymer systems are examined using a
mixture of analytical and computational approaches that quantify equilibria,
morphology, and dynamics. In conjunction with these models, algorithms for
inverse problems will be developed for purposes of parameter identification and
engineering design. Self-assembled systems involving a large number of
interacting particles are studied within the same framework, leading to
predictions of pattern formation and collective behavior. Byproducts of the
research include the development of numerical and inverse problem
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
