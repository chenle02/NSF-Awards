Aspects of topology of algebraic varieties, closely related with their
arithmetic properties, will be studied. Particular emphasis will be on
development of new topological invariants (e.g. various versions of motivic
perverse sheafs), and on structures emerging in conformal field theories
(geometry of loop spaces). This work combines ideas from theoretical physics
with others from geometry, using methods which are equally diverse.
