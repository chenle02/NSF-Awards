This project uses game theory and empirical analysis to understand the incentive
and stability properties of resource allocation mechanisms. The investigator
develops a theoretical framework to compare allocation methods based on the
extent to which they are susceptible to 'gaming'. The goal is to understand
whether one method is more or less easy for one group of participants to
manipulate. This work provides a coherent analysis of existing allocation
methods, and it also provides a framework for comparing new methods that are
developed by other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second project funded
by this award studies how a particular type of complementarity (the presence of
couples) affects the inventives and performance of two-sided matching markets,
such as those used for entry-level labor market clearinghouses. The data
analysis part of this project uses data from the centralized labor market for
psychologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has substantial and direct
social benefit. It creates tools that will aid school administrators in
developing new ways to conduct school choice programs. The PI has already been
involved in designing new methods for school choice programs in New York and
Massachusetts.
