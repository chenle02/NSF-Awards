Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) will be used to experimentally analyze flow
structures and species concentration in a curved two-dimensional turbulent
mixing layer. Data from multiple planar light sheets will be combined to
construct a global view of the entire flow field. Mixing at the molecular level
will be inferred from measurements of the probability density function of
mixture fraction of fluorescence dye. Flow configurations with both stabilizing
and destability curvature effects will be utilized. Curvature is one means for
enhancing or reducing the mixing effectiveness between two flowing streams, with
relevance to combustion and fuel systems as well as chemical processes.
