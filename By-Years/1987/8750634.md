This project is to create a computer graphics laboratory in the Department of
Industrial Engineering. Twelve Tektronix graphics terminals and digitizing
tablets will be connected to a host Vax computer. Three area of graphics will be
stressed. In addition to the conventional uses for computer graphics,
communication and documentation, the idea of "ideation" will be explored. This
idea is to give the engineering student a graphical tool to enable the student
to visualize the design of an item. This should help the student to be more
creative without spending a lot of time at the drafting board making paper
images.
