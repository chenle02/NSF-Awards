Title: IEEE EMBS Infrared Imaging Workshop

Infrared imaging is an emerging technology and has the potential of leading to
multi-modality sensor systems for enhancing the screening, diagnostic, and
therapeutic capabilities of future medical practice. It can also be used alone
for applications such as those of a pathophysiological nature (functional and
soft tissue imaging); a unique advantage since it is provided by a totally non-
invasive, non-ionizing, and low-cost procedure. The concept of thermal imaging
in medicine toady is being evolved with the use of the advanced infrared imaging
technology. It is now being merged with "smart algorithms" and image processing
for the effective interpretation of medical images and the building of new
bridges between computer science, engineering, and medicine. To this end, an
IEEE EMBS Infrared Imaging Workshop is being held. Experts in infrared sensors
technology, infrared image analysis and image interpretation are giving
presentation and discussing various uses of infrared imaging in medicine in a
hope to further the state-of-the-art.
