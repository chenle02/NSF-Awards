Knap 9617785 It is proposed to continue the now 41 year long time series of the
deep (3000 m) ocean hydrographic station near Bermuda known as Station S or the
Panulirus Station. Data collected to date have used by investigators in several
disciplines to examine fluctuations at periods from weeks to decades in the
western Atlantic Ocean. This continuous and on-going data set has proven to be
an important link in global ocean monitoring for both climate research and for
evaluating temporal changes of many parameters.
