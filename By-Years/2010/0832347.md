This 1-day workshop will bring together key members of the FAA, NSF, DHS, and
other agencies and invited leaders of the national science community in order
to: i) identify new basic research directions for unmanned aerial systems (UAS)
in areas such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, and human-robot
interaction and catalog computational issues such as software verification and
secure wireless communications that will allow safe operations in the NAS, ii)
identify requirements for safe operations of UAS in the NAS and translate those
needs into basic research objectives for academic research, and iii) clarify and
identify new mechanisms to facilitate timely academic research, especially in
small UAS. The workshop will involve the larger computational sciences into the
UAS community and generate a statement of research needs for UAS operations
specifically for the NAS. The close interaction of the FAA with the academic
research community is expected to lead to safe operation of UAS in the NAS. A
list of mechanisms or programs by which researchers can apply their research to
UAS or FAA problems will be created and a statement of clarification of
regulations and procedures for university researchers will be prepared.
