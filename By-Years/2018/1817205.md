The next generation of wireless systems are widely expected to connect a massive
number of low-energy sensors and actuators that form the fabric of smart
technologies and cyberphysical systems. The resultant 'Internet of Things' is
expected to be one of the major drivers of technological growth over the next
decade. However, its design presents new challenges to wireless engineers. One
of the key challenges is how to enable a massive number of low-energy wireless
devices to sporadically access the scarce spectrum with minimal coordination and
channel estimation overheads. While there are several existing solutions for
random access, they are not well-suited for this emerging paradigm due to high
energy cost for retransmissions and carrier sensing, near-far effects, or
significant control layer overheads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
fundamentally rethink wireless random access for IoT networks by identifying the
sporadic access of a massive number of severely energy limited devices as its
key distinguishing characteristic. It develops a mathematical framework to study
this problem and shows how this framework relates to a seemingly unrelated
problem in theoretical computer science called group testing. By building on
this connection it aims to develop optimal mathematical solutions that can be
translated to innovative random-access protocols which (a) jointly optimize
control and information layer tasks, such as device discovery and data
transmission; (b) embrace sensor collisions and thus, eliminate the complexity
and energy cost of collision resolution and retransmissions; (c) are designed to
satisfy stringent energy constraints and match the energy dynamics at the
transmitters; (d) employ simple modulation and detection techniques that do not
require channel estimation; and (e) are low-complexity (encoding/decoding),
flexible (can be applied in heterogeneous settings), and resilient to noise and
device imperfections. The multi-disciplinary nature of the formulated problems
will enable the cross-fertilization of ideas from different sub-disciplines of
electrical engineering, computer science and applied mathematics. The project is
complemented with a strong education and outreach program with an emphasis on
broadening participation in electrical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
