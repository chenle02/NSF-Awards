This project establishes a profile measurement laboratory. The equipment
includes state of the art equipment to trace the profiles of engineering
surfaces, necessary filters, a powerful microcomputer system for on-line date
recording and analysis, and a high resolution monitor to display the profiles
and results. The system uses standard specimens from the National Bureau of
Standards for reference measurements. This project enables students in four
manufacturing engineering courses to use the equipment and measure the profiles
and roughness of engineering surfaces. It also effectively illustrates several
manufacturing concepts including the usefulness of surface roughness data in
determining the functionally of parts as well as in diagnosing the condition of
production processes. Experiments focus on the effect of cutoff, cutting
conditions, use of cutting fluid, wear, and different production processes on
the surface roughness of parts. Databases developed as a part of this project
are used by students for the improvement of their skills in designing quality
specifications and selecting manufacturing processes to meet customer quality
requirements with optimum cost effectiveness. The award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution. //
