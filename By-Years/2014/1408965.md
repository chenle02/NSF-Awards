This award provides support for the initial operations of Future Earth, an
international research program that will provide the knowledge required for
societies to face the challenges posed by Global Environmental Change (GEC) and
to identify opportunities for transitions to global sustainability. Building on
30 years of international collaboration under the ICSU GEC programs, Future
Earth aims to facilitate collaboration among natural and social science
researchers and stakeholders from many countries. New research ideas and
collaborations will emerge from this multidisciplinary framework. Future Earth
will also help develop the next generation of globally engaged STEM researchers
across many disciplines. This award will allow the interim leaders of Future
Earth to begin implementation, continue regional engagement, support clustering
of existing GEC projects so that they can make a full contribution to Future
Earth, and create a small number of fast track initiatives.
