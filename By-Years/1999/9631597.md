9631597 Bohs This proposal involves the development and support of student
projects to aid the disabled, to be undertaken within the framework of a new
course in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Duke University. The
objectives of the proposed projects are to enhance engineering education,
provide students with insight into careers in working with the disabled, to
improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, and to serve the
community. Students will be paired with health care professionals who will
suggest assistive or therapeutic technologies to develop for a specific user or
group. The student, health care professional and course instructor will
formulate a plan for implementation with the goal of producing a completed
project that meets the need of the disabled person, as well as providing a
challenging design experience for the student. Five or six projects are expected
to be completed each year, involving students working individually or as small
teams. In addition to project development, the course will involve formal
lectures on topics such as engineering design and ethics, as well as numerous
student presentations and written reports. ***
