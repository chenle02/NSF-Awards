9732631&lt;br/&gt;Saff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year award supports US-
France cooperative research on the use of approximation theory and function
theory for linear system identification and control. It involves Edward Saff and
Vilmos Totik at the University of South Florida and Laurent Baratchart at INRIA
(French National Institute for Research in Informatics and Mathematics) in
Sophia-Antipolis. The researchers will collaborate on a newly proposed method
for solving certain inverse problems for convolutions, namely singularity
detection for two dimensional hybrid systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US
researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in utilizing potential
theoretical methods in application of problems. This is complemented by French
expertise in numerical approaches applied to theoretical problems. The problems
under investigation have a wide range of potential applications to fault
detection and safety analysis, mine detection, echography and
tomography.&lt;br/&gt;
