With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr.
Eric J. Enholm of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida. Dr.
Enholm's research is in the broad area of the development of new synthetic
methodology which can then be applied to a variety of total syntheses. The
specific goals of the proposed studies are to study synthetic applications of
various one-electron coupling reactions of two unsaturated centers which lead to
carbon-carbon bond formation. Dr. Enholm will focus his efforts on carbonyl-
alkene cyclization, the preparation of carbocycles from carbohydrates, the
coupling of dicarbonyl compounds and a newly developed free radical coupling
reaction mediated by tributyltin hydride. Targets projected for eventual total
synthesis include the natural products anguidine, tricotriol and tylonide
hemiacetal.
