9311901 Locke This project is on research to develop a new material for use in
electrophoresis and other bioseparation techniques. The new material consists of
a polyacrylamide gel with controlled channels that are formed by inducing
gelation around liquid crystalline DNA solutions. Once formed, the gels will be
characterized experimentally by measuring rates of diffusion and electrophoretic
migration. Also, modeling and computer simulation of the transport processes
will be performed. ***
