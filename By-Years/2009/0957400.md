This research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports
work by Professor Abel-Santos at the University of Nevada Las Vegas to study the
mechanism of Clostridium difficile spore germination using kinetic methods and
molecular probes. Kinetic analysis of C. difficile spore germination is used to
determine how small molecules (germinants) interact with C. difficile spores to
induce germination. Using germinant analogs as activators and/or inhibitors of
C. difficile spore germination allows defining which parts of the germinant
molecules are required for interaction with the C. difficile germination
machinery. Finally, photoreactive analogs serve to characterize which spore
protein(s) bind to the germinants. These complementary experiments will allow
mapping interactions between germinants and C. difficile spores. By using
techniques from chemistry, biochemistry, and microbiology, we are able to study
a hitherto intractable biological problem. The project has a broader impact on
education, as a diverse group of students receives multidisciplinary training in
chemistry, biochemistry, and microbiology to provide them with in-depth exposure
to both physical and biological sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since spore
germination is the fist step in establishing infection by C. difficile, a
molecular-level understanding of how spores germinate could eventually lead to
new approaches to prevent C. difficile associated disease. In a more general
sense, sporulating bacteria are used beneficially to control agricultural insect
pests. Furthermore, some sporulating bacteria species can be used to produce
precursors used by the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Thus, the chemical
techniques and knowledge developed in this project will be applicable to
understanding the germination process in important bacteria species.
