This project addresses the current disagreement about representation and realism
in science between many philosophers of science, scientists, and the general
public and, on the other side, many scholars in the humanities, social sciences,
and science studies. Call the former group `scientific realists` and the latter
`humanistic relativists.` Scientific realists insist that the pursuit of science
has taught us much about the natural world. We have learned that the earth
revolves around the sun, that continents move, that DNA has two intertwined
strands. These things are now known, and are not merely socially acceptable to
believe. But humanistic relativists reject such claims as absurdly naive. They
argue that there is no uniquely correct interpretation of nature. For them, the
history of science tells how different scientists and different societies came
to have the beliefs they in fact had. It is emphatically not the story of how
various truths came to be discovered. Stated in a realist vocabulary, both
scientific realism and humanistic relativism, as typically understood, are
mistaken. They both, however, express important truths about the nature of
science. Or, stated in a relativist vocabulary, neither interpretation of the
nature of science is appropriate for our times. A more appropriate framework (or
a more satisfactory synthesis) will incorporate some elements from both. The
purpose of this project is to develop a framework and vocabulary for expressing
a mediating point of view called perspectival realism. At the heart of this
mediating viewpoint is the notion of representation, and the strategy that will
be used to develop this notion is drawn from cartography. Maps have many of the
representational features needed for understanding how scientists use models to
represent the world. Maps are not universal, but embody a point of view, a
purpose, and a projection. Maps vary in accuracy, scale, detail, yet they manage
to correspond in various ways with the real world.
