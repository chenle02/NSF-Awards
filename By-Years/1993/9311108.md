This proposal calls for the study of the process of acoustic cavitation and the
accompanying emission of electromagnetic radiation. The light observed in this
process is called sonoluminescence. In the process of propagating acoustic waves
through a liquid containing microscopic cavitation can be violent enough to
damage even hardened materials, and the effective temperature within the bubbles
can reach thousands of degrees. There is a lack of knowledge of the physical and
chemical processes occurring in these processes. However recent studies have
produced conditions wherein a single, stable cavitation bubble is observed to
generate sonoluminescence every cycle. "Temperatures" associated with these
bubbles appear to reach levels near 100,000K and the electromagnetic emissions
inexplicably achieve a level of synchronity that is repetitive to within a part
1011. The duration of these synchronous pulses is less that 50 ps. Several
technological applications of this process have been suggested. This proposal is
for the study of the basic physics of this process.
