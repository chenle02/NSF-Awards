This awards supports the research of Professor P. Aluffi to work in algebraic
geometry. He will work on problems deriving from the study of hypersurface
singularities. He hopes to find a new formula for MacPherson's Chern class and
to extend result son duality of projective varieties. He hopes to apply some of
these results to the study of combinatorial questions on graphs. The research is
in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern
mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10
years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated
figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.
Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and
topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has
proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer
science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
