This grant provides funds to support students and junior faculty for travel to
the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2023), which will
take place in Melbourne, Australia in May, 2023. ICSE is the flagship conference
in the field of Software Engineering. The grant will provide travel and
registration support for students. The ICSE conference this year will have a
doctoral symposium, student mentoring workshop, and a new faculty symposium.
Conference attendance is important for the technical exchange of information and
research conversations/collaborations made possible by the conference, as well
as advances in the field made possible by these interactions. The conference
provides opportunities for education, training and mentoring to build the next
generation of researchers and practitioners in the field of software
engineering. The international nature of this conference helps develop a
globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build
the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
