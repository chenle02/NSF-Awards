Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical programs for the past workshops are
available online at [1-3].&lt;br/&gt;IMC is the primary venue for presenting new
research results on collecting and analyzing&lt;br/&gt;measurements of the
Internet. Last year's conference in Miami had more than 120 attendees.
This&lt;br/&gt;proposal requests funding to aid graduate students enrolled in
institutions in the United States in&lt;br/&gt;attending this premiere
conference. Attending conferences such as IMC is of
paramount&lt;br/&gt;importance for graduate students pursuing research in the
field. Authors have the opportunity to&lt;br/&gt;present their work and all
attendees have a chance to interact with many others
performing&lt;br/&gt;leading-edge research in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will serve to widen the audience
attending the Internet&lt;br/&gt;Measurement Conference, raising the level of
interaction and the potential for new collaboration,&lt;br/&gt;new
investigations, and higher quality research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal,
by enabling students to attend who might not otherwise be able,&lt;br/&gt;will
increase the dissemination of the conference's research results to a larger and
more diverse&lt;br/&gt;audience. By giving preference in grant awards to women
and minority students, we hope to&lt;br/&gt;widen the participation among these
underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by advertising to a&lt;br/&gt;wide range
of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of
institutions should&lt;br/&gt;be able to attend and benefit from the conference.
