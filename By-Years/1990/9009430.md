The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will establish a world class
calibration facility for CTDs and other hydrographic instruments that are
necessary for modern ocean science research. Permanent equipment and supplies
will be acquired and technical support will be provided to set up the facility
and make it operational. The facility will be housed in a new addition to an
existing building being constructed by the institution. Major components of the
calibration facility have been provided by the Office of Naval Technology. NSF
funded research projects such as WOCE will be the prime beneficiaries of the
facility.
