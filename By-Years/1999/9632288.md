9662288 Freeman Computerization of the Extant-plant Collections, KU Natural
History Museum The R.L. McGregor Herbarium at the University of Kansas is the
primary repository for specimens and information concerning the vascular plants
of central North America. Since 1985, KANU has been computerizing label data for
its more than 116,000 Kansas specimens. During this three-ear effort, staff will
capture data for the estimated 247,000 specimens not yet computerized, and
barcode and verify the records for all 363,000 KANU specimens. Data will be made
available via the Internet at regular intervals. The immediate goal of this
project is to make KANU collection data more widely available to scientists,
resource managers, and the general public, and to enhance management of the
collection. The project will also yield a robust data model and software
application that other herbaria can use. Ultimately, it is hoped the KANU
project will facilitate efforts to capture and integrate data from natural
history collections across the U.S. and elsewhere.
