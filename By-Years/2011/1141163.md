The project is a pilot study on the effectiveness of using online, interactive
technology (IdeaJamÂ© -- http://www.elguji.com/) as a mechanism for communicating
within the TUES community. This tool is being used to identify and promote TUES
funded innovations that are ripe for adoption and to gather information about
the teaching and pedagogical needs of STEM faculty members. Expected outcomes
include the collaborative identification of high interest innovations that can
be easily adapted by STEM instructors and promoted by professional societies or
by web and print publishers; feedback that developers can use to improve or
refine their innovations; the development of collaborations among instructors
sharing the same interests around an innovation; and the generation of new
ideas, research paths, and trends that might help define new funding
opportunities. The software tool supports Idea Jams, which are expanded versions
of online conferences with the usual "main stage" for scheduled live or streamed
presentations and, more importantly, mechanism for a high level of interactivity
and participation. The project is organizing two Idea Jams, one looking at all
STEM fields and one concentrating on engineering and mathematics. Each will run
for one to two days with three to four innovators making either live or taped
presentations. The project investigators are using established review criteria
to select specific innovations for presentation and a direct email campaign to
invite TUES PIs along with members of various organizations that support STEM
educational innovation to submit ideas. Data collected by the Idea Jam software
and also through focus groups are being used to provide participants with
feedback on how to promote and improve their innovations. The evaluation effort,
which is being led by independent evaluators, is using IdeaJam metrics, post Jam
surveys, and follow-up interviews to determine whether the approach is suitable
and effective as a dissemination tool for the STEM education community. The
project's broader impacts include a low-cost, effective mechanism for
strengthening the STEM education community and enhancing dissemination of
innovative educational approaches in a way that allows full participation of
under-resourced colleges and universities.
