The Synthetic Organic Program is funding the research of Dr. William S. Johnson
of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University. Dr. Johnson will continue
his world renowned studies on biomimetic polyene cyclization. The proposed work
focuses on the use of cation-stabilizing (C-S) auxilliaries to enhance
cyclization and also on the use of monoclonal antibody catalysis. The research
will employ various C-S groups to explore synthetic routes to pentacyclic
triterpenoids. Further, the C-S effect has led to to a proposed mechanism for
the action of oxidosqualene cyclases involving stabilization of the transition
states by ion pairing with external point charges delivered by the enzyme.
Synthesis will lead to partially cyclized substrates with appropriately located
positive centers and these compounds will be tested as possible transition state
analog inhibitors. The initial studies of monoclonal antibody catalysis will
focus on the design and synthesis of haptens which resemble cyclization
products.
