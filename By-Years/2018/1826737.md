This award supports a research project that studies how to create adaptive
knowledge infrastructures that will support and sustain research and management
programs through environmental and sociotechnical transitions. The project will
build knowledge to help address challenges in science policy and transition
management and will provide management and policy recommendations that are
applicable to creating adaptive knowledge infrastructures across disciplines and
locales. The study explicitly engages with how researchers go beyond
participation and play a role in initiating transformation. Looking to Scotland
as an exemplar of a nation that is investing heavily in innovation and research
for emerging low-carbon technologies will serve to provide a better
understanding of how to support these transitions and develop appropriate
science-policy measures in the US and globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research project will conduct a large-scale ethnographic case study and
transition analysis of renewable energy research, innovation, and development.
This project will take advantage of this unique historical juncture in which a
nation builds a scientific infrastructure, providing an exemplar of a
sustainability transition to a low-carbon sociotechnical imaginary; that is, an
imagined form of social life reflected in the design and implementation of a
national energy transition project. It will also develop theoretical frameworks
for understanding scientific innovation and transformation through novel
interdisciplinary engagement of STS and the field of sustainability transitions.
Understanding how knowledge infrastructures change has been identified as one of
the key research challenges for infrastructure
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
