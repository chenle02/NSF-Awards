Current devices to screen the hearing of newborn infants are cumbersome to use,
and consequently infants who are not expected to be at high risk for deafness
generally do not get examined. This proposal is to develop a small and
convenient data acquisition system that will allow the collection of auditory
evoked potentials, which, when appropriately analyzed, will allow the
discrimination between normal and hearing-impaired infants. The request is for
the support of a specific graduate student; she has experience uniquely suited
for the proposed task.
