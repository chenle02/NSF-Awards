With this CAREER award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the
integrated research and education program of Professor Corey Stephenson of the
University of Michigan. This research aims to develop green chemical
methodologies mediated by visible light sensitization. The methodologies will
benefit both laboratory and industrial research by introducing a more efficient,
environmentally benign approach for producing biologically active materials for
further investigations. This research will also play an important role in the
PI's educational plans, both as a training opportunity for students in his
laboratory, and also a hands-on experimental module designed to engage high
school students in the excitement of interdisciplinary science. Dr. Stephenson
reaches out to high school students by participating in the Wolverine Express
(an annual statewide high school visitation program) and developing a High
School Chemistry Week Program and a course for the Michigan Math and Science
Scholars Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates operationally
simple, catalytic methods that forgo the need for specialized photochemistry
equipment, utilizing inexpensive household light bulbs and energy efficient LEDs
for irradiation. It aims to develop 1) a general, catalytic approach to radical
chemistry taking advantage of ligand dependent redox properties of ruthenium and
iridium polypyridine complexes; and 2) a catalytic approach to the activation of
carbon-oxygen bond towards nucleophilic displacement reactions.
