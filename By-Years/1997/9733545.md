This research develops representations and algorithms to manage large digital
libraries of engineering knowledge. In engineering design, it is conservatively
estimated that more than 75% of design activity is case-based. This research
identifies new computational methods for reasoning about complex geometric and
engineering information. It develops the mathematical foundation and algorithmic
tools to support content-based retrieval from large engineering knowledge-bases
(such as are generated by modern CAD systems). This research identifies: (1)
classes of heuristic search algorithms for automated indexing and retrieval of
models from design knowledge-bases; (2) data structures for defining arbitrary
relationships among engineering data elements, based on their relationships
through product model geometry; (3) search interfaces for supporting customized
queries from outside agents. Additionally, this project develops an educational
plan that integrates the core computer science curriculum with complex problems
drawn from real-world application domains. This is accomplished through
incorporating interdisciplinary problem solving into basic Computer Science
classes, outreach activities with industry, and the National Design Repository
---digital textbook of design knowledge for users around the globe. This CAREER
plan will have an extensive impact on engineering design and computer-aided
manufacturing. http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/ wregli/EKB
