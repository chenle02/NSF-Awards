9421180 Hall JC Complex biological sounds are particularly important in
communication for many animals, as well as speech for humans. Such sounds
contain information in both spectral (sound wavelength, or pitch) and temporal
(patterning) domains. These properties are encoded in responses of neurons in
the auditory nerve carrying signals from the ear to the brain. The coded signals
are further transformed in two important relay centers in the brainstem and in
the midbrain, as excitatory and inhibitory processes converge in particular ways
on particular neurons. Some of the neurons in these centers are highly selective
in their responses to particular spectral and temporal features of vocalizations
by animals of the same species. Selectivity is created by combinations of
excitation and inhibition from neuronal inputs to these cells. This project uses
frogs, with their highly specialized calls, as a model system for exploring the
mechanisms of stimulus selectivity in auditory networks. A combination of
electrophysiology and pharmacology is used in a novel approach to clarify how
not just one, but two different inhibitory compounds, called GABA and glycine,
shape these responses and sharpen the stimulus selectivity of the system in the
different stages. Results will add to our knowledge of how time and frequency
filters are constructed and interact in the auditory system, and enhance our
general understanding of the biological and computational mechanisms that
underlie complex sound recognition. The impact will extend beyond sensory
neurobiology to studies of communication behavior, to engineering of artificial
speech, and to recognition systems for communications.
