This award will provide for one-half the funds necessary to acquire an isotope-
ratio-monitoring gas chromatography mass spectrometer. The University of Hawaii
has committed the additional funding required for this acquisition. This
instrumentation will be used in a variety of geologic and oceanographic research
programs in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of
Hawaii. Present need for this instrumentation is great and will be even greater
in the future. Current research requires the ability to analyze carbon,
oxygen,nitrogen,sulfur, and hydrogen isotopic compositions of samples and on-
line carbon isotopic compositions of individual organic compounds. Equipment
presently at Hawaii cannot now,nor in the future be up-dated to meet their
current research needs. The acquisition of this mass spectrometry system will
provide them with the capabilities to meet current demands as well as give them
the flexibility to add new technologies in the future.
