In this research, networking issues arising in communications systems and
parallel processing will be studied within a unified framework encompassing
several diverse technologies. The goal is the consolidation of basic networking
principles and techniques, and the development of a systematic methodology,
leading to a deeper understanding of the structural and analytical aspects of
networking and supporting innovative technologies. Under the networking
umbrella, several relevant issues are considered, including process scheduling
and resource sharing, coordination and protocol science, structural and
analytical modeling and optimization of discrete event dynamics and asynchronous
algorithmic implementations. Motivation for this research is drawn from variety
of modern technological areas, including high-speed communication networks and
service integration, radio networks and personal communications, parallel and
distributed computation, flexible manufacturing systems. Quite different in
several respects indeed, these technologies share certain key structural
features related to networking and parallelism. They also provide the natural
applications for this research where there is strong potential for important
technological innovations.
