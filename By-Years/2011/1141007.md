While many measures could immediately reduce the environmental burden of
disease, making such changes requires scientific literacy that informs
environmentally-driven decision making. The purpose of the "Breathe, Eat, Touch"
project is to use environmental health as a strategy to transform undergraduate
education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and create
a broadly educated citizenry that understands the intersection of natural
sciences and the mathematical science of public health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this project, the interdisciplinary team of investigators is developing,
implementing, and evaluating an environmental health learning experience that
exemplifies STEM education in the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. One
outcome is a collection of new undergraduate environmental health learning
resources that are portable and transferable, inquiry-based, and
experiential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*
engaging students in the design and implementation of new learning materials for
classroom and laboratory-based courses;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* deepening
students' understanding and enhancing ownership of material by developing a
database of service learning opportunities where undergraduates develop
resources to enhance STEM education in secondary schools and other community-
based programs;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* enhancing the pedagogical skills of
faculty through workshops on best practices in teaching;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*
developing cross-disciplinary faculty knowledge in chemistry, biology, and
epidemiology through an integrated team-teaching
experience;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* assessing student learning gains with and
without a formal laboratory component, and assessing effective practices in
interdisciplinary teaching; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* disseminating the
"Breathe, Eat, Touch" approach and resources to two-year and four-year
postsecondary institutions through print and online mechanisms.
