A cryogenic echelle spectrometer has been constructed for mid- infrared
astronomical observations. It has been shown to be an extremely sensitive
instrument, capable of a wide variety of astronomical observations. The
spectrometer observes ten positions along a slit projected onto the sky,
sampling 64 spectral points with resolving power between 1000 and 30,000. This
spectrometer will be improved by fixing several known problems, expanding its
capabilities, and making it accessible to a wider range of users. Specific
projects planned included: expanding the wavelength range observable to include
the 20um region, acquisition of backup data acquisition equipment, improvement
of data acquisition and analysis software, and study of infrared luminous
galaxies and interstellar molecules.
