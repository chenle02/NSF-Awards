The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Deep-sea Borehole Reentry Project is an
independent, coordinated undertaking of researchers through the France-USA
Cooperative Programs in Oceanography. The U.S. research participants will be
known as the Hawaii Research Team, which consists of researchers from the
Pacific International Center for High Technology Research (PICHTR), the
University of Hawaii (UH), and Makai Ocean Engineering. Institut Francais de
Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER) has been performing the
independently funded French effort. This work will continue with newly committed
funding in cooperation with the Hawaii team. The project's aim is two-fold:
first, to advance the state-of-the-art of autonomous underwater vehicles, and
second, to develop technologies needed by geologists to facilitate automatic
reentry of deep-sea boreholes so that new exploratory, experimental tools may be
deployed economically. The Hawaii researchers will develop teleoperated and
autonomous functions for the underwater system, including teleoperation,
adaptive control, artificial intelligence, computer vision, sensing, modeling,
simulation, and communication, as well as miniaturization and ruggedization of
developed technologies.
