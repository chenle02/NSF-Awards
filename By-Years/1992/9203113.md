This research will test three specific hypotheses that may account for the
maintenance of non-functional anther and pollen production in functionally
female plants of Thalictrum polygamum, a native perennial plant with a
cryptically dioecious breeding system. Anther and pollen production may remain
in females as a reward for insect pollinators because of selection pressure for
increased insect visitation (Adaptation Hypothesis); as a correlated response
because of selection maintaining anther and pollen production in males (i.e. a
strong, positive genetic correlation exists between anther and pollen production
in males and females, Genetic Constraint Hypothesis); or as vestiges of the
ancestral cosexual state because there is little or no selective benefit to
their removal (i.e. no "cost" to females for production of anthers and pollen,
Ancestry Hypothesis). The second portion of this project will evaluate the
evolutionary pathway by which dioecy has evolved in the T. polygamun, the
possible role of resource reallocation as a selective force important to this
transition, and the relevance of wind pollination to the change.
