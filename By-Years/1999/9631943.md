9631943 Gavin In previous work under NSF support, this laboratory was the first
to identify a myosin gene from the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena. In this
short-term continuation project, the cloning and characterization of the gene,
termed TETMYO, will be continued and a construct will be prepared for a gene
replacement experiment. ***
