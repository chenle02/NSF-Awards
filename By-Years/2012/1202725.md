Stressors to native species under global change: Invasive species as vectors of
infectious disease

As climate change progresses, invasive species will play an increasingly
prominent role in mediating the spread of infectious diseases around the world.
This research will investigate the role of invasive bullfrogs in spreading
chytridiomycosis via the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) to
native amphibian populations. Invasive bullfrog populations now occur in
numerous countries, and they compete with or prey on native frog species. In
addition, bullfrogs are resistant to Bd and act as vectors in spreading Bd to
native populations. This research will combine observational field studies with
controlled laboratory experiments to disentangle the effects of invasive
bullfrogs and Bd infection on native frogs, providing a framework for evaluating
the potential for invasive species to serve as disease vectors. Moreover, the
approach taken here is broadly applicable to other combinations of stressors,
species pairs, and regions of the world, and will be particularly relevant as
climate change broadly affects native-invasive and host-pathogen interactions in
systems around the world.

Approaches to broadening participation in ecological research will include an
educational outreach program for high-school students and a training workshop
for their teachers. These programs will give students and teachers the
opportunity to form their own hypotheses, design a study to test those
hypotheses, collect field data, analyze results, and present their studies to
peers. The course for high school students will provide a valuable opportunity
for students to conduct their own ecological research in the unique Sierra
Nevada ecosystem, and the teacher workshop will build the content knowledge
necessary to incorporate ecological research into high school learning
objectives.
