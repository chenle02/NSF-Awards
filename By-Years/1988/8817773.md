The PI will examine any polarity asymmetry in deep-sea sediment paleomagnetic
data from intermediate latitudes (north and south) to determine the actual
configuration of the standing non-dipole field. Better characterization of
persistent and polarity- dependent non-dipole field components is directly
relevant to our understanding of the behavior of the geomagnetic field during
polarity transitions, is needed for high resolution plate tectonic and true
polar wander studies, and may lend greater insight as to the physical source(s)
of field generation.
