Saint Vincent College will acquire three Apple-IIGS Systems and a mounting for
an existing 25 cm optical telescope. The computers will be interfaced with the
optical telescope and an existing 5 meter radio telescope for control of
telescope positioning and acquisition and analysis of data. In addition to
student research and advanced laboratory courses, activities using the
telescopes will be developed for application in the Introductory Astronomy,
General Physics and Electronics courses offered by the department of physics.
