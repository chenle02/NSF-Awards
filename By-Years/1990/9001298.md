The use of real time, computationally intensive graphical methods as
diagnostical procedures in statistical problems will be explored. Residuals in
high dimensional regression problems will be studied by means of restricted
grand tours. Innovative computational procedures such as slicing regressions to
find structure will be examined. This procedure is semiparametric rather than
nonparametric and promises to yield useful results when a few basic assumptions
are satisfied. Furthermore novel graphical summaries of uncertainty will be
explored in high dimensional problems.
