The Small Business Innovation Phase I Research will develop a formal algorithm,
and a corresponding software package, which constructs and evaluates regression
models automatically and can handle large data sets efficiently. Regression
analysis is widely used in all areas of physical and social sciences, medicine,
management, and engineering. Despite its widespread use, there is a significant
element of art in building regression models. In addition, the wide availability
of data makes it important to be able to perform regressions with very large
data sets and a large number of potential explanatory variables. The objective
is to take the art out of the construction of regression models, and, in doing
so, will achieve better regression models that are significantly faster, and
extend their capabilities to build much larger models in the presence of very
large data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial benefits of an automated
regression package would allow data mining in diverse areas such as marketing,
health care, insurance, credit cards, and finance. An automated regression
package that can handle very large data sets and many explanatory variables can
become the critical engine for data mining in all these industries.&lt;br/&gt;
