Superconducting materials have recently been discovered which have unprecedented
high values of the critical temperature Tc. These values of Tc are so high that
new physical mechanisms may be at work. Technological implications are
important. Single crystals of these new materials will be produced.
Investigations will be made of these single crystals by various methods,
including x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, secondary ion mass
spectrometry, Tc, anisotropy of the upper critical field Hc2(T), specific heat,
magnetic susceptibility X(T), and resistance R(T). With collaborators,
measurements will be made of the Raman effect, angle-resolved photoemission,
optical properties from the near infrared to the ultraviolet, acoustic
properties, and possibly inelastic neutron scattering. The main objective is to
obtain information about the electrons, the phonons, and the various
interactions among these particles to help understand the mechanisms of high
temperature superconductivity.
