9407774 Chave Investigators from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories, and University of Alaska will collaborate on a novel ocean
science instrumentation development project that will adapt very low-light
astronomical imaging technology for ocean research applications. The
investigators will construct a set of low light charge coupled device (CCD)
cameras that are designed to operate in three modes: 1) an ambient light imaging
tool; 2) as a simultaneous, multispectral scanner and 3) as a low resolution
spectrometer. The device will be deployed by the deep submersible ALVIN at
hydrothermal vents and at mid-ocean ridges. This work addresses a recent
scientific discovery of abiotic light in the deep ocean. The source of this
light is unknown, but the existence of photoreceptors on shrimp inhabiting these
very deep regions has produced speculation that a non-solar light source may
influence the local habitat. The proposed ALISS (Ambient Light Imaging and
Spectral System) is designed to measure the available light and its spectral
properties.
