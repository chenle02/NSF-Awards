Microtubules, a complex network of protein filaments found in the cytoplasm of
the cell, are important in the maintenance of form and function in nerve cells.
Developing nerve cells require the capacity to stabilize certain microtubule
populations, as well as the ability to make new microtubules. Abnormalities
observed in the aging brain may result from abnormal modulation of microtubule
stability. Understanding the regulation of neuronal form and function will
depend on knowing the mechanisms that regulate microtubule assembly and
stability. Microtubules, comprised of the protein tubulin that has been
acetylated, have been shown to be more stable. The investigator will study
whether tubulin acetylation regulates microtubule stability in neurons by
purifying an enzyme from brain tissue that acetylates tubulin. The enzyme
preparation will be used to acetylate brain microtubules in vitro, to determine
whether the microtubules cold stability is altered due to the effects of the
binding of microtubule-associated proteins. These studies will provide
information on acetylated tubulin enzyme regulation during postnatal brain
development, maturation and aging.
