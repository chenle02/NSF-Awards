This proposal is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of surface dynamics and laser desorption. The effects of metallic
and chemical additives on surface reaction kinetics will be investigated using
laser-induced thermal desorption (LITD) techniques. Effects of copper and
potassium additives on the surface diffusion and reaction kinetics of methanol
on the (100) face of ruthenium single crystals will be explored. Rates of
diffusion and reaction will be altered progressively by modulating the surface
electronic structure with varying additive coverage. Factors that control
surface kinetic parameters will be elucidated. The kinetics of elementary
processes on surfaces are central to a microscopic understanding of surface
chemistry and physics. Surface kinetic phenomena also play an essential role in
predicting and controlling heterogeneous catalysis. The kinetic measurements
that will be carried out in these studies will help to elucidate the role of
individual elementary steps in determining reaction kinetics and provide an
experimental basis for testing of theoretical models.
