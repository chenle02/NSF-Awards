9703870 Ruan This project lies in the area of Kahler geometry and its
application to mirror symmetry. More specifically, the investigator is to use
the idea of Kahler or Riemannian collapsing - a sequence of Kahler manifolds and
their limit manifold are considered - to further our understanding of mirror
symmetry. Riemannian manifolds are curved spaces equipped with a notion of
distance, also called a metric. The totality of (compact) Riemannian manifolds
itself can be given a metric so that when given an infinite collection of such
manifolds it makes sense to talk about clustering or converging. Mirror symmetry
is a phenomenon first discovered by physicists: in the popular 10-dimensional
string theory model of the universe, the invisible 6-dimensions arise as so
called Calabi-Yau manifolds possessing certain symmetry.
