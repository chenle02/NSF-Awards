Recent technical innovations in light and electron microscopy, the development
of new cellular markers, an increased capacity to generate antibodies to
specific cellular antigens, and improved techniques for in situ hybridization of
genetic probes have enormously enhanced our ability to study structures at the
cellular molecular levels. The investigators will implement instrumentation
which combines these recent advanced anatomical techniques with methods for
computer image analysis that they have developed over the past twenty years. The
instrumentation will be used for visualization in three dimensions (3D) of
cells, subcellular structures and specific molecular markers within cells and
tissues. Computerized image processing will be used to display stereo pairs or
images with real-time rotation for 3D visualization, with color used to
distinguish the different markers or structures. The instrumentation will be
used for many different research projects. These include studies of the
locations of viral proteins in infected cells, the distribution of mRNAs in
mouse cerebellar neurons, the spatiotemporal pattern of expression of homeobox-
containing genes, the morphology and interactions of developing and regenerating
neurons, the distribution of different types of vesicles during exocytosis, and
the assembly and transport of histones in yeast, as well as several others. The
proposed instrumentation will bring together neurobiologists and molecular
biologists with widely differing scientific backgrounds but with a common
interest, and will thus serve as a focus for the exchange of ideas and technical
expertise, as well as a means for initiating cross-disciplinary collaborations.
It will play an important role in expanding the range of approaches used by
individual investigators, effectively helping the neurobiologists and cell
biologists to become more molecularly oriented, and the molecular biologists
more cellularly oriented.
