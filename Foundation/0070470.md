ABSTRACT

This award will provide funds to support a program of travel awards to logic
students to assist them in attending the two main annual meetings of the
Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL). These meetings are the ASL Annual Meeting,
normally a four day meeting held during the Spring on a university campus in
North America, and the ASL European Summer Meeting (Logic Colloquium), normally
a week to ten day long meeting held during the Summer on a university campus in
Europe. These two meetings are arguably the most important meetings in the field
of logic. The ASL works to ensure that these meetings cover logic
comprehensively and that they represent the highest quality work which is being
done in this field. For students in logic, attendance at one or both of these
ASL meetings is a necessary component of serious participation in the
profession.

This will permit continuation of a successful program that has been administered
by the Association since 1993 and partly funded by NSF since 1997.
