This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop
new low-loss materials for tunable dielectrics, which are suitable for high-
frequency applications and possess significant tunability at low temperatures.
The most common tunable dielectric material is a ferroelectric. However, despite
considerable advancements in the application of ferroelectrics to tunable
dielectrics in recent years, these materials still possess unacceptable high
losses and limited tunability, especially where application to high frequency
and room temperature requirements must be met.

The broader impacts/commercial potential will be the range of products that will
benefit from improved tunable dielectric materials. Applications from cellular
phones and hearing aids for consumers to remote sensing instruments and tunable
microwave devices for industrial and military uses are made possible by the use
of tunable dielectrics. The new nanocomposite materials enabled by the proposed
innovation will provide lower losses and improved tunability at low voltages
compared to current voltage tunable dielectric materials. These materials will
enable smaller sized components, lower power consumption, and improved
performance in existing applications and may also create opportunities for
broader applications of the material. High-frequency tunable materials would
also have application in both civilian and military applications, such as agile
thin and thick film antennae, varactors (variable capacitors), phase shifters,
tunable dielectric resonators, tunable impedance matching devices, tuned
filters, and communication and remote sensing applications. The materials
developed in this program will have a stimuli-responsive component, in that the
dielectric permittivity will be sensitive to electric field effects.
