Interest in solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years
due to the broadly based recognition of the scientific challenges and
technological importance attached to the discovery and study of new materials.
Many scientists from other disciplines see opportunities for performing exciting
research in this area. The 2004 Solid State Chemistry Gordon Research Conference
will be held at Colby-Sawyer State College, New London, NH from July 25-30,
2004. The goal of the conference is to facilitate international collaborations
and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests
in solid-state chemistry. The NSF funds will be used to help support the
attendance of young American Scientists as well as several senior U.S. session
chairs and invited speakers. Partial NSF support will also make possible the
participation of approximately 20 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and
faculty from undergraduate
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solid State
Chemistry community continues to have direct impact on technological advances of
high significance to society by designing new materials such as new
superconductors, catalysts, and magnetic and electronic materials.&lt;br/&gt;
