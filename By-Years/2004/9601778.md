9601778 Hung This Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) award is made to
partially support the development of a new shearography instrument for measuring
time dependent deformations. The shearography technique allows full-field and
noncontact measurements. The new aspect is to extend the technique to the
measurement of time dependent deformations. This new capability will be
particularly useful for noncontact and full-field measurements of structural
vibrations and for nondestructive testing of large structures such as bridges.
An interdisciplinary team of researchers has been formed which includes experts
in optics, sensors, mechanics, control and computer and image processing. An
interaction with industry is also likely. ***
