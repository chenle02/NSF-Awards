This project develops and tests a core of telecommunication laboratories for
data communications, telephony and signal analysis. These laboratories form the
foundation of a new program and affect seven new courses. The equipment
requested includes signal analyzers with internal noise generators, protocol
analyzers with interface pod, frequency generators, and a personal computer to
control a telephone switch. The signal analyzers are used to demonstrate
frequency domain notions and to gain an understanding of Fourier Transforms. In
keeping with engineering technology education, the laboratories provide
experience with practical applications of basic concepts. The award is being
matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
