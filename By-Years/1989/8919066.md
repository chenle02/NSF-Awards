Convective squall lines are a major source of springtime precipitation in the
United States. Squall lines typically consist of an active convective region
with its potential for very heavy rainfalls and a trailing region of stratiform
precipitation which is generally much less intense, but can produce a total
rainfall amount equal to the that of the convective region. The nature and
structure of the stratiform region is a current active research area not only
because of its beneficial rainfall, but also due to the fact that knowledge of
the redistribution of heat and moisture in this region is important to our
understanding and ability to predict these localized weather events. The
Principal Investigator will utilize a three dimensional numerical model to study
the formation and early development of the stratiform region of squall lines. He
will use the model to investigate the sensitivity of stratiform region
development to modeled microphysical factors and characteristics of the large
scale environment. The results from this study will improve fundamental
understanding of squall lines and will provide clues to the feedback mechanisms
of these systems to larger scale processes.//
