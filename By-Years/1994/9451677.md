9451677 Eleftheriou This project will develop an experimental course in
inspection, gaging and measurement systems as a significantly enhancement of the
manufacturing curriculum. The course will provide students with background and
hands-on experience in metrology, force measurements, sources of inaccuracy in
measuring instruments, surface texture evaluation, statistical analysis of
experiments, and modern quality control instruments. The course will include a
sequence of experiments which will be conducted in a machine-shop environment.
The lack of a well equipped metrology laboratory hinders the effective
instruction of all manufacturing related courses, and the new equipment will
significantly contribute to their improvement. With the new instruments,
students will be able to improve mating of parts, design fixtures for quick-
gaging, improve their design through proper tolerancing, and propose improved
machining processes based on the experience they gain. Course activities will
link exposure to metrology operations by high school, community college, and
university students. The difference in the educational backgrounds of the
different student groups will be analogous to the one present between formally
trained engineers and technicians. Valuable lessons will be learned by both
groups of students through this exercise.
