The growth of the Internet has led to rapid developments in network servers for
services such as web content, streaming media, and networked storage. Network
servers provide data in many different forms to end-users. Thus their
input/output (I/O) units are critical to performance. However, there is a
bottleneck in the communication interfaces between the host CPU and the I/O.
This causes inefficiencies at both the hardware and software levels. The goal of
this research is to improve these communication interfaces to allow server
performance to scale with network links of 10 Gigabits per second and
beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This approach utilizes network processors and
programmable network interfaces to streamline data communication in network
servers. While modern host CPUs have exploited instruction-level parallelism
(ILP) and data caches to improve performance, tasks such as TCP/IP networking
are not known to be well suited to these techniques. In contrast, the streaming
data and connection-level concurrency of TCP/IP maps naturally to the cacheless,
multithreaded and multiprocessor cores of network processors, motivating the
offloading of a high-performance TCP/IP network stack to such devices.
Cooperative computation and storage between the host CPU and the network
interface also allows for copy-avoidance on network receive and for reducing
costly interrupts by offloading TCP protocol processing from the host to the
network interface. The new workloads developed during this research also
motivate system-level architectural enhancements for both the host processor and
the network processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All software and tools produced
through this research will be transferred to the community through open-source
distribution. The results of the research are being introduced into courses
targeted at freshmen and sophomores to introduce systems-level concepts in
computer engineering starting from basics such as bits and transistors and
culminating in micro-architecture and systems topics.&lt;br/&gt;
