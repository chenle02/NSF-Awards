The objective of the research is to experimentally simulate the flame- flow
interactions encountered in turbulent combustion with a carefully controlled,
rotating laminar flame undergoing various degrees of stretch. Opposed jet and
stagnation point flows have been chosen because of their accessibility and two-
dimensionality. Temperature, concentration, and velocity will be measured in
reacting and unreacting environments, and the structure of secondary flows
induced by rotation as well as resonance phenomena previously identified will be
explored. Supporting experiments will be performed at the Combustion Research
Facility of the Sandia National Laboratory, Livermore. Combustion in devices of
practical application invariably involves turbulent flow in geometries not
amenable to temporal measurement of the important scaler and velocity fields.
Numerical predictions of the system performance require an understanding of the
flame quenching and propagation processes that occur within the localized
turbulent structures. Successful simulation of this complex phenomena through
the proposed simple experiments will substantially contribute to our
understanding.
