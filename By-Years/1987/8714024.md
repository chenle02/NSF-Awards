This project will continue upgrading the seismic reflection capabilities of the
R/V CONRAD, a specially instrumented geological and geophysical research vessel
that is operated by Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory. The initial phase of
the upgrade was completed in early 1986 with the acquisition and installation of
a ten-airgun, tuned array that was funded by NSF. In early 1987 Lamont purchased
a modern digital streamer and recording system using private and institutional
funding sources. This phase of the project will refurbish and calibrate the
streamer, then install it and the recording system on the ship. The completed
upgrade will provide a modern multi-channel seismic (MCS) capability to the
ocean science community, as was recommended in a report to NSF by the National
Oceanic Reflection Profiling Organization (NORPO).
