This award provides partial reimbursement for 25 participants in the conference
entitled Teaching Entrepreneurship to Engineering Students. The Conference is
organized by Engineering Conferences International (ECI). ECI is the successor
of the United Engineering Foundation, which was established in 1962 to provide
an opportunity for the exploration of problems and issues of concern to
engineering from many disciplines. The organization recently changed its name
and moved to be housed at Polytechnic University.

The conference is chaired by Eleanor Baum, Dean of Engineering at The Cooper
Union, and is co-chaired by Carl McHargue of the University of Tennessee. The
steering committee is exceptional including, Phil Weilerstein of the National
Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA), Joel Moses (MIT), Howard
Flagg (Founder, Pair Gain) and Tina Seelig (Stanford University Technology
Ventures Program).

The goal of the conference is to develop a set of recommendations for
engineering faculty, to identify exemplary curriculum and model programs, and to
increase interaction between business and academia on these topics.
