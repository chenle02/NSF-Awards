Advances in sensors, analog to digital converters, and instrumentation in
general are fostering a need for similar advances in the output noise
performance of the power supplies that provide power to these devices. To ensure
that the power supply noise does not degrade or limit the performance of present
state of the art sensors and signal processing circuits, reduction of noise by
40 to 60 dB is needed. This is beyond a reasonable expectation for conventional
methods, so research into new methods of power conversion specifically aimed at
reducing noise is proposed. The purpose of this research is to develop methods
that will reduce as much as possible the sources of the noise. The methods will
greatly reduce or eliminate the generation of high order harmonics so that
subsequent filtering and shielding will be more effective.
