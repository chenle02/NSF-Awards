The project is awarding thirty scholarships per year for four years to students
enrolled in a computer, electronic engineering or civil engineering technologies
associate degree program. The project is supporting the Scholars with peer and
faculty mentoring, engaging them in an active student chapter of the Association
of Information Technology, providing child care for students with children at a
child development center, supporting their academic progress in academic
achievement centers, and developing partnerships and support systems with
technology employers within their own discipline. The project is building upon
the lessons learned from a previously awarded CSEMS project. Previous
recipients, who are working in industry, are becoming role models by giving
presentations and supporting current CSEMS recipients.

Departmental faculty within each of the three programs are providing an
identification and referral process to improve retention, graduation and
transfer rates of the scholars. Recruitment and retention efforts are
specifically targeting underrepresented and non-traditional students through a
federally funded Educational Talent Search program, TRIO programs that include
an Upward Bound program, and a Program for Accelerated College Enrollment.
