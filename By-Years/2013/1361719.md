The site to be planned at Drexel University will highlight in its efforts two
fundamental challenges are 1) advancing the understanding of how plasmas
interact with their surroundings, either through chemical and physical processes
on plasma facing surfaces or through their interaction with electromagnetic
fields, and 2) advancing the understanding of and modeling the fundamental
interactions of plasmas with the external mechanisms (electrical or mechanical)
that drive them, thereby providing a means to engineer these systems based on
the optimal conditions predicted from a complete understanding of plasma
processes.

The planned site intends to provide scientific insight to a class of plasma
engineering processes that are vital to established and growing markets, and
support advancement of plasma engineering technologies in multiple fields. By
providing an environment that focuses on fundamental understanding of these
systems, combined with industry engagement through collaborative research,
industry residencies, and co-operative opportunities, the planned site intends
to contribute to filling a manpower void and accelerating the growth of low
cost, repeatable solutions for the domestic high-tech industry. The
interdisciplinary training environment for plasma research spanning 6 colleges
at Drexel will support this end.
