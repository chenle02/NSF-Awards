During the Miocene Epoch, 5-24 million years ago, there was an extensive
radiation of hominoid primates in the Eastern Hemisphere. Their relationships
with each other and with extant taxa are still unclear. Their functional anatomy
and locomotor adaptations are clearly different from those of extant primates.
This proposal seeks to characterize this radiation by descriptive and functional
analyses, and by defining postcranial features by which Miocene taxa may be
recognized as hominoids, or as primitive catarrhines. The research will continue
the PI's previous studies on Sivapithecus, Kenyapithecus, and the recently
discovered Simiolus, Turkanapithecus, and Afropithecus. The study will include
studies of recently collected specimens, and on new specimens collected during
the proposed research period. Functional analyses will be made of the postcrania
of all known small apes from Kenya, comparisons will be made between Miocene
catarrhines and platyrrhines, and possible indicators of terrestriality in
Miocene hominoids will be explored.
