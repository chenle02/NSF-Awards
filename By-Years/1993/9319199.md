A key question in neuroscience is how sensory information is processed to
control adaptive behavioral responses. An excellent system in which to study
this issue is found in fish called weakly electric fish. These fish have an
electric organ like that in the electric eel, but much weaker, and produce
periodic discharges of particular waveforms. These fish also have electrosensory
systems that detect the electric field produced by the fish itself or by other
nearby electric fish. The electrosensory system is used for orientation and the
pattern of signals is used for communication. The brain of these animals is now
known to process the signals using certain kinds of spatial maps, comparable to
those in the visual system, and using certain kinds of temporal analysis,
comparable to processes in the auditory system. This project has its focus on a
particular group of nerve cells, or nuclei, in the brain, located at an
interface between the spatial representation of the midbrain, and the nuclei
that produce the electric signalling behavior such as the prepacemaker nucleus,
which modulate the discharge pattern of the electric organ. Anatomical and
physiological techniques are used to label physiologically identified nerve
cells to trace their functional connections in this circuit. Behaviorally
relevant stimulus paradigms will be used to test the response properties of
individual neurons along pathways involved in control of specific behavioral
responses. Clarification of this circuitry for integrating complex sensory input
into a discrete behavioral output in this model system will provide major
advances for neuroscience, with importance to sensory systems, motor systems,
integration, and behavior.
