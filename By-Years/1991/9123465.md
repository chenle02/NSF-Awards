McClanahan intends to continue his study of the K-theory of operator algebras,
with emphasis on those that arise as reduced C*- algebras of groups. He will use
Lance's six term exact sequence of K-groups to obtain the K-groups of the
reduced noncommutative unitary group C*-algebra and the reduced noncommutative
Grassmanian C*-algebra. He then intends to use the techniques of Pimsner in
order to generalize this exact sequence to include a certain class of full and
reduced amalgamated products of C*-algebras. The general area of mathematics of
this project has its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.
Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers.
Special types of operators are often put together in an algebra, naturally
called an operator algebra. These seemingly abstract objects have a surprising
variety of applications. For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which
in turn is currently being used to study the structure of DNA.
