Professor Greg A. Slough of Kalamazoo College is supported by the Chemical
Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the catalytic
properties of diastereomeric Mn-salen complexes, to be prepared through a
combinatorial library approach and immobilized within polystyrene/divinyl
benzene resin beads. The effect of the salen complex, the resin type and solvent
swelling on the microenvironment of the immobilized salen catalysts will be
probed by infrared spectroscopy, and the epoxidation of alkenes on immobilized
salens having differing structures will be investigated. The goal of this
research is to understand the effect of confinement within organic polymer
networks on organic chemical catalysis. Understanding the effects of confinement
could potentially render metal catalysts recyclable and less of an environmental
burden. Undergraduate students at Kalamazoo College will be exposed to a
valuable research experience involving instrumentation, synthesis, and
catalysis.
