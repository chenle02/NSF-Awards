Valle-Levinson/02-44035&lt;br/&gt;This award provides renewed funding for an REU
site at Old Dominion University (ODU) located in Norfolk, VA. The site has been
funded by NSF since 2000. The program supports internships and related costs for
eight undergraduate students during a 10-week summer research internship.
Students will be able to conduct independent research projects in the area of
geosciences, particularly oceanography and the biogeochemistry of natural
environments. Students will be paired with a faculty mentor. They will develop a
research idea, present an oral and written prospectus, maintain a laboratory
notebook, undertake the research and present their results in oral and written
formats. They will participate in a series of lectures and discussions on
ethics, a journal club, and social events. In addition, students are encouraged
to participate in scientific conferences following their internship.
