The research project combines work on graph embeddings and parallel algorithms
to study a variety of emulation problems for processor arrays, i.e., parallel
architectures that consist of a communication network having processing elements
at each mode. The research focuses on a variey of theoretical problems that
relate to the design, programming, and implementation of "real" processor
arrays. More specifically, the research problems motivating the research include
attempts to: o simplify the programming of a parallel architecture, by allowing
the programmer to specify an algorithm for an idealized architecture which is
then emulated by an actual architecture; o understand the relative communication
power of various interconnection networks, by determining how efficiently arrays
based on each of the networks can emulate arrays based on the others, on general
computations; o achieve fault tolerance, by having an array that has been
crippled by defects emulate a fault-free version of itself. The theoretical
results obtained in the course of the proposed research should lend insights
into the "real" analogs of the problems studied.
