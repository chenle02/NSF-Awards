The PAlmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) is designed to exploit the large and
increasing concentration of people working in number theory and number theoretic
applications located in the Southeast. The primary goals include the fostering
of collaboration and education rather than dissemination of new results. The
meetings will provide graduate students exposure to recent research with a
minimum of costs. The location of the meeting will rotate among Clemson
University, University of South Carolina and the College of Charleston. The
regular meetings will foster a strong regional culture of research in pure
number theory as well as its applications. The creation of PANTS is especially
timely as there is more and more interplay between pure number theory and
applications. For instance, low-discrepancy sequences created from function
fields are used by financial institutions; higher dimensional abelian varieties
are being considered in cryptography to guarantee privacy of digital
communications; and understanding modular towers is now very important in the
construction of the best sequences of error-correcting codes. This mixture of
very theoretical mathematics with applications is uniquely well-represented at
the PANTS core institutions, and we intend to capitalize on this. The
conferences will host many of the major names in the field. Because of its
relatively central location in the Southeast, the series will attract students
and faculty from several states, who would not otherwise be able to attend
larger more costly conferences. In addition, the organizers will strive for a
demographically diverse group of speakers and participants, including women and
those from other underrepresented groups.
