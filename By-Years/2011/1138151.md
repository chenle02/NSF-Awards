This award supports the development and publication of a policy report and a
special edition of a peer-reviewed journal to disseminate the findings of an
OECD-NSF workshop on Building a Smarter Health and Wellness Future. The report
will analyze how technological developments such as high-speed and mobile
applications, sensor-based devices, and electronic health records can support
new models of care to address 21st century health and wellness needs, reflecting
a vision of a patient-centered, rapidly learning healthcare system. It will
consider the challenges encountered in redesigning processes of car, the socio-
technical and usability factors, access and privacy issues, the sustainability
of the new models and their impacts. The special edition will include renowned
experts from the United States and Europe. The special edition journal, which
will be published online, has an international readership and is recognized for
its high impact and extensive citation. The publications provide a way to engage
a broad international audience and go beyond describing current trends to focus
on governance issues and policies, looking to promote the most efficient and
effective roles for both the public and private sectors in sustaining health
care innovation.
