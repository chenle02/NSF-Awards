The investigator has developed an in vitro system which functions in authentic
nuclear import. With this approach, the following results have already been
established: 1, nuclear import is ATP-dependent and requires an intact nuclear
envelope; 2, import is inhibited by wheat germ agglutinin binding to nuclear
pores (implicating nuclear pore glycoproteins as possible participants in
nucleocytoplasmic transport); and 3, nuclear import can be separated into two
sequential steps, binding to the nuclear envelope and translocation through the
pore. Binding is mediated by the nuclear targeting signal on the translocatable
protein, and is independent of ATP and is not inhibited by wheat germ
agglutinin. Translocation, however, requires ATP and is inhibitable by the
lectin. During the tenure of this grant, the investigator will identify and
chemically isolate the receptor which mediates specific binding of
translocatable proteins, using chemical cross-linking techniques. Antisera will
then be prepared against the receptor, and used for immunolocalization and
functional studies. Also, the potential for receptor heterogeneity will be
explored, by competition studies using synthetic nuclear targetting signal
peptides. The communication between nucleus and cytoplasm is a critical feature
of cellular life. On the one hand, it is imperative that the nuclear content of
the cell remain segregated from the general cytoplasm, in order to permit the
highly-ordered regulation of gene activity that is typical of eukaryotic cells;
on the other hand, information, enzymatic machinery, and structural components
must be provided to the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The results of this project
will greatly increase our understanding of how this communication occurs and is
regulated. Such understanding is a necessary prerequisite to experimental
manipulations of cytoplasm-to-nucleus communication for specific biotechnical
applications.
