Experiments to study magnetohydrodynamics of nonlinear superflows in Al phase of
3He, varying temperature, magnetic field, pressure and boundary effects. Another
experiment will force superfluid through a "magnetic spin filter" to increase
the polarization, and then characterize the fluids' viscosity to compare with
recent theory. Second sound will be used to measure the thermal conductivity of
3He superfluid. Another experiment will measure attenuation of fourth sound with
the boundary conditions altered by a 4He coating.
