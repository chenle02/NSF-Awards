"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Robert M. Metzger and
Stephen A. Woski of the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, and Professor Daniell
L. Mattern of the University of Mississippi are supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop and evaluate
molecular rectifiers. Synthetic tools will be developed to arrive at optimally
designed organic molecules with appropriate molecular electronic levels to allow
passage of charge in a single direction, and appropriate end/side groups to
facilitate device assembly. The overall objectives are to design molecules with
high rectification ratios and to use these molecules to develop molecular diodes
with stable device operation to be the future circuit components in molecular
electronics. Students drawn from universities which educate a large number of
graduate students from underrepresented minorities will be trained in synthesis
and molecular electronics, and the research will be interfaced with the LSAMP
program.
