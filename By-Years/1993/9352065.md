The purpose of this project is to substantially improve the modern physics
component of the laboratory in General Physics. This equipment is allowing the
implementation of five new experiments into the curriculum of General Physics.
One piece of equipment, One-Piece Millikan Apparatus, is being used for an
independent student project.In addition, the instrumentation is being used to
add two new experiments to the curriculum of Introduction to Physical Science, a
course that satisfies the science requirement for non-science majors.
