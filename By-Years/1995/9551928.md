The college is integrating cell culture techniques into functional biology
laboratory curricula by developing a tissue culture facility. The introduction
of these techniques is vital to improving student comprehension of lecture
material through hands-on laboratory experiences. Course work affected includes
Immunology, Cell Biology, and Developmental Biology; in addition, the equipment
enables students to perform a wide variety of senior research projects in these
areas. The college's goal is to provide in vitro models designed to enhance
biology students' understanding of immunity, cell physiology/biology, and
molecular biology. A thorough understanding of these areas is critical for
undergraduates pursuing medical and research careers. The major equipment
obtained through this project includes a laminar flow hood, a climate controlled
(CO2) incubator, a refrigerated table-top centrifuge, a microplate reader, and
an inverted microscope.
