9619957 Cremer, James University of Iowa Research Experiences for Undergraduates
at the University of Iowa in Experimental Computer Science This Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports 12 students per year
in programs carried out during the summers, for three years. The students
participate in a variety of computer science research projects, with emphasis on
experimental and applied research. Students are recruited nationally and matched
with active faculty members in research areas including: virtual environments,
real-time simulation, graphics, computer vision, computational geometry,
distributed systems, and artificial intelligence. Substantial effort is placed
on recruiting minority students and students from non-research institutions. The
program provides a coherent experience involving close interaction between
faculty, graduate students, and REU students, hands-on experience with state-of-
the-art software and computing facilities, and work on challenging and important
research problems.
