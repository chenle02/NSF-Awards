Behavior results from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.
However, it is still not clear how genes exert control over behavior, and how
genetic processes interact with the environment. Dr. Lenington has a fascinating
system that can provide answers to these important problems. She has found that
genetic variability associated with the t-complex in wild house mice may have a
strong influence on naturally occurring behavior patterns. The t-complex is
located on chromosome 17 and is linked with the H-2 histocompatibility complex
of the mouse. About 25% of wild house mice carry the t haplotype, which have
deleterious effects when homozygous. Depending upon the specific t haplotype,
homozygosity could result in death during fetal development or sterility, if the
mice survive. Dr. Lenington has found that wild mice can use odor cues to
discriminate genetic differences at the t-complex and that the mice prefer odors
of conspecifics that do not carry t haplotypes. She will now determine whether
behavior of the mothers towards their young is affected by the presence of the t
haplotypes. Dr. Lenington will determine whether the mothers prefer to raise
pups that do not carry this mutation. In addition, she will examine the behavior
of a mother herself that carries this genetic mutation. The t complex provides a
rare opportunity to examine the effect of specific genes upon behavior in wild
mammals. Not only will this work provide important and novel information
regarding the role of genes and behavior, but the model itself opens new avenues
for molecular biologists to pursue how a specific piece of DNA on chromosome 17
is ultimately translated into a behavioral outcome.
