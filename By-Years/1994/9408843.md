9408843 Walker This is a proposal to continue an on-going program studying
nuclear reactions, nuclear structure physics at intermediate energies, and the
interface between nuclear and particle theory. We propose research in the
following areas: the role of retardation and relativistic effects in modifying
the nuclear response; the study of exclusive meson production reactions at
intermediate energies; parton distribution in the nucleon, especially the
magnitude of charge symmetry breaking effects in parton distributions. Finally,
we propose to study the properties of low temperature electrons in very narrow
two- dimensional conductors called "quantum wires". ***
