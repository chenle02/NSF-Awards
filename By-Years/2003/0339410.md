This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the development
of a Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based, 2D ultrasonic transducer
array for 3D imaging in real time, featuring near-photographic image quality
with sub-millimeter resolution at 20cm depth. Current 2D ultrasound systems
employ a 1D array of transducers to accumulate images. A 2D array is universally
acknowledged as the ideal approach for 3D image acquisition; however, multiple
challenges must be overcome to make this practical, including: limitations in
existing piezoelectric transducer technology, connecting an array with many
elements (e.g., &gt; 16,000) to front-end electronics, and processing large
amounts of image data in real-time. The highly collaborative Phase I effort will
focus on the design and simulation of key building blocks of the array,
including a specialized transducer design; fully-populated array architecture
with over 16,000 elements; and integrated multiplexing scheme to reduce
interconnect lead count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed technology will
bring many new capabilities to medical imaging, including volumetric flow, and
real-time 3D imaging for tumor evaluation, image-guided surgery, and fetal echo-
cardiography. Ultrasound provides real-time medical imaging, is safer than
radiation-based modalities, and is less expensive to buy and maintain than
magneto-resonance imaging (MRI) system. 2D ultrasound imaging is currently used
for abdominal, breast, cardiovascular, OB/GYN, pediatrics, and a host of other
diagnostic modalities. The developed 2D transducer array technology, once
incorporated into a commercially viable, practical, easy-to-use, high quality
3D/4D ultrasound system has potentially immense societal impact. Such a system
would:&lt;br/&gt;
