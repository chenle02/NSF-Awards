Various highly reactive intermediates will be generated and a study will be
made of their reaction mechanisms. These highly reactive intermediates will be
generated by photolysis and by pyrolysis of appropriate precursors. Decay
kinetics of these species will be followed by time-resolved spectroscopy
following laser flash photolysis. Chemical reactivity of these intermediates
will be probed through trapping experiments and product studies. The molecules
to be studied include species containing divalent silicon, germanium, and tin
atoms, namely, silylenes, germylenes, and stannylenes, respectively. Reaction
pathways for the monovalent six-valence-electron species nitrenes (R-N:) and
phosphinidenes (R-P:), and of the monovalent four-valence-electron borylenes
(R-B:) and aluminylidenes (R-Al:) will be compared with reaction paths for the
corresponding carbenes, silylenes, and germylenes. Molecules will be synthesized
with new kinds of bonds, including silicon-silicon and silicon-germanium triple
bonds, and silicon-transition metal double bonds. New ring systems will be
prepared as well. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
continuing work of Professor Peter P. Gaspar at Washington University. Reactive
intermediates will be generated that contain silicon, germanium, tin,
phosphorous, aluminum, and boron atoms that have less than their normal
complement of bonds. These reactive intermediates will be generated from stable
precursor molecules by photolysis and by thermolysis methods. The steps by which
these intermediates decompose will be studied as well as the rate at which these
processes occur. More direct evidence for these reactive intermediates will be
given by trapping them with other molecules. The products of these trapping
experiments will reveal the structure of the intermediates. Compounds with
silicon- silicon single and double bonds are known. Now even more reactive
molecules will be synthesized with silicon-silicon and silicon- germanium triple
bonds. New ring systems will also be prepared.
