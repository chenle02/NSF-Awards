9322574 Hammel In July 1994 Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 is predicted to collide with
the planet Jupiter. This event will provide a unique opportunity to learn
fundamental parameters about the Jovian atmosphere. This project is one of four
in a coordinated campaign that involves investigators from the University of
Arizona, Lowell Observatory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and NASA
Ames Research Center. The groups will deploy portable, high-speed CCD systems to
four sites spaced in longitude around the globe for the purpose of recording an
epochal series of collisions of various subnuclei of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with
the planet Jupiter. The objectives of the observations are to obtain images of
all faces of Jupiter in several passbands immediately prior to the encounters,
to record the flashes produced by the incoming bolides as seen in light
reflected off the Galilean satellites, to document the changes produced in the
planet's appearance as a result of the impacts, and to record the evolution of
affected belts and zones as the planet settles back to equilibrium.
