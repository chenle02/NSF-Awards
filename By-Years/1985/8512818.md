This project expands the science base for probing non-destructively for residual
stress in a solid. This is a critical area of research with innumerable
applications to structures in engineering. The PI has successfully evolved a
technique for analyzing acoustic fluids. The basic method is reformulated in
this study for elastic media and then validated by solution for planar waves.
The goal is an improved understanding of the interplay between nonlinear effects
and multidimensional phenomena which offers the prospect of substantial
improvement in the ability to probe nondestructively for residual stress.
