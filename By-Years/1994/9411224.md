9411224 GARCIA The purpose of this project is to discover how the interactional
process of mediation contributes to agreement between disputing parties.
Specifically, how does mediation provide for negotiation about proposed
solutions in a way that facilitates dispute resolution rather than continued
disagreement? Previous research has shown that agreement in mediation is more
likely if participants engage in the creative generation of ideas for potential
solutions. Negotiation procedures which include such activities are more likely
to result in "win-win" solutions-- those that benefit both disputants. However,
previous research also suggests that these benefits result only if the
participants are not committed to particular solutions. Additional data are
needed to determine if there is a critical difference between how mediators and
disputants propose and/or interpret proposed solutions: as possibilities or as
requirements for resolution. Approximately 30 mediation hearings at a community
mediation program will be observed and video-taped. Transcripts of each hearing
and detailed observation records will be produced by graduate student research
assistants. These data will be coded for analysis by the principal investigator,
using theoretically defined categories of disputing behavior. On the basis of
the coded data, the principal investigator will compare the interactional
interpretations of mediators and disputants as they propose and work toward
resolutions. ***
