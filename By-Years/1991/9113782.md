The primary aim of this research is to investigate the structural properties of
fluid surfaces (such as water, methanol, and carbon tetrachloride and their
vapors) on length scales varying from several angstroms to microns. In addition,
investigation will focus on Langmuir monolayers, thermotropic liquid crystals,
and lytropic liquid crystals. The techniques of x-ray reflectivity and
diffraction will be used in this work because no alternative technique is
available to acquire this information. Graduate students will conduct their work
at the Harvard MRL facility and the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
