This project funds the purchase of state-of-the-art equipment for archaeological
field surveying. The equipment is the type referred to as a total station, which
enhances considerably the rate at which field data can be generated and
recorded. A visual orientation replaces a plumb-bob, and an infrared beam
measures distance, features that both speed information retrieval and improve
accuracy. Auxiliary equipment includes prisms for the proper control of the
infrared beam, a data collector for temporary storage of information, and sundry
poles and tripods for field use of the major equipment. The immediate need for
such equipment stems from field research in Chile, in which a large data base is
generated rapidly in surveying a dispersed and segmented irrigation system.
Undergraduate students participating in a field school in Chile are well served
by the new equipment since they can train on up-to-date technology and can
accomplish the task without data saturation. In an undergraduate science/social
science environment, the equipment can continue in use for future editions of
the same or other field schools in archaeology and can also be used by faculty
and students of the Geology Department.
