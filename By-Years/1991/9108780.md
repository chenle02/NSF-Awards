The proposed research seeks to gain knowledge of protein structure through
increased understanding of the microscopic interactions and mechanisms of
folding initiation. Peptide folding events will be studied using a novel
combination of configurational energy methods, statistical mechanics and
statistical clustering techniques. The microscopic mechanisms leading to nascent
folding events are generally unknown. Two extremely long molecular dynamics
simulations (2.2 nanoseconds each), recently carried out on a pentapeptide that
forms stable reverse turns in solutions, will be analyzed by statistically based
methods to identify folding pathways. The large number of conformations obtained
from the simulations (&gt;30,000) will be clustered into structurally similar
groups. Transitions between the conformations in the reduced data set will be
analyzed for concerted dihedral angle changes. The mechanisms causing these
conformational transitions will be deduced from intra-peptide and peptide-
solvent interactions, assessed for each cluster. This research develops new
techniques for the analysis of large numbers of conformations resulting from
long simulations, and the knowledge of folding pathways gained can lead to the
design of more computationally efficient folding simulations. Cluster analysis
and other surveys of protein structures have shown that certain N-cap and C-cap
conformations dominate helix termini. Free energy simulations will be used to
determine the free energy contribution of these capping structures to a- helix
initiation and propagation, and their potential to act as helix stop signals.
The free energy contributed to helix formation by charge/helix dipole
interactions will be calculated, an the role of solvent structure in capping
will be examined.
