This 3.5-year project provides a model for teacher enhancement that
incorporates instruction in mathematics content and methodology with extensive
discussion of techniques for increasing the interest of middle school students,
especially girls and minorities, in mathematics. Each summer, 30 mathematics
teachers from middle schools in Arizona will participate in a three-week
institute that includes courses in mathematics, the use of microcomputers, and
encouraging students in mathematics, as well as a seminar on curriculum
revision. Academic-year activities consist of visits by the project staff to the
participants' classrooms, inservice sessions conducted by participants for their
colleagues, and a two-day workshop in the spring. The evaluation will measure
the participants' knowledge of mathematics, their attitudes towards teaching it,
and their students' attitudes towards learning it. The university and the school
systems are contributing an amount equal to 32% of the NSF award as cost-
sharing.
