This research concerns the analysis of the behavior of complex dynamical
systems. The problems under consideration can be classified into the following
categories: the study of hybrid dynamical systems (which may be described by a
mixture of differential equations and operators) with emphasis on the properties
of stability preserving operators; the investigation of questions of existence,
nonexistence, stability or instability of periodic motions in interconnected
systems; techniques for establishing Lyapunov stability of interconnected
systems; and the study of security assessment and fault diagnosis problems for
dynamical systems in general and for power systems in particular.
