9354040 Fasching Three institutions within the state of Rhode Island (the
University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and the Community College of
Rhode Island) are designing faculty workshops to change the teaching approach of
the mathematics, science, technology, and education faculty at their
institutions. The workshops are a base for the development of college statewide
frameworks for the teaching of mathematics and the sciences. The team is also
developing an implementation plan for a mentor-mentoring chain concept that will
span from grade three through college. ***
