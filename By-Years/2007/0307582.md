AST-0307582&lt;br/&gt;Schneider&lt;br/&gt;The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
Quasar Survey, when completed, will cover a quarter of the celestial sphere and
will contain approximately 100,000 quasars below redshift 5.5, with consistent
and accurate positions, photometry, image morphology, and spectra. This research
will produce the main quasar catalog, a broad absorption line (BAL) quasar
catalog, and an annual list of new high-redshift quasars, as a service to other
researchers. The combination of area coverage, sensitivity, photometric
accuracy, broad wavelength coverage, and radio selection make this a uniquely
powerful quasar dataset, and its production has the added benefit of training
future researchers. Although the catalogs can, and will, be used for many
studies, this project will focus its scientific efforts on understanding the
quasar luminosity function and its evolution, and promises to produce the
definitive luminosity function for many years to come. The research may also be
able to verify the validity of photometric redshifts from the high quality SDSS
data, enabling the sample to be extended to around a million quasars. The
quality control supported by this proposal makes the database of far more use
than the "raw" catalog, whose conditional quality flags can be hard to
understand.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
