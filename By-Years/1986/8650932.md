The chemistry education of undergraduate students at Notre Dame College of Ohio
will be enhanced by laboratory experience with a state-of-the- art Fourier
transform infrared spectrophotometer. This instrument will allow students in
Organic Chemistry to follow reaction progress and identify reaction products; in
Spectrometric Methods, to analyze "real- world" mixtures; in Physical Chemistry,
to define molecular structure and thermodynamic properties; in Advanced
Inorganic Chemistry, to observe metal-ligand interaction and bonding. Using a
computer to interface with other laboratory instrumentation, the students will
develop facility with computer control of instrumentation and computerized data
acquisition and analysis. In particular, students in Electronic Instrumentation
and Analytical Methods courses will learn to apply modern computer technology to
the chemistry laboratory. This women's college makes special efforts to
encourage and enhance the chemistry education of women undergraduates, including
minorities and handicapped students. Through this project, the college will
continue its contribution to the education of women scientists. Its chemistry
students will develop expertise in using modern laboratory instrumentation and
computers to solve chemical problems, and will capture the excitement and vision
of modern chemistry.
