Drs. James Hanken and Marvalee Wake propose a half-day symposium at the
centennial meeting of the American Society of Zoologists (ASZ) in Boston in
December, 1989. The theme of the symposium will be "Experimental Approaches to
the Analysis of Form and Function." Two speakers each will address the impact of
experimental approaches at the developmental, functional, ecological and
evolutionary levels of organization. The specific aims of the symposium are to
evaluate the utility of the experimental approach by illustrating the kinds of
insights that can be gained, as well as the limitations faced in experimental
functional analyses. A Proceedings volume will be published Technological
advances in imaging, microsensors and microsurgery, and the resolution of early
developmental features have rejuvenated the discipline of functional analysis.
These novel sources of data will shed new light on ecological, physiological,
and evolutionary issues. The proposed symposium will find a diverse and
interested audience at the annual meeting of ASZ.
