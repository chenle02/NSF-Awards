Knowledge of the high pressure and high temperature behavior of key physical
properties of minerals is an essential ingredient in the continuing effort to
understand convection within Earth's mantle. Since much of our current
understanding is still based on assumed and extrapolated elastic and thermal
properties of silicate minerals, it remains difficult to determine whether or
not radial seismic models for the mantle imply chemical stratification. The PI
has constructed a laboratory for the measurement at high pressure and
temperature of key physical properties of candidate mantle constituents. Laser-
Induced Phonon Spectroscopy has been coupled with diamond anvil cell technology
to measure elastic constants and thermal diffusivity of minerals at high
pressure. Results for olivine to 7 GPa have recently been reported. Extension of
such measurements on a variety of minerals to a transition zone and lower mantle
pressure regime (12 to 25 GPA) is a principle goals of the present work.
Measurements at simultaneous high temperature and pressure will be attempted.
