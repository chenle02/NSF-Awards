An experimental study will be made to determine the effects of contact
vibrations on friction and wear in dry sliding contact and to develop maps of
optimal amplitude and frequency conditions to give minimal wear and/or friction
for given conditions. Vibrations will be imposed from external actuators or
generated by the sliding surfaces due to engineered surface roughness. The
results will be used to develop and validate a model for the effect and to form
the basis for design selection of operating conditions for components such as
electrical brushes.
