The proposed research concerns the study of the fundamental properties of
disordered systems. Disordered systems are models of systems with impurities.
The development of a rigorous theory of disordered systems is expected to
contribute to the understanding of many types of physical phenomena, and in
particular, may lead to finding new materials with desired physical properties.
Disordered systems are also used in modeling many other micro and macro effects
from quantum localization- an important topic in quantum computation- to
earthquakes. An integral part of the project concerns educating graduate
students and other young researchers. The PI will also continue her outreach
efforts to entice K-12 students to the study of mathematics.

The project consists of several parts. One is to prove the extended states for
multidimensional quasiperiodic operators. Another is to study the effects of
interaction in tight-binding quasi-periodic models. One more is to study local
eigenvalue statistics in the regime of localization for discrete ergodic
Schroedinger operators. It is also planned to study several models related to
Bloch electrons in constant magnetic fields, notably the Extended Harper Model.
Other important objectives are the study of issues related to Cantor/non-Cantor
spectra of quasiperiodic operators. The project involves the continuing
development of non-perturbative methods for the proofs of localization type
effects both in Schrodinger operators and in quantum spin systems, percolation
and contact processes in disordered environments, as well as for the study of
absolutely continuous spectrum.
