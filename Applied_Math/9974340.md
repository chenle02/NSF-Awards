This project concerns the dynamics of both spatially discrete and continuous but
non-local evolutionary systems. In particular, we are concerned with the
existence, stability, and variety of spatial patterns in interacting and
reacting systems which exhibit threshold behavior. Not just stationary patterns
but also those which evolve in a predictable way. The systems of equations arise
in the field of computational neural networks designed to perform specialized
tasks such as automatic image recognition. They also arise in population
dynamics, in models of phase transitions, in models of the primary visual cortex
of the brain, and in computer simulation of a wide variety of continuum
processes where discretization is the standard approach. Results from the
project will have a direct impact on the understanding of computational
experiments and on the assumptions on which the mathematical models of many
physical phenomena rest.

From one perspective, the project explores some of the basic challenges of
present day material science: The modeling of processes which cause and
accompany change of phases or crystalline variants of a substance. New
mathematical models are being continually proposed, with the hope of shedding
insight into the basic physics of these processes. Successful modeling can offer
help in the development of new high performance materials, which is vital to
economic and other national interests. From another perspective, the theoretical
study of neural networks will lead to the development of automatic pattern
recognition, useful in such widely diverse areas as text analysis, target
identification, and image enhancement.
