The principal investigator will conduct research in the area of large
deviations. In particular, he will conduct projects on three topics: (a) large
deviations for Markov chains taking values in an abstract space; (b) large
deviations, limit theorems, and phase transitions in statistical mechanics; (c)
large deviations for Markov processes with "discontinuous statistics" and
applications to queueing networks. Large deviation theory is a branch of
probability theory involving limits of random variables. It is well known that
in certain idealized cases, where the random variables are independent and
identically distributed, that the average of the sequence converges to the
average of the individual random variable (in terms of statistics, that the
sample average converges to the population average). Large deviation theory
shows that the probability that the sample average deviates from the population
average by a small amount is exponentially small as the sample size increases.
The principal investigator is working in the much more difficult case of
dependent random variables, whose dependence structure follows a Markov process.
There are many applications of this theory to statistical mechanics and queueing
networks.
