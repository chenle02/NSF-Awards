This investigation is directed towards the development of robust, efficient
numerical methods and software for solving large stiff systems of ordinary
differential equations. Of particular interest are systems that result from the
semi-discretization of parabolic and mixed type partial differential equations,
for example, the equations that model reaction diffusion convection processes.
The effort will require the development of preconditioned iterative methods for
large structured systems of linear and nonlinear algebraic equations. Algorithms
and software will be designed to take advantage of shared memory
multiprocesor/vector computer hardware. Moreover, algorithms and software will
be suitable for use on a wide range of computers. The effort if successful will
provide mathematical software that will facilitate computer modelling and
simulation in various scientific and engineering fields. The numerical methods
and software developed will extend the capability to solve an important class of
partial differential equations.
