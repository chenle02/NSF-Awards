This is a cross-disciplinary pilot study to "reserve engineer" a portion of the
cardiovascular control system. The central nervous system component of the
baroreceptor reflex, a control mechanism that attempts to keep arterial pressure
approximately constant, will be studied using intracellular recordings. Emphasis
will be on the portion of the reflex that alters vagal control of heart rate in
response to changes in arterial pressure. A computer model of the system will be
used to develop principles for the control of chemical processes. The
expectation is that understanding natural control mechanisms will aid the
development of improved algorithms for controlling engineering systems.
