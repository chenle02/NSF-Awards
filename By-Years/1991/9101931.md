Dr. Vincent Catalano has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Catalano's doctoral degree was from the University of California
at Davis under the supervision of Professor Alan Balch. Dr. Catalano intends to
continue research at the California Institute of Technology under the
sponsorship of Professor Harry Gray. Dr. Catalano's area of postdoctoral
research will be inorganic photochemistry. Longer term, he plans to study the
ground state and excited state chemistry of quadruply bonded mixed metal dimers
directed towards catalytic or photocatalytic systems. %%% The Postdoctoral
Fellowships Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
