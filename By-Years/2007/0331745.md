A workshop titled "NSF Workshop on Nanoscale Mechanical Engineering" to be held
at NSF on June 15-16, 2003 is being proposed. The goals of the workshop are to
foster the continued emergence of nanotechnology as a major focus area within
the mechanical engineering community; to identify the critical sub-areas within
nanotechnology to which mechanical engineers will make key contributions; to
address to what extent the emergence of nanotechnology will require a paradigm
shift in mechanical engineering education; and to recommend to NSF the steps it
can take to nurture this transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will
consist of approximately 30 invited talks, a poster session, and a panel
session/open forum. The invited talks will give highlights of research in areas
including nanofabrication, nanomechanics, nanoscale transport, nanoscale
imaging, and nanoparticles and nanostructured materials. Speakers will be drawn
from both academia and industry. The panel session/open forum will have as its
object the development of specific recommendations regarding what the mechanical
engineering community can do, and what NSF can do, to foster the continued
development of nanoscale mechanical engineering. Following the meeting a report
will be prepared summarizing the Workshop and detailing the recommendations that
emerge. This report will be provided to NSF and posted on the NSF web
site.&lt;br/&gt;
