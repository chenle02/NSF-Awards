Abstract Rohde

The Fields Institute will mount an intensive program on Renormalization and
Universality in Mathematics and Mathematical Physics during the period Sept-Dec
2005. A large number of researchers and postdoctoral fellows will be in
residence at the Institute during this period, and more will visit during the
program's three workshops. One of these workshops will focus on percolation,
SLE, and related topics. This proposal requests partial support to substantially
increase the number of young American mathematicians gaining access to and
participating in this workshop. Researchers, graduate students, and postdoctoral
fellows from the program on Renormalization will be engaged in the workshop.
Workshop participants will interact with them, and may extend their visit to
take advantage of other program activities. The funding will be used primarily
for the travel support of graduate students and young PhDs.
