9302292 Patterson The objective of this research is to understand grain growth
in multiphase materials that exhibit wide variations in amount and structure of
a grain-growth inhibiting phase. The studies are performed on experimental
materials created with desired initial microstructures. The effects of
controlled variations in basic but critical parameters such as volume fraction,
shape, location, mobility, stability, and contiguity of the growth inhibiting
phase are examined. Elevated temperature grain growth anneals are employed with
stereological measurements to analyze the evolving grain and inhibiting phase
structures. The data are analyzed using a grain growth model derived from recent
research to test and further refine the model. %%% The knowledge gained from
these studies will be of scientific and technological value, broadly applicable
to a wide range of conventional and advanced materials. ***
