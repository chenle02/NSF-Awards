The project focuses on the study of unitary representations of reductive p-adic
groups via affine Hecke algebras. The general approach is motivated by the local
Langlands program which predicts a correspondence between the larger class of
admissible representations of p-adic groups and certain geometric categories
defined in terms of the dual complex group. The first direction of research is
the development of an algorithm for computing signatures of invariant hermitian
forms for the affine Hecke algebra, motivated by the recent results obtained in
the setting of real reductive groups. A second direction concerns basic abstract
harmonic analysis problems for (graded) affine Hecke algebras, and certain
applications of Dirac operator theory in this setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project falls in the area of representation theory of Lie groups. Lie groups,
named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, are mathematical objects
underlying the symmetries inherent in a system, and their representations, i.e.,
the ways in which the Lie groups can manifest themselves, have had an important
impact in theoretical physics and number theory. This research will generate
topics that can constitute bases for Ph.D. or master theses; some problems of
combinatorial nature related to the project are suitable for undergraduate
research through REU programs.
