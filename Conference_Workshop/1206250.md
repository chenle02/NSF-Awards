The 2012 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences Summer School in
Probability, to be held at the University of British Columbia from June 4-29,
2012, will be an opportunity for a few top researchers in the field to interact
directly with the advanced graduate students and recent graduates. The
participants will learn the current techniques in the most significant areas of
probability theory, including growth models and exclusion process, last passage
percolation, random maps and their scaling limits. It is expected that the
participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main
courses and related areas. PIMS Summer School 2012 will be a great opportunity
for graduate students and junior researchers to learn some of the most
significant modern probability theory from the top experts in the field. The
junior participants are often current and future academic faculty, able to
spread the knowledge of the modern techniques further in the research community.
