The project is a three-year, exploratory, qualitative case study of a
mathematics Lesson Study group for 12 beginning mathematics teachers working in
high-poverty middle schools in Brooklyn, New York City. The project's Lesson
Study model employs social semiotics to examine the intersection between
language and learning in mathematics classrooms. The project is addressing two
research questions: (1) How does social semiotics illuminate the complexities of
mathematics instruction in high-poverty schools? (2) How does the Lesson Study
group strengthen teachers' content knowledge, increase their pedagogical-content
knowledge, and enhance their ability to orchestrate whole-class conversations?
Additionally, on-site Lesson Study groups will also be launched in some
participating schools.
