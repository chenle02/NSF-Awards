IRI-9612768 This award funds a research-planning workshop that is intended to
discuss promising new and emerging applications for robotics, and to identify
research needs to facilitate the realization of those applications. The workshop
is co-sponsored by the Robotics Industries Association and by the IEEE Robotics
and Automation Society. It is be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in November 1996.
The Robotics and Machine Intelligence Program of NSF has long had a strategic
objective of supporting research that would enhance robotics system performance
and usability, thereby gaining acceptance and adoption of robotics technologies
across a broad spectrum of application domains. The workshop aims to establish
or enhance connections between technology researcher/developers and potential
end users, leading to stimulation of research of increased strategic value.
Thus, the design of the workshop includes involvement of lots of industry
participants, primarily representing end-users, with a few robotics vendors, and
a number of academic researchers. Discussion groups will address needs
identification, research identification, and research transition. Several
planned publications from the workshop should assure wide dissemination of the
findings and recommendations.
