This is a parallel study with MSS-9116093. The objective is to involve
stochastic analysis of failure probabilities for seismically excited systems
exhibiting soil-structure interaction phenomena. The models considered will take
into account kinematic coupling between the free-field motion of the soil and
the rigid motion of the foundation, inertial coupling between the motion of the
soil-foundation and the motion of the attached structure, and non-linear
behavior of the soil medium. Both circular and rectangular surface supported
rigid foundations will be considered. The applicability of simplified stochastic
methods previously used primarily for structural engineering problems will be
investigated by comparing their results with those of Monte Carlo numerical
simulation.
