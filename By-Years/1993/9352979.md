9352979 Karnawat Turtle Mountain Community College will conduct a four week
summer commuter project in mathematics for thirty Native American high school
students. Participants will learn to apply mathematical ideas to engineering
design. Problems relevant to local industry and the reservation will be studied
using techniques from probability and statistics. The TI-82 graphing calculator
will be employed to analyze data. Emphasis will be given to those problems that
are relevant to the Chippewa culture. Field trips to local universities and 9
Saturday follow-up meetings complete the program. ***
