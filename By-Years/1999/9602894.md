The Symposium will provide an opportunity for senior researchers, postdoctoral
research associates, and advanced students to hear and discuss recent
experimental and theoretical work related to symmetries in atoms, nuclei, and
particles. These symmetries often form the framework of the underlying theories
of modern physics. Included will be space-time symmetries, gauge symmetries,
chiral symmetries, and other ones that are playing an important role in the
developments of subatomic physics.
