This research involves investigating the major processes occurring in the Io
plasma torus - the sources and losses of material; the mechanisms of energy
transfer from Jupiter to the plasma and between the plasma species and radiation
fields; and the response of the torus to changes in the volcanic output to Io.
By building on previous models of the torus structure, Dr. Bagenal will combine
in situ particles and fields measurements obtained on the initial passage of the
Galileo spacecraft through the torus with remote sensing measurements obtained
on subsequent orbits to determine the 3-dimensional distributions of plasma
properties (density, temperature, composition) and their variations with time.
By building on these models of the torus chemistry, she will: model the
production of plasma from Iogenic neutral material following the plasma as it
diffuses radially; calculate sources and losses of each species through
ionization and charge-exchange processes; and compute energy pick-up, transfer
and radiation losses. Interactive activities include running the Space Physics
Seminars, teaching a graduate special research topics course, working with the
UCLA Committee on Gender Issues, and running a seminar/workshop on gender
issues.
