This Presidential Faculty Fellow Award will support theoretical and
computational cosmological studies. The principal investigator, Dr. Lars
Hernquist, will use sophisticated numerical simulations run primarily on
supercomputers to investigate the effects of galaxy collisions and hydrodynamics
in multi-component systems on the formation and evolution of galaxies and very
large scale structure in the Universe.
