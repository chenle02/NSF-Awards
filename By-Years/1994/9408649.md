9408649 Lucas For the first time since explicitly dynamic macroeconomic models
were first developed in the 1930s, we have available a class of theories that
are squarely in the general equilibrium tradition; built up from assumptions on
preferences, technology, and market structure. In the ten years since the
introduction of the first real business cycle model, a great deal of useful
theoretical and computational experience has been accumulated, evidence from a
wide range of sources has been brought to bear on key parameters, and people
have begun to apply the standard methods of neoclassical welfare analysis to
macroeconomic questions. These are exciting and promising technical
developments, but they have been bound together with a particular substantive
view of the nature of business cycles: that productivity changes have been the
main source of economic instability. As a result, macroeconomists who are
convinced of the importance of monetary shocks and nominal rigidities have made
little use of these developments. This project addresses the question of how to
best integrate the analysis of real and monetary forces in a general equilibrium
framework with well- specified microfoundations. This project pursues
theoretical research on the business cycle effects of monetary instability. A
framework is proposed for a unified treatment of the economy's response to
productivity shocks and of market malfunctions that transmit monetary
disturbances in other sectors of the economy. The potential of this framework in
accounting for the behavior of production, prices, and interest rates is
described, Some central questions are identified, and a program of theoretical,
numerical, and empirical research on these question is pursued.
