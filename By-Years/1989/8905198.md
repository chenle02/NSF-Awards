The thickness of the polar sea ice cover is an important parameter in the
exchange of energy between the atmosphere and the ocean, and may act as a
significant variable in the variation of the global climate. Present methods for
determining the ice thickness are so inefficient and labor-intensive that remote
sensing techniques need to be introduced, however up to this time no feasible
way to make the measurements has been found. The present research program will
try out a new technique which observes the weighted average of the ultra-high
frequency (UHF) microwave emission of the sea ice and the underlying water
surface. The UHF radiometer, on loan from the NASA Langley Research Center has a
theoretical capability to measure sea ice thickness up to one meter, which
exceeds the average thickness of undeformed first-year ice around Antarctica.
