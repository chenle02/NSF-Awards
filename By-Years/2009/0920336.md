The enormous amount of information processed in the nervous system depends on a
complex network of trillions of neuronal connections. These neural connections
form during embryogenesis, when neurons extend axonal projections towards their
targets. This is a process similar to laying out a grid of phone cables that
allow communication between people in different parts of a city. One key
question in the field is how extending axons utilize cues that they encounter
during migration in order to find their targets.

The objective of this project is to determine the role a particular group of
molecules, called extracellular matrix components, plays during embryogenesis
when motor neurons in the spinal cord establish connections with their distant
muscle targets. The laboratory of Dr. Granato uses the zebrafish (Danio rerio)
as a model organism to investigate these questions, using an array of genetic
and molecular manipulations aimed to understand how a complex network of
neuronal connections is established in a stereotyped and efficient way during
embryonic development.

Generally, insights into the development and function of the nervous system have
impacted the arts, education, and economics, and our understanding of ourselves
as individuals and as members of society. Specifically, results from the project
will elucidate the factors that play critical roles to generate neural
connectivity, thus providing insights into how the human nervous system is
organized. In addition, the project will provide training opportunities for
doctoral and postdoctoral fellows, as well as for undergraduate students.
Students will use state-of the-art technologies and will be trained to
synthesize information across the neurosciences, thereby helping to grow the
next generation of scientists.
