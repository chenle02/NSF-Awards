The low-dimensional dynamic behavior of infinite dimensional systems is a field
of intense mathematical research, and the theoretical part of this work explores
and builds on a number of such directions. The investigator and his colleagues
study several new aspects of the theory of inertial and approximate inertial
manifolds, and explore and establish new connections between them and the method
of empirical eigenfunctions. At the same time, a goal of the proposal is the
computational implementation of the new methods and the study of certain
numerical analysis aspects associated with them (stability, interaction with
symmetries, and preservation of dissipation). Dissipative time-dependent partial
differential equations arise from descriptions of a variety of important
physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. The purpose of this project is to
develop, analyze, computationally implement, and test methods for the reduction
of such equations to accurate, small dynamical systems. This is a subject of
intense research interest in its own right; at the same time, it provides a
bridge to the study of many complex physicochemical and engineering systems,
with important implications for the simulation, analysis, prediction and control
of their dynamic behavior. An integral part of this work is the application of
the techniques to models of realistic systems of current research interest, such
as pattern formation in catalytic and electrochemical reactions. The
investigator and his colleagues believe that the attempt to tackle realistic
problems strengthens the theoretical and computational aspects of the research,
and provides new ideas and directions.
