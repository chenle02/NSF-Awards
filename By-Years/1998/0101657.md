E-Portal to Information Technology and Careers (E-Portal to IT) provides on-line
dissemination of IT curricula and educational materials, best practices, career
and certification information, and professional advancement opportunities. The
portal, developed and maintained by the Northwest Center for Emerging
Technologies (NWCET), aggregates content, brings together a community of
interest in IT education solutions and provides them with adaptive e-tools
necessary to efficiently reach and organize information. The Business Connector
increases and enhances connections to practices and models for working with
community colleges and other educators to develop IT educational programs. Also
posted are internship and employment opportunities. The Development Finder
provides educators and business-education partnerships links to smart IT Skill
standards, online access to curricula and courseware based on the standards,
professional development opportunities, implementation guides and resources
developed by NWCET and other ATE projects. The IT Program Finder and Skills
Locator links jobs to required skills, educational programs and certification in
ways meaningful to students and re-careering adults. The portal expands linkages
with professional organizations and business and industry leaders to ensure ATE
presence in policy making and implementation.
