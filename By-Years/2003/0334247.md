A grant has been awarded to Drs. Amy Martin-Carnahan, Sam Joseph and Colin
Stine at the University of Maryland, Jonathan Heidelberg at The Institute for
Genomic Research and Ashok K. Chopra at the University of Texas to produce the
complete genome sequence of the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila. This will
provide a roadmap for understanding the physiology and ecology of this
microorganism which is found in all manner of aquatic environments worldwide, is
an important fish pathogen and interacts with many other microorganisms in the
aquatic environment. The DNA of the organism will be isolated, purified and
extracted and each fragment will be sequenced and subsequently the complete
genetic code will be pieced together by a combination of state-of-the art
molecular and computational techniques.&lt;br/&gt; This study will provide vital
genetic information about this microbe, and its role in the environment and
interactions with other organisms. Aeromonas hydrophila is on the Drinking Water
Contaminant Candidate List of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and is
listed as a pathogen of concern in the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration's
"Bad Bug Book". Overall, the sequencing of A. hydrophila will further our
understanding of this and related organisms in many of the major aquatic
ecosystems on this planet. With our increasing dependence on the aquatic
environment, it is important for us to better understand the overall composition
of its microbiota, thus allowing us to detect changes in environmental quality
that may pose hazards to human and ecosystem health. The results of this project
will be made available to the general scientific community as well as
incorporated into undergraduate and graduate science courses at various campuses
of the University of Maryland. The sequence data will also be available through
scientific databases and web pages as well as other public databases.
