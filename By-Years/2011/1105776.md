A fundamental goal in knot theory is the classification of knots up to isotopy
and up to concordance. The fundamental group of the knot complement is an
important algebraic invariant, but is rarely abelian. Homology with local
coefficients can be used to associate modules to the knot. Since modules are
abelian groups, distinguishing them is still feasible. However, since these are
often modules over noncommutative rings, some of the rich structure of the
fundamental group is retained. These homology modules, as well as linking forms
defined on them, have been used by myself and others to define isotopy
invariants of knots and concordance invariants of knots. This project concerns
using these noncommutative techniques in two areas of knot theory: knot
concordance and knot Floer homology.

The goal of this project is to use non-commutative algebra to better understand
knotted curves in 3- and 4-dimensional space. The study of knots has important
applications in biology and physics. For example, DNA strands are naturally
knotted, but must unknot in order to replicate. Many mathematicians have used
algebra to better understand how curves can knot, however the type of algebra
considered is usually commutative. By employing non-commutative algebras, we can
get a more refined understanding for how curves can knot in 3-dimensional space
and bound surfaces in 4-dimensional space.
