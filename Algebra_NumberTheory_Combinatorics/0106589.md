1. The proposed project covers several topics in Probabilistic Combinatorics.
The first group of questions is about graph colorings. It mainly deals with the
study of chromatic and choice numbers of graphs satisfying certain local
conditions. One of the open problem which investigators will study is bounding
the chromatic number of a graph G with maximum degree d, which contains no copy
of a fixed graph H. A variant of this problem was posed already twenty years ago
by Komlos and Szemeredi and so far it was solved only for some special cases.
Investigator also plans to work on a few related questions about vertex list
coloring and acyclic edge coloring of graphs. Another set of questions is about
asymptotic properties of random graphs and random regular graphs. Here
investigators goal is to understand the distribution of independent sets of
nearly optimal size in sparse random graphs, and use this to determine the
asymptotic behavior of its choice number. It is sometimes the case that an
existence proof, supplied by the probabilistic method, is not sufficient and it
is better to have an explicit construction. One of the major open problems in
this field is to construct exponentially large graphs, without a clique or an
independent set of size k. In this project investigator intends to consider this
problem together with its bipartite version. He also plans to study the
properties of pseudo-random graphs and their applications.

2. Leave nothing to chance. This cliche embodies the common belief that
randomness has no place in carefully planned methodologies. In modern
Combinatorics at least, nothing can be further from the truth. Here the
Probabilistic Method has been developed intensively and become one of the most
powerful and widely used tools. Use of probability proved to be helpful in
tackling many long standing open problems. Another major reason for the
development of this method is the important role of randomness in Theoretical
Computer Science. Here algorithm which make random choices during its execution
proved to be simplest and fastest for many applications.
