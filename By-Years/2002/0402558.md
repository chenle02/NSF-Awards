This award is for the continued operation and improvements to the Diatom
Paleolimnology Data Cooperative (DPDC) operated from the Academy of Natural
Sciences in Philadelphia. The DPDC is a publicly accessible website and database
designed to provide scientists, and interested parties, with counts of diatom
and estimates of temperature, precipitation, water chemistry, and hydrologic
characteristics for use across a broad spectrum of paleolimnological and
paleoclimatological studies. The DPDC enhances independent study by a wide
variety of US and non-US scientists and educators.
