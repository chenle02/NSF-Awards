"Monitoring the Environment"

This proposal requests funds to support young scholar travel to participate in a
workshop, "Monitoring the Environment: Scales, Methods, and Systems in
Historical Perspective", co-sponsored by the Society for the History of
Technology and the American Society for Environmental History. The workshop will
bring together two groups of historians who frequently read one another's work
and share a number of common interests but have never organized a joint
workshop. Approaching the topic from the twin perspectives of environmental and
technological history will open a dialogue on how to identify and study the key
issues involved in setting and enforcing environmental standards. The broader
impact of the workshop is two-fold. First, the workshop will facilitate contact
between two groups of historians who approach the topic of environmental
monitoring from very different points of view. Just as importantly, the
opportunity for young scholars to hear and critique one another's work will set
the stage for future cooperation and collaboration.
