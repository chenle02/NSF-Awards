This summer research program for undergraduates in Cell and Molecular Biology
supports undergraduate research in laboratories of leading researchers in the
biological sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Members of minority
groups underrepresented in biological research and students from institutions
without broad research facilities are selected for the program based on research
interests and potential commitment to a research career. During a 9-week
program, each student works on an independent research project in a faculty
mentor's laboratory. Depending upon the project, participants learn current
techniques including DNA cloning, PCR sequencing, in situ hybridization, cell
culture and Western blotting. They also participate in workshops on specific
research areas, bioethics, advice from graduate students and preparation for the
Graduate Record Examination. Students write and orally present a research
proposal during the beginning of the program, and, at the conclusion, submit a
paper summarizing their work. The paper is presented at a symposium for the
participants.
