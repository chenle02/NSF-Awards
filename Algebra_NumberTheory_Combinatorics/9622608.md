This awards supports the research of Professor D. Grayson to continue the
development of Macaulay 2. This system will enable large scale research
computing projects dealing with systems of polynomial equations in many
variables. He also hopes to work on the connections between algebraic k-theory
and motivic cohomology. This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one
of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point
where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics. The software being developed here will make many previously difficult
or impossible computations in this field possible.
