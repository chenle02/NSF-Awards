The biennial publication of the proceedings of the International Symposium on
Combustion is one of the most valuable ongoing contributions to the scientific
literature. Support (to the extent of $6,000) is a fine investment to make in
connection with the 1988 Symposium. A 12-month grant is recommended from FY88
funds in the amount of $6,000.
