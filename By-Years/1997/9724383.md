9724383 Butman This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
Massachusetts provides funds for construction of a new seawater flume system and
related instrumentation. The new instrumentation is expected to contribute
substantially to research in fluid dynamics, marine biology of larval
settlement, marine sediment dispersal research, and related geological and
ecological studies. This award is jointly supported by the Major Research
Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation Program of the Division of Ocean
Sciences. Substantial cost-share is offered by Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution towards this project. ***
