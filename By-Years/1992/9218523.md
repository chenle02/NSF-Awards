Heterotrophic protista have been shown to be important components in aquatic
food webs. The goal of this research program is to develop a new methodology for
studying protistan ecology in aquatic environments. Present methodologies for
examining these assemblages cannot resolve the trophic status of some important
species, nor do they facilitate studies of their spatial and temporal
variability. The identification of many of these species in natural samples is
presently dependent on procedures that are too laborious (e.g. electron
microscopy) or unrealistic (e.g. the observation of live specimens) for routine
use. This project will develop a new methodology, based on the sequencing of
ribosomal RNA genes, to construct fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes
for the identification of protists in mixed assemblages. Moreover, it will
establish a framework by which other investigators may adapt the methods for the
development of probes in their own work.
