9353587 Cobb The three-year project brings together issues concerning students'
learning, teachers' activity, classroom interactions, and the nature of
instructional activities. The primary focus is on the role that students' models
of their informal mathematical problem solving play in supporting their
transition to more formal yet personally-meaningful mathematical activity. As
part of the investigation, particular attention is given to both small group
work and to students' developing mathematical beliefs and values. The research
involves a series of classroom teaching experiments conducted in collaboration
with first, second, and third-grade teachers. The four instructional sequences
used in these experiments each last six weeks and address arithmetical topics
that are central to elementary school mathematics. The analysis of classroom
video-recordings and children's written work coordinates cognitive and social
perspectives to clarify the role that models can play both in individual
learning and in classroom communication. The findings have immediate
implications for the design of mathematical learning environments that are
consistent with current reform recommendations. Further, the four instructional
sequences that will be revised in the course of the research are designed to all
innovative teachers the so-called basics via communications, reasoning, and
problem solving. ***
