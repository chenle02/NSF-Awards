This project is devoted to the study of regular and chaotic motion in nearly
integrable infinite dimensional hamiltonian systems. Such systems include
certain nonlinear partial differential equations, the wave and vibrating beam
equations for instance. Statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics also
lead to these systems. The approach consists of extending KAM theory to
perturbations of completely integrable hamiltonian systems. Together with the
usual methods of the calculus of variation and bifurcation analysis, KAM theory
will shed new light on the existence of periodic and quasiperiodic solutions. In
addition, geometric and numerical methods will be employed.
