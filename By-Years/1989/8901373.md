Eastern tent caterpillars live communally in silken tents which they construct
cooperatively in cherry and apple trees. They also cooperate in the search for
food, communicating their funds to tentmates via chemical trails. Their social
organization both the question of how this cooperative system evolved the
eastern tent caterpillar is the only non-eusocial insect known to employ a
complex chemical communication system for corperative foraging the origin of
which poses some problems for classical selection theory based on individual
fitness. Taking advantage of the ease with which colonies can be sampled in the
field and studied in the laboratory, genetic relationships between and within
colonies and behavioral preferences of individual caterpillars for tentmates and
tents will be measure. The patterns observed should some light on the likely
made of evolution of the eastern tent caterpillar social system.
