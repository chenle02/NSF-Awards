Marlow Industries will be fabricating `filled` Skutterudite materials and
determining their thermoelectric properties in the refrigeration and lower power
generation temperature range (77K-350K). The recent verification of promisingly
high mobilities, and low thermal conductivities measured in the basic
Skutterudite family, and the independent confirmation of these values, have
established an entirely new family of potential materials. The inherent
advantage of these materials is their availability in powder and crystal form,
their cubic symmetry, and their potential for high thermoelectric transport
properties. The materials chosen to fill the two vacancies in the Skutterudite
unit cell will be chosen to explore p and n-type materials and to determine
their effect on further reducing the thermal conductivity by changing the
molecular weight, atomic radius and valence state of the `filler`. The obvious
impact on the refrigeration, air conditioning and power generation market make
this program essential to the maintenance of U.S. industry leadership in these
markets. Phase I will evaluate the potential of these materials and define the
nature of the barriers to be overcome to achieve economically viable synthesis
pathways in the follow on Phase II.
