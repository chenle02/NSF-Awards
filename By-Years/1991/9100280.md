The chemistry of copper complexes with dioxygen will be explored, as it may
relate to that in biological systems. Specific pursuits will include: 1) the
synthesis of new ligands that are able to bind one, two, or three copper ions
ligated by nitrogen atoms, preferably from the heterocycles pyridine or
imidazole; 2) the incorporation of groups into such ligands that will influence
the local copper ion environment by positioning a proton, an additional metal
ion, a "substrate- binding cavity" or a non-polar hydrophobic moiety near the
copper-binding site; 3) a study of the dioxygen, carbon monoxide, and anion-
binding properties of such complexes; and 4) conducting oxidation reactions of
organic molecules that associate with those ligands having a cavity by treating
such complexes with dioxygen in the presence of substrate. In order to achieve
these goals, use will be made of rigid organic molecules as ligand "anchors"
that have the requisite stereochemical properties to bring the chosen groups
into proximity, and the known dioxygen chemistry of pyridine- and imidazole-
ligated copper complexes will be utilized as well. The organic frameworks
comprise known and derivative triptindane and cavitand molecules that can be
made in gram quantities from relatively simple starting materials. %%% In this
project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo- metallic Program of the
Chemistry Division, Dr. Thomas N. Sorrell of the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill will explore the chemistry of copper complexes with dioxygen. The
goal of these studies of model systems is to increase our knowledge of how
copper-containing enzymes are able to catalyze metabolic and biosynthetic
reactions.
