This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program along with the
Instrumentation and Instrumentation Development Program of the Division of
Instrumentation and Resources will help the Department of Chemistry at
Washington State University acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. The projects
described by the major users include development of novel synthetic methods such
as the use of boronic esters in asymmetric synthesis, and the use of metal-
halogen exchange reactions in chiral synthesis of novel macrocycles; the
synthesis of altered nucleotide bases and their incorporation into DNA; the
investigation of electron transfer in organometallic complexes; the synthesis of
isotopically enriched terpenoids for biosynthetic studies; the synthesis of
potential metabolites for ligin biosynthesis; and the synthesis of isotopically
enriched substrates for mechanistic studies of enzymes of aromatic amino acid
biosynthesis. %%% Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules and to study the dynamics of interactions
between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is
essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in
biology.
