Research supported by this award will focus on various aspects of nonlinear
evolution equations: nonlinear partial differential equations whose solutions
evolve in time. The work combines classical theory of differential equations
with harmonic analysis and mathematical physics. The principal areas of study
include nonlinear dispersive systems arising as approximate models in
propagation of nonlinear waves. Particular interest will be paid to determining
the lower bound of Sobolev exponents which guarantee local well-posedness for
the generalized Korteweg-deVries equation. A similar effort will be applied to
the study of nonlinear Schrodinger equations. In both cases preliminary work has
already improved known estimates on the exponents. Higher order equations will
also be analyzed. Here the nonlinear part of the equations will be restricted to
polynomials having no constant term. This class of evolution equation models
waves in elastic media. Local results have already been established for the
smoothness of solutions, but long-time behavior is not well understood. For
instance, fifth order systems do not have solitary wave solutions. Additional
work is planned on the Zakharov-Schulman systems which describe interactions of
small-amplitude, high frequencey wave with acoustic type waves. Where the linear
part is elliptic, the equations have been extensively studied, otherwise no
results are known. Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical
modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much
to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative
information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about
uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods
for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these
approximations.
