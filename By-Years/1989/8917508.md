The study is designed to determine the importance of organic carbon flux on
benthic foraminiferal morphotype patterns and carbon isotopic data from Holocene
deep-sea benthic foraminiferal. The study will be based on surficial sediments
beneath a surface productivity gradient on the northwest African margin. An
analysis of benthic foraminiferal morphotypes, based on test shape and mode of
coiling, will provide information on the depth distribution of microhabitats of
the deep-sea fauna. Carbon isotopic analyses of epifaunal and infaunal benthic
foraminifera will be carried out to test the hypothesis that the microhabitats
in which species live influence the carbon isotopic composition of the test, The
morphotype and carbon isotopic data will be compared with estimated organic
carbon flux data to determine if these methods can be used to reconstruct
organic carbon flux in ancient oceans.
