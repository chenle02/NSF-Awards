This award will be used to upgrade engineering research equipment being used in
an on-going research project. The project is a study of high temperature
lubrication of sliding systems by carbon generated in situ from catalytic
dissociation of organic gases. The equipment upgrades consist of a far infrared
accessory and a fast kinetic accessory to a Fourier transform infrared
spectrophotometer. These accessories will allow the equipment to follow fast
reactions and to distinguish hydrogen-metal bonds at the metal surface from
other bonds in the various molecules present on and near the surface. This will
make it possible to characterize the reactions and the surfaces in detail.
