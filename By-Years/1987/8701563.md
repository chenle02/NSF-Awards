Dr. Fraley has requested partial support for a conference that will focus on
recently developed techniques that allow the production of transgenic plants.
The sessions will cover: Ti plasmid derived vectors, plant gene promoters,
transformation of crop plants, plant genetics (somatic and sexual), crop
modification, protein traffic, novel gene systems, and several other topics. The
tentative list of speakers is excellent. The conference will be held in a
central location (Colorado), and will have a size and format similar to that of
the very successful Gordon conferences. The proposed conference will center
around recent advances in the development of techniques for the introduction of
foreign DNA into plants and their use in a variety of plant research areas. Both
from the progress to date with plants and from past experience with other
organisms, it is clear that these techniques will revolutionize the study of
plant physiology, development and genetics. This is a rapidly moving research
area of fundamental importance, and the conference will be of great use to the
participants and to the study of plants in general.
