The research objective of this grant is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms
that are responsible for contact, adhesion, and friction interactions between
micro-patterned surfaces and soft fluid-coated substrates. The goal is to
understand the generation of tractions; its dependence of key design,
environmental, and operational parameters; and its impact on the mechanical
response of the substrate. A multi-scale modeling framework will be used to
capture the interplay of large macro- and micro-scale deformation phenomena
during the roll-over of a treaded wheel over a soft wet substrate, in dependence
of material, geometric, and operational parameters. The mechanical behavior of
tread and substrate will be described by large deformation theories and
appropriate constitutive models. The tight integration of modeling and
experiments will provide novel insight into the contact mechanics of soft, wet
materials, in particular into the microscopic phenomena for generating friction
and the interplay of macro- and micro-scale mechanics for generating
traction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will facilitate the
discovery of new types of patterned architectures and concepts and establish a
crucial body of knowledge needed for the design of in vivo robotic devices that
can reduce patient trauma and expand robotic surgery. The proposed educational
program will introduce students at all levels, including those from typically
underrepresented groups, to the excitement inherent in research conducted at the
intersection of micro-fabrication, biomechanics, and robotics in general, and to
the promise inherent in the world of surgical robotics specifically. The
proposed educational activities will be enhanced by our access to the University
of Colorado?s Award-winning Integrated Teaching and Learning Laboratory.
