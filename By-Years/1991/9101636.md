The analysis of a hydrographic and acoustic Doppler current profiler section of
the tropical north Atlantic at 11 degrees N will be completed. The objectives of
the work are to calculate the meridional heat and fresh water fluxes and the
transport of various deep water masses. This work is collaborative with
scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
