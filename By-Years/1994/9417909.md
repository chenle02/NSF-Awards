In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Gilbert Nathanson of the Chemistry Department of the University of
Wisconsin in Madison will continue his researches on the interactions between
gases and liquids, these ranging from repulsive collisions to trapping and
solvation. Three sets of experiments will be conducted: 1. paraffin, olefin, and
aromatic liquids will be bombarded by hydrocarbon gases in order to learn how
changes in the structure and bonding of liquid phase molecules govern surface
corrugation and gas-liquid energy transfer; 2. inert gas atoms will bombard the
surfaces of liquid metals indium and gallium and the In/Ga eutectic alloy to
examine the roles played by surface and sub-surface atoms in absorbing the
impact energy; 3. gaseous water, ammonia, short chain alcohols, and hydrogen
chloride will bombard a sulfuric acid surface to map out the scattering from,
and solvation in, sulfuric acid as function of impact angle and collision
energy. Mass spectroscopy and time-of-flight velocity analysis will be used to
monitor the identity, translational energy, and direction of scattered products.
There is little experimental work being done probing the liquid interfaces at
the molecular length scales. This research has a high probability of exposing
new phenomena and discovering new aspects of gas-surface interaction mechanisms.
The techniques employed in this research were developed by the principal
investigator. The results of this research will have bearing on other areas of
physical chemistry such as nucleation, vaporization, chemical reactions at
surfaces, polymer physics, and atmospheric chemistry involving aerosol
particles.
