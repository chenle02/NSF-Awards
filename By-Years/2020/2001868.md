This research investigates how performance standards in the workplace create
barriers to inclusion. The specific focus is on how sound and voice criteria for
broadcasters have constrained plans of inclusion in broadcasting organizations
in different regions. The project investigates 1) the creation of public radio
broadcast standards, 2) the endurance of these standards despite demographic
changes, and 3) how broadcasters experience these standards. This work will
contribute to understanding of how obstacles to opportunity can exist in
organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data will be collected from relevant
documents and interviews, as follows. Memoranda about language usage in national
archives will be examined to identify foundational policies and practices for
radio networks. Board documents at broadcasting organizations will be examined
to analyze inclusion efforts and their relationship to existing rules. Listener
complaints will be analyzed to identify audience demands. Lastly, 100 radio
broadcasters will be interviewed about challenges they face and tools they
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
