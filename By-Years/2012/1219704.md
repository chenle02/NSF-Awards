This award (OCE-1219704) will support two NSF funded sea-going programs by
providing access to research vessel Pelican, operated by Louisiana Universities
Marine Consortium (LUMCON). R/V Pelican as a designated UNOLS vessel adheres to
all UNOLS safety standards, NSF inspections, and reporting requirements.
Historically LUMCON has run an efficient and economical operation to support
sea-going activities primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. This award represents the
start of a new five-year cooperative agreement, and for each year of the
cooperative agreement annual funding will be re-negotiated based upon the number
of days at sea in direct support of NSF peer-reviewed research. This award is
for platform support for NSF programs.
