The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with
Industry (GOALI) award is to develop a novel and powerful topology optimization
method. The research will be carried through close collaboration with Mercury
Marine (WI), the industrial partner for this award. The specific tasks are: (1)
to identify a set of topology optimization problems that are representative of
the challenges faced by the industry today; (2) to significantly improve the
speed and reliability of topology optimization; (3) to focus on product
realization and commercialization. In addition to collaborating with the
industrial partner, the research will leverage student-designed SAE Formula cars
at UW-Madison to put the topology optimization algorithms to a rigorous test.

If successful, the research will provide a fresh stimulus to the mathematically
rich discipline of topology optimization. It will further strengthen the theory
of topological sensitivity by applying it to complex problems of engineering
interest. It will explore and exploit relationship between existing topology
optimization methods and new method. Through industrial interaction, the
research will create better understanding, formulation and solution of practical
topology optimization problems. The broader impacts of the research are: (1)
better optimization techniques will lead to reduced physical prototyping, and
reduced material usage; (2) undergraduates and graduate students at UW-Madison
will be exposed to topology optimization through case-studies, and summer co-ops
at Mercury-Marine, and (3) the impact of the industrial interaction is on
budding engineers who will be exposed to a unique blend of research, industrial
experience and formal education. The research is transformative in that it
suggests a fundamentally new direction for topology optimization that has not
been investigated by the research community.
