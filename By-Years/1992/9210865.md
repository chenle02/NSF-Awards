This project will create the first complete data set containing county level
occupational censuses for nineteenth-century Britain and will supplement a
demographic data set already created by the investigator. Completion of the
project will allow scholars to begin a quantitative study of the female labor
force in nineteenth- century Britain in an attempt to measure the impact of
industrialization on female labor force participation. Female employment
patterns today have generated much research and legislation. These patterns have
historical roots that can be investigated to determine the importance of
institutions and culture on economic activity. Using the proposed data set, the
reasons for the decline in female participation rates can be explored. It can
also be determined whether or not industrialization necessarily leads to
competitive labor markets. Occupational segregation and industrial segregation
can be measured and compared. The importance of "noneconomic" factors on women's
work can be examined as can the "economic" factors which traditionally affect
demand for and supply of female labor.
