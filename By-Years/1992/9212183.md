With the increased complexity of distributed and concurrent programs, it
becomes necessary to use formal methods to reason about such systems. This
entails new research on using temporal logics and state transition systems to
reason about concurrent programs. The problem of proving properties of systems
of processes communicating through message channels that may lose or duplicate
messages is investigated. New methods for automatically verifying properties of
such systems specified in different temporal logics are proposed. Part of the
research will be directed towards developing algorithms for verifying real-time
properties of finite state concurrent programs specified in a branching time
temporal logic. New formalisms for specifying real-time behavior of finite-state
processes will be investigated. In addition, new methods for proving correctness
of concurrent programs with respect to specifications given by, possibly finite
state, nondeterministic automata will be explored. Research on fault-tolerance
in distributed systems will focus on developing new algorithms for achieving
fault-tolerance through roll back recovery in distributed systems. Specifically,
efficient algorithms that tolerate arbitrarily spaced crash failures as well as
application specific recovery procedures will be investigated.
