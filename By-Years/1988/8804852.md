The Devonian Acadian orogeny was the result of collisional tectonics involving
North America and continental material to the east. Acadian tectonic development
involved early fold and thrusts nappes followed by complex back folding with
structural and metamorphic fabrics accompanying stages. The pattern of meta-
morphic isograds and reconstructed P-T trajectories bear a complex relationship
to the deformation stages. This combined structural and petrologic study is
aimed at developing a clearer and chronologically more precise tectonic and
thermal history of the belt. Exposures of high metamorphic grade in central
Massachusetts can be correlated with fossil-bearing units to the north, thus
allowing stratigraphic sequence to be a useful tool in understanding the pattern
of large-scale structural features and the growth of metamorphic minerals will
be used to establish the relative ages of deformation and thermal events and to
evaluate the sequence of pressure and temperature conditions to which different
rocks were subjected. Results will help develop a fuller understanding of mid-
crustal processes during the develop- ment of this major mountain belt.
