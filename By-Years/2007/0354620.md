ABSTRACT

We propose to further developments related to Perelman's work on the
Geometrization Conjecture, using Ricci flow through the space-time formulation,
new gradient estimates and monotone quantities and their geometric applications,
and to apply new techniques and applications based on the ideas of these methods
and estimates with the aim of furthering the understanding of the following
interconnected topics: 1. Uniformization of compact and noncompact Kaehler
manifolds, combining Kaehler-Ricci flow and the study of holomorphic
functions/sections. 2. Analysis of singularities, formulation of weak solutions,
and flow past singularities for geometric evolution equations and the duality
between the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. 3. Study of
harmonic/holomorphic functions, function theory, spectrum and the geometry of
complete Riemannian/Kaehler manifolds. 4. Existence of Einstein and other
canonical Riemannian metrics on manifolds.

Geometric evolution equations are powerful and central tools in the study of
the global geometry and topology of manifolds. Recent work of Perelman on
Hamilton's program for Ricci flow and its applications towards a possible
solution to the Poincare and geometrization conjectures provides a timely and
promising opportunity for a group effort on significant advancements in
geometric analysis and related areas. The results from the project should lead
to new advances in and connections between string/duality theory and
renormalization group flow, Ricci flow, mean curvature flow and other geometric
evolution equations, and may enhance the understanding of the homogeneity of the
universe at large scales, as well as other areas in science. The project will
enhance the understanding of geometric analysis, linear and nonlinear partial
differential equations, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.
