This award will fund Undergraduate Design Projects to develop custom devices for
persons with musculoskeletal or neurological disorders. The students will work
with an institution providing care and training for the targeted population. Ten
projects per year will be undertaken by the group and reports on the completed
projects will be included in a publication that will detail the projects
completed at all institutions participating in this project. This type of
experience is important since not only will it provide meaningful projects for
the engineering students to complete as part of their education, but it will
also benefit a population where customization is usually required of many
rehabilitation devices.
