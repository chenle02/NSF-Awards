Over the past decade, numerous groups within the broad community of sedimentary
geology, paleoclimatology, and paleobiology have repeatedly highlighted the
importance of continental scientific drilling to address key science questions
in climate and linked earth systems. In recognition of this sustained interest,
this award will support a workshop to identify high priority sedimentary targets
for scientific drilling to address key questions on Earth system topics. The
primary goal of this workshop will be to galvanize research teams to plan and
begin to execute proposals for pursuing specific, high priority drilling
targets, intended to address key science questions related to paleoclimate,
paleobiology, and extreme events in Earth?s history.
