This project plans to map the fluxes, enzyme activities, and metabolic levels
for key reactions in the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle for two common bacteria, E. coli and B. subtilis. Both wild-type and
metabolic mutants will be examined in order to obtain regulatory insights and
alternative yield scenarios. Four areas are expected to be impacted. First, an
improved understanding of how the TCA cycle and glycolysis are coordinated would
be obtained. Secondly, the magnitude of the energy spilling reactions would be
determined. Thirdly, the results could prove useful to developing cultivation
conditions that promote the maximal conversion of carbon to cell mass. Finally,
metabolic engineering strategies could be identified that would allow one to
alter the regulation of the cell in an optimal manner.
