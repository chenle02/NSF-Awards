Researchers are working on a technology for 24/7 detection of bridge scour. The
system leverages advances in sensor technologies to provide cost-effective early
detection of bridge scour and the means to avoid bridge failure and associated
costs. The scour sensing technology uses magnetostrictive flow sensors that are
buried in the soil around bridge foundations. As scour develops and the soil
begins to erode, the sensors are activated and able to detect water flow and
automatically alert the bridge owner that remediation is needed. The macroscale
and nanoscale magnetostrictive fluidic sensors investigated with prior NSF
support are the basis for the advanced flow sensors system that is being used to
provide robust and continuous detection of bridge
scour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scour monitoring is a federally mandated part of
regular bridge inspections but often bridge owners do not have sufficient
manpower to inspect their entire bridge inventories more than once every year or
two. Scour can thus go undetected for long periods of time and develop into very
costly and even life threatening problems. The candidate scour detection system
could both improve public safety and save costs to the owners of bridges. This
is because the early scour detection can significantly reduce repair costs,
which in cases of advanced scour, can involve the cost of a complete bridge
replacement. A bridge experiencing or at risk of even moderate scour may be
closed resulting in a significant economic impact on the surrounding
communities. Often the solution to moderate to severe scour is replacement of an
otherwise sound bridge at a significant cost. Early scour can be repaired at a
cost of a few thousand dollars but late stage scour can cost a few hundred
thousand to repair or millions if the bridge needs to be replaced.
