The investigator proposes to study the topology of 3-dimensional
manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;using 2-dimensional laminations and foliations as the basic
tools. The main&lt;br/&gt;goal is to show how these objects can be used to
attack several long-standing&lt;br/&gt;conjectures in low-dimensional topology.
In particular, he proposes to use&lt;br/&gt;constructions of essential
laminations, due to the investigator and others,&lt;br/&gt;to classify the
exceptional Dehn surgeries on alternating knots. He&lt;br/&gt;plans to use
laminations to show that some large classes of 3-manifolds&lt;br/&gt;satisfy the
Virtual Haken Conjecture. He will also continue work aimed at
&lt;br/&gt;providing a better understanding of the structure of sutured
manifold&lt;br/&gt;decompositions, a fundamental technique in building and using
taut foliations,&lt;br/&gt;by developing examples of hyperbolic knots with large
depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We live in and move through a 3-dimensional
universe, which we perceive&lt;br/&gt;as extending infinitely in all directions.
But recent observations hint at the&lt;br/&gt;possibility that space may instead
wrap around itself, so that we live in a finite&lt;br/&gt; universe. It is this
very idea of a space wrapping around itself that lies at the&lt;br/&gt;heart of
geometric topology, whose goal is to understand the global structure
&lt;br/&gt;of objects which locally look like ordinary Euclidean space. The
investigator &lt;br/&gt;plans to study several questions aimed at uncovering
patterns in the global &lt;br/&gt;structure of 3-dimensional spaces, by using
2-dimensional surfaces to study &lt;br/&gt;the spaces in which they can be
found. The main idea is to use surfaces as a&lt;br/&gt;way of cutting the space
into pieces; by studying the resulting pieces, we &lt;br/&gt;can gain insight
into the large-scale structure of the 3-dimensional space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
