9322591 Nair Research in theoretical particle physics involves three major
topics in the standard model description of the basic interactions of matter.
The first concerns the interactions among quarks at high temperatures. Such
interactions play a significant role in the early universe. The second deals
with objects that can be formed in theories like the standard model, which have
unusual properties at macroscopic distances. These objects could underpin
significant phenomena such as superconductivity at high temperatures. And
finally, the third topic concerns the properties of scattering processes
involving many particles. These processes are quite important in high energy
collisions. ***
