9713013 Ripley The Academy for Educational Development, working in association
with the Association of Science-Technology Centers, is conducting activities
necessary in planning a clearinghouse that would provide information and support
to museums striving to provide greater and easier access to visitors with
disabilities. During the planning phase, the applicants will: * identify the
unmet access, information and educational needs of children and youth with
disabilities as they relate to the operations and services of science-rich
museums nationwide; * identify exemplary facilities, exhibits, materials, and
outreach and programming efforts in the museum world that are currently meeting
needs in this regard; and * identify the most appropriate and feasible
strategies through which science museums and similar facilities can attract and
more fully respond to the needs of visitors with disabilities. Toward the end of
this effort, the project will develop and field-test a panel and workshop on
accessibility at the ASTC 1997 conference. The results of the surveys and the
prototype workshop will serve as the foundation for design of a more
comprehensive and sustainable effort to support accessibility in museums.
