9403980 McMahon This award is made to support experimental and analytical
research in the mechanistic understanding of the phenomena of quasi-static
brittle fracture caused by stress assisted diffusion of surface- absorbed oxygen
into two polycrystalline high-strength alloys and to explore methods to inhibit
the embrittlement. A model with coupled creep and diffusion in the nonlinear
crack-tip region will be used to predict the dependence of initiation and crack
growth on loading, environment, and material properties. Predicted crack growth-
rates will be compared with measured rates in order to evaluate the model. ***
