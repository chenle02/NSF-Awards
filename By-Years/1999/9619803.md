This research investigates the relationships between information technology that
supports complex organizational work in critical ways, and the ensuing
organizational and human reliability and risk in the workplace---in this case
hospital emergency rooms. The project focuses on identifying organizational-
level information and information technology structures and factors that impact
the level and types of errors and risks in dynamic workplaces. The project will
(1) model actual technology-supported work systems from the standpoint of
understanding the role of information technology (IT) in system and human
reliability, and examine the models to understand potential points of IT-related
risk and breakdown in the work system; (2) use the model to predict role of IT
in contributing to errors and adverse outcomes; (3) pursue documentation of
patient information as the locus of organizational work, by examining critical
points in this system, and consider ways that the technology interacts with the
human work system, relating this to the model and rationalizing it; (4) refine
the model iteratively; and (5) work toward preliminary tests of the models that
examine single articulation points I the work structures and vary aspects of the
support technology in pilot experiments.
