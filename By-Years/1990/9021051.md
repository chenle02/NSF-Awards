The purpose of this research project is to investigate the nonlinear optical
properties of d-doped GaAs and to design and characterize unique space charge
structures created with this new doping techniques. One of the main objectives
is to merge and incorporate the concepts of nonlinear optics and atomic layer
doping of semiconductors for the first time by implementing creative methods of
materials characterization with hopes of developing a better understanding and
advancing both of these areas in materials science.
