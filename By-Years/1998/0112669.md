Networked information technology has led to unprecedented opportunities for
exchanging information in a population of participants whose interests and needs
vary over time. In particular, this project concerns populations of consumers
looking for information products, and producers who possess products that others
might be seeking. Substantial research has gone into studying how producers and
consumers can settle the terms of a transaction for a particular good. However,
there are many possible variations and combinations of information products and
their prices that can be offered. A critical and poorly understood problem is
how parties should position themselves in this vast information product and
price space to differentiate themselves from competitors and attract those with
whom they should transact. To address this problem, the investigators will use
economic analysis and computer simulation to study how producers of information
goods can learn to position themselves based on criteria such as price schedules
and information content, and can adapt to changing consumer tastes where
consumers might be making strategic buying decisions to affect producer
positioning. This project will extend economic theory to account for these
concerns, and create computational agents that can make adaptive, strategic
decisions about product positioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
