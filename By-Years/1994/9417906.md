9417906 Nyblade This award provides partial (67%) funding for an upgrade to the
computer facility for geophysics in the Department of Geosciences at the
Pennsylvania State University. The institution is committed to providing the
remaining funds necessary for the acquisition of this equipment. The geophysics
computing facility is the principal research facility for four faculty members
and their students who have active research and teaching programs in the areas
of seismology, earthquake seismology, tectonics, heat flow, gravity and
geomagnetism. The upgraded facility, comprising a new central server with large
memory and several new workstations, replaces an existing facility which does
not meet the current research and teaching needs of the geophysics group at Penn
State. ***
