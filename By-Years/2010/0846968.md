Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0846968&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Martin Bridgeman, Noel Brady, Tao Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
award supports US speakers and invited US junior researchers&lt;br/&gt;attending
the fourth William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology&lt;br/&gt;Workshop, a
3-day, directed workshop to be held at the Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics
Institute in Dublin, Ireland in August 28-30,&lt;br/&gt;2008. Participants at
the workshop include leading researchers,&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers and
graduate students from the fields of low&lt;br/&gt;dimensional topology,
geometric group theory, and hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;geometry who have a special
interest in problems related to&lt;br/&gt;Heegaard splittings, mapping class
groups, and curve complexes.&lt;br/&gt;Specific topics include the relation of
the combinatorial data of&lt;br/&gt;a Heegaard splitting to the hyperbolic
structure on the manifold&lt;br/&gt;and applications of Masur-Minsky techniques
on the curve complex&lt;br/&gt;to the Surface Subgroup Conjecture and the
Virtually Haken&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture. There is already a growing tendency for
researchers&lt;br/&gt;in each of areas of Heegaard splittings, mapping class
groups,&lt;br/&gt;and curve complexes to use techniques from the other
two&lt;br/&gt;areas. This workshop should increase this, and will
focus&lt;br/&gt;collective energies on common
themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians who study low dimensional topology,
geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory, and hyperbolic geometry are concerned about
the&lt;br/&gt;nature of symmetry. Examples include the symmetries of
a&lt;br/&gt;snowflake, frieze patterns in architecture, wallpaper and
tiling&lt;br/&gt;patterns, and symmetries of crystal or lattice structures
in&lt;br/&gt;chemistry. This award will enable leading researchers,
graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and junior researchers from the US to gather
together&lt;br/&gt;with researchers from around the world in order to
combine&lt;br/&gt;methods and techniques to further research. This activity
will&lt;br/&gt;help focus the research programs of the next generation
of&lt;br/&gt;researchers, and will deepen our understanding of the nature
of&lt;br/&gt;symmetry. This activity supports an ongoing
international&lt;br/&gt;workshop dedicated to forging bonds between the US
mathematics&lt;br/&gt;community and an emerging mathematics institute (the
Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics Institute) in the European community.&lt;br/&gt;
