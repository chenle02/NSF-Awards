Those familiar with the weather off the California coast can attest to the
variability of cloudiness. Sometimes a deck of strato-cumulus clouds may persist
for hundreds of miles for hours or days. At other times such a layer of clouds
may form and break up within a relatively short period of time. Cloud-top
entrainment instability is the mechanism whereby a stratocumulus deck breaks up
into scattered cumulus clouds. It is generally accepted that the onset of the
process depends on the temperature and mixing ratio discontinuity across the
inversion. That is, whenever the equivalent potential temperature difference is
smaller than a critical value, the inversion is unstable and entrainment can
occur freely. However, recent evidence suggests that despite this instability
the cloud deck may remain solid. This requires that other mechanisms sustain the
entrainment instability; some examples include turbulence within the cloud
layer, coupling between the cloud and subcloud layers, and shear induced
entrainment. Under this grant, Dr. David Rogers will study these physical
mechanisms using a mesoscale model of the planetary boundary layer over the
ocean. The results should increase our understanding of the evolution of marine
stratocumulus.
