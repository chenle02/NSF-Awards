This award supports participation of US-based mathematicians, especially those
in early career stages, in the international conference "Finite Dimensional
Integrable Systems 2015" held at the Mathematical Research and Conference Center
in Bedlewo, Poland, on July 13 - 17, 2015. See
http://www.impan.pl/BC/Program/2015.html for additional details. The conference
brings together leading experts in this important and fast-growing area of
research, along with young mathematicians and graduate students.

The conference is focused on integrable systems with a finite number of degrees
of freedom, the most classical and popular part of the theory of completely
integrable systems that goes back to the works of Lagrange, Jacobi,
Kovalevskaya, Noether, Poincare and others. In the second half of 20th century,
KAM theory and the work of its founders (Kolmogorov, Arnold, Moser) gave a new
perspective on integrability problems and stimulated further progress in this
area. New powerful methods based on the interplay between a priori disconnected
branches of mathematics and physics have been recently developed: methods of
complex analysis, symplectic and complex geometry, Lie theory, representation
theory, and computer algebra - they are all used in the integrability theory. As
a result, new integrable systems have been found, new applications of integrable
systems in physics and geometry were discovered, new tools for the study of
integrable systems were developed, and many questions, open for a long time,
have been answered. The conference will survey recent progress in this field,
present open problems, outline new directions of research, look for new
applications, and foster new collaborations.
