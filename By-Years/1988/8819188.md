In order to reveal the mechanisms of learning and memory it is essential to
have information about the way synaptic inputs are integrated and processed in a
neuron, especially at the dendritic level. Recently, optical techniques have
been developed which can measure changes in membrane potential and intracellular
calcium simultaneously from many locations, including fine dendritic processes.
This project will use these new techniques to examine electrical events in
Purkinje cells in slices from the guinea pig cerebellum. In particular,
experiments will be performed to look at a) the spatial and temporal
characteristics of climbing fiber and granule cell neuronal contacts with
Purkinje cell neurons, and b) the interaction of the different interneuronal
contacts with each other. A computer model of the Purkinje cell will also be
developed which can be used to help interpret the optical data.
