9412304 Patterson This project investigates the balance between heterotrophy and
symbiotic autotrophy in sponges, a topic that we know very little about. Through
a series of laboratory experiments the investigators will determine the effects
of ecosystem (freshwater vs. marine), sponge morphology, and energy regime on
the extent of sponge heterotrophy and autotrophy. The techniques employed are
novel and include flow cytometry and DNA to RNA ratios. This study will result
in new fundamental understanding of the biology of sponges and their role in
ecosystems. The results of this study can be applied to ecosystem management,
especially for those ecosystems in which sponges are important, including such
diverse systems as Lake Baikal and the Florida Keys.
