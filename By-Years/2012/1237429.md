As the Internet emerges as the platform for computation, we have become
increasingly reliant on cryptography to provide privacy and security in many of
our day-to-day activities. We rely on cryptographic protocols to protect our
credit card numbers from hackers in electronic transactions and our personal
information from unauthorized access on online social networks. However, the
design of many cryptosystems do not adequately account for new computational and
cryptographic attacks made possible by advances in quantum computing and complex
protocol interactions on the Internet. The focus of this project lies in the
design and analysis of new cryptographic protocols that address these new
attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is centered around two goals: (1) to
develop cryptosystems from large classes of intractability assumptions as viable
alternatives to the widely-used factorization-based cryptosystems; (2) to obtain
new techniques and efficient protocols secure against coordinated attacks amidst
concurrent protocol executions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected
to develop ideas and techniques which hold the potential to bridge the gap
between theory and practice in cryptography, and to fundamentally change the way
we communicate, compute and collaborate. To ensure broader impact of this
research, this project also encompasses a program of educational and outreach
activities, including curriculum development (with an emphasis on new
pedagogical approaches) as well as collaboration and regular exchanges with
research institutions in the New York area and abroad.
