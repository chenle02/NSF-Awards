This project will support the participation of mathematical scientists from the
United States at a conference on the Mathematics of Computation to be held
August 9-13, 1993 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Survey and state-of-
the-art lectures will be given in plenary sessions, as well as contributed paper
sessions on such topics as the numerical solution of partial differential
equations, numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, numerical
solution of integral equations, numerical quadrature and cubature, special
functions, numerical linear algebra, numerical solution of nonlinear equations
and optimization, and computational number theory. This conference is being held
in conjunction with the Joint Summer Meetings of the American Mathematical
Society, Mathematical Association of America, and Canadian Mathematical Society.
