Mr. Scott Zona, under the supervision of Dr. Sherwin Carlquist of the Rancho
Santa Ana Botanic Garden, will undertake extensive field-collecting of Sabal
palms throughout Mexico and the West Indies, to determine patterns of
morphological and chemical variability among the species and construct an
hypothe- sis about the evolutionary history of the group. Difficulties in
collecting large palms have deterred most botanists from studying them. Modern
taxonomic methods, applied to newly collected field materials, will improve
substantially our understanding of the biology and evolution of these plants.
New characters will be assessed with modern techniques of scanning electron
microscopy of leaf surfaces and pollen, anatomical investigation of leaf
structure, and chemical analysis of plant pigments. Observations will be made of
seed dispersal (whether by animals or by water currents) and of pollination
(whether by palm-specific insects, by generalist insects, or by wind). Improved
taxonomic understanding of the ca. 21 species in this genus will facilitate
analysis of evolutionary relationships and of the biogeographic history of
speciation in the Caribbean region.
