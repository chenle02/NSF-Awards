In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, R. Bruce Weisman
of Rice University will use laser pump-probe techniques to investigate the rates
at which triplet excited states of molecules undergo vibrational energy
relaxation and redistribution, electronic energy transfer, and reaction. Systems
to be studied include triplet pyrazine and methylpyrazine using the rare gases,
CO, methane, ethane, water, and benzene as relaxers. These relaxers span a range
of mass, polarizability, and polarity, and will provide information to help
clarify mechanistic differences between triplet and ground state relaxation.
Further studies include the triplet decay mechanisms and kinetics of fullerenes
in various solvents and in aqueous micelles. The fullerenes have been shown to
produce triplet excimers, and these studies will determine the equilibrium
constant for excimer formation and its variation with solvent and temperature.
Due to their unpaired electron spins, triplet state molecules often exhibit
rates of reaction and relaxation which are entirely different from those of the
ground electronic state. Professor Weisman's studies will enhance our
understanding of these important chemical differences and will clarify the
mechanisms involved in excimer formation and vibrational energy redistribution
and relaxation.
