AST 0206299&lt;br/&gt;Cen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The formation and evolution of
cosmic structures, including galaxies, clusters of galaxies and large-scale
structure, are fundamental problems of modern cosmology. While the Big Bang
picture of how the Universe began is generally accepted, the details of how and
when structures developed and formed are in hot debate. On scales larger than
clusters of galaxies (&gt;10 million light years across) it is generally
believed that gravity is the dominant force and structures grow from small
initial seeds planted in the very early universe (&lt;&lt; 1 second since the
Big Bang), because gravity is attractive and unstable. However, on smaller
scales gas hydrodynamics, microphysics (i.e., forces on atomic scales) and star
formation processes play progressively more important roles in shaping and
determining when galaxies form and how they evolve; the picture at these smaller
scales is much less clear. The radiation field, especially, the ultra-violet
radiation that is capable of ionizing atomic hydrogen must play a very important
role in these processes. In particular, it determines when atomic hydrogen is
fully ionized and the universe is cleared of hydrogen "fog" and becomes
transparent to distant sources. This epoch has been characterized as the "end of
the dark ages". Since radiation controls the evolution of the thermodynamic
state of the gas, a fraction of which is subsequently incorporated into stars,
it is essential to include radiation hydrodynamics in full detail in
cosmological computer simulations in order to provide answers to many of the
important questions in modern cosmology. This is a formidable task to tackle
even with the fastest supercomputers today. Dr. Cen and his collaborators have
developed an efficient way to compute this complicated situation and begun to
carry out a program that should help provide some clues about how the radiation
field and the matter evolve with time.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
