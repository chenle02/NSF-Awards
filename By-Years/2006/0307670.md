AST 0307670&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the
Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA), the only university-based solar dedicated radio
imaging array, through operations support, partial support for the personnel on
the site at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (Big Pine, CA), and partial support
for graduate student and post-doctoral research with the data. As the only
solar-dedicated radio instrument in the United States, continued operation of
the instrument, through its unique combination of imaging and spectral coverage,
provides quantitative physical measurements of solar particles and magnetic
fields in thousands of solar flares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
OVSA instrument represents irreplaceable infrastructure for research and
education. The OVSA data provide research projects for undergraduate and
graduate students at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, an urban school, in
Newark, NJ, and the students working with the data come from a diverse group.
The OVSA facilities provide a testbed for prototyping of antennas, feeds, and
signal transmission systems for the new Frequency Agile Solar Radio telescope,
highly ranked by two national decadal surveys, conceived to be a national
facility, and the world's premiere solar instrument for the next two decades.
The OVSA data are available through a web interface to scientists worldwide to
add to their studies of the Sun and solar activity. Solar activity can have a
direct impact on society through its effects on satellite and communication
systems, among others. Results from OVSA are used to bring the excitement of
this research to school and community groups, through involvement with the
Newark Museum, the Newark Discovery Charter School, and Project Astro NOVA in
New Jersey. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
