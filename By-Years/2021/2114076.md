The recently released "A Strategic Vision for Americaâ€™s Quantum Networks" driven
by the National Quantum Initiative Act addressed the importance of quantum
networks on future communication security and computing advancement. Quantum
networks supplement traditional networks, e.g., the Internet, and enable
important applications such as secure key distribution, clock synchronization,
secure remote computation, and distributed consensus, most of which cannot be
easily and efficiently achieved by the classical Internet. This project focuses
on a fundamental network service for quantum networks, namely quantum
entanglement routing. If successful, the research outcomes of this project will
be transformative as they will provide critical networking services and tasks
such as secure communication and time synchronization, which in turn, will
enable emerging and future services including IoT, edge computing, and their
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address quantum entanglement routing,
this project will develop quantum network models that are consistent with
results from experimental physics, while applying computer network design
techniques and research methodologies to quantum networks. The proposed models
will account for practical considerations from network protocol design, such as
arbitrary network topologies, multiple concurrent sources and destinations that
compete for resources, fidelity and purification, limited capacity at each node,
as well as the fact that nodes only know localized short-lived link-state
information. As such, the expected contributions of the proposed research are as
follows: 1) Exploration of different routing metrics; 2) Development of offline
and online contention-free routing protocols; 3) Design of efficient topologies
for quantum networking; 4) Evaluation of the proposed algorithms using
analytical models as well as a custom simulator; and 5) Implementation of the
proposed protocols with real quantum devices. The network models, algorithms,
protocols, and experimental tools developed in this project will be made
available to the networking research community to help jump-start research
efforts on quantum networks, e.g., exploring ink layer and transport layer
services. The project will leverage the visibility and timeliness of quantum
computing and quantum networking to recruit first-generation students as well as
students from under-represented populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
