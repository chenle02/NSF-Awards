ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ignace, Richard&lt;br/&gt;"Probing Circumstellar
Envelopes with Gravitational
Microlensing"&lt;br/&gt;AST-9986915&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project a
theoretical basis and observational methodology will be developed for
interpreting stellar gravitational microlensing events that are discovered in
the course of ongoing monitoring campaigns. Such events in principle can be used
to 'gravitationally image' otherwise unresolvable stellar photospheric and
circumstellar structures when an invisible but massive object passes between the
observer and a background star. Current microlensing techniques are useful only
by assuming normal symmetrical stellar photospheres. The PIs will extend the
technique to include microlensing events that involve red giant stars. The
latter have highly asymmetrical atmospheric structure, winds, and variations in
envelope size, velocity and density. The technique developed also may be useful
in categorizing lensing events in the nuclei of other nearby normal galaxies
such as M31 and active galactic nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project was
provided by the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics
(AST/SAA).&lt;br/&gt;
