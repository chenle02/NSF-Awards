*** 9725038 Golden This project is an application of percolation theory, a well-
developed mathematical concept based on the study of fluid and gaseous flow in
porous media, to the study of sea ice where interstitial brine pockets affect
the transport of salt, and heat, as well as nutrients and biomass. At low
temperatures and low brine concentrations, brine pockets are separated, and sea
ice is essentially impermeable, but above a critical brine volume fraction of
about 5 percent, brine inclusions become connected on a macroscopic scale,
allowing the circulation or percolation of sea water and the diffusion of sea
water properties. The transition at the critical brine volume fraction plays an
important role in air-sea-ice interactions, in the evolution of the sea ice
microstructure, and in the life cycles of biological communities inhabiting the
ice. Percolation theory, which was developed specifically to model flow in
materials where connectedness becomes important, is a powerful technique for
studying why the critical volume fraction is 5 percent, whether this is
dependent on the specific ice type, what determines the spacing and geometry of
brine tubes, how the transition affects the electromagnetic characteristics of
sea ice, and other transition properties of sea ice. The application of the
theory will also allow the development of a predictive capability for the
response of sea ice in the electromagnetic spectrum, which is particularly
important in the remote sensing of sea ice with satellite-based synthetic
aperture radars. In more general terms, it is an intriguing cross-fertilization
of ideas from mathematics to the geosciences. ***
