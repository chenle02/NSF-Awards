This is a proposal that continues the principal investigator's efforts to
construct accurate numerical solutions of two problems in radiative transfer
theory: the searchlight problem for an obliquely incident beam and a general
nonhomogeneous problem that describes internal emission. The basic numerical
method is the so-called FN-method, and there is genuine hope that the research
on its application to the above two problems will lead to robust numerical
methods for more general nonhomogeneous linear transport models. One of the many
important problems that modern technology has created is involved with the
transmission of light waves and radio waves through the earth's atmosphere. For
example, the shuttle astronauts have to worry about their communication with the
earth because the earth's atmosphere very often interferes with their radio
signals. The same problems arise in satellite communications as well. Rather
than tackle a problem as large as the earth's atmosphere some scientists, like
the principal investigator, study simpler mathematical models for the
transmission of waves through inhomogeneous media like the atmosphere. In this
case the principal investigator will study such problems numerically.
