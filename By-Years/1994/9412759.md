9412759 Dravinski The objective of this project is to obtain the predominant
frequencies of vibration of ground motion in the San Fernando Valley area, and
to compare them with the resonant frequencies of several key structures which
suffered significant damage during the Northridge earthquake of January 17,
1994. This comparison permits the identification of "double resonance". (Double
resonance occurs when the fundamental period of the ground coincides with the
resonant frequency of the structure.) The specific tasks include: (1) the
measurement of long-period microtremor response at highway bridges and
overpasses which suffered severe damage during the earthquake (microtremors are
naturally-occurring ground vibrations), and (2) measurement of long period
microtremor response at seventy sites within the San Fernando Valley with
simultaneous recordings at a reference bedrock site. ***
