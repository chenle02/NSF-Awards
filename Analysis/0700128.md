The study of Ergodic Theory and dynamics of group actions and its interactions
with number theory is an extremely active field of research. The recent
important work of Einsiedler-Katok-Lindenstrass on the Littlewood conjecture in
Diophantine approximation and Tao-Green on primes in arithmetics progressions
offer spectacular instances of the effectiveness of dynamical and ergodic
techniques. The project aims to study number theoretic properties of manifold on
the one hand and develop a new set of tools in the study of dynamical systems on
the other. The problems addressed are at the forefront of research in this
exciting interdisciplinary area. The method used to study the key problems will
involve a combination of creative applications of existing methods and the
development of a new set of tools to address long standing problems.
