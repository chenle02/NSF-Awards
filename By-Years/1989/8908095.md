The purpose of this proposal is to generate funds to purchase a VAX 6210
computer to replace the VAX 750 which currently functions as a central computer
resource within the Medical Center. This central computer provides databank
storage and computing power for nearly all research scientists in the Medical
Center whose work involves molecular biology. Any project that focuses on the
determination of DNA or protein sequences and seeks to relate those sequences to
ones obtained by other laboratories needs to have access to a data bank
containing this information, and the programs to rapidly and reliably exploit
it. The goal of the shared resource is to enhance current services and to
provide new facilities, some under development in the Medical Center. These
resources consist in new databases, tools for the visualization of molecular
structure, and image processing tools employing file and compute service
technologies. Investigators will therefore be able to explore biological
structure at all levels from the molecular to the cellular, an opportunity not
available at present at the Medical Center. The PI and the Co-PIs are currently,
and expect to continue to be major users of the computer system in the future.
They share a commitment to a shared computing resource and are involved in
projects which will enhance its value to the Medical Center community.
