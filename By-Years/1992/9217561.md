This study will use germanium/silicon ratios in marine biogenic silica and
accumulation rates of opal in the Southern Ocean to characterize variations in
Antarctic productivity and in the oceanic silica and germanium cycles over the
Pleistocene and Late Neogene. Over the next year efforts will be directed toward
(1) implementing the Ge-hydride generation method on a new ICP-MS, and
establishing the capability to analyze small volume and mass samples of marine
waters and particulates (pore waters, trap samples, radiolaria); (2) running and
additional set of diatom cultures with two dominant Antartic species, including
the "reverse" dissolution experiment to determine the Ge/Si fractionation
factors for both diatom uptake and dissolution; (3) publishing the lingering
preprints.
