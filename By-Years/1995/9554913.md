The proposal aims to design an integrated two semester general education course
in mathematics and science. The work will involve two more-or-less separate
activities: 1) The revision of a first draft of the mathematical material,
relying on results of pilot testing with undergraduates at William and Mary and
Norfolk State University and with in- service teachers at ten university sites
across the state of Virginia. 2) The construction and piloting of a
physics/engineering portion of the material which will directly reference the
mathematics encountered by students in the first term. The central theme of the
mathematical material is that real engineering data will be used by students who
will be asked to solve problems that directly bear on an intuitive grasp of a
particular physical setting: Powered aircraft flight. This data is freely
available from multiple sources: daily wind data, wind histories, navigation
maps and runway plates, weights and dimensions of commercial aircraft and
current magnetic declination data. Computations involve arithmetic, elementary
algebra, some geometry, some trigonometry, and some use of hand- calculators for
numerical integration. Problems are selected because they are elementary.
Omitted because of mathematical complexity are many problems that would be part
of a standard introduction to aeronautical engineering. The engineering/science
part of this work will ask students to obtain some of these data themselves,
with a view to getting information that is crucial to the proper function of
aircraft. We will also design appropriate experiments to test physical laws that
are important to flight. Our entire aim is to convince non-science students that
they can enhance their grasp of the outside world by means of elementary
calculations and data acquisition.
