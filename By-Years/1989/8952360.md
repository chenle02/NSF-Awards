The atomic absorption spectrometer expands the range of experimental work that
can be expected of the juniors and seniors now using related instrumentation. In
addition, freshmen and sophomores in an Environmental Science course are urged
to use the atomic absorption spectrometer with the expectation that this
increases the number of students choosing science majors. The equipment provides
opportunities for students to use semiautomated techniques and computer-assisted
data analysis as part of their experimental work. The grantee provides funds
that are an equal match for the NSF award.
