The Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr. Ei-ichi Negishi
of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University. Dr. Negishi will continue
his innovative studies on organometallic carbon-carbon bond forming reactions
catalyzed or promoted by transition metal complexes, especially ones involving
zirconium and hafnium. This study includes discovery and development of
synthetically attractive new organometallic reactions and exploration of the
scope and mechanism of funda- mental organometallic reaction patterns. Dr.
Negishi will focus his research in four areas: (1) catalytic reactions of
organozirconium and organohafnium compounds, (2) diastereoselective and
enantioselective reactions of organozirconium and organohafnium compounds, (3)
further exploration of the chemistry of zirconicene and hafnicene derivatives,
and (4) stuctural and mechanistic studies of organozirconium and organohafnium
compounds. In these studies Dr. Negishi will also systematically investigate the
scope of migratory insertion reactions with emphasis on those involving d-block
transition metals.
