This project will provide a thorough magnetostratigraphic study of cores from
sedimentary deposits at three classic hominid cave sites in South Africa
(Makapansgat, Sterkfontein, and Taung). The proposed research should result in
the production of dates for some of these sites. Knowledge of the magnetic
polarity of archaeological deposits is an important factor in developing an
accurate time scale and thus in dating the fossils accurately. The South African
hominid-bearing cave deposits have a very complicated stratigraphy and thus the
temporal placement of these fossils has been difficult to resolve. The
application of this modern technique will be a major contribution to our
understanding of the timing and duration of previous events at these cave sites.
