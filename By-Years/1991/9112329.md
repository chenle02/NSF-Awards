This project is an experimental approach to the investigation of a high
mobility electron gas which involves application of advanced spectroscopic
techniques for high temporal and spatial resolution. Optical methods will be
employed to complement transport measurements and to initiate new directions in
the study of collective and ballistic phenomena, including the presence of a
quantizing magnetic field.
