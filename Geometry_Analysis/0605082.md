The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since
its founding in 1989, a total of 35 times. The conference has become an
extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of
conferences will have six primary sponsoring universities: The University of
Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Rice University, the University of
Houston, Texas Tech University, and Texas Christian University. The conference
is designed to enhance both the educational and the research atmosphere of the
active community of geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding
states. The conference is committed to bring researchers of national and
international stature to discuss their research and to interact with
mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states. Summaries of talks with
notation of important results have been publicly reported for some time and will
continue similarly in the future.

By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci.
First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and
topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet
and share mathematics on a regular basis. This both stimulates individual
research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second,
the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the
mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation,
the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no
registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and
persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply
for support. More information can be found on the conference website:
