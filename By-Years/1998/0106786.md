Title: A Seismic Study of the Taiwan Orogen

This is a seismic study of the Taiwan orogen, an important case of active
collision zone that has been a focus of international research for the last 20
years. Since the devastating Chi-Chi earthquake sequence of 1999, seismicity
increased remarkably in and around Taiwan. Hundreds of large- to moderate-sized
earthquakes have been well recorded by arrays of state-of-the-art instruments,
providing high-resolution data to investigate active arc-continent collision.

We plan to study about 300 earthquakes, including precise determinations of
epicenters, focal depths, fault plane solutions, and seismic moments, in order
to address some key questions in active collision. The young age and fast
convergence of the collision zone are particularly favorable for resolving: 1)
if spatial variations reflect time-progression of collision; and 2) if
reactivation of pre-existing, extensional structures is important in the early
stages of collision. We will focus on these topics and cast our interpretation
in the context of geological and geophysical information gathered from various
sources.

In addition, we will study diffuse deformation to the east of the suture zone,
in the interior of the western Philippine Sea. Recent marine data showed a
surprisingly old age (early Cretaceous) for the colliding edge of the Philippine
Sea. This region, underlain by oceanic lithosphere, is often assumed to be
mechanically strong, thus behaving as the driving edge of the collision. The
proposed work will constrain the thickness of the strongest part of the
colliding oceanic lithosphere, and potentially provide clues to the anomalously
shallow depth of the old sea floor.
