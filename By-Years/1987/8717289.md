This award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in a seminar on
"Diagnostic Ultrasound of the Prostate and Bladder," organized jointly by Drs.
Martin Resnick of Case Western Reserve University and Hiroki Watanabe of the
Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan. Participants from the
United States and Japan will meet in Washington, D.C. during October 1988. The
seminar will provide a forum for the exchange of data and ideas in the rapidly
advancing field of diagnostic ultrasound. Discussions will focus on the
application of transrectal and transurethral sonography to the evaluation and
management of patients with diseases of the prostate and bladder. Ultrasound
techniques offer tremendous potential in screening for and staging certain
diseases, such as cancer of the prostate and bladder. This seminar, by bringing
together leaders in urologic ultrasound research from our two countries, will
help to establish common diagnostic criteria and lead to increased cooperative
efforts.
