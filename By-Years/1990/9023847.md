The Archean rock of West Greenland represent some of the best-exposed, best-
studied, oldest rocks known and thus constitute a prime target for crustal
reflection studies. Interpretation of crustal reflection data has attained its
greatest success where "deep" seismic data was correlated with surface geology.
The Archean of West Greenland is thus an excellent geophysical target because of
its exposure and age that allows the study of early crustal processes. This
award supports the interpretation of a recently completed gravity study in the
area and a combined gravity and magnetic investigation. The research is a
cooperative project between Norwegian, Danish, and U.S. scientists. Problems
being addressed by this research include: 1) continuation of the deformation
zone to depth, 2) crustal shortening and mode of deformation, 3) role of
volatiles in the deep crust, 4) change in Moho depth, 5) Archean crustal
development, and 6) nature of deep crust under granulities.
