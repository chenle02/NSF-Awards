This award provides continued support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program for studies of the photophysics of d6 diimine complexes
by Dr. James N. Demas, Chemistry Department, University of Virginia. The overall
goal of the project is to develop rationally designed luminescent molecular
probes for specific molecular sites. He will investigate the effect of the
proximity of a long hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain on the emission properties of
the d6 metal center. He will also study luminescent complexes intercalated into
DNA with special emphasis on identification of fluorescence due to multiple
bonding sites, and the rotational reorientation of the probe while bound to DNA.
In the course of the study, Demas will assess the effectiveness of time resolved
phase sensitive emission in characterizing environmental effects on excited
state properties. Steady-state, pulsed, and phase fluorimetry, as well as NMR
and crystallography, will be used to examine variations in state ordering and
decay paths of luminescent Ru(II), Os(II), Ir(II), and Re(I) photosensitizers.
%%% The electronic structure of luminescent metal complexes is sensitive to
changes in local molecular environment. When such complexes are bound to species
like DNA, their electronic characteristics may be modified by the location or
the symmetry of the site. Conversely, complexes can be designed to detect the
presence of certain sites. In this project, the sensitivity of a new technique
to detect changes in the flouresence of the probe due to its molecular
environment will be tested. In addition, the effect of changes in the
hydrophobic environment on the luminescence of the metal complex will be
investigated. The project has implications for sensor technology and for the
design and application of new probes for the structure and dynamics of DNA and
other chiral biopolymers.
