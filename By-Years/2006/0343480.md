MicroRNAs (miRNAs), single-stranded RNAs of usually 21-25 nucleotides in length
found in diverse eukaryotes, act as sequence-specific regulators of gene
expression during normal growth and development. miRNAs are processed, by an
RNAse III enzyme named Dicer, from longer transcripts that fold into stem-loop
structures with the miRNAs being in the double-stranded regions. In addition to
Dicer, two classes of proteins of unknown molecular functions, Argonaute and
HEN1, have been implicated in miRNA biogenesis. The temporally or spatially
restricted expression of many miRNAs suggests that miRNA biogenesis is tightly
regulated during development. However, little is known about the pathway or the
regulation of miRNA biogenesis. The goal of this research is to dissect the role
of HEN1 in miRNA biogenesis using molecular genetic and biochemical approaches.
In particular, this research will follow clues from previous observations, such
as the accumulation of a potential miRNA precursor in a dicer mutant and the
presence of heterogeneous miRNA species in the hen1-1 mutant to probe the
potential roles of HEN1 in miRNA biogenesis, such as production, stabilization,
or nuclear export of miRNA precursors or miRNAs. This investigation will shed
light on the molecular function of HEN1, a pioneer protein with homologs from
metazoans, in miRNA biogenesis and also provide insights into the poorly
understood miRNA biogenesis process in plants, such as the steps involved to
process the primary transcript to the mature miRNA and the subcellular locations
of the processing steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
