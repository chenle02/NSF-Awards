The research is partitioned into four parts: (1) cryptography; (2)
derandomization; (3) approximation algorithms; and (4) parallel and distributed
algorithms. As described below, there are strong interconnections and themes
that link the work in the different parts. The interaction between randomness
and efficient computation is crucial in all parts. In cryptography, randomness
is crucial for hiding information, and the interaction between randomness and
computational power is the motivating force behind the definition of a pseudo-
random generator. The derandomization part explores the development of general
methods for converting efficient randomized algorithms into efficient
deterministic algorithms, and thus the interplay between randomness and
efficiency is central. The de-randomization part has strong connections with the
parallel algorithms and approximation algorithms parts: some of the algorithms
de-randomized are randomized parallel algorithms, and some are randomized
approximation algorithms. Some of the work in the approximation algorithms part
develops efficient randomized approximation algorithms. The work on the
approximation algorithms is done jointly with the ESPRIT RAND working group.
