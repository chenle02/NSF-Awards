An interinstitutional and interdisciplinary program is undertaken. The program
provides research opportunities to 10 selected undergraduates in the mechanical
engineering, materials, and bioengineering areas. Special features of the
program include research topics that are of fundamental, as well as current
engineering interest including several that have originated through
collaboration between faculty members at the participating institutions. A five
member faculty team from the host institution aided by four from the external
institutions will supervise the project activities. Participants are recruited
from both inside and outside the host institution with special attention given
to attracting qualified minority, handicapped, and female students. Productive
involvement of the participants in the project activities is assured through
extensive and carefully planned orientation and postparticipation activities.
The program terminates with written reports and oral presentations of the
project results by the undergraduate participants.
