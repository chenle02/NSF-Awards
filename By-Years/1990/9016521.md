Drs. Burton Jones, Arnold Klemola, and Robert Hanson at the Lick Observatory,
University of California, Santa Cruz will continue work on the Lick Northern
Proper Motion program. Observations for a major phase of the second epoch in
this program are nearly complete, and the emphasis for the next two years will
be on plate measurements and the preparation of a machine readable form of the
survey. The study of the motions of various classes of stars is fundamental to
an understanding of our Galaxy. Proper motions provide the observational basis
for the study of solar motion, galactic rotation, and velocity dispersions, and
for the statistical determination of stellar distances and luminosities. The
Lick Northern Proper Motion program will meet many of these basic observational
needs by providing absolute proper motions for some 300,000 stars covering the
northern two-thirds of the sky.
