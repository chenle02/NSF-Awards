The objective of this SBIR Phase I research award is to examine the feasibility
of designing and manufacturing equipment which will process advanced resign
discontinuous long fiber composites (1/2 to 2 inches in length) in a controlled
environment. This molding equipment should maintain the fiber length,
orientation, dispersion and wet out, thus improving interlaminar shear strength,
impact resistance and fracture toughness. This goal is to demonstrate that this
machinery will be able to mold recycled resin into a usable quality product when
combined with discontinuous long fiber composites.
