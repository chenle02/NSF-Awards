9725020 Navrotsky Metal oxides, oxyhydroxides and hydroxides, particularly
containing Al, Fe, Mn are important, but complex variables, phases in soils,
aquifers, sediments, hot springs and vents and in low temperature materials
processing. Because of complex polymorphism, incorporation of minor elements,
variable hydration, and small particle size, the separation of thermodynamic and
kinetic factors I the formation and reactivity of these important environmental
minerals is difficult. Using modern synthesis and characterization methods, a
suite of chemically and structurally defined phases will be prepared and their
energetics determined by high temperature reaction calorimetric techniques
unique to the PIs laboratory. The influence of crystal structure, surface area,
oxidation state degree of hydration, and minor element content on energetics
will be explored. The systematics obtained will be a starting point for better
kinetic models of dissolution, precipitation and pollutant transport and for
understanding biologically mediated processing of theses phases. Emphasis will
be on phases in the Mn-O-H, Fe-O-H, Fe-Al-O-H and Co-O-H systems.
