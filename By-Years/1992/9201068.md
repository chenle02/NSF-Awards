This SGER project will use electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and optical
techniques to investigate novel magnetic behavior in one-dimension linear
magnetic chains. A magnetic resonant ion is created in the chains by doping the
chains with diamagnetic species. This S=1/2 species is delocalized in an unknown
fashion over several metal sites in the chain. This delocalization will be
probed by the ENDOR technique. The reslts will be of interest to theoreticians
studying low-dimensional magnetic materials, an area of considerable current
interest in condensed matter physics. Optical techniques will be used to try to
disrupt the chains via excitation of a local diamagnetic metal ion
configuration.
