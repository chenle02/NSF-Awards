This proposal is for the acquisition of a state-of-the art cooled imaging
detector and imaging processing electronics to be interfaced with and existing
spectrometer. This prototype imaging spectrometer will then be checked to
demonstrate its suitability for spectroscopic remote sensing of very low light
level optical signatures of upper atmospheric processes.***//
