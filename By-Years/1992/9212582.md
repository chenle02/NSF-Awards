It is typically quite difficult to predict the properties of injection molded,
fiber-reinforced parts. A major part of the difficulty involves an inability to
accurately predict the orientation of the fibers in the finished part. The
research will provide the scientific basis for predictions of the flow-induced
structure and properties of fiber composites. The project will provide a firm
basis for qualitative engineering judgments about the effects of factors such as
fiber concentration and aspect ratio, mold geometry, filling pressure and fluid
rheology on fiber orientation and composite properties. The results obtained
from the research will guide the development of computer-aided design/computer-
aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software for the processing of fiber composites by
injection and compression molding.
