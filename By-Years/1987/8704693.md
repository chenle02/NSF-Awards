This research is aimed at providing basic data to develop more efficient and
innovative horizontal-tube heat exchanger designs and design methods for the
case when boiling takes place in the shell of the heat exchanger. The special
feature of the data is that it is local, rather than global. The availability of
local data should enable less conservative designs to be employed, thereby
leading to more efficient use of materials, energy, and capital.
