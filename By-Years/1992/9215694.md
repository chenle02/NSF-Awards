9215694 Zamrik A series of multiaxial thermal-mechanical fatigue (TMF) tests
are to be conducted using two structural materials: type 316 stainless steel and
Nickel-base superalloy Waspaloy. The TMF tests will be conducted in continuous
cycling modes and with holds-in- strain/temperature imposed on the continuous
cycling waveforms. The hold-periods are imposed in the TMF loading cycles to
induce time dependent effects such as creep and oxidation. The objective of this
research is to characterize the mechanical and micromechanical TMF responses of
these two materials under multiaxial isothermal fatigue and creep-fatigue
responses of these two structural materials from available data. Extensive
microstructural evaluations of the fracture and failure processes of these two
materials will be conducted in order to develop a physical-based universal life
prediction concept. A universal multiaxial fatigue life prediction concept
developed for the isothermal case will be applied to the multiaxial TMF data
obtained in this research study. ***
