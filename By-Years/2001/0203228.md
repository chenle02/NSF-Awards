This study will provide improved resolution of 3D structure and the first 3D
images of lower crustal/upper mantle structure beneath a slow-spreading ridge.
The results will constrain models of magma plumbing. The project requires some
technique development to best combine the wide-angle reflection and refraction
data, and will provide insights into the 3D nature of the ridge thermal
structure, the existence of any deep crustal or mantle magma reservoirs, the
variability in magma supply along the ridge, and the importance of along-axis
transport of magma at deep versus shallow levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
