Terman The investigator studies large networks of relaxation-type oscillators
with coupling that mimics chemical synapses. These lead to large systems of
differential equations that include numerous physical parameters as well as
multiple time scales. The models typically display an incredibly rich structure
of dynamic behavior; this depends in a highly nontrivial way on the various
parameters. The investigator systematically studies what sorts of collective
behavior are possible in a given network, determines the mathematical mechanisms
responsible for this rich oscillatory behavior, classifies the sorts of
bifurcations that can take place as parameters in the models are varied, and
determines the physical consequences of the underlying mathematical structures.
The types of networks considered in this project arise in numerous applications.
These include several areas of the nervous system, respiration, movement,
secretion, and models for scene segmentation. The project examines models for
bursting oscillations in pancreatic beta cells. These cells are responsible for
the secretion of insulin. It also analyzes models for oscillations in various
parts of the nervous system, including the hippocampus and the thalamus. The
investigator also continues a study of scene segmentation and other aspects of
visual processing. This work contributes to fundamental understanding of
pancreatic functions and a variety of neurophysiological questions.
