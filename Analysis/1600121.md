This award provides funding for the "Midwest Several Complex Variables
Conference," to be held at the University of Toledo from May 13 to May 15, 2016.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of several complex variables, Cauchy-Riemann geometry, d-bar theory, and
other related topics. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to
attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers,
researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded
by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
through a number of different activities. More information will be made
