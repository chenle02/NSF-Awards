Engineering-Engineering Technology (58) The project is increasing the supply of
engineering technicians and technologists through educational opportunities at a
small, rural community college. The University of Dayton and Edison State
Community College faculty are aligning administrative functions and curriculum
in order to create a degree of integration that will permit the continued
delivery of technology leading to a baccalaureate program for rural students in
a cost-effective manner. The project is building upon the distance-learning
program at the University of Dayton, which is currently offered at the Edison
campus.

Specific activities include: 1. Developing a joint marketing plan targeting Tech
Prep students and women. 2. Leveraging existing marketing strengths at each
institution in order to aid each other. 3. Training Edison faculty to assist
Edison-based University of Dayton students on advising issues. 4. Establishing
cross-enrollment policies and a "bureaucracy-free" experience for students in
terms of fee payments, book purchases, financial aid, etc. 5. Coordinating
scheduling of courses to eliminate duplication of courses and times between
University of Dayton and Edison and to increase the number of options available
to students. 6. Identifying curricular niches that require special faculty
expertise and/or lab equipment. Once labeled as a curricular niche at one
institution, the other institution is not attempting to develop or offer those
courses and is enrolling its students at the other college. 7. Publishing an
integrated partnerships handbook. 8. Updating existing articulation agreement to
achieve 95 percent transfer efficiency for Edison students transferring to
University of Dayton and to implement an outcomes-based model.
