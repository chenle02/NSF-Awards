The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project between Dr. Gabor
Speier of the University of Veszprem and Dr. Cortlandt Pierpont of the
University of Colorado is to examine the fundamental steps involved in the
copper- catalyzed oxidation processes that occur in both synthetic and
biological systems. Work will focus on intramolecular copper-quinone electron
transfer, molecular oxygen coordination and activation of the reduced copper
center, and stoichiometric and catalytic substrate oxidation. Funds for the
project are awarded through the US-Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest, in accordance
with established guidelines.
