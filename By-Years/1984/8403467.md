This research entails a basic study in natural convection; specifically,
attention will be focused on heat transfer in gases between isothermal
concentric cylinders maintained at cryogenic temperatures. Of special interest
are the validity of the Bousinesq approximation, which is commonly used in
natural convection studies, and the effects of fluid property variations.
