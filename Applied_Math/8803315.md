The general objective of this project is to study variational problems
associated with phase transitions in the context of continuum theory, using as
theoretical tools Continuum Mechanics (specifically Thermoelasticity) and the
Calculus of Variations. The topics under consideration include: the study of
macroscopic properties which depend on the particular microstructure of a
configuration; determination of symmetry invariances and constitutive relations
appropriate to interfacial energies for solid crystals; the study of
minimization problems for the total energy functional obtained by the inclusion
of surface terms; to give a detailed description of the phase boundaries
observed in twinned crystals and to protect the relative proportions of
different phases; the study of surfaces endowed with an intrinsic thermodynamic
structure and thermostatics of phase equilibria; the effect of light
polarization; dynamical aspects, such as the determination of the speed of
propagation of the interfacial surface at the critical temperature and the heat
generated during this propagation.
