This research is to utilize digitized core phases PKP generated by earthquakes
to study the inner core where some evidence of anisotropy has been found, and
the core-mantle boundary where heterogeneity is known but poorly resolved. Data
are extracted from CD-ROMS distributed by the National Earthquake Information
Center and from the IRIS data center. In order to remove effects of mantle
hetereogeneities and earthquake source mislocations, the research will utilize
differential measurements between phases with similar paths in the mantle. Both
amplitudes and times will be used to analyze inner core structure along the
earth's spin axis. The results will be used to constrain theories of anisotropy
and heterogeneity in the inner core and core-mantle boundary regions.
