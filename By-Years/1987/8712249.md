This award will place into operation a portable two-star photometry system with
which to conduct an observational research program. An important objective of
this research is to search for close-binary nuclei of planetary nebulae and
obtain some of the properties of those discovered. The results will be a
determination of the fraction of central stars that are close binaries, the
importance of binary star processes in the production of planetary nebulae, and
the discovery of star systems which will lead to the establishment of an
evolutionary sequence linking the wide binaries (periods 1-10 years) to the
cataclysmic variables (periods less than several hours). An important aspect of
this program will be the direct involvement of undergraduate students in all
phases of the research from implementation of one instrument through observation
and analysis of results.
