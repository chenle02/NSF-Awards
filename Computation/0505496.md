The investigator works on three projects: 1) Mechanical properties of
composites and polycrystals. New reliable analytical and numerical methods are
developed to predict the strength of a wide range of heterogeneous solids. In
addition, detailed results on idealized models are obtained. These serve to gain
understanding of real materials and to test existing methods in regimes where
their accuracy is uncertain. 2) Solute transport in porous media. New efficient
mathematical models are developed and studied. Because this project is relevant
to the understanding of the transport of contaminants in soils and the transport
of nutrients in bones, the range of potential applications of the results of
this project is wide. 3) Small particles migration and clogging. Laboratory
experiments that capture the physical mechanisms involved in particles migration
and clogging are studied and mathematically modeled. The goal is to improve the
current understanding of the physical phenomena that lead to clogging, to
provide guidelines for improved methodologies to pump petroleum and water. The
phenomena to be studied are also relevant in other contexts including sand
filters in water treatment, food grain, pharmaceuticals, bio-mechanical systems
(lungs, kidneys, etc.) and filters. The projects are of related nature. In all
cases, the macroscopic physical phenomena depend on the microgeometry of the
materials. Accordingly, a key component to their study is to identify the
relevant different length and time scales to formally obtain or construct the
mathematical models.

Guidelines that mathematical analysis can provide in the understanding of
properties of heterogeneous materials is of great benefit to society. The
current availability of computational power and the maturity that applied
mathematics has reached make mathematical modeling and numerical simulation
powerful tools. The investigator believes that important discoveries are likely
to result from interdisciplinary work; accordingly, he collaborates and
interacts with researchers in other disciplines. Potential applications of the
project include new guidelines on the disposal of contaminants, the design of
improved methodologies to treat osteoporosis and related diseases, a better
understanding of the processes that lead to loss of bone experienced in the
absence of gravity (during space flights), and improve methodologies for bone
implants. The objective of the educational activities is to create
interdisciplinary learning and research experiences for students, with
mathematics being a central component. To accomplish that goal, a seminar in
interdisciplinary mathematics is developed.
