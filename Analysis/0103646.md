The proposal outlines a program of exploring different aspects of low
dimensional dynamics: combinatorial and geometric issues of holomorphic
dynamics, its interplay with one-dimensional real dynamics (particularly in the
rigidity and renormalization theories), interaction with three dimensional
hyperbolic geometry and the theory of foliations, analytic and geometric aspects
of two dimensional complex and real dynamics.

The dynamical systems theory studies the evolution of various systems arising in
physics, biology, engineering etc., as well as simplified mathematical models
for those systems. It has been realized in the past 25 years that even one- or
two- dimensional models can exhibit rich and important phenomena. It has been
also realized that the methods of complex analysis provide powerful tools for
dealing with these systems. The proposal intends to explore further this branch
of dynamics.
