Biological image informatics is an emerging frontier in computational biology,
as there is an urgent need to move beyond the manual inspection of images to
computational analysis for accelerating scientific discoveries. Conventional
methods commonly employ shallow machine learning models in which handcrafted
image representations are computed and used in model construction. These
approaches heavily rely on prior knowledge on the data and problems to compute
appropriate image representations. Motivated by the recent success of deep
learning methods in image-related domains, the objective of this project is to
develop advanced deep learning models for automated representation learning from
biological images. This project also facilitates the development of new courses
and laboratory infrastructure for attracting graduate, undergraduate, and high
school students, with an emphasis on those from underrepresented groups.

Specifically, this project focuses on the analysis of spatiotemporal gene
expression pattern images in fruit fly and mouse. The key challenges lie in how
to capture the intrinsic structures of biological problems and how to enable
effective model training on small, manually labeled biological data sets. This
project develops multi-instance, multi-task, hierarchical, and regularized deep
learning models for incorporating the structures of biological problems. The
multi-instance and multi-task models capture the complex relationships among
inputs and outputs, respectively. The hierarchical and regularized models
explicitly encode problem structures and make the results interpretable. In
addition, transfer and unsupervised learning methods are developed to enable
effective model training on small labeled data sets. These are achieved by
integrating both labeled and unlabeled data sets across multiple domains.
Altogether, this project is expected to result in a set of advanced deep
learning methods for the efficient and effective analysis of biological images.
