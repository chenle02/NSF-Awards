The Department of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering at Norfolk State
University is acquiring microcomputers, data- acquisition peripherals and
software, and computation and simulation software to upgrade laboratory
instruction in three programs. Simulation and modeling software permits students
to study experiments too hazardous or expensive to actually run in a laboratory.
Additionally, simulation software permits training of students in the operation
of laboratory instruments, thereby improving their skill level and their
understanding of the principles of instrument design.Software and data-
acquisition devices are identified for application in Organic Chemistry, Honors
General Chemistry, Biochemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry,
undergraduate research projects, physics courses, and electronic engineering
courses.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non- federal sources.
