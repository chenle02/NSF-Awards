Statistical measures defining microstructures in deforming polycrystalline
materials will be studied. Many properties of polycrystals are linked to
stochastic features of microstructure such as lattice preferred orientation
(LPO) and the morphology and arrangement of grains. An automated analysis of two
and three-point statistical measures of LPO will provide input into rigorous
statistical theories of deformation in polycrystals. A phenomenological study of
strain evolution of two and three-point measures in some single and two-phase
polycrystals will be done. The development of new crystal-plastic theories,
introduced by the author, will be completed.
