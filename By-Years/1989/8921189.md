The principal investigator will study the time-dependent propagation of waves
past obstacles using a numerical scheme that incorporates approximate far-field
boundary conditions derived asymptotically. A straightforward numerical solution
of such problems is usually very difficult because the domain is unbounded. The
research in this proposal should help to remove many of the difficulties
associated with the boundary conditions at infinity. Many problems in nature
involve the flow of liquids and gases past obstacles, think of your car or an
airplane or a boat. One of the difficulties in finding solutions of such
problems stems from the fact that the flow domain is infinite, and so one must
replace the infinite problem with a problem on a finite domain. This is also
tricky, but the present proposal contains a method for choosing the right finite
domain on which to perform numerical calculations.
