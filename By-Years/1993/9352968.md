9352968 Yuen The University of Hawaii-Manoa seeks to initiate a 6-week, summer
residential, Young Scholars program in the agricultural sciences for 26 students
entering grades 11 and 12. The Pacific Region Program (PRP) will select students
from Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, and the Northern Marianas. The
program will consist of four interrelated components: classroom presentations;
field trips; research with mentors; and small group activities. During the
summer students will conduct research projects under the guidance of scientists
and learn how science is used to solve real- world problems. In the follow-up
sessions during the academic year, Hawaii students will communicate with
American Pacific students via PEACESAT, an international satellite communication
network.
