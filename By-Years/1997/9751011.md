Acquisition of a high performance capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument is
permitting this exciting new technique in separation science to be incorporated
into our undergraduate chemistry curriculum through a specially designed set of
experiments. These experiments are having a significant impact on our
Quantitative Analysis and Instrumental Analysis undergraduate laboratories. The
effect of these expedients includes: an introduction of CE principles and
methodologies in both laboratory experiences; the development of experiment
which demonstrate micellar electrokinetic chromatography as a technique for the
separation of neutral molecules in the Instrumental Analysis Laboratory; and a
comparison of capillary gel electrophoresis to traditional slab gel
electrophoresis for the separation of DNA fragments in the Instrumental Analysis
Laboratory. In addition, undergraduate CE research projects are included. *
