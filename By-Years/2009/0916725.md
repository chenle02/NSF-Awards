In the 21st century, the dominant computing platform has shifted to multicore
chips that implement cache-coherent shared memory and run multi-threaded
applications. Unfortunately, these chips do not provide a deterministic model to
either software or hardware developers. Reasoning about and testing for multiple
possible executions is much harder than reasoning about and testing for a single
correct sequential execution, as was possible under the von Neumann model that
dominated in the 20th century. Easing the burden of programming multicore chips
is critical to provide society with the rapid, cost-effective performance gains
that we have all come to expect. Moreover, broad impact requires practical
solutions that do not ask industry to discard or rewrite billions of lines of
existing general-purpose thread-based software.

To this end, research under this proposal will develop solutions for managing
non-determinism with alterative implementation approaches that provide
complementary benefits and opportunities. (1) Work will expand techniques of
recording executions for deterministic replay to improve replay parallelism and
extend the scope of record/replay to hardware debugging and fault-tolerance. (2)
Work will develop and advance a deterministic coherence model that eliminates a
major source of non-determinism in shared-memory multiprocessor systems: memory
races. (3) Work will develop both all-software and hardware-accelerated
implementations of deterministic coherence, in part, through extensions to the
Wisconsin GEMS simulation infrastructure. (4) Finally, work will explore
rebuilding coherence upon a formal deterministic foundation. Broader impacts
will include embodying the proposed work in public software releases (e.g.,
GEMS) as well as dissemination to students and through courses, talks,
industrial affiliates, and commercial influence.
