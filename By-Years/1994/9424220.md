This award supports summer research by undergraduates at the University of
Kentucky College of Medicine. Students pursue research projects of their own
choosing during the 10-week program, which also includes an intensive short
course that covers anatomical, physiological, behavioral and developmental
aspects of modern neuroscience. Other student activities provide a better
understanding of the elements of graduate training and the various career
opportunities in neuroscience.
