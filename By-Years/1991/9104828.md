The geochemistry of the constituent minerals of spinel lherzolites suggests that
the MORB-depleted lithosphere underwent significant enrichment in incompatible
minor and trace elements during Koolau (tholeiitic) and Honolulu (alkalic)
magmatic activity. An investigation into the enrichment processes has led to the
development of the present 1 year proposal designed to explore the nature,
chemical composition, and origin of isolated crystal-laden glass pockets, some
of which may have activity provided the elements in which these xenoliths have
been enriched. Extensive electron microprobe analysis (major and minor elements)
and preliminary ion microprobe analysis (REES) of the phases in these pockets
will be performed in this project. The results will allow evaluation of the
various models concerned with origins of the various types of glasses found.
