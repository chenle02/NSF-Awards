Constrained optimization problems permeate much of applied mathematics,
engineering and the sciences ranging from linear and nonlinear programming,
calculus of variations and optimal control to variational formulations of
parameter identification and inverse problems, ill-posed problems, and continuum
mechanics. The primary objective of this research program is the development of
a new class of robust and very fast algorithms for the solution of these
problems. These algorithms are based on the use of fast numerical continuation
techniques to follow smooth penalty paths to optimality. The key to the
development of these algorithms is an expanded Lagrangian system of equations
which contains the penalty path as a solution, is a perturbation of the first
order necessary conditions, and sometimes, but not always, provides a basis for
finding multiple optima. The problem formulation and continuation methodology
provide a natural framework for the development and application of Tikhonov
regularization techniques to the solution of sensitive, ill- conditioned, or
ill-constrained optimization problems arising from model error or uncertainty
and for the investigation of the parametric optimization problem. Also, in this
setting the traditional ill-conditioning associated with a sequential
optimization algorithm is removed for three smooth penalty functions: the
quadratic penalty function for equality constraints and the logarithmic barrier
and quadratic loss function for inequality constraints. In linear programming
one of the problem formulations and correspondence algorithms is very similar to
the Karmarkar algorithm with similar expectations in speed; however, these fast
continuation-penalty path algorithms are also applicable to the aforementioned
constrained optimization problems with similar expectations in speed. Research
of this type aims at developing new computer software for optimization of
functions of many variables with constraints in the most efficient and robust
way. Software of this type has a large number of potential applications, ranging
from management of resources to airline scheduling and machine design.
