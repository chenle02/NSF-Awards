The Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory of the University of Massachusetts and
the University of Oklahoma will collaborate to investigate tornadoes. UMass
graduate students will install a 95 GHz polarimetric radar in a chase van and
operate the system during field measurements with researchers of the University
of Oklahoma's School of Meteorology. This will present an opportunity to obtain
the best spatial resolution of a tornado's radar reflectivity and wind fields
ever achieved. The use of polarimetric millimeter wave radars for this
application is untested, and engineers and meteorologists will research jointly.
