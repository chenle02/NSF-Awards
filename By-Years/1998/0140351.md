This project is a continuation of work in progress to measure, using laser
spectroscopy, magnetic dipole transition wavelengths within the ground terms of
selected multiply-charged ions. The basic goals of the research are
determination of the g-factor of an electron in a bound state of a highly
charged ion, and precision laser measurement of the hyperfine structure of a
high-Z one-electron ion. Immediate goals are fine-structure measurements on
intermediate-Z ions, using a laser beam to induce the transitions in ions
condensed to an ordered state at low temperature in a Penning ion trap. The
research is done in collaboration with scientists from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Theoretical
support is provided through a collaboration with an atomic structure theorist at
the University of Texas, Pan American, an undergraduate institution.
