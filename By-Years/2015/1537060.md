Big data analytics are used to explore vast quantities of transactional data,
such as customer purchase histories, medical records, or cell phone usage, to
discover anticipated and unanticipated relationships that are useful for
prediction and understanding. Dynamic stochastic simulations are used by
engineers and management scientists to design and improve industrial, service
and financial systems that are subject to risk. Simulations also generate large
quantities of synthetic transactional data, but current practice is to first
distill these data into high-level summary performance measures, and then to
discard it, making it difficult to evaluate risk or predict actual system
behavior. The success of data analytics in business and industry will lead
simulation users to expect the same sort of fine-grained analysis from their
simulations, and if they cannot obtain it they may conclude that simulation is
irrelevant. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)
research project will provide a foundation and proof-of-concept first steps
toward a data analytics treatment of dynamic, stochastic simulation, by
considering simulation as data analytics for systems that do not yet exist. The
result will be better and more robust system design and control decisions for
business and industry. Collaboration with industrial partner SAS Institute will
insure that the research is broadly relevant and the results are
implemented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three core topics are planned: simulation
analytics as a precursor to system control, simulation analytics for
comprehensive comparisons of system designs, and simulation analytics via
dynamic metamodels. The focus is on a post-simulation analysis that is
facilitated by retaining the simulated sample paths, sample paths that may have
been generated by a simulation experiment designed to achieve a specific narrow
objective such as system optimization. New visualization and statistical
analysis methods will be created to allow simulation users to solve the kinds of
problems that data scientists routinely address, but in the simulation context
where the data are dynamic, time-dependent sample paths, rather than customer
instances. This will require new statistical methods for both supervised and
unsupervised learning. Problems that do not typically arise in field data
analytics, like the comparison of alternative system designs that are exposed to
the same source of simulated uncertainty, will also be addressed.
