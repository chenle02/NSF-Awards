The objective of this research is to develop an automated CAD system for the
structural design and analysis of aerospace members. The system will allow
complex assemblies to be synthesized from standard parts libraries in a
tinkertoy assembly fashion. The system will be able to automatically generate
the finite element model of major structural assemblies from the design part
definition database. It will map the finite element solution results from the
idealized stick/panel idealization to the actual members. The system will
automatically perform design checks based on the member's form features and on
the applicable functional and structural sizing rules. Violations of design
rules will be automatically detected and a goal-seeking control strategy will be
used to make the necessary changes for compliance.
