During the period June 13-16, 2016, Harvard University will host a conference in
pure mathematics on the theme of L-functions and Arithmetic. The purpose of the
conference is to gather together leading experts and young researchers to
discuss recent developments on the connections between analytic and algebraic
aspects of number theory and arithmetic geometry. Such research has applications
to cyber security, through cryptography, and to some aspects of coding theory. A
significant portion of NSF funding will be used to fund the travel and housing
of junior participants (e.g. graduate students and postdocs).

Over the four days of the conference there will be seventeen lectures by experts
in number theory and arithmetic geometry. The conference program will focus on
recent developments in (commutative and noncommutative) Iwasawa theory; the
construction of new Euler systems for Galois representations; Stark's conjecture
and the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture; p-adic interpolation of modular
forms, Selmer groups, and L-values; and recent breakthroughs in the study of
average behaviors of class groups, Selmer groups, and Mordell-Weil groups.
