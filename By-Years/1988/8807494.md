Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that uses
absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. The acquisition of
an FTIR spectrophotometer is crucial for enhancing the research environment of
the modern chemistry department. The Department of Chemistry of the University
of Wisconsin, Madison will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help acquire an FTIR spectrophotometer that will
enhance research in three areas of chemistry which include the following: 1)
Mechanistic organometallic chemistry 2) Luminescent properties of derivatized
semiconductors 3) Synthetic organosilicon chemistry
