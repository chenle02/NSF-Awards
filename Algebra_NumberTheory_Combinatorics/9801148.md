Initially, one considers a reductive, complex Lie algebra g with adjoint group
G, Cartan subalgebra h and Weyl group W. In this case, Professors Levasseur and
Stafford have shown that the Harish-Chandra homomorphism from G-invariant
differential operators on g to W-invariant differential operators on h is
surjective with kernel generated by tau(g), where tau denotes the differential
of of the adjoint action of G on g. This has numerous applications to the theory
of invariant eigendistributions, to the representation theory of g and to
generalizations of the Springer correspondence. Generalizations of these results
and their applications to the G-invariant differential operators for more
general G-representations V will be studied. In particular, Professor Stafford
intends to study the invariant differential operators on G and on symmetric
spaces. These results are also related to longstanding questions about the
commuting variety of g (for example, whether it is normal), which Professor
Stafford will investigate further.

Professor Stafford works in the general area of algebra, specifically in the
study of algebras for which multiplication is not commutative. Such algebras
arise in many areas of mathematics and science; for example, in the theory of
quantum groups (which, ultimately, come from quantum physics), and in the theory
of differential equations. The techniques of ``noncommutative Noetherian
algebra'' can be applied to study questions in these diverse areas.
