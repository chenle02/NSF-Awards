9352312 Palettas The Statistics Focus Group, sponsored by the Mathematical
Association of America's Curriculum Action Project, has recently raised two very
important issues concerning undergraduate statistics education. First,
traditional lecturing is proving ineffective to convey the basic concepts from
probability and statistics. Second, dogmatic teaching of older theoretical
frames becomes increasingly less relevant as the advancement in power and
sophistication of modern computing leads to fundamental changes in statistical
practice. This project is developing a novel mode of instruction which is
addressing both of the above concerns. Specifically, the project is fostering
active learning by means of laboratory instruction which employs calculation and
plotting as means for exploration and learning. At the same time, the project is
enriching the scientific content of undergraduate statistics curricula with
respect to advances in statistical/mathematical computing and state-of-the-art
computer intensive statistical methodology. In summary, Virginia Tech is
developing a foundational course to set up the framework to promote the use of
structured, partially supervised laboratory instruction. For that purpose, the
course is designed to provide the students with a broad introduction to
numerical, graphical and symbolic computation, which will be the tools employed
by laboratory instruction, as well as with guidance and direction to help them
develop the skills which is promoting active learning via the use of calculation
and plotting. The laboratories being developed under this project are initiating
the change from lecturing to laboratory-instruction along the lines described
above. The project is tailored to the needs of the Statistics Majors Program at
Virginia Tech, but it is an innovative pilot project with high potential to
provide national models of continuing impact. ***
