Utah State University will conduct CEDAR research at the Hardware Ranch
Observatory (HRO), mid-latitude facility for the study of the upper atmosphere.
HRO consists of two sites -- Hardware Ranch and Bear Lake -- that are located in
the Wasatch Mountain Range 25 and 38 miles, respectively from the university.
Both sites are well situated for optical and radio observations and are very
accessible to researchers and students.***//
