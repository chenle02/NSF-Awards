Haken will develop an improved version of the theory of normal-surfaces, making
use of his recently proved splitting theorem and the polynomially bounded time
demand of the Whitehead-Zieschang algorithms for simplifying meridian systems in
handlebodies. This is expected to yield fast algorithms for determining
distinguished cell-partitions for all those compact 3-manifolds whose first
Betti number is greater than zero and which are known to be irreducible. In
particular, it is expected to yield a fast algorithm of which it can be proved
that it recognizes every trivial knot which is given in an arbitrary ambient
3-manifold. He will also continue his search for interesting examples of
Heegaard diagrams of 3-manifolds.
