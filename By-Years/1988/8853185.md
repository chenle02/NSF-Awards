This project permits students to study issues of parallel computation and
parallel processing in a flexible, reconfigurable laboratory. As parallel
processing becomes increasingly important in computing, students of computer
science need to be exposed to facilities that will allow them to explore, in
depth, the concepts and limitations of different parallel computational models.
The parallel computation laboratory that supports this project is equipped with
six (6) parallel processing machines. Each machines contains eight (8)
processors which may be connected in a variety of ways including a ring, a
pipeline, shuffle-exchange and hypercube. The six parallel machines are
connected to one network server allowing the 48 processors to be integrated as
one large "supercomputer". Student access to the parallel equipment
configuration is via six high efficiency wokstations suitable for parallel-
program development and debugging. By being exposed to different parallel
computer configurations, students in this project are prepared for an area of
computing that is becoming increasingly important both as a practical and
research topic. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
