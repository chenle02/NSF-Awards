9308728 Finn Should construction progress according to schedule, the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO) detector will make its
first observations in the late 1990s. Consequently, there is an urgent need for
accurate and complete appraisals of sources of gravitational radiation to 1.
Guide the design of the advanced LIGO X instrumentation, ! 2. Provide the
foundation for the analysis and X interpretation of the forth coming
observations and ! 3. Suggest directions for the initial investigations of X
gravitational wave astronomy. ! In order to be useful, these appraisals must
take into account the precise nature of the LIGO detector and our best
understanding of the anticipated radiation sources. With this motivation and
goal, Prof. Finn will initiate a program of research to provide detailed
assessments of astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation appropriate for
modern interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The sources considered will
include inspiralling binary neutron star/black hole systems, freely precessing
pulsars, and non axisymmetric (rotating, but not precessing) pulsars. ***
