Hidden from view by the human eye are literally millions of microscopic
organisms that are essential for maintaining the health and integrity of all
ecosystems. Indeed, the roles microbes play in basic functions such as
photosynthesis, energy flow and nutrient recycling are necessary for maintaining
life on Earth. Irrespective of their overwhelming importance in the biosphere,
microbes remain poorly understood. Because little is known about the true number
of microbes and their genetic diversity, it is especially troubling to realize
that taxonomic expertise in this group is declining worldwide. This project is
developing an innovative, fun-to-use, and highly informative computerized guide
for use in introductory courses that will ignite interest and understanding of
microscopic biodiversity, and help attract young people to careers in the study
of microbes. The project is focusing on the algae, a diverse array of colorful
and fascinating organisms that catch the imagination of students. Each year in
introductory courses throughout the country literally hundreds of students are
asked to use a dichotomous key to identify algae supplied by commercial venders.
Often, due to insufficient illustrations and the unforgiving nature of
dichotomous keys, students leave these laboratory sessions frustrated. We are
developing a highly illustrative key to be used with cultures from commercial
suppliers that is fundamentally different from standard dichotomous keys in
being nonhierarchical in design and inherently easier to use. Because the key is
being widely distributed over the web it can potentially be used by thousands of
students.
