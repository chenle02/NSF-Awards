9633401 Paffenhofer This project will investigate the ability of doliolids
(Tunicata, Thaliacea) to control the abundance of protozoa and free-spawning
calanoid copepods. Pelagic tunicate feeding rates have been difficult to
quantify, particularly for Thaliacea. In this work, Drs. Paffenhofer and Verity
will quantify simultaneously the feeding, growth and reproduction rates of
doliolids, which repeatedly have constituted a major component of neritic
zooplankton in temperate and subtropical waters. The main hypotheses are
that:(1) doliolid assemblages above ~ 600 large zooids m -3 are able to control
phytoplankton, protozooplankton and free- spawning calanoids, and (2) that such
high concentrations of large doliolids are rapidly attained by intense
reproduction of two consecutive asexual stages, and high individual grown rates.
The significance of these studies is several fold: first, to obtain
environmentally-realistic and simultaneous information on rates of consumption
and production of the different doliolid zooids; second, determine
experimentally at which concentrations doliolids control phytoplankton,
protozooplankton and free-spawning calanoids; third, develop a model describing
the direct and indirect effects which a doliolid assemblage can have on these
prey populations. ***
