Asymptotic Geometric Analysis is concerned with geometric and linear properties
of finite dimensional objects, normed spaces and convex bodies, especially with
asymptotics of their various quantitative parameters as the dimension tends to
infinity. The achievements of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis demonstrate new and
unexpected phenomena characteristic for high dimensions. These phenomena appear
in a number of domains of mathematics and adjacent domains of science dealing
with functions of infinitely growing numbers of variables.

The last few years have seen tremendous progress in the field of Asymptotic
Geometric Analysis. The Thematic Program at the Fields Institute will be an
opportunity to attract some of the leading mathematicians of our time and also
to create an environment in which students could profit from the interaction
with such top experts. New applications of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis will
continue to have an impact on a broad range of fields, including combinatorics,
complexity theory and probability.
