The growth of carbon filaments onto the surfaces of primary fibers by catalytic
decomposition of a hydrocarbon offers the potential of producing a new
generation of composites with unique physical, chemical and mechanical
properties. Filaments can be formed in three basic conformations: (i) whisker-
like, (ii) branched, and (iii) multidirectional. The material chemistry on and
within the catalyst particle which causes carbon filaments to grow in these
various conformations will be investigated. A combination of techniques will be
used to study various aspects of the proposed filament-growing process,
including controlled atmosphere electron microscopy, HRTEM/in-situ electron
diffraction, surface spectroscopy, C13NMR, micro-calorimetry and bulk kinetic
studies. Also to be studied are the fundamental relationships between filament
morphology and mechanical behavior of the X-D composites containing such
filaments. The micromechanics physical and chemical characteristics of the
filaments will be established. These data will then be used to select catalytic
chemistry and whiskerization process variables to produce desirable filament
morphology. The multidirectional filaments will provide the continuous fiber
composites with through thickness reinforcement, improved interlaminar shear
strength, enhanced delamination resistance and damage tolerance.
