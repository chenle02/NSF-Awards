Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
DEB-0129009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: The Macroecology and Biodiversity of
Geographic Ranges in Mammals&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: John L.
Gittleman&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Virginia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different animals and plants are found in
different places. Kangaroos and eucalyptus trees are characteristic of
Australia, whereas giant pandas live only in China. One must travel far to see a
close human relative, the lemurs, found only on the island of Madagascar.
Surprisingly, no single source of information summarizes the geographic ranges
of all mammal species. It is now all the more important to have such a database
because species ranges are rapidly changing due to global climate change,
habitat fragmentation, and human population growth. If there is a single
prescription for species conservation, it is the preservation of natural
geographic range distributions of a species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
sources for discovering where species live are maps showing point localities and
range boundaries of a species. Our research will use GIS technology to digitize
current range maps for all mammal species. We will use this database to examine
three broad questions: (1) How do species differences in geographic range relate
to their ecology or reproduction? (2) How are geographic ranges in mammals
influenced by humans (i.e., dense human populations and land usage)? (3) How
will geographic areas with high mammalian diversity (e.g., tropical forests) be
effected by climate and other global changes? These questions are fundamental to
understanding why almost a quarter of the 4,763 mammal species currently are
threatened with extinction and using that information to establish conservation
priorities. Both graduate and undergraduate studetns will be involved in all
facets of this researh, and the entire database will be available freely on the
worldwide web.&lt;br/&gt;
