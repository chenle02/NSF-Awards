A pilot program will be developed which will serve as a model for a year-long
three-course series to meet the general science education requirement for
students from 30 majors and the non- science colleges across 20 California State
University campuses. The major objective is to test the feasibility of using
material integrated and presented, not by discipline, but by common features
across the disciplines. Students are expected to achieve a deep understanding of
the scientific method and the most important theories and mechanisms of seven
sciences (Astronomy, Physics, Geology, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science and
Mathematics) through a series of computer modules using systems process as
unifying themes to present, explain and show the similarities between in-depth
case studies from the disciplines. The pilot will emulate the innovative, hybrid
method planned for 30-week courses, using computer-based multimedia modules that
provide computer-based self-study, use of case studies from the individual
disciplines, weekly group discussion, skill training sessions and general
assembly debates, and a fully inter-disciplinary lab, all involving team
teaching. The project would result in twenty specific products that are highly
portable to other campuses including multimedia modules, their multidisciplinary
team-produced "scripts",study pamphlets for each module, guidelines for
discussion groups and one set of seven interdisciplinary laboratory protocols.
