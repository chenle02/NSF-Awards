Research will be conducted in theoretical condensed matter physics to increase
the knowledge and understanding of the anharmonic properties of crystals and of
surface effects in solids. Computer simulation studies of the anharmonic
properties of crystals will provide results for thermodynamic properties and
excitation lifetimes that are correct to all orders in the anharmonicity. Phonon
transport phenomena in dielectric crystals, such as phonon viscosity, thermal
conductivity, and ultrasonic attenuation, will be studied on the basis of
numerical solutions of the linearized Peierls Boltzmann equation for realistic
crystal models. The study of surface effects in solids will include
nonperturbative self-consistent calculations of surface phonon dispersion curves
for low index surfaces of metals and the amplification of surface plasmon
polaritons. The linewidths of surface phonons due to lattice anharmonicity will
also be investigated.
