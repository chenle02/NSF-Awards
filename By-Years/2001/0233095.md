This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will conduct research
and develop prototypes of an Earth Systems science-learning program for
secondary schools. The product will consist of a DVD-ROM that combines a library
of high-resolution visualizations with an inquiry-based curriculum and the
ability to update with new content from web sites on the Internet. Building on
WorldLink Media's previously published CD product, Interactive Earth, the
investigative team will research and prototype an advanced tool set for data
analysis and image interpretation that will enable students to inquire,
hypothesize, analyze, discover, and communicate with peers, replicating the work
of real scientists. Using NASA's Earth Observatory and Visible Earth web sites
as a test case, the Phase I research will define Web protocols that let users
seamlessly upload data and imagery into the DVD-ROM interface. TERC, a research
and education organization will evaluate teacher needs and develop a curriculum
framework that aligns with the National Science Education Standards. This
project recognizes the vital interplay between a curriculum developer (TERC), a
data provider (NASA) and a tool-builder (WorldLink) in creating exemplary
materials. Principal commercial applications include a DVD-ROM and curriculum
package for schools, a DVD program for homes and libraries, and an interactive
multimedia resource for museums and science centers. The proffered technology
will not only contribute to earth science learning but also to solving
information management problems: dealing with large amounts of data effectively
in a classroom setting.
