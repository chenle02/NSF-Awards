This project is for an evaluation of the feasibility, cost effectiveness, life
cycle cost, environmental impact reduction, onsite servicing reduction, design,
development and testing needed to prove molten carbonate fuel cells for
Antarctic applications. The approach involves defining the electric power and
service requirements of the U.S. Antarctic Program, and adapting the technology
of molten carbonate fuel cell power plants to meet these needs.
