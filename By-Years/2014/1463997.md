Earthquakes generate hydrological responses, such as increases in stream flow
and changes in the water level in wells. Such hydrologic responses are important
because they provide unique insight into the coupling of hydrologic and tectonic
processes at spatial and temporal scales that are otherwise difficult to study.
The August 2014 magnitude 6 Napa earthquake caused several previously dry stream
to begin flowing, an unexpected source of water during a time of intense
drought. The study of earthquake-induced hydrologic changes has implications for
water resources and engineering, including assessing the role of earthquakes in
damaging aquifers, affecting underground repositories, and changing water
supplies.

The origin of hydrologic responses to earthquakes has been the subject of
controversy, in large part because there are many models to explain observations
and few measurements suitable for distinguishing between hypotheses. The Napa
earthquake provides a unique opportunity to test hypotheses because water
emerged in dry or nearly dry streams and hence was not diluted by water already
flowing at the surface. The PI will collect water samples and make discharge
measurements over a 1-year period in order to answer the following questions: a)
Does the excess discharge in streams originate from the shallow or deep
subsurface? b) Are there permanent changes in properties of the subsurface such
as permeability? c) Are static or dynamic stresses more important for explaining
the observed changes?
