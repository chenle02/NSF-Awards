The problem of model uncertainty has recently received widespread attention in
applied mathematics, especially after being identified as a cause for the recent
credit crisis. The investigator seeks to develop probabilistic tools for
stochastic control problems under uncertainty, in particular in mathematical
finance and related game theoretic problems. The focus is on situations of
severe model uncertainty, where no reference probability measure can be
constructed and, therefore, standard tools from stochastic analysis cannot be
applied. The first part of this project studies the problem of superhedging for
a European, possibly path-dependent option under model uncertainty as well as
the fundamental duality between trading strategies and (possibly singular) risk-
neutral measures. The second part is concerned with stochastic differential
games of control and stopping and, in a special case, the pricing of American
options under uncertainty. The third part investigates a nonlinear version of
the Doob-Meyer decomposition, which is a step towards a theory of
semimartingales and stochastic integration under uncertainty.

This project seeks a better mathematical understanding of model uncertainty.
Its results help to resolve important questions of pricing, risk measurement,
and hedging in mathematical finance. Moreover, the project leads to
methodological developments in the theory of stochastic analysis and control.
