The Center for American Archeology will initiate a six-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in Archeology for 30 students in grades 11-12. This project
consists of an archeological field and laboratory workshop for high school
juniors and seniors at the Center for American Archeology (CAA) in Kampsville,
Illinois. The project immerses students in all aspects of archeological
research, including field excavation; and it incorporates studies in
geomorphology, botany, zoology, and bioanthropology. Coupled with the research
training are lectures and activities which explore ethical issues facing modern
archeologists. Career choice seminars and experimental archeology also form an
integral part of the workshop. Follow-up activities include in-school
presentations, attendance at professional archeological conferences, and a
participant newsletter.
