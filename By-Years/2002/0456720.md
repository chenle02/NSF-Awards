This award provides continued support for the Institute for Quantum Information
(IQI), which was founded at Caltech in September 2000. The IQI is devoted to
building the theoretical foundations of quantum information science across a
broad front encompassing quantum algorithms, quantum cryptography, quantum
information theory, fault-tolerant quantum information processing, and physical
implementations of quantum computing. Basic advances in all of these areas are
needed to bring revolutionary quantum technologies closer to
realization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strength of the IQI rests on three
distinctive qualities: a focus on interdisciplinary research, an emphasis on
fostering the career development of world-class postdoctoral talent, and
devotion to an active visitor program. The IQI promotes synergistic interactions
among scientists with a variety of backgrounds. Physicists and computer
scientists collaborate on investigations of quantum algorithms and quantum
cryptographic protocols. Control theorists and physicists team up to illuminate
the structure of entanglement. Theorists and experimenters join forces to
conceive feasible realizations of quantum hardware. The IQI has attracted and
trained top postdoctoral scholars, seven of whom have moved on to faculty
positions (or the equivalent) elsewhere, thus significantly strengthening the
world effort in QIS. The visitor program fuels intellectual excitement,
facilitates collaborations and exchanges of scientific ideas, and performs a
highly valued service for the international QIS
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the end of scalability of conventional
silicon-based information technology on the horizon, it is vitally important to
explore aggressively new paradigms for information technology. IQI contributions
are dedicated to broadening the nation's technical base and ensuring US
leadership in the future development of quantum science and technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this award is provided through the Physics at
the Information Frontier program in the Physics Division and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate and the Emerging Models and Technologies for Computation Cluster in
the Computing and Communications Foundations Division in the Computer and
Information Science and Engineering Directorate. &lt;br/&gt;
