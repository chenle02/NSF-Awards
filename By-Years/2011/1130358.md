The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with
Industry (GOALI) project is to elucidate the mechanisms controlling the
performance of shape memory polymers during mechanical activation. Amorphous
shape memory polymers can be programmed to store a temporary shape by applying
deformation and cooling below the glass transition temperature. The material
recovers the permanent shape when reheated above the transition temperature. The
polymer structure can be tailored to meet a broad range of mechanical and
biological requirements. This makes them attractive for applications in the
biomedical device industry; yet they have not gained wider acceptance because of
their slow recovery times. In mechanical activation, mechanical work is applied
in addition to temperature to accelerate shape recovery. The research will
investigate the importance of two mechanisms, molecular orientation and
structural relaxation, on the force requirements for mechanical activation. The
effect of shape memory programming conditions and physical aging on mechanical
behavior will be measured. Constitutive models will be developed to investigate
the effect of material properties and temperature and loading conditions on
mechanical activation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will enable the
development of more precise programming and more efficient manufacturing
strategies for mechanically activated devices. The developed models will help to
characterize the safety and performance of these devices throughout their
intended shelf life, which can lead to a wider acceptance in the biomedical
device industry. Student researchers will gain industry experience through
summer internships at a leading company for shape memory polymer medical
devices. The research will be integrated into courses to include the mechanics
of smart polymers.
