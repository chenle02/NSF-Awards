The project encompasses the investigation of the molecular basis of sequence
specific recognition by DNA binding proteins and, in particular, the mechanism
by which type II endonucleases achieve their high degree of binding and
catalytic specificity. SmaI, XmaI and XcyI each recognize the hexanucleotide
CCCGGG. SmaI cleaves between the internal CpG, while XmaI and XcyI are perfect
isoschizomers and cleave between the external cytosines. Cytosine methylation
within the recognition site inhibits the activity of the enzymes. It is the aim
of this proposal to focus on the DNA binding properties of the endonucleases and
to compare the mechanism by which each of the proteins interacts with the same
DNA sequence. The project involves structural characterization of the
endonucleases and analysis of the protein-DNA interaction in terms of the
overall topology of the protein-DNA complexes, specific base and phosphate
contacts and the potential for protein-induced bending and unwinding of the DNA.
The effect of cytosine methylation on the binding properties of the
endonucleases will also be investigated. The comparative study of the
endonucleases will reveal whether there are any similarities in their mechanism
of molecular recognition or whether each is characterized by a distinct mode of
interaction with DNA. Furthermore, the enzymes also provide a good model system
for analyzing the potential roles of cytosine methylation in protein-DNA
interactions.
