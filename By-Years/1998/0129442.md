This planning grant is a collaboration between the Education Development
Center's for Children and Technology (CCT) and Wireless Generation, a technology
development company. Together, the collaborators are building a suite of
handheld diagnostic tools that make it possible for teachers to conduct
observational assessments and collect the process data necessary to effect
changes teaching and students' learning. The planning period will be used to
conduct a thorough review of the literature, strengthen the research design, and
focus on designing an assessment system. During the planning process, CCT will
draw on an interdisciplinary team and a nationally recognized board of advisors
to guide the work.&lt;br/&gt; Staff Analysis&lt;br/&gt;PI: Honey&lt;br/&gt;
