The National Nonofabrication Facility (NNF) will provide a resource composed of
equipment, personnel and project administration unique in the country. NNF will
be available to qualified researchers from U.S. universities, industries and
federal laboratories. The NNF staff, in collaboration with Cornell faculty and
visiting scientists will also develop new instrumentation resources and process
technologies. The resulting research accomplishments will impact many areas of
science and technology currently recognized as crucial to the nation such as
microelectronics, deliberately structured materials, electron and ion optics,
ion beam processing of surfaces, physics of random systems, and bioengineering.
More importantly, the development of this resource will create new, as yet
unimagined, research opportunities. NNF will serve important national needs
through research accomplishments and education of students and professionals.
