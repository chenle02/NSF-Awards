Animals use myriad strategies to avoid predation -- camouflage, spines, and
toxins are among a few. Animals that are toxic, inedible, or otherwise noxious
often advertise this by a warning signal, for example the yellow and black
stripes of a yellowjacket or the rattle of a snake. Bioluminescent millipedes,
known only from California, are defended with cyanide and their green-blue glow
is hypothesized to be a nocturnal warning signal. In this project, the
evolutionary relationships of millipedes will be analyzed, using molecular
phylogenetic methods, to pinpoint the origin of bioluminescence, and the
ecological circumstances under which bioluminescence evolved will be
investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The phylogeny will also establish a
framework for a stable classification system for millipede biodiversity. The
collections component of this project will provide species information posted
publicly on the Tree of Life Web Project. Educational websites will also be
produced, including detailed information on decomposers as important members of
the global ecosystem, as they provide functions that are essential to healthy
ecosystems.
