9403540 Curry The Program in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado
will purchase computational equipment which will be dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular: 1.) Numerically Induced Chaos,
Sympletic Integrators and Nonlinear Wave Equations; 2.) Fast Numerical
Algorithms: Wavelets; 3.) Dynamical Systems: Computational Experiments with
Maps; 4.) Multilevel Methods for First Order System Least Squares Discretization
of Partial Differential Equations; and 5.) Nonlinear Ocean Waves: Simulation,
Chaos, and Field Data
