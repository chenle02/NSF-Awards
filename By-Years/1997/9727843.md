9727843 Apsell WGBH Educational Foundation will explore new ways to accurately
depict in a large format film the eruption of a volcano that occurred in 79 AD.
One means is to use footage of Montserrat, a similar volcano that currently is
erupting. In order to do this, however, they must film the volcano in the
immediate future while it is still erupting and the block and ash flow is still
clearly visible. Once this is completed, WGBH will conduct various testing to
address such questions as the following: * Can original footage shot in large
format film be used to dramatize events of the past? * Can original footage of
the ash eruptions on Montserrat be used in a composite with live action footage
of Vesuvius today? * Can original footage of the plumes be used in a composite
with a miniature model of Vesuvius? * Can the original footage be enhanced with
computer graphics, or will it need to be "degraded" to create an historical
sense?
