9410359 Gadh The long-term goal of the current research is to develop a
fundamentally new approach to computer-aided geometric design which integrates a
features-based design approach with feature abstraction from boundary
representation surface or solid models. The focus of this research activity is
on the determination of features generated in a design-by-features/loops
environment. The features-based design approach in the current research uses an
abstract geometric entity called a loop; features are defined in terms of loops.
A designer may design in terms of high- level features such as the rib or boss,
and subsequently, may modify features by modifying loops. The loop provides the
designer the flexibility to generate creative designs thus providing a function
that is lacking in existing design-by-features approaches. Whether designing by
features or by loops, new features - that are not intentionally created - get
formed. These features often affect issues such as manufacturability,
assemblability etc. These features are determined via a set of loop mappings (or
feature mappings). Determination of these mappings and their completeness are
studied in this research. A computer implementation of these mappings is
performed and verified by industry experts.
