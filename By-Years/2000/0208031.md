EAR-0208031&lt;br/&gt;Jeffrey J. Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Red Sea
region, a continental shield has rifted to form an incipient ocean basin.
Several stages of the continental rifting process are evident in the region,
ranging from the formation of genuine oceanic crust in central Red Sea to
transcurrent pull-apart motion along the Dead Sea transform. Surface features of
this rifting are well mapped, but the extent and geometry of ductile shear in
the underlying lower crust and mantle lithosphere are unknown. The use of
seismic anisotropy as a proxy for the deformation of the lower crust and upper
mantle became widespread with the advent of broadband digital seismic data
recording. However, only a small subset of data available from permanent seismic
observatories in the Red Sea region has been explored with techniques that
address anisotropic properties directly. The investigators will study the
structure and the texture of the lower crust and the shallow mantle in the Red
Sea region using seismic observables that diagnose elastic anisotropy -
teleseismic shear wave splitting and receiver functions. These two techniques
are largely complementary: shear-wave splitting integrates anisotropy along the
path of a shear wave, while P-S converted waves are sensitive to velocity and
anisotropy jumps at interfaces. Together they offer a way to constrain vertical
variations in anisotropic properties, which should allow us to distinguish
inherited rock textures within the Proterozoic-age lithosphere from textures
associated with the ongoing continental break-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
