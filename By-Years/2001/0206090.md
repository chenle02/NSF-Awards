Dissertation Research: Inducible Defenses and Plasticity in Tadpoles:
Chracterization of Chemical Alarm Cues

Dr. Thomas Eisner & Jacqualine Grant

Many organisms go about their daily business unprepared for danger. However,
some can anticipate hazards by cueing in on the environmental stimuli that
presage peril. In the gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) chemical alarm cues are
released from the skin of injured tadpoles. These cues induce morphological and
behavioral changes in conspecific tadpoles, changes that improve their ability
to withstand future attacks. Specifically, the induction involves enlargement of
the tailfin, and a simultaneous color change of the fin from nearly translucent
to a mottled red and black. In its transformed state, the tadpole is said to be
less vulnerable, because the gaudy tail deflects attacks away from the body
itself. The transformed tadpole is also less active and, as a result, less
conspicuous. The ecology of this phenomenon has received much attention, but so
far the mediating chemicals remain unknown. This dissertation research is
focused on characterizing those substances that trigger inducible defenses in
gray treefrog tadpoles. The results will shed light on the evolution and ecology
of morphological and behavioral plasticity.
