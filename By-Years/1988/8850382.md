There is a growing interest in the country for reform in the area of elementary
science education. While most science educators recognize the need for hands-on
science education, those currently engaged in reform efforts recognize that one
of the crucial failings of the previous curriculum work in this area was the
inability or unwillingness of developers to devise new forms of student
assessment to meet the needs of material based science programs. This proposal
is for an invitational conference to address the need for curriculum independent
tests and assessment tools for classroom teachers to use in conjunction with
instruction. New ideas about elementary science assessment can come from other
curriculum areas (reading and writing), recently developed indicators of science
achievement such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress assessment,
new NSF-supported curriculum developments, and research on children's
conceptions of science. The conference, based on a series of commissioned
papers, will address how these developments can form the basis for new
instruments and methods. The result will be a monograph for wide dissemination
and suggestions for future developmental work in elementary science assessment.
