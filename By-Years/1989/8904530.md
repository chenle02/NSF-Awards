The kinetics and mechanisms of plagioclase behavior during certain igneous,
metamorphic, and deformational processes will be experimentally investigated.
NaSi-CaAl interdiffusion rates will be studied. The hydrogen-bearing species in
feldspar will be studied using an ion microprobe, and the concentrations of
these species correlated with pressure and temperature. Nucleation of jadeite
and quartz during the breakdown of albite will be studied using natural starting
materials with different amounts of overstepping of the equilibrium boundary and
TEM used to evaluate various factors in determining the nature and rate of
nucleation. These results will provide major advances in our ability to
interpret the behavior of feldspar in the earth's crust (It is one of the most
common minerals.), as well as fundamental information about the factors which
affect the kinetics and mechanisms of mineralogical processes in general.
