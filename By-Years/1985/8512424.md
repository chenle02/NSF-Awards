This project allows for the measurement of mutal diffusion coefficients, thermal
conductivities, and shear viscosities for ten nonideal, binary liquid mixtures
over the entire composition range and over the liquid range between Oo and 90oC
at ambient pressure. In conjunction with the measurements being made on the
heats of transport for these same mixtures, the measurements provide a
consistent set of data as a function of both composition and temperature for
development and testing of liquid-mixtures transport models. In particular,
corresponding states techniques and local composition models are utilized and
tested. Additionally, thermodynamic information from the temperature dependence
of measured excess enthalpies (already available) are used to determine
thermodynamic nonidealities and to back-calculate Onsager coefficients from the
measured transport properties. This provides a complete set of Onsager heat-mass
coefficients and their composition and temperature dependence. Correlation and
interpretation of relationships between them and thermodynamic properties are
investigated.
