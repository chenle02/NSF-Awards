The principal investigator will conduct mathematical research in percolation
and random graphs. Both topics deal with mathematical models of clustering
processes, and have applications to phase transitions and critical phenomena in
statistical mechanics. The percolation theory research focuses on two problems:
In classical percolation models, mathematically rigorous exact solutions for the
critical probability (phase transition) value are rare. This project continues
development of a method for computing accurate upper and lower bounds for the
critical probability. AB percolation is a variant of the classical percolation
model, introduced for the study of antiferromagnets and gelation processes. AB
percolation models behave quite differently from classical percolation models,
by exhibiting multiple phase transitions in some lattices, and no phase
transitions in others. In this project the investigator will study why these
differences occur. The random graph theory research continues to explore the
behavior of the Erdos-Renyi random graph models near the phase transition value.
