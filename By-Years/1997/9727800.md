ABSTRACT Proposal # : 9727800 (Wieder And Yavitt) Title: CARBON CYCLING AND PEAT
ACCUMULATION IN THE DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST REGION OF BOREAL, CONTINENTAL,
WESTERN CANADA Institution: VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY Boreal and subarctic peatlands
contain about a third of the world's soil carbon pool and presently function as
a net sink for atmospheric CO2 and a major source of atmospheric CH4. This
research focuses on the extensive peat deposits in the discontinuous permafrost
regions of boreal, continental, western Canada, where new findings suggest that
permafrost has been melting in recent years, possibly in response to warming
climatic conditions. Both field and laboratory studies will be conducted to test
hypotheses related to carbon balance and peat accumulation/degradation. The
research is structured around four questions: 1) How does the presence, absence,
or disappearance of permafrost affect peat accumulation rate and peat organic
matter quality in peatlands of the discontinuous permafrost region? 2) How does
the presence, absence, or disappearance of permafrost affect CO2 and CH4
production/emission and controls on production/emission in peatlands of the
discontinuous permafrost region? 3) Will the carbon balance of peat underlain by
permafrost be tipped from peat as a sink for atmospheric carbon to a net source
of carbon to the atmosphere as permafrost melts? and 4) Do roots contribute
substantially to CO2 and CH4 production/emission in peatlands in the
discontinuous permafrost zone? By understanding the factors that affect CO2 and
CH4 production and emission, the work will lead to insights into the potential
carbon cycling responses of these extensive peatlands to projected regional and
global climate changes in general, and to ongoing permafrost degradation and
melting more specifically.
