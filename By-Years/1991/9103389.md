The International School for Space Simulations (ISSS) was originally conceived
as a means of bringing together established and beginning investigators in space
plasma physics. A broader scope was to increase communication in order to
advance the use of space plasma simulations by the scientific community as a
whole. This grant is for support of ISSS-4 which will be held March 25 - April
6, 1991 in both Kyoto and Nara Japan. The conference will consist of two
distinct segments. The first week will be devoted to lectures and exercises on
simulation techniques and will take place in Kyoto. The second segment will be
held in Nara and consist of a symposium for the presentation and discussion of
recent research topics and methods related to simulations (e.g. observations,
data analysis, model development).
