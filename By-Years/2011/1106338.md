In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Dennis Clouthier of the University
of Kentucky will use laser spectroscopic methods to study the electronic spectra
of main group reactive intermediates, concentrating on free radicals containing
phosphorus, arsenic, boron and group III metals. These species will be generated
by electron impact fragmentation of stable precursor compounds, cooled to
temperatures of a few Kelvin in a supersonic expansion, and detected by laser-
induced fluorescence and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Many of these transient molecules are of interest as they occur as
semiconductor growth intermediates. In addition, there is a high probability
that the free radicals containing phosphorus and aluminum can be found in the
interstellar medium once they have been identified and characterized in the
laboratory. The spectroscopic information obtained from these transient species
will provide necessary benchmark data for future studies of reactive species in
industrial processes and chemical reactions. This project will provide training
for a new generation of physical chemists in a technically demanding and
challenging area of science in which there is a dearth of well-qualified
practitioners.
