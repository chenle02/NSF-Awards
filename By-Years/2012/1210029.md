This project examines how animals in groups collectively learn about their
environment and how this learning process may result in "collective
intelligence", whereby the group can make more accurate decisions than any
single individual can. Most social animals, such as fish, have very limited
means of communication and coordination, and it is currently unknown whether
these animals can learn to exploit the potential collective intelligence under
these constraints. This project will develop a theoretical model of collective
learning, and preliminary results suggest that the same learning rules known to
be ubiquitous in solitary animals can also be highly efficient in a group
context and can lead to near-optimal levels of collective intelligence, even
with limited coordination between individuals. The specific predictions of the
collective learning model will then be experimentally tested using two social
animal species: fish and humans. By using two very different species, the
generality of the model can be tested, and general mechanisms of collective
learning will be uncovered. These experiments will provide important insights
into the learning process in animal groups, which has previously been
unexplored. They may also give specific insight into how humans learn in a group
context and may suggest techniques to increase the efficiency of collective
learning in human groups.
