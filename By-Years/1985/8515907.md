Coordinated theoretical and experimental research will be performed on the
microstructure in granular materials and the interrelationships of
microstructure to the overall constitutive behavior will be investigated. This
research will identify and establish stress-fabric relationships; characterize
fabric changes associated with stress rates; and develop appropriate
constitutive relations.
