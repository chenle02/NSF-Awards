The vertebrate eye transduces visual information into a series of electrical
impulses which are transmitted by nerve cells to higher brain centers.
Therefore, it is important to understand how the retina of the eye takes images
and converts them, through a series of nerve networks, into signals which the
brain can process. This is a problem both of physiology and mathematics. This
project will study the input-output relationships of the vertebrate retina, that
is, light to nerve cell and nerve to nerve cell. This is the first stage of
visual transduction and integration. The project will focus on the mathematical
analysis of the input-output system in order to develop models of how light is
transformed into nerve impulses. The mathematical and computer-modeling aspects
will be done in conjunction with ongoing studies of retinal physiology. These
studies will contribute to our understanding of light and image transduction and
how retinal neural networks initially process visual information. The results
should provide valuable information about the normal function of the eye and,
possibly, what factors are involved in visual defects.
