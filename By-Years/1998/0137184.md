ABSTARCT &lt;br/&gt;PI: HARDING&lt;br/&gt;INST. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-
SCRIPPS-SD&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL # 0137184&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award is for a
project to further analyze seismic data collected during a cruise in 1999 that
was undertaken to identify potential drill sites for a deep penetration,
reference crustal section in the Guatemala basin. The crust in this area was
created during an episode of rapid spreading during the middle Miocene. Because
of the rapid spreading rate, theory suggests that the depth to the dike-gabbro
transition should be shallower and therefore more accessible to drilling. The
proposed work will include 1) waveform modeling of bright UCR reflections, 2)
integration of reflection and refraction datasets, 3) slant stacking/basement
velocity determination, 4) simultaneous P- and S- wave inversion/anisotropy
investigations, 5) prestack depth migration of UCR/LCDRs, and 6)
characterization of reflectivity patterns at other survey
sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
