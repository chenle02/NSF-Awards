The Langlands program endeavors to link Galois representations to automorphic
forms. Central to the Langlands program is the study of arithmetic moduli, which
is to say parameter spaces for geometric objects defined over a local or global
field. Arithmetic moduli include modular curves and Shimura varieties in the
global setting, and the Lubin-Tate tower and spaces of Rapoport-Zink in the
local setting. Such geometric objects are always structured in towers, such as
the tower of modular curves of level a power of p. Taken as a whole, a tower of
arithmetic moduli admits an action of a reductive group, and studying this
action on the cohomology of the tower is the only way we know how to attach a
Galois representation to an automorphic form. This project concerns arithmetic
moduli at infinite level, e.g. the inverse limit along a tower of modular
curves. A recent discovery of the PI is that, in the case of the Lubin-Tate
tower, such limits exist as objects in Peter Scholze's new category of
perfectoid spaces. There are many ways in which the inverse limit object is
actually simpler than the constituent layers of the tower. The PI intends to
generalize these discoveries to general arithmetic moduli. These results will be
leveraged into new insights in the Langlands program. In particular this
proposal represents the most promising hope yet for a proof of the local
Langlands correspondence for GL(n) which is purely local in nature (i.e., which
does not involve automorphic representations).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal includes a plan for the research-level participation of graduate and
undergraduate students at Boston University, with appropriate projects for each.
The PI intends to continue his involvement in programs which disseminate
mathematics throughout a broad community. These programs include the PROMYS
program, a number theory summer program for high school students located in
Boston University, and the Arizona Winter School, an intensive mini-course for
graduate students which takes place in Tucson. The PI also intends to present
research at conferences, including the joint meetings of the AMS-MAA.
