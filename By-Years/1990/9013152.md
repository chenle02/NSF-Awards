Abstract Gravity data collected by the PI during a SeaMARC II program on the
East Pacific Rise, together with data collected during earlier studies, provide
the basis of an ideal gravity survey of an ultra- fast spreading ridge. The main
goal of this renewal proposal is to determine if "bull's eye" gravity lows or
other along-axis variations in the gravity field occur at such ultra-fast
spreading rates in the South Pacific. This study will provide the support for
completion of a PhD thesis and complements work done by the student earlier on
crustal thinning near Atlantic transform faults.
