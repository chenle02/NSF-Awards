Abstract P.I. Giacomo DiTullio OPP97-25800 Preliminary dimethylsulfide (DMS)
and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) data indicate that Phaeocystis antarctica
plays an important role in carbon and sulfur cycling in the Ross Sea. High
sediment DMSP and DMS concentrations, coupled with deep (> 400m) fluorescence
peaks, suggest that the carbon export flux associated with Phaeocystis blooms
may be significantly underestimated. The Phaeocystis-associated carbon flux to
deep water also may have important implications for the glacial iron hypothesis.
For example, if silicate depletion in the subantarctic zone occurred, then
enhanced eolian iron deposition during the last glacial maximum may have
preferentially stimulated Phaeocystis populations. Phaeocystis blooms in the
marginal ice zone may sequester carbon and promoted a decrease in atmospheric
pCO2. The proposed research will measure DMS and DMSP concentrations in the
water column, sediments and in the atmosphere of the Ross Sea as part of the
ROAVERRS project. In particular, we propose to determine the significance of
Phaeocystis blooms in the Ross Sea to carbon and sulfur fluxes to deep water and
to the benthos. Phytoplankton species composition will be compared to DMS
dynamics and to DMSP fluxes to the sediments. In addition, the cycling of DMS
and DMSP, and the relationship between DMS production/consumption and
atmospheric concentrations will be examined.
