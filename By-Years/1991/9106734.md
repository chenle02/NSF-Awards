This award will support study of the Japanese language by an American scientist
or engineer by providing a stipend, tuition, or other course-related expenses.
The objectives of the program are to enable active U.S. scientists and engineers
to acquire sufficient familiarity with the language and customs of Japan to
allow them to function independently there and/or to acquire sufficient
expertise in reading Japanese to be able to understand technical abstracts in
their field of interest. There is a critical need for more effective technical
communication between American and Japanese researchers. This award is intended
to help remove language and cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese cooperative
research and to facilitate science and technology exchange.
