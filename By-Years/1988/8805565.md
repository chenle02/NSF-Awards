Long-term research abroad: Investigation of Chiral Asymmetries in Light
Reflection from a Gyrotropic Medium. This award recommendation is made under the
Program for Long and Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The
program is designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term
research abroad at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide
opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign
countries. Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to
the applicant's field of science, the prospective potential of the applicant for
professional growth, as well as criteria relevant to the furthering of
international cooperation in science and engineering. The program is
particularly directed to scientists and engineers who are embarking on their
research careers. The project is under the direction of Professor Mark P.
Silverman, Department of Physics, Trinity College, Hartford, CT in collaboration
with Professor J. Badoz, Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie, CNRS, Paris,
France. The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,
international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if
applicable, language training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance
of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
