Larsen&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807825&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops and
studies models for the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of elastic damage (i.e., regions of
weakened elastic&lt;br/&gt;properties) and fracture. Difficulties come from,
among other&lt;br/&gt;things, the irreversibility of these phenomena, and the
fact that&lt;br/&gt;existing models are essentially variational (static).
The&lt;br/&gt;general strategy is to first develop quasi-static models that
are&lt;br/&gt;consistent with these variational principles, and prove
existence&lt;br/&gt;and approximation results. Next, the goal is to extend
these&lt;br/&gt;results to the fully dynamic setting. The first step has
been&lt;br/&gt;essentially completed for damage and brittle fracture, and
the&lt;br/&gt;investigator works on developing corresponding methods
for&lt;br/&gt;cohesive fracture. Dynamic models and their analysis are
major&lt;br/&gt;open problems for all these phenomena, and are the main focus
of&lt;br/&gt;this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Material damage and fracture
prediction are of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;importance in the areas of materials and
manufacturing, civil&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, etc., yet in the most physically
realistic&lt;br/&gt;setting (dynamics) there is no sound mathematical footing,
making&lt;br/&gt;engineering models largely ad hoc. The investigator works
on&lt;br/&gt;developing this mathematical support, as well as creating
and&lt;br/&gt;rigorously justifying algorithms for computing
approximate&lt;br/&gt;solutions. The project includes training mathematics
Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;students through work on important interdisciplinary
problems.&lt;br/&gt;
