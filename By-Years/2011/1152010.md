In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Karl A. Scheidt, Chemistry Department of Northwestern
University, will investigate the synthesis and study of new Lewis bases as
catalysts for chemical reactions. A primary focus will be on N-heterocyclic
carbenes (NHCs). These Lewis bases have been developed as metal-free catalysts
as well as being employed as ligands to generate chiral metal complexes.
However, there is a dearth of new, chiral NHCs and there have been few
mechanistic investigations of NHC-catalyzed processes. This project will focus
on the development of new families of chiral NHCs as ligands and catalysts. The
different phases of the investigation include a) synthesis and characterization
of new classes of chiral N-heterocyclic carbenes and the evaluation/benchmarking
of these NHCs in established catalytic processes, b) exploring/validating
carbene catalysis mechanisms, and c) studies geared towards understanding the
structure reactivity relationships of new catalysts for the purpose of
predicting and controlling the outcome of Lewis base processes. These advances
will ultimately expedite the ability to synthesize natural products,
pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals with maximum efficiency and minimal impact on
the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new catalysts that
promote high value reactions is a crucial enterprise that impacts a wide range
of scientific endeavors with biological and pharmacological endpoints. The
investigations to be carried out on this project will advance our knowledge of
Lewis base and metal catalysis, as well as structure reactivity relationships
that are the foundation of modern chemical science. These studies provide
training for s diverse set of students and postdoctoral fellows. The expected
skills acquired by graduate and undergraduate students driving these projects
include advanced problem solving, chemical synthesis, and mechanistic organic
chemistry/catalysis.
