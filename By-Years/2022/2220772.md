This project will focus on how to educate the next generation of data scientists
and software engineers to implement their technical expertise informed by sound
ethical principles. This interdisciplinary research project will investigate
pathways to making ethics of technology–computational, data-driven technology–a
fundamental part of the liberal arts curriculum for undergraduate students. This
project aims to answer these questions in a collaboration between the principal
investigators and their students in a multi-year pedagogical exercise called:
Method, Ethics, Technology, Research Seminar (METER). The findings from this
project will be of interest to educators, practitioners and students.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The project: Pathways to Ethics of Technology in the Liberal Arts
Curriculum seeks to address two questions: How should the next generation of
data scientists and software engineers be educated to think of their work as not
just technical but also ethical? What sort of educational experiences will lead
them to see that the social impact of their work requires that it be driven by
sound ethical principles? Using surveys and interviews, the research team will
also collaborate with alums of their institution to bring the workplace into the
classroom. This project will generate new knowledge with respect to: 1. How
workers in the field of digital technology reflect on their preparation for
careers in technology, 2. How the historical and present-day iterations of
liberal arts curricula intersect, support, or otherwise interrogate the ethics
of technology, 3. Strategies and materials for meaningful intervention in
liberal arts curricula, with the objective of strengthening the ethical decision
making preparation for future leaders in technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
