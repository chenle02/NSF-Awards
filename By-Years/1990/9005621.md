Computer models provide a new arena of computer based scientific
experimentation currently referred to as computational science. One subcomponent
of this new science which we seek to advance is that of computational
epidemiology. Based on existing strength in information management and computer
modelling and expert systems as the vital subcomponents of computational
epidemiology. Some problem-solving methods are quantitative and complex, and
require computer modelling methods. Others are qualitative and fall in the
domain of expert systems research. The task is to meld expert knowledge with
computer modelling methods to advance epidemiologic knowledge management. Two
approaches, one based on expert systems, and a second based on computer
modelling will be utilized. Since the two methods appear to be different, they
have generally been used separately. However, if the two are coupled, a more
effective problem-solving and decision-support model may result. To test this
core hypothesis, we will proceed to develop prototypes of the two systems and
experiment with optimal coupling approaches using the bioepidemiologic dynamics
of trypanosoma as the test bed. An outreach component will be embedded in the
research environment so as to increase the number of minorities pursuing
advanced studies in computational epidemiology. The research and outreach in
tandem will lead to the development of resources that will form the backbone for
long term research in computational epidemiology.
