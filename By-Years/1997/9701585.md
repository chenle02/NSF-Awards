9701585 McAdam This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement grant examines
three questions regarding student activism: (1) How have levels of student
activism varied over time, and what accounts for this variation?; (2) Why does
protest activity occur on some campuses and not others?; (3) and What is the
relationship between student protest and protest activity at the national level?
Student protests that occurred between 1930 and 1990 will be investigated using
data from student newspapers at forty-eight U.S. colleges. Data on relevant
covariates of protest will be gathered from archival sources. Event history
methods, which take into account the timing of events, will be the primary
method of analysis. The data gathered will be used to empirically test
theoretical propositions regarding the location and levels of student protest
over time, which will enable the investigator to refine social movement theory.
This research will also increase our understanding of how social movements shape
U.S. college campuses and society at large. **** ??
