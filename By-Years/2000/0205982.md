Insects and other arthropods are being surveyed in Colombia, one of the most
biologically diverse countries in the world, and one of the most poorly sampled
for arthropods and other forms of life. The arthropod fauna of 10 of Colombia's
National Parks and wildlife sanctuaries are sampled employing, at each site, a
number of different collecting methods in order to capture organisms in all
types of microhabitats from tree canopies to forest ground litter. Samples are
sent to the Alexander von Humboldt Institute in Villa Leyva (Colombia), where
they are sorted and prepared. PI Sharkey travels to Colombia to collect the
samples twice per year. He then sends them to almost 100 scientific
collaborators across the United States and to 15 other countries around the
world. The timing is critical since Colombia is the third worst country in South
America in terms of rate of forest loss and the second worst in terms of
population growth. Combined with political instability, the high crime rate, and
the illegal drug trade, the project might appear to be urgent but impractical;
however, these handicaps have been surmounted. The von Humboldt Institute, which
is a branch of the Federal Department of the Environment, and the Colombian
Ministry of National Parks, is collaborating to overcome the potential logistic
problems. Park naturalists are operating the sampling equipment, and send the
samples to the Humboldt Institute on a quarterly (or more frequent) basis, thus
avoiding dangerous travel in Colombia.&lt;br/&gt;Insects and other arthropods
constitute more than half of the species level diversity of all life. That is,
there are more species of insects and other arthropods like spiders than all
other species of life combined! Therefore, the study of this group is
fundamental to understanding the diversity of life, which is higher in Colombia
than just about anywhere else in the world, due to its varied geography and
tropical location. Despite this wealth, the international scientific community
has not had access to it for more than 20 years. This project results in the
distribution of tens of thousands of prepared specimens throughout the world
each year. Collaborating scientists describe new species and higher-level taxa.
Using our quantitative sampling data, they prepare estimates of the total number
of species throughout Colombia, and compare the Colombian fauna with other areas
of South America and the world to obtain a clear picture of the species that are
restricted to Colombia.
