With support from the Organic Dynamics and the Solid State Chemistry Programs
Dr. George Whitesides will continue his studies of self-assembling organic
structures. The system chosen for study is the 1:1 complex between cyanuric acid
and melamine. Procedures for designing, synthesizing and characterizing these
self-assembling hydrogen-bond connected structures will be developed. Similar
networks of hydrogen bonds will also be used in order to simplify the structures
of organic crystals. The results from these studies will be utilized in order to
define rules of self-assembly. %%% The formation of new materials will be
investigated. These new materials consist of aggregrates of molecules held
together by networks of bridging hydrogens. The long term goals of this research
include: (1) to understand the factors which control the formation of these
aggregates, and (2) to understand the relationship between the structure of the
component molecules and the structure of the crystal aggregrate.
