This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to examine the
feasibility of developing a new class of bent-core NLO ferroelectric liquid
crystals (FLCs) capable of advanced, low cost, laser light sources for displays
on the basis of their strong second harmonic generation (SHG). These materials
will also have large electro-optic (EO) coefficients and can be readily
integrated with silicon VLSI, enabling their use in high-bandwidth chip-to-chip
data transfer, optical long-haul, and fiber-to-the-home telecommunications.

This SBIR Phase I project will advance the scientific and technological
understanding of a new class of bent-core NLO ferroelectric liquid crystals.
This innovation will enable advanced optoelectronic products across multiple
markets, including laser illuminators for projection display, high-speed
integrated EO modulators (e.g. >100GHz), switches for optical interconnects and
telecommunications, and sensors and devices for optical information processing.
