9521010 Lewis The utilization of estuarine habitats as nurseries by many coastal
fishes is considered to be critical to the productivity and survival of those
pmpulations, yet patterns of usage and an understanding of factors which effect
differences in habitat utilization within and among estuaries by the larvae of
these species are not well-defined. The objective of this planning study is to
measure the physiological and behavioral responses of estuarine-dependent larval
fishes (Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus and spot Leiostomus xanthurus) to
a range of salinity regimes. This preliminary information will provide a basis
for designing more rigorous experiments that will relate larval growth and
survival to environmental fluctuations. ***
