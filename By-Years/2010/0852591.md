In a series of papers the PI developed an arithmetic analogue of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). In this theory the independent real variable is
replaced by a prime number, functions are replaced by integer numbers, and the
derivative operator on functions is replaced by a Fermat quotient operator. Part
of this theory was extended to a theory of arithmetic partial differential
equations (PDEs) in two dimensions. Applications of this theory were found by
the PI in previous work funded by the NSF. The PI proposes to continue exploring
the applications of this theory along the following lines: a) applications of
arithmetic ODEs to finiteness Diophantine results for correspondences between
Shimura varieties and Abelian varieties, b) applications of two dimensional
arithmetic PDEs to local class field theory on the one hand and, on the other,
to congruences between coefficients of Fourier (or Serre-Tate) expansions of
classical modular forms, and c) construction of arithmetic PDEs on higher genus
curves.

The analogy between functions and numbers plays a key role in the development of
modern number theory. One of the basic tools in function theory is the theory of
differential equations. It is reasonable to hope that an arithmetic analogue of
this theory will have a useful impact on number theoretical questions. The PI
has developed, in previous work, an arithmetic analogue of differential
equations. He proposes to find new applications of this theory to Diophantine
geometry, class field theory, and modular forms.
