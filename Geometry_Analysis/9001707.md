One investigator will study problems in the areas of rigidity theorems for
Riemannian manifolds, the structure of manifolds without conjugate points, and
sharp isoperimetric inequalities. A second investigator will study related
problems in the areas of degenerate systems of partial differential equations,
isospectral deformations of Riemannian structures, and minimal isometric
embeddings of spherical space forms in spheres. The problems to be investigated
in this project arise from an example due to Milnor of two isospectral manifolds
which are not isometric. While the original example was sixteen dimensional,
more recently three dimensional examples have been constructed. Analogously, one
might ask if two round drums which have the same rough shape and which sound the
same when struck, have the same exact shape. In fact, they must. These two
investigators will study related deep questions for higher dimensional
hypersurfaces.
