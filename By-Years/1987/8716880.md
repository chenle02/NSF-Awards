The technology and application of novel passive and active fiber optic devices
will be investigated. Research in passive devices will build upon the recent
discovery that dielectric mirrors can be produced in a continuous length of
silica fiber by fusion splicing. The interdiffusion process which occurs when
the mirrors are produced will be studied for a variety of candidate materials.
Multilayer films will be used to obtain high reflectance. Novel input-output
couplers and in-line polarizers will be produced using angled mirrors. Fabry-
Perot interferometers in single-mode fiber will be explored for application as
temperature and strain sensors. Feedback from fiber mirrors will be used for
diode laser frequency stabilization, line narrowing and mode locking.
Acoustooptic phase modulators in which the fiber itself serves as a cylindrical
acoustic resonator will also be investigated. A zinc oxide transducer on the
fiber surface will be driven from an rf signal source to produce a standing
acoustic wave which modulates the guided light via the strain-optic effect. A
coherent communication demonstration will be carried out using these modulators.
