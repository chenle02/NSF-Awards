9310381 The principal investigators propose to continue the management of the
Southern California Geometric Analysis Seminar. The purpose of the seminar is to
gather together scientists and graduate students working in the general area of
Geometric Analysis for two days of lectures by six distinguished researchers in
this area. Topics covered will be at the forefront of current research and the
infrastructural value of the seminar series is justified.
