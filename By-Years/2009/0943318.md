This project is improving the assessment of student learning in computer science
by developing three concept inventories for introductory computer science
subjects. Modeled after the successful Force Concept Inventory that was
developed to assess student learning of Newtonian physics, the concept
inventories are testing understanding of key computer science concepts in a
manner that enables reliable comparisons between courses at different
universities. This multi-institution partnership among the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Rose-Hulman Institute, and Washington University
is helping to ensure the validity of the proposed instruments by providing
access to diverse student populations and different program objectives. With a
standardized assessment tool, the computer science education community can make
meaningful comparisons of the effectiveness of different pedagogical approaches,
greatly facilitating computer science education
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concept inventories are designed to test student
comprehension of difficult concepts by forcing a choice between the correct
answer and distractors constructed from common student misconceptions. As the
primary source of information about which topics are difficult and about what
the most common misconceptions are, students are being directly engaged through
introspections, discussions, interviews, and "think alouds" to direct the
development of questions for the concept inventories. These questions are then
being refined and validated through peer review, qualitative, and psychometric
analyses. An advisory panel, comprised of experienced concept inventory
developers, is advising and annually assessing project progress.&lt;br/&gt;
