Abstract ATM-9422631 Miller, Ronald Tegen, Ina Columbia University Title:
Feedbacks Between Mineral Aerosols and Sahel Drought This two year project is to
study how mineral aerosols originating as Saharan and Sahelian dust influence
West African climate, when the feedback s between dust and the climate are taken
in to account. Earlier studies without such feedbacks have shown significant
influence of dust in suppressing Monsoon circulation and rainfall over Sahel.
The project looks at the problem with feedbacks. Dust deflation and radiative
heating parameterizations developed by one of the PIs, will be incorporated in
to a GCM so that mineral aerosols can become fully interactive. Experiments will
be performed to demonstrate the significance of the mineral aerosol dust effect
in such an interactive situation which is more realistic. The proposed research
is important to find out the effect of dust on the climate of Sahel and to
understand the implications of different types of land use and agriculture.
