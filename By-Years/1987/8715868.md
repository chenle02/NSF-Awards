Abundant hyporheic (interstitial riverine) biota were collected within a grid of
shallow (10m) wells as far as 2.5 kilometers from the channel of the Flathead
River, MT, which confirms a greatly extended spatial dimension in river ecology.
This research addresses several community level hypotheses in an attempt to
describe and differentiate the hyporheic fauna (microbes and invertebrates) and
the functional role of the hyporheic zone in influencing biota and processes in
the benthos (channel) of alluvial rivers. Flathead River hyporheic Plecoptera
are very abundant and intraspecific selection pressures resulting in
reproductive isolation is suggested by the presence of polymorphic populations.
The project will also involve the reproductive strategies of these stoneflies.
The energy base of the apparently complex hyporheic food web is unknown, and it
is hypothesized that interstitial entrainment of riverine detritus (POM) is
important. Discharge from the hyporheic is apparently a significant source of
nitrate and biologically active phosphorus in the river. If these nutrients are
derived from communition of riverine POM within the hyporheic food web, then the
research will lay a new conceptual foundation for eosystem-level questions in
river ecology.
