A tandem double focusing mass spectrometer will be acquired to be used in
biochemical and biophysical studies on cellular function; the tandem mass
spectrometer or MS/MS will form part of the instrumentation available in the
University of California, San Francisco, Mass Spectrometry Facility, and will
also be available as part of the structural biology effort at the University.
The research to be enhanced by access to the new instrument will include
unresolved structural issues including the delineation of C- terminal peptide
sequences, the molecular nature of post- translational modifications of
proteins, the organization of membrane bound glycoprotein receptors, and
generally in studies on post translational modification of proteins such as
glycosylation and phosphorylation. MS/MS data will complement and confirm data
from protein sequencing, DNA sequencing, and other macromolecular and
instrumental analyses.
