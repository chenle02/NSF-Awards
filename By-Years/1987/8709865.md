The long term objective of this project is to define the relationship between
the events of embryonic development and regulated gene expression in the sea
urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. The specific goals are to characterize
the molecular details of the regulation of expression of particular actin genes
which are differentially expressed in development. Analysis of transcription in
isolated nuclei has indicated that the expression of two cytoskeletal actin
genes and the single muscle actin gene is transcriptionally regulated in
embryos. Dr. Crain will determine whether the expression of these three actin
genes is correctly regulated in interspecific hybrid embryos. The temporal
expression of these genes will be assayed by protection of gene and species
specific riboprobes from RNase digestion and the spatial expression will be
determined by in situ hybridization analysis. Interspecific hybrid embryos of
the sea urchin species A. purpuratus and Lytechinus pictus will be constructed
in both directions to assess the effect of maternal trans-acting factors on
expression of these genes. Mapping of the position of transcription initiation
for the muscle actin gene will be done. This information will allow the use of
this gene to ask what sequences are important for the muscle specific expression
and to ask whether and RNA polymerase III/SINE, which is located within the
first intron, plays a role in regulating its expression. Understanding the
differential regulation of genes during embryogenesis is basic to an
understanding of development at a molecular level. Dr. Crain is using a well
established model system, the developing sea urchin, to study this question.
