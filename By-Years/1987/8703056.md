The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center will be host to the Second International
Symposium on the Production and Decay of Heavy Flavors from September 1-5, 1987.
The Symposium will be devoted to experimental and theoretical problems involving
heavy quarks. The meeting is intended to be one of a series, the first one
having been held at Heidelberg (May 20-23, 1986) sponsored by the University of
Heidelberg and the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron Laboratory, DESY. About 150
participants are expected for the 1987 meeting. There will be about 50 speakers
from Europe, Japan and the United States. A number of presentations from
Cornell, DESY and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center will describe heavy
flavor quarks as seen in e+e- interactions. B-quark and c-quark physics results
obtained from the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) and Fermilab
experiments will also be presented. New results from Tristan and the Stanford
Linear Collider are anticipated. The meeting will have a strong emphasis on
facilities and experimental techniques for future heavy flavor programs.
