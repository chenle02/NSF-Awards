This proposal seeks funds to enhance the skills of mathematics and science
teachers in the middle school. The project is a three year program involving a
total of 160 middle school teachers in an integrated approach to improving
science and mathematics instruction in middle schools. It will provide pairs of
educators, a science teacher and a mathematics teacher, from participating
middle schools in the Jacksonville State University area in a six- week summer
institute. During the summer institute program, participants will take courses
which will include topics in mathematics, and laboratory experience. The courses
will be taught by teams of mathematicians, educators, and a laboratory assisted
scientists and will emphasize applications and ways to achieve desirable
solutions and conclusions through skillful reading techniques. The science
course will allow participants to engage in hands-on experiments appropriate for
middle school students to broaden their understanding of selected topics. In
addition, participants will attend weekly seminars involving the use of the
latest technology in teaching. Cost sharing is equivalent to 10% of the NSF
award.
