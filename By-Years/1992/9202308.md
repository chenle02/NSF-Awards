A new materials processing system is used to rapidly solidify liquid metal from
an undercooled state. This facility incorporates electromagnetic levitation and
free fall in a drop tube with rapid solidification by melt spinning in an
ultrahigh vacuum environment. A set of titanium/rare-earth alloys has been
selected for study because previous research has demonstrated significant
microstructural improvement after rapid solidification from a deep undercooled
condition. The experimental method consists of three phases: (1) materials
evaluation; (2) undercooling and recalescence modeling; and (3) ultra-rapid
quench processing with consolidation into bulk samples. Scanning and
transmission electron microscopy are used to characterize the samples. %%% This
undercool-rapid quench processing system could be scaled up for
commercialization. This research should permit the evaluation of the benefits of
the process for a series of titanium alloys, as well as supplying scientific
information on the process.
