Catalytically stabilized combustion is a promising way to extract energy in
well controlled, uniform conditions. Such improvements will be documented in the
laboratory, with extensive measurements and computational techniques. Laser
induced fluorescence will be the principal form of diagnostics whereas
supercomputers will allow for an accurate account of chemical kinetics. Unsteady
conditions and soot formation will be investigated also. Catalysis will allow
for much more efficient and pollution-free combustion than is currently possible
in piston and turbine engines, where flame propagation is intrinsically hard to
control. It will also adjust easily to changes of regime, a frequent situation
in automotive applications.
