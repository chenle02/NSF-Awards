This six-month award will provide support for US researchers to attend a
workshop on disordered systems in Andalo, Italy, March 12 - 15, 2000. Joseph
Feldman, Center for Computational Materials Science, Naval Research Laboratory
is the US organizer; Gabriele Viliani, Department of Physics, Trento University,
Italy is the European co-organizer. Although this is the eighth workshop of its
type, it is the first at which US researchers will be a strong presence. The
workshop will focus on an understanding of the glass transition and of the high-
frequency dynamics in glasses. The purpose of US attendance is to develop
ongoing collaboration between US and European researchers in the field of
disordered systems.
