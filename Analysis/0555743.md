Many natural phenomena involve several time scales. One of the most powerful
tools in studying multiscale systems is the method of averaging which consists
in replacing the fast variables by their effective contributions. The goal of
current proposal is to use recent advances in dynamical system such as parameter
elimination method, smoothness of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures and limit theorems
for partially hyperbolic systems for providing efficient ways of writing down
and rigorously justifying the averaged equations for a broad class of systems.

The intellectual merit of this proposal is in providing a better understanding
of stochasticity in differential equations. Since multiscale systems contain
rapidly oscillating variables they should often exhibit a sensitive dependence
on initial conditions providing one of the most natural mechanisms of
randomness. The broad impact of the proposed research is in development of the
new tools for studying complicated equations. The averaging method allows to
decrease the dimension of the problem and henceto make it amenable to numerical
investigation. The results of this research should be of interest in any fields
studying multiscale systems from molecular dynamics to astronomy.
