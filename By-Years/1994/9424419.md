9424419 Sokol This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
introduces the application of concurrent engineering methods to the materials
industry. Discrete product manufacturers have utilized computer-based tools such
as computer-aided design (CAD), but materials suppliers perform the materials
product design function relying on the traditional paper-based approach for
documentation and communication. SBIR Phase I research produced a conceptual
design and a specification definition language for capturing materials
specifications in a structured electronic format. Phase II is expected to
validate the design of a concurrent engineering design software system and
extend the scope of application to forging and casting design activities. A
complete working prototype will be developed in coordination with two industrial
partners and with the subcontract support of the Society of Automotive Engineers
(SAE) and the Edison Materials Technology Center of Kettering, OH. A significant
commercial potential for this software rests in large cost savings and quality
improvements made possible through new applications of concurrent engineering
design techniques in materials and related industries.
