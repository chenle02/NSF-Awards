A novel pulsatile jet propulsion scheme for low speed maneuvering of small
underwater robots is developed, demonstrated, and characterized. This propulsion
scheme is loosely analogous to that used by squid and jellyfish. The potential
for pulsatile jet propulsion is explored by first optimizing the design of a
pulsatile jet actuator and associated actuation concepts. Next, a vehicle-level
fluid dynamical model is developed in order to capture the interaction of the
pulsatile jet flows with the primary flow past the vehicle. Prior development in
nonlinear averaging-based vehicle feedback control schemes is adapted to this
technology using such models. The pulsatile jet prototypes and control scheme is
integrated into a prototype underwater vehicle, whose performance is
characterized. The suggested propulsion scheme has very few moving parts, has no
protruding components that increase drag, and takes up relatively little
volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate engineering students are heavily
involved in the design, fabrication, and testing of the pulsatile jet actuators
and underwater vehicle prototypes proposed in this project. These activities
provide excellent hands-on engineering experiences for the participating
students.&lt;br/&gt;
