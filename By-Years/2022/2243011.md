The Earthâ€™s climate changes present a challenge to astronomical observations.
Astronomers understand the science of climate change and interact with a wide
audience. The investigators will provide education materials for astronomers,
such as videos or lesson plans, to communicate climate change and its impacts
effectively. The investigators will also work to improve resources that have
already been developed. The materials will be made accessible through the
Astronomers for Planet Earth (A4E) network. These resources will enable
astronomers to use their knowledge and experience as scientists to address
climate change in a wide variety of educational
contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to: (1) produce a
clear mechanism and organizational structure by which members can share and
access materials, and significantly increase the number and range of available
resources; and (2) communicate with A4E members about what resources members
want and have, and work with members to assess ease of access to relevant
materials. In support of these goals, the investigators will collect and curate
existing resources; perform a materials and needs assessment; test and refine
the resource organization; and communicate and distribute materials, inspiring
their use. They will publicize the tools and resources through the A4E network,
A4E newsletters, and at astronomy meetings around the country. The investigators
will encourage student researchers, from a diverse community, training and
enabling young students to participate in this important
effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
