The mechanism of Electro-Weak symmetry breaking is still not understood. LHC
will probe the relevant energy range in a few years and will hopefully provide
the necessary clues that will lead to a solution. Since no approach to
explaining electroweak symmetry breaking is presently theoretically compelling
and experimentally tested, it is worthwhile to explore any approach that might
lead to progress in this area. The PI's propose to both explore alternative
approaches in the sense of building models, and to work out constraints from
collider and precision data. One aspect of this proposal is to explore an
alternative to the Higgs mechanism as the origin of mass. The idea is to use
Kaluza-Klein towers of massive vector bosons to delay the unitarity violations
that occur without a Higgs mechanism. The PI?s plan to further study this model
and its generalizations. Having an alternative scenario for generating mass
other than a Higgs particle will be very important if the Higgs is not found at
Tevatron or LHC energies.
