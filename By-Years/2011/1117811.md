Mobile content distribution (MCD) is an important emerging application in
vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Its high and stable data rate requirement
puts significant stress on the severely bandwidth-limited and highly mobile
VANETs. Symbol level network coding (SLNC) provides better error-resilience and
in turn higher spatial reusability for wireless transmission. It thus is a
promising approach for the very bandwidth-hungry MCD networks. This project
focuses on two main fundamental problems related to exploiting SLNC for MCD in
VANETs. First, a theoretic study on the network capacity and performance bounds
achievable by SLNC in mobile wireless networks is carried out. A new model is
proposed to characterize the SLNC operation in a flow network setting. Key
factors that impact the achievable throughput are identified. Methods to derive
accumulated throughput for a mobile receiver following certain mobility pattern
are investigated. The second research focus is on the design of distributed and
localized algorithms and protocols for MCD networks using SLNC. A suite of new
network protocols for SLNC-based MCD network are proposed in order to maximize
the throughput of the MCD network.
