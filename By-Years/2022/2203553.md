Map services, including finding the route to a certain destination or searching
for nearby facilities, have empowered a variety of ubiquitous services and
applications, including transportation, location-based services, ride-sharing,
and a broader delivery industry. A major assumption for all such services is
that the underlying map is accurate, which is not always true. Maps suffer from
all sorts of inaccuracies that impact the optimality of map services. While this
may be acceptable for causal users where inaccuracy may only mean few minutes of
delay, it is not the case for applications that support map services for large
numbers of users. Recent reports show that map inaccuracy in the USA costs
delivery companies alone billions of dollars annually. This trend is just going
to increase with the increase of online shoppers and riders, which shifts
traffic from casual users to delivery companies and ride sharing services. This
project aims to conduct research, develop requisite knowledge, and build
software infrastructure that will significantly boost the accuracy of the
underlying map, which will have a direct impact on map services
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to achieve its goals through
exploiting two orthogonal directions. First, building the most comprehensive and
accurate maps worldwide, with a broad definition of a map that goes beyond the
traditional map topology to a richer definition that includes traffic-related
metadata, without which, most of map services will have low accuracy. This is
achieved through harnessing trajectory data and open-source maps to identify and
infer missing information. Second, developing new techniques that would increase
the accuracy of query processors over the accurately built maps. This is
achieved through understanding the error patterns of query processors and using
it to calibrate the query results, while taking advantage of the accurately
built maps and their metadata.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
