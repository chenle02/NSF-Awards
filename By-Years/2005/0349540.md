A grant has been awarded to Dr. Larry M. Page, Florida Museum of Natural
History, to organize and conduct an interdisciplinary workshop that will bring
together representatives of professional scientific societies and museums and
other research institutions for the purpose of producing a long-term vision for
taxonomy and natural history collections. Important research areas and questions
that require taxonomic research and natural history collections will be
identified. In addition, workshop participants will identify educational
challenges and opportunities related to taxonomic research and natural history
collections, both in terms of educating a new generation of taxonomists and in
making taxonomic knowledge accessible to the public and educators. Acknowledging
that conservation biologists and resource managers depend on accurate taxonomies
and museum collection records for prioritizing areas for protection and for
informed management policies, participants will recommend ways to expedite the
process of species discovery and description.

A preliminary report will be sent electronically to NSF by January 31, 2004, and
a printed final report submitted to NSF by May 15, 2004.
