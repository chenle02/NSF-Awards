This equipment proposal is for the purchase of a Fourier Transform
Infrared/Internal Reflection Spectrometer (FTIR/IRS) for the study of chemically
modified oxide surfaces (eg silica) and their applications. The modified
surfaces will consist of a solid substrate modified by surface-graft
polymerization or surface silylation. The proposed study of surface-grafting
polymerization and silylation will consist of in situ studies of the kinetics
and efficiency of surface activation and surface polymerization. This
information will be used to support ongoing work on the synthesis of novel
polymer-solid matrix resins for aqueous exclusion chromatography, adhesion
enhancement in polymer composites, and rheology of interacting colloids as occur
in the manufacture high performance ceramics.
