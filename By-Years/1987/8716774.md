This proposal requests partial support for travel (mainly international) to an
American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference on the Amazon River dispersal
system. The conference will be held in the U.S. and will bring together the
scientists (principally South American and U. S. scientists ) who have been
studying the Amazon River and the dispersal of its sediment onto the adjacent
continental shelf. The conference will promote international collaboration of
geologists, oceanographers, and climate modelers and will provide the most
effecient mechanism for an international group of scientists to share and
synthesize the results of their various research projects underway or completed
over the last decade.
