The primary goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the
influence of atmospheric aerosols on climate. In particular, the relationships
between aerosol composition and aerosol radiative and cloud droplet activation
properties will be tested. The plan is to measure time-dependent variations of
aerosol chemical composition across the particle size spectrum, and to examine
how that variability affects calculated and measured optical and droplet-
nucleating properties of the aerosol, as a function of particle size. An
ancillary objective is to compare measurements made in a small urban environment
with those at a remote mid-continental site, both in Wyoming. A comprehensive
range of aerosol instruments will be employed to measure aerosol composition,
size distribution, cloud drop nucleating properties, scattering at three
wavelengths, and light absorption. Of particular importance will be the use of
an aerosol mass spectrometer to measure the variability of particle size-
resolved composition over time scales as short as a few minutes. These
measurements, coupled with size distribution measurements, will permit optical
and cloud condensation properties of the aerosol to be calculated with a
similarly high time resolution, and compared with observations. Analysis of
these comparisons will provide estimates of the importance of size and temporal
variability of aerosol properties, and, thus, the appropriateness of model
estimates which use averages of those properties to describe aerosol behavior.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analysis of these data sets will contribute to our
understanding of the impacts of aerosol on the Earth's atmosphere. Additional
broader impacts include capacity building at the University of Wyoming, and the
training of a graduate student.
