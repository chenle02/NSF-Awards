The broader impact of this I-Corps project includes exploring the commercial
potential of a novel solar cell for simultaneous electricity storage and
generation. The technology may also enable long-term sustainability of the
nation's energy resources. The proposed technology applies recent advances in
photoelectrochemical cells and high-capacity photochromic materials to solar
cells that could potentially enable all-day solar power. The proposed customer-
discovery efforts will lead to expanded technical capacity of the developed
technology. Commercializing this technology is expected to enable both overall
energy load management and shorter term bridging power of solar cells, and
address the growing need for daily renewable energy supply with the expanding
penetration of solar energy into the U.S. If successful, this will also minimize
the need to build and operate spinning-reserve power plants, a method employed
today to close the gaps between power consumption and
generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores commercial
application opportunities for next-generation solar cells with integrated
storage capability. Currently, most solar batteries are simply a physical
addition of a storage device such as a battery or supercapacitor to a solar
cell. Such construction involves complicated cell architectures and control
processes, and can be prohibitively expensive. To circumvent the problems with
the current state-of-the-art in solar energy storage, this proposed technology
centers on a dual-function electrode on a photoelectrochemical cell
construction, which simultaneously generates and stores electricity during the
day, and discharge at night. Differentiators include: simple construction
resulting in lower fabrication and maintenance costs, easy scalability and
market penetration since the modular panel design is compatible with the
existing PV infrastructure; low maintenance because at night or under low-light
conditions the discharge is automatically activated.
