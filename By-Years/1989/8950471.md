This project gives Chemistry and Geology students laboratory experience in the
use of high performance (HPLC) and ion chromatography (IC), two widely used
analytical methods. HPLC has become the method-of-choice for the separation and
quantitative determination of small amount of many non-volatile or thermally
labile compounds in a variety of matrices such as pharmaceutical and
environmental samples. IC is a rapidly growing method that is especially well-
suited to the determination of anions. The combination HPLC/IC instrument along
with a microcomputer gives students hands-on experience in both methods. IR and
thin layer chromatography are use to identify the alkaloids and choose the
optimum solvent system. The computer data system collects HPLC/IC data and
creates data files for export to other software systems. IC is used to determine
several anions in natural water samples or food extracts. The effects of solvent
modification on IC is demonstrated and the comparison with other methods of
anion analysis is preformed. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funds.
