Title: Optimizing Performance and Reliability in Distributed Computing Systems
Through Wide Spectrum Storage Services&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Logistical
Networking promotes an innovative model of network storage that views data
transmission and storage as part of a unified framework, just as military or
industrial logistics view transportation lines and storage depots as coordinate
elements of a single infrastructure. Under the Logistical Computing and
Internetworking (LoCI) project, we have created and implemented a primitive
abstraction of network storage, called the Internet Backplane Protocol (IBP)
[43], as the lowest network layer in a "storage stack" for Logistical
Networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to test
this hypothesis by creating a Logistical Runtime System (LoRS) designed to
support advanced applications on a well-provisioned network of IBP-based
storage, and then exploring its value and performance along several dimensions
using real-world Grid applications.&lt;br/&gt;
