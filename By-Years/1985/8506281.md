A Micro VAX II Computer and a Micro PDP 11/73 Computer are being acquired. This
equipment will be used for: projects on process control which include simulation
of heat integrated towers and crude towers, the application of predictive
control to distillation, and development of short-cut dynamic tower models; and
research on polymerization processes directed toward developing detailed dynamic
models and control strategies including online control of batch polymerization
reactors and the stochastic control of continuous polymerization reactors.
