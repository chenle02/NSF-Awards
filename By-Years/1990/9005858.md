Tools will be developed for assessing sensitivity of results to assumptions
about the prior probability distribution (which represents knowledge gained from
sources other than the data being analyzed). A deeper understanding of the role
of parameterization of statistical models will be gained through the development
of diagnostics for the detection of a poor approximation by a Normal
distribution to another distribution. The focus will be the approximation of the
posterior distribution which is the basis for inference in a Bayesian analysis.
Appropriate numerical integration strategies will be incorporated in a computing
environment for Bayesian analysis. Further work will be carried out on
asymptotic Bayesian inference for nonparametric problems in which the
assumptions of the statistical model are greatly weakened.
