9732150 Schulz Many body interaction dynamics are probed in unprecedented detail
for positron-atom, proton-atom and neutral Hydrogen-atom collisions. The
experimental results will be used to resolve long standing questions concerning
the direct and exchange collision amplitudes for these interactions.
