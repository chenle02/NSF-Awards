Dr. D. Sarah Stamps has been awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral
Fellowship to conduct research and develop a GPS geodesy education program while
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This project aims to confirm and
elucidate the origin of the dynamic processes driving rift-parallel surface
deformation observed along the East African Rift, an archetype continental rift
system. Dr. Stamps will (1) occupy geodetic benchmarks with Global Positioning
System (GPS) instruments at previously measured sites along the Western Branch
and Rukwa Rift where rift-parallel deformation is indicated, and (2) test
candidate mechanisms for rift-parallel deformation using an adaptive finite
element technique that can solve viscoelastic and time-dependent problems at
various spatial scales. Verifying the existence of rift-parallel deformation
along the East African Rift and determining the responsible mechanism(s) will
provide a more complete understanding of rifting
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of GPS as a tool for monitoring active
deformation is vital for advancing knowledge of seismic and volcanic hazards.
This project supports the development of a GPS geodesy training program aimed at
educating university students to observe millimeter precision surface motions
with GPS. The pilot program will be implemented at the University of
Antananarivo, Madagascar and documented for future GPS geodesy capacity building
efforts in developing countries and within the US.
