New School University doctoral student Zohar Rotem, under the supervision of Dr.
Lawrence Hirschfeld, will conduct research on how Israeli children develop their
internalized social categories of "Jew" and "Arab." Social category
distinctions, manifested in beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, are often taken
for granted. Nevertheless, they are learned distinctions and it is not well
understood how that learning takes place. The researcher will focus attention on
how children incorporate these socially prescribed distinctions to make meaning
in their daily lives, examining how such beliefs are taught as well as learned.

The research will be conducted in Israel, in a bilingual/bicultural school for
Jewish and Arab students, and outside the school, in children's homes and the
wider community. The researcher will construct an ethnographic description of
children's lives in these settings. In addition, experimental methods, adapted
from cognitive-developmental psychology, will be used to assess children's
beliefs (e.g., about the degree to which these ethno-national categories are
"natural") that children otherwise have difficulty articulating.

This research is both timely and important, as it will shed light on the ways in
which ethno-national differences, in the context of violent and intractable
ethnic conflict, emerge in children's lives and are reproduced in society. The
research will also inform the work of educators as they seek to alleviate inter-
group tensions and enmity.
