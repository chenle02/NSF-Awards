This proposal is concerned with a theoretical study on upset forging of
cylinders which is used to determine the material formability. The latter is
normally based on a strain criterion which cannot correlate all observed failure
modes. Dr. Lee will use the more realistic porous plasticity, which is based on
void nucleation, growth and coalescence, in a finite element model to simulate
upset forging. Detailed histories of stress and strain distributions as well as
the evolution of void growth will be used to predict the failure modes. The
theoretical results will be evaluated against existing numerical and
experimental results. The important material and processing variables thus
identified will then be used to predict the failures of other metal-forming
processes, such as forging, extrusion and rolling. Although young, Dr. Lee is
most likely to succeed in meeting his research objectives at this Predominantly
Undergraduate Institution.
