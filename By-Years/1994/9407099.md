9407099 Schoonen The objective of the research is to evaluate through
experimental studies and field work the role sulfur oxyanions may play in
hydrothermal systems. Because little is known about the stability of these
sulfur species, the PI has conducted experiments in the first stage of this
program to study the stability of thiosulfate. For this funding cycle, the PI
proposes to focus the experimental work on the formation of thiosulfate. Two
pathways for thiosulfate formation: 1) H2S-SO4 equilibration in the presence of
mineral surfaces and metal ions, and 2) H2S oxidation with FE(III) bearing
minerals as oxidants will be studied to temperatures up to 250oC. A third major
pathway, H2S oxidation by O2, is the focus of our field work. Yellowstone will
be used as a natural lab to complement the experimental studies at Stony Brook.
This field work will prepare us for the challenges of sampling deep hydrothermal
fluids which is a long-term objective.
