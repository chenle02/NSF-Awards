This is an SBIR Phase I award for the development of polysilylenes as liquid
scintillator material with the aim of providing radiation detectors with fast
responses and high resolution. Detectors emphasizing highly efficient photon
detection should have many commercial applications which could include oil and
gas well logging, mineral surveys, medical and remote process control. fast
gamma spectroscopy, high speed counting and tracer analytical chemistry.
