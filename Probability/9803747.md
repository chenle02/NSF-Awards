9803747 Khoshnevisan

This grant provides funds for Davar Khoshnevisan and Yimin Xiao at the
University of Utah to develop a systematic approach to the study of many of the
exceptional sets which naturally arise in the study of random fields. Special
emphasis will be placed on Gaussian random fields such as the Brownian sheet and
fractional Brownian motion. More specifically, these investigators will (1)
study precise quantitative connections between random fields, capacities and
higher--order partial differential equations; (2) develop and advance canonical
techniques for the multi-fractal and geometric analysis of a large class of
Gaussian random fields; (3) continue their on-going work on developing
connections between the theory of Gaussian processes and capacity in Wiener
space; and (4) continue their investigation of canonical heat flow on a class of
random erratic surfaces and structures.

This research will study the properties of Gaussian random fields, such as the
Brownian sheet and fractional Brownian motion. These are random fields which
play a prominent role in several disciplines in mathematics and mathematical
aspects of economics, oceanography, hydrology and physics. The goal of the
proposed research is to develop analytical tools which will lead to a better
understanding of geometric problems for random fields and help promote their
further applicability.
