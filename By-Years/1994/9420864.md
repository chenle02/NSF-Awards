This award supplies funds to the University of Pittsburgh to increase the
training of their Ph.D. graduate students in Cultural Anthropology. The funds
will be used to help the students go to the places they anticipate doing their
dissertation field work, or else to accompany a faculty adviser to a field site
to work with the adviser in a traineeship. This award will increase the
scientific capacity of US social scientists by expanding opportunities for
training in ethnographic techniques of field research before the critically
important Ph.D. research.
