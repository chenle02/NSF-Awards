This grant funds the development, testing, and distribution of innovative
microelectronics educational materials and the execution of a pilot project on
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These materials are for both lecture and
lab use in a variety of courses and employ multiple media in creative and
dynamic ways. The first materials have already been developed and tested at the
University of Hawaii, Stanford University and at the University of California
Berkeley. The FPGA pilot project manages the evaluation of FPGA kits at 15
universities and provides FPGA bulletin-board support as a pilot study of the
feasibility of a national FPGA support center. Testing at several sites began in
the fall of 1990, with materials being widely distributed in the summer of 1991.
