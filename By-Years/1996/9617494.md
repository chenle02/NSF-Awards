Burrows, Adam AST 96-17494 Dr. Burrows continues his theoretical investigations
into the physics and the mechanisms of core- collapse supernovae. He will refine
the treatment of neutrino transport and multi-dimensional effects to determine
their roles in the mechanism of core-collapse. By extending his previous work to
consider a range of progenitor masses, he will investigate the systematic
effects the structure of the progenitor star has on features such as the delay
to explosion, the explosion energy, the mass cut and the ejecta electron
fractions. In addition, he will investigate the hypothesis that r-process heavy
element nucleosynthesis occurs in the wind from the star late in the supernovae
explosion by detailed modeling of the dependence of nucleosynthesis to wind
properties. He will also explore the effects that asymmetries in the core itself
may have on both the core collapse and its signature as gravitational waves and
neutrinos. ***
