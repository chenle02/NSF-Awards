Coelenterates include the invertebrate jellyfish and their relatives, and were
the first group of animals to have a recognizable nervous system. This symposium
on their neurobiology emphasizes neurotransmitters, neural pathways, and sensory
receptors, in the context of mechanisms underlying behavior. It presents and
integrates recent discoveries from modern neuroscience, genomics and
phylogenetics about an evolutionarily crucially important group of animals. This
Symposium is part of the International Conference on Coelenterate Biology (which
last met in 1995), which attracts investigators from many different countries,
and the this is the first time this meeting has been held in the USA.&lt;br/&gt;
This symposium will have scientific impact on understanding evolution of nervous
systems from some of the simplest forms of neuronal nets and the first sensory
organs, and will have impact beyond neuroscience to a better understanding of
the evolutionary importance of the coelenterates. Additionally, the conference
attendance of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral workers and
junior faculty will insure several opportunities for promoting interactions with
established laboratories that will have impacts on the careers of young
investigators.
