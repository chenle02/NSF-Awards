At its maximum extent in the early spring, antarctic pack ice covers an area
roughly equal to that of the antarctic continent; by late summer only remnants
remain in the Weddell Sea and other coastal areas. Thus, the ice edge zone is a
major feature of the antarctic region and one that includes most of the
surrounding seas at some time during the annual cycle. Productivity at the ice
edge appears to be higher than in either the open ocean or pack-ice region, and
it has been hypothesized that the ice edge is an important feeding area for
birds and mammals. A multidisciplinary program was developed to obtain data on
the physics, chemistry, and biology of the ice-edge zone in order to better
understand the overall importance of the ice edge for antarctic productivity and
ecology. Garrison's project is one component of this program AMERIEZ (Antarctic
Marine Ecosystem Research at the Ice Edge Zone). This project is now in its
final analysis and synthesis stage. This project will complete the examination
of the protozoans in the vicinity of the ice edge to determine their abundance,
distribution, species composition, and role in the food web. This is an
Accomplishment Based Renewal.
