Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include work at the
interface between particle physics and cosmology and work motivated by the
superstring models of the basic forces and particles. The cosmology - related
research will deal with the role of quantum mechanics in the inflation of the
universe and with the generation of galaxy - sized structure in the universe.
This research addresses very important issues relating to the evolution of the
universe.
