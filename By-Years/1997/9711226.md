9711226 Yu The proposed research is directed at the chain dynamics on surfaces
of water, polymer covered glasses and silicon wafers in order to investigate the
influence of confined geometries on the chain motions. In addition, interest is
focused on the chain diffusion in highly interacting systems wherein the
diffusants are known to impact on rheology of the entire system even when they
are present as minor components. With the interfacial dynamic techniques of
surface fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, surface quasielectric light
scattering, in-plane steady shear viscosity by canal flow, in conjunction with
the interfacial static techniques of atomic force microscopy, x-ray photon
spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and spectroscopic elllipsometry, the PI will
examine 1) polyelectrolyte diffusion on functionalized glass surfaces, 2)
polymer monolayer shear viscosity and dilational viscoelasticity at the
air/water interface, 3) polymer diffusion as a function of film thickness, and
4) polyelectrolyte diffusion on planar surfaces consisting of polar heads of
surfactant molecules. %%% The purposes of the proposed research are to come up
with better materials design methods covering a wide range of advanced organic
materials that are used in many different applications such as in artificial
organs and implants, all spill confinement materials, drug delivery devices, and
lubricants. This study is at the molecular level. ***
