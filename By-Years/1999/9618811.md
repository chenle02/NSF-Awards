Abstract MARTIN, C. AST-9618811 The goals of this project are (1) to make
possible new ground-based, diffraction-limited imaging spectroscopic
observations of major astronomical significance, including imaging spectroscopy
of protoplanetary disks and active galactic nuclei, and astrometric imaging of
globular cluster cores; (2) to develop a new multi-aperture, wide-field
interferometer that will record the field-angle and subaperture-dependent phase
information required for diffraction-limited post-processed imaging
spectroscopy; (3) achieving a deeper level of understanding of atmospheric
turbulence, its optical consequences and correction; and (4) to develop an
alternative approach to active correction (Adaptive Optics) that utilizes full
post-processing.
