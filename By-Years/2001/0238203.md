The performance, cost, and power requirements of future applications will strain
the incumbent sequential processing models. Simultaneously, implementation
trends point towards partitioned (rather than monolithic) designs. Correctness-
performance partitioning (CPP) is a promising approach that exploits
partitioning while accommodating existing sequential software. CPP divides
execution responsibilities among multiple processing partitions. The correctness
(C) partition produces the sequential instruction stream expected by the
programmer and inter-operating applications. One or more optional performance
(P) partitions accelerate the C-partition by warming up its caches and supplying
it with pre-computed values. With minimal performance responsibilities,
C-partitions can be simple, compatible, and reusable. With no correctness
requirements, P-partitions can be simple, powerful, and efficient. C and P
partitions can be composed to form efficient designs for different processing
niches. A single C-partition can be used in isolation (or with a simple
P-partition) as a power-conscious embedded processor. Multiple C and P
partitions can be combined to create a high-performance server processor. The
CPP approach simplifies both software and hardware development.

Two instances of CPP have been previously studied. We have developed a new
value-communication mechanism that enables others. We will explore the
theoretical aspects of CPP and the practical implications of promising schemes.
