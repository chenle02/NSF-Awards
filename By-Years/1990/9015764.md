This proposal requests partial support for a Gordon Conference on the topic of
"Enzyme Organization and Cell Function." The conference has been held twice
previously in 1987 and 1989 with great success. Monies requested will be used to
support the travel and subsistence of participants. The topic of the conference
deals with a most important topic: how do the structure and organization of
enzymes in living cells affect their function. Some important areas to be
covered include the formation of multienzyme complexes, direct transfer of
metabolic intermediates, the effect of intracellular conditions on enzyme
activity, theoretical and experimental approaches to enzyme regulation, as well
as the transport, maturation and processing of proteins.*** //
