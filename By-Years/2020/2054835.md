Random matrix theory has proven useful in a wide range of disciplines, including
condensed matter physics, high dimensional statistics, number theory, and
network theory. The utility of random matrices lies in the universality of their
eigenvalue and eigenvector statistics for very large matrices. This phenomenon
depends only on the underlying symmetry and is independent of the law of
individual entries. This research project aims to broaden understanding of the
universality phenomenon of random matrices and to develop new tools and
techniques for more applications of random matrix theory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore two research directions related
to random matrix theory. In the first direction, the project aims to understand
the spectral properties of adjacency matrices of random d-regular graphs. The
sparsity and dependency among entries make the analysis of such models more
challenging than that for Wigner-type random matrices. The investigator and
collaborators previously proved the universality of the local spectral
statistics for sparse random graphs with growing degrees. The project's goal is
to understand the local statistics of random d-regular graphs with fixed degree,
particularly the fluctuations of extreme eigenvalues of random d-regular graphs.
This will provide insights for the universality phenomenon for extremely sparse
systems and is expected to have applications in theoretical computer science. In
the second direction, the investigator aims to study statistical learning
models, such as deep neural networks and tensor models. Even though these models
are built out of random matrices and random tensors, the powerful machinery of
random matrix theory has so far found limited success in studying them, due to
the nonlinearity. This project seeks to develop random matrix theory to
incorporate nonlinearity and open the door for more applications of random
matrix theory to statistical learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
