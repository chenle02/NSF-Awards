This study focuses on several globally important, crustforming orogenic
processes that have been active during the complex tectonic history of the
Pacific margin of Antarctica. This award supports a comprehensive geophysical
survey (i.e., MCS, gravity, magnetics, sonobuoys and multi- beam bathymetry) of
two parts of the Antarctic Peninsula to illuminate the role of the South
Shetland Islands-Bransfield Trough region as a modern analog of Andean orogenic
processes and as a specific step toward tectonic reconnaissance of the less
accessible and therefore more poorly known parts of the West Antarctic margin
bordering the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas. By integrating the marine data
with onshore geologic observations and kinematic plate motion histories, this
investigation should be able to make real progress towards increased
understanding of the following processes: Andean-type orogenesis; continental
lithosphere extension in a convergent continental margin setting; ridge crest
subduction; and interaction of large- offset fracture zones with convergent
margins, including the uplift of subduction complexes. The study will provide
impetus for the U.S. Antarctic Geoscience Initiative by undertaking the most
ambitious Antarctic marine geophysical study yet carried out by any nation.
