This project develops a theoretical framework that enables an analytical
characterization of guidance laws for obstacle avoidance, accompanied by an
experimental validation of these laws. This has significant implications since
the obstacle avoidance problem is an important component of the path planning
problem, which appears in several diverse fields including robotics, autonomous
air, ground and underwater vehicles, computer animation, molecular motion,
autonomous wheelchairs, spacecraft avoiding space debris, robotic surgery,
assistance aids for the blind, etc. The guidance laws designed are particularly
applicable for real-time implementation of precise path planning in cluttered
dynamic environments such as those containing robot manipulators, humanoid
robots, vehicles flying in formation and other high-dimensional spaces wherein
the agents have no a priori information about their environment. A robustness
analysis of the designed guidance laws to various uncertainties such as sensor
noise, data delays and data dropouts is performed, followed by an experimental
validation wherein the guidance laws are coded on microcontroller platforms in a
resource-efficient manner and implemented on small-scale robotic ground and air
vehicles. The expected results include guidance laws suitable for collision
avoidance of obstacles of various, possibly time-varying, shapes moving in high-
dimensional stochastic environments, along with a postulation of the safety
guarantees of these guidance laws. This project also performs multiple outreach
activities and introduces new curriculum that promote the education and
applications of robotics, and these activities are conducted in levels starting
from K-12 all the way through undergraduate and graduate level engineering
education.
