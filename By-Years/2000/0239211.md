The goal of this international cooperative research project between Gregory Taft
and Thomas George of the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and their
Hungarian partners, Laszlo Nanai and Sandor Szatmari of the University of
Szeged, is to understand the physical processes occurring in semiconductors at
femtosecond time scales. The Hungarian expertise in experimental laser physics
complements that of the Stevens Point group whose strengths include femtosecond
pulse generation and measurement and theory of laser-matter interaction.
Together, these U.S. and Hungarian physicists will examine the Dember electric
field effect and its role in earliest stages of the charge carrier evolution.
They expect to determine if that effect could become large enough to initiate
structural changes in semiconductors. Results are expected refine the
theoretical framework and improve our basic understanding of the propagation of
fast electronic signals in semiconductors, with potentially broad general
applications in high-speed optical communications.

This project in experimental physical chemistry fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
