One increasingly important resource for victims of intimate partner violence
(IPV) is domestic violence civil protection orders. Using theories of legal
mobilization and legal consciousness to guide our analysis, this project is
designed to better understand why some victims mobilize the civil court system
as a resource by filing for protection orders and, conversely, why some victims
do not. Through the use of both quantitative (survey) and qualitative
(interview) methods, this study focuses on how victims conceptualize the role of
the legal system in regard to the abuse they have experienced, who chooses to
use protection orders, why they are used, the perceived costs and benefits of
protection orders for victims, and the individual and structural barriers that
prevent victims from filing for or receiving orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results of this study will address several gaps in the literature on legal
mobilization, legal consciousness, help-seeking behaviors of victims of IPV, and
inequalities in access to justice. Much previous research in this area derives
samples from victims who have already sought legal interventions and, therefore,
cannot address why victims do not ask for help from the legal system. Our sample
includes victims who have not filed for protection orders, allowing us to better
understand the decision to not file for a protection order. The findings from
this project can be used to determine unmet legal needs and barriers to
accessing the civil courts, as well as the development of best practice models
that can be adopted by policymakers, court personnel, legal advocates, and
shelters to facilitate victim access to protection orders. This research will
also help in the refinement of coordinated community responses to IPV. Finally,
results of the research will be used to identify underserved populations who may
need culturally appropriate outreach services to address many of the perceived
costs of obtaining protection orders.
