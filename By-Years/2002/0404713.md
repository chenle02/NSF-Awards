This proposal supports the participation of doctoral students from U.S.
universities in the Doctoral Consortium of the 14th International Conference on
Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) to be held June 3-7, 2004 in Whistler,
B.C., Canada. ICAPS is the premier conference for research in artificial
intelligence planning and scheduling. This Doctoral Consortium includes a Poster
Session and a mentoring program that matches PhD students with established
researchers with similar interests. The goals of the Doctoral Consortium include
providing doctoral students with valuable exposure to additional perspectives on
their work at a critical time in their research projects as well as providing
helpful career advice at a critical time in their professional development.
