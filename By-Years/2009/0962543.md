This project uses a series of decision making experiments to gather data for
understanding choice under uncertainty. The project also develops tools for the
theoretical analysis of choice under uncertainty and a blend of parametric and
non-parametric econometric techniques for testing the theory with the new data.
The theoretical and experimental aspects of the project provide a richer
understanding of risk preferences and the choices that implement them.

The experiments provide a positive account of choice under uncertainty in an
environment that allows for a general characterization of the patterns of
individual behavior. Previous data show that although there is considerable
heterogeneity in choce behavior, participants do behave in a way that is
consistent in the sense that choices maximize a consistent set of preferences.
However, subjects also use identifiable common heuristics (rules of thumb) to
make decisions. These two different kinds of behavior reflect two different
kinds of rationality: substantive rationality and procedural rationality. The
new theory combines these two different ideas into a single model and the
research team will use the new theory to develop a method to identify when
people make decisions using procedural or substantive rationality.

Understanding how people make decisions in risky situations is an important and
interdisciplinary research question that also has important implications for
public policy. The experimental platform and the analytical techniques that the
researchers are developing will be broadly useful to the research community.
