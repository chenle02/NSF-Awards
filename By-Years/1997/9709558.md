The focus of this research is to develop synthetic methodology using the
condensations of pentacovalent oxaphospholenes (P(V)'s) with various
electrophiles for the production of highly substituted phosphonates. The
methodology will be be applied to the synthesis of phosphonate analogs of
biologically active organophosphates. The reactivities of P(V)'s with differing
ligand on phosphorus and the mechanism(s) of the condensations between P(V)'s
and electrophiles will also be explored. With this renewal award, the Synthetic
Organic Program and the Office of Mutlidisciplinary Activities are supporting
the research of Dr. Cynthia K. McClure of the Department of Chemistry at Montana
State University. Professor McClure will focus her work on developing methods
for the preparation of phosphonate containing compounds of biological interest
as antimetabolites and enzyme active probes. Compounds of this type could have
medicinal value as antivirals, antibiotics, antiacidosis agents and could
exhibit herbicidal and insecticidal activity.
