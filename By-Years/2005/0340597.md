Proposal: IIS-0340597 Institution: University of Illinois PI: John Downie Title:
Workshop on the Evaluation of Music Information Retrieval

This proposal is to convene a workshop as part of the 26th Annual International
ACM SIGIR Conference to be held in Toronto this summer. Music information
Retrieval (MIR) is a rapidly emerging research area requiring new expertise and
approaches. The amount of digital music information being created and often
available via the internet has been increasing at exponential rates and has
promoted new approaches within the field of information retrieval to deal with
this unique content. The SGIR Conference is a major meeting on information
retrieval and affords many the opportunity to participate in the workshop who
might otherwise not be able to attend. Two earlier meetings in July 2002 (JCDL)
anb October 2002 (ISMIR) have provided valuable background for this workshop and
demonstrated the intense and growing interest in music information retrieval.
