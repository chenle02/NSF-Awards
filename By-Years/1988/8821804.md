This award will support the emplacement of two automactic weather station (AWS)
units on the Greenland crest. This project is support of the second Greenland
Ice Sheet Program (GISP II). The climatic objectives of the proposed AWS units
on the Greenland crest are: (1) to measure the climate at each site so that
possible differences in climate around the creast will be known: (2) to measure
the snow height with time so that the addition and removal of snow associated
with other meteorological variables will be known: (3) to measure the snow
temperature profile down to four meters in the snow and to detect possible water
vapor transfer within the snow. The meteorological objectives of the AWS units
on the Greenland crest are: (1) to estimate the sensible and latent heat fluxes
from the snow surface: (2) to describe the possible katabatic wind around the
crest: (3) to provide meteorological data for use in weather analysis and
forecasting.
