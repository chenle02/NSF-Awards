The mechanisms underlying the ontogeny of voltage-gated ion channels in muscle
are unknown. To determine whether expression of voltage-gated channels is
dependent on mitogen withdrawal and growth arrest, as is generally true for the
induction of muscle specific gene products, the BC3H1 muscle cell line is being
used as an advantageous model system. Differentiated BC3H1 myocytes form
functional calcium and sodium channels which, by patch clamp techniques were
found to correspond to those in transverse tubules of skeletal muscle. Ca and Na
channels were first detected about 4 days after mitogen withdrawal. Since
cellular ras genes have been found to have a role in the transduction of growth
factor signals, BC3H1 cells have been modified with an activated ras expression
vector. Transfection with a valine-12 c-Ha-ras vector suppressed the formation
of functional Ca channels and Na channels for more than 4 weeks. In contrast,
potassium channels were affected neither by mitogenic medium nor by the
transfected ras gene. Thus, the ras gene selectively blocked the expression of
ion channels whose induction was contingent upon mitogen withdrawal. These
studies will be extended to elucidate the mechanisms that control Ca channel
number. First, Ca channels expressed by differentiated BC3H1 muscle cells will
be thoroughly characterized. Second, growth factors that inhibit muscle-specific
gene expression in BC3H1 cells will be used under conditions that uncouple
direct effects from secondary effects of cell proliferation. Third, Ca channel
expression will be investigated in BC3H1 myocytes modified with genes that
affect myogenesis. These studies will focus on the control of Ca channel
expression by cellular ras genes and will analyze the effects produced by a
reversibly inducible ras expression vector, by a graded series of missense
mutations at codon 12 of the c-Ha-ras gene, by microinjected ras proteins, and
by blocking antibodies against p21 ras. This research represents one of the
first major efforts to elucidate the genetic mechanisms regulating the
expression of specific voltage-dependent ion channels in muscle membranes. The
proposed experiments should clarify the role of the cellular Ha-ras gene in the
control of calcium channel expression during muscle differentiation.
