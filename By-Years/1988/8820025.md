ABSTRACT Lakhota is the most viable dialect of Sioux, spoken in the northern
plains states and in central Canada. Although Sioux has been studied for nearly
150 years, there is no complete and consistent dictionary of any Siouan
language. This project will use computer generated concordances to the text
collections and extant dictionary materials to prepare the most complete and
consistent dictionary possible. Eli James, a native speaker of Lakhota Sioux,
will write the definitions and select or generate the examples and their
translations, under the supervision of the Principal Investigators and with help
from tribal elders as he needs it. The result will be orthographically
consistent, will contain all the words in the documents which have been
processed, and will be usable by both speakers and non-speakers of Lakhota. In
particular, it will contain data for phonological and semantic studies of this
rich language.
