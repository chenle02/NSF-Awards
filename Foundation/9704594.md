Miller will continue his research on o-minimal structures, concentrating mainly
on further developing the model theory and analytic geometry associated with
o-minimal expansions of the ordered field of real numbers (and their
corresponding geometric categories). This has been a rapidly-developing area for
the last several years, with many contributions from---and cooperation between
---model theorists and analytic geometers. Miller hopes to build further
interdisciplinary links by investigating possible connections and applications
of o-minimality to control theory and variational calculus. Many results of so-
called classical mathematical analysis and geometry are very general; they apply
to a wide variety of 'input', so one must expect to have to deal with a
correspondingly wide variety of 'output'. However, one could hope that if the
input is, in some respect, particularly well behaved, then the output would be
similarly well behaved. This turns out to be true in many important cases, but
to see this usually requires new, more constructive, proofs of classical
results, as well as a deeper understanding of the 'good' properties of the
input. Before such projects can be begun, though, it is necessary to have some
way of deciding which mathematical objects (inputs) should be considered as well
behaved, and those which should be considered as troublesome. (This can be a
difficult matter.) The theory of o-minimal structures on the real field, a sub-
discipline of mathematical logic, has been developed in large part to deal with
this issue. Recent years have seen rapid growth of the subject. Applications and
connections have been found in neural-net learning theory and theoretical
economics, as well as several areas of pure mathematics.
