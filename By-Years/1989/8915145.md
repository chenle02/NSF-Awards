Severe storm waves can cause downslope mass movements of a sloping seafloor in
various magnitudes including massive failure. Permanent displacements, even not
reaching a massive failure, can be large enough to be destructive to structures
on or in the seafloor. Therefore, in offshore and coastal development, both the
magnitude of permanent displacements and possibility of a massive failure must
be evaluated for intensive wave loading in order to avoid catastrophic
consequences. This research will develop a practical and yet rational analysis-
based method to evaluate wave loading in a systematic manner for slightly
sloping seafloors. The displacement-based approach will be adopted since it can
account for various complexities of wave-induced environments in a failure
evaluation and, at the same time, can provide the magnitude of the permanent
displacements. The evaluation method will be developed through wave tank model
tests, case history studies and analytical studies, and will be coded in a
computer program.
