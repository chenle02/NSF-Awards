The college will purchase equipment for its new facility for molecular and
cellular biology: a high speed centrifuge, top loading balances, an analytical
balance, a liquid scintillation counter, an electrophoresis/transillumination
system, student microscopes, and a video camera for microscopy. These
instruments will be used in a number of existing courses (introductory biology,
cytology and histology, microbiology, prokaryotic and viral genetics, and
biochemistry) and will also be used in a new course in molecular biology and in
a new laboratory course for non-science majors. The equipment will also be used
extensively in undergraduate research projects, required of all seniors. The
college will provide 50% matching funds.
