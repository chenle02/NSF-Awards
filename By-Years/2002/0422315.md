This project provides scholarships for academically talented, financially needy
students, with an emphasis on attracting women and underrepresented minorities.
It provides 85 scholarships over four years while implementing a plan to
increase the candidate pool. The project includes three faculty members from the
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, as well as the Director of
Enrollment Services &amp; Financial Aid, Assistant Director of Enrollment
Services, Executive Director of Student Services, and Program Manager of Career
Services. Recruitment will include outreach to specialized organizations such as
Women in Science and Engineering, the Urban League, and the Hispanic
organization, Adelante. Every CSEMS scholar will be paired with a faculty mentor
who will direct academic and personal interventions as necessary. Academically
challenged students will be offered extended classroom instruction or individual
tutoring. Eligible students will be offered Dowling College matching grants,
opportunities for work-study and co-op/internships.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merit: the project will advance knowledge and understanding of computer science
and mathematics in local school communities and industry.&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts: the project will make an important contribution to understanding how to
create a collegiate learning environment in which underrepresented students can
fulfill career goals.
