Abstract

Title: Analytic aspects of L-functions and their applications

This proposal is primarily concerned with the analytic aspects of automorphic
forms and automorphic L-functions related to the Ramanujan-Selberg conjecture
for GL(n) and the quantum unique ergodicity on arithmetic groups, from the
perspectives of analytic number theory.

The questions addressed to in this proposal are important open questions, the
resolution of which would have profound impact on our understanding of the
complete picture of the underlying theories. Motivated by recent advance, the
goal of the present projects is to make contributions to these fundamental
problems by refining current techniques and by exploring new approaches.
