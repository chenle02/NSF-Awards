The Principal Investigator is concerned with basic questions that arise in the
design of large-scale information systems, in particular, teletext and videotex,
developed in the last decade. The study will focus on system performance as an
integral part of system conceptualization, design, and implementation. It will
consider methods by which an information system can be configured so as to
provide good and cost-effective performance to a large number of users. The list
of research topics include: o Teletext-like information delivery on local area
networks o The use of local user terminal storage to enhance teletext system
performance o Optimum scheduling of broadcast in a videotex system o Performance
of limited-connection-time videotex systems o Videotex systems with multiple
databases
