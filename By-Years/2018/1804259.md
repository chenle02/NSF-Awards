This award enables the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) to
promote, advertise, and provide support services for the conference series known
as the NSF/CBMS Regional Research Conferences in Mathematics. These conferences,
together with the online and print materials that arise from them, spur research
in all areas of the mathematical sciences while attracting young researchers
into new, highly-active research areas. The conferences are typically held at
institutions that provide opportunities for a broad range of researchers to
engage or re-engage with important current research. Many of the hosting
departments are in Minority Serving Institutions, providing an opportunity for
students from underrepresented groups to experience what it means to participate
in the study of advanced mathematical science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this
award, CBMS works to identify the leading scholars in emerging fields who can
help to shape the next generation of researchers, as well as the venues where
such conferences can have the greatest impact, especially in attracting and
supporting researchers from underrepresented minorities. CBMS assists in the
preparation of proposals to host conferences, advertises the conferences,
assesses their impact, and disseminates the online and print products of the
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
