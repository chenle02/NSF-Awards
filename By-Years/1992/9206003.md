This project is developing the parasitic fungus Olpidium as a vehicle for
delivering foreign DNA sequences to plant cells. The experimental plan has the
following research objectives: 1) Characterize the TNV/STNV pseudovirions in
terms of composition, physical properties, and size limits of encapsidated DNA,
and refine the preparation of pseudovirions. 2) Determine Olpidium culture
parameters for best zoospore-mediated pseudovirion transfer to various hosts. 3)
Characterize transient expression of DNA introduced into plants via Olipidium
and determine the spatial and temporal patterns of such transient gene
expression in plant roots. 4) Evaluate the system for stable transformation of
plants. %%% The research will provide a ready means for the study of plant
promoters and gene expression in intact roots in a wide range of plant species.
Also, it may open new avenues for transformation of plants hitherto not amenable
to current transformation methods.
