This is a two.year collaborative research project between Robert D. Pehlke of
the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, and
Li Qingchun of the Casting Division of the Department of Metallic Materials and
Technology of the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China. The project is
sponsored jointly by NSF and the Harbin Institute of Technology. The research
program will focus on defect formation in castings with an emphasis on hot
tearing. Several front.line research issues will be addressed, including (1)
measurements of compressive >strength/resistance of green and dry sands; (2)
quantitative estimates or measurements of frictional behavior at the sand/metal
interface; (3) >determination/estima>tion of more accurate fracture or tearing
criteria; and (4) mechanical property measurements of casting alloys at and
above 80 percent of the absolute melting temperature. The assessment of fracture
criteria would be undertaken at the University of Michigan, and the high
temperature mechanical property measurements for selected alloys would be
studied at the Harbin Institute of Technology. The other issues of high
temperature sand properties and the frictional behavior at the sand/metal
interface would be jointly undertaken by groups at both institutions. The goal
of this project is to contribute to a major research activity conducted at the
University of Michigan with NSF support since 1979 in the field of
computer.aided design for castings. The research will also contribute to ongoing
research at the Harbin Institute of Technology.
