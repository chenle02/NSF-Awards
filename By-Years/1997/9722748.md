This research represents the continuation of a set of extremely successful
electron-scattering experiments in atomic hydrogen. The program uses techniques
developed earlier for measurements of integral cross sections for electron-
impact excitation to the H(2P) metastable state and the determination of the
polarization of the subsequent Lyman-a radiation. Within this new period, the
group will undertake to measure integral cross sections for excitation to the
H(2S), H(3P), and H(4P) states and the polarization of the Lyman-a and Lyman-B
radiation. New techniques will be developed to extract the fine structure
contributions of individual angular momentum components of the n=3 and n=4
states.
