This project applies the methods and principles of bioengineering in the design
and development of a tele-rehabilitation platform to allow stroke, traumatic
brain injury, and spinal cord injury patients to interact with therapists, with
family members, and with other patients. The quality of life of these patients
depends on longer-term exercise-based rehabilitation and support from the above
groups. While frequent repetition of these exercises is critical to recovery,
data indicates that compliance is very low. The proposed project seeks to
increase compliance by increasing motivation through individual and multiplayer
gaming, providing guidance and feedback, and enabling the therapist to monitor
progress. Researchers use a combination of motion tracking technology, video
games, and therapist oversight to accomplish increased compliance. The platform
has three key components: &lt;br/&gt;1. A set of computer games prescribed to
patients by therapists; &lt;br/&gt;2. A therapist portal to allow therapists to
evaluate the patient, provide feedback and instructions, and coordinate with
other providers in the course of treatment; &lt;br/&gt;3. An evidence-based
knowledgebase for the analysis of therapy outcomes for various types of
patients, conditions, and therapy regimes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two major
shifts define the current trend in rehabilitation: The first is the shift toward
evidence-based medicine. The second is the shift in rehabilitation from neuro-
development, which emphasizes accurate performance of prescribed movements, to
neuroplasticity, which emphasizes repetition and frequency. From a
neuroplasticity perspective, the more repetitions of a movement, the stronger
the identification fabric becomes as neurons rebuild their connections. The
proposed project leverages current technology (motion tracking, gaming, cloud
services, and data analytics) to enable both of these shifts in therapy. It
involves patentable innovations in three key areas of patient-centered workflow
development tools, collaborative stroke rehabilitation processes, and evidence-
based therapy using data analytics techniques.
