ABSTRACT CTS-9512517 Caltech has established the Center for Quantitive
Visualization (CQV) which serves as a focus organization and coordinates imaging
developments and applications. The personnel participating in the Center, who
will be involved in this project, represent an interdisciplinary team with
expertise in many areas of imaging, high-speed data-acquisition and storage, and
imaging-processing. The development and acquisition of advanced imaging
instrumentation falls in two broad categories: (1) high-speed image acquisition
systems, and (2) advances in image-processing, storage, and graphics systems. It
is intended to extend the presently-available, state- of-the-art in this field,
resulting in new, nationally and internationally unique capabilities. An attempt
is made to balance the greater risks of development versus acquisition by the
much more capable technology that would result. This endeavor is shared by
industrial and governmental partners, such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
EPIX, Inc., General Pixels, Inc., Boeing Co. and Baxter Healthcare, Inc. The
activities of the CQV and the proposed infrastructure project form an integral
part of the educational and research environment at Caltech, with broad and
intense participation by students, faculty, visitors, and staff. Furthermore,
this center will serve equally as a bridge between university and industry by
providing the means for transfer of technology and science, between academia and
industry, and by preparing students for the industrial work environment. ***
