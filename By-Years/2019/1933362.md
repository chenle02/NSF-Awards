Nontechnical Description This award will provide support for students,
postdoctoral researchers, and early career researchers to attend 2019 Metabolic
Pathway Analysis (MPA) to be held August 12-16, 2019 in Riga, Latvia. The focus
of the MPA 2019 conference is on analyzing topological structure-function
relationships of metabolic networks to study fundamentals of biology and its
biotechnological applications, with topics covered over including six sessions
spanning systems and synthetic biology, metabolic networks, and mathematical
algorithms. The conference also provides pre-conference workshops on tools and
methods for systems biology modeling and provides opportunities for early stage
investigators to interact with senior researchers in the field.

Technical Description Network modeling and analysis approaches are making
advances in this field through elucidation and quantification of phenotypes
reflected by genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and fluxomic data.
The Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MPA) 2019 conference will focus on topological
analyses of metabolic networks and in particular techniques utilizing linear
algebra, linear programming and computer modeling in conjunction with
experimental data to decode biological principles found in omics data sets.
These analyses can be applied at many levels of abstraction, from individual
reaction mechanisms to whole organisms and mixed cellular populations. The MPA
conference and the unique series of pre-conference tutorials provide an
environment for research dissemination and education for early stage and
established investigators to interact with the international systems biology
research community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
