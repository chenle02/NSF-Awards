Robots and humans interact with the world through physical contact. But since
modern robots do not yet "understand" contact, they have very little capability
to figure out how to do useful work. For example, robots today cannot figure out
how to help a person with a sprained ankle climb a flight of stairs. This
project will develop simulation models of contact that robots can use to "think"
about useful work requiring contact. Through several mental experiments
(simulations) a robot will be able to determine the best strategy to carry out
whatever contact task it faces. These contact models will be computationally
efficient, so the robot won't have to think too long, and realistic, so that the
robot's plan has a high probability of success when executed. Since robots are
relatively good at working with hard solid objects, this project focuses on soft
bodies, such as people, food, and ropes. The resulting new algorithms will be
incorporated in the publicly available physics simulator, MuJoCo, which can be
embedded easily into the "brains" of future robots to expand the kinds of work
robots will be able to do.

The new soft contact model is derived from the Gauss principle of least
constraint, applied to an augmented system that includes the rigid-body dynamics
and the contact deformation dynamics. This yields a convex conic program in
terms of the accelerations of the augmented system. The convex dual of this
conic program is an optimization problem over contact forces. The project will
develop this new theoretical framework, and explore its many properties
including stability as well as computation of dynamics derivatives and their
application to physically-consistent state estimation. Fast algorithms for
computing both forward and inverse contact dynamics will also be developed. This
will include a generalization to the projected Gauss-Seidel method that can
handle conic constraints, as well as preconditioned conjugate gradient method
exploiting the convexity and smoothness provided by the new framework.
