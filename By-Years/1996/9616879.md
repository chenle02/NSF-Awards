9616879 Levitan This is a collaborative project between researchers at the Univ.
of Pittsburgh, and the Univ. of California at San Diego (UCSD). The goal of the
project is to produce design analysis and virtual prototyping tools for mixed
technology free space optoelectronic information processing systems. The design
tools will be based on current work in modeling and simulation of optoelectronic
signals and devices at the Univ. of Pittsburgh, and device fabrication, modeling
and testing at UCSD. These efforts will be expanded to include functional,
physical and parametric models for devices and interconnections using a
framework that will support the composition of these models into complete
systems. The resulting optoelectronic system prototyping tool suite will be made
available to the academic community, and is expected to accelerate the insertion
of photonics technology in traditionally microelectronic applications. ***
