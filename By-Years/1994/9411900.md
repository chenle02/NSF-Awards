9411900 Garoff Wetting of a surface by a fluid arises in many natural and
technical settings. Despite its common occurrence, wetting is neither completely
understood nor entirely controllable in technical processes. The open scientific
questions arise from the sensitivity to the detailed physics and chemistry of
the interfaces involved. Using optical, x-ray, and neutron techniques, the
Principal Investigators will investigate wetting phenomena on both the
macroscopic and microscopic scales. The proposal seeks to understand the origins
of the complex, macroscopic wetting behavior within the microscopic structures
of fluids confined by the interfaces at and near the contact line. % % % %
Wetting of a surface by a fluid arises in many natural and technological
settings such as recovery of fluid fossil fuels, film coating, and the
processing of advanced composite materials. Despite its common occurrence,
wetting is neither completely understood nor entirely controllable in technical
processes. The program will study the microscopic origins of wetting processes
using a variety of experimental techniques, including neutron and x-rays
scattering performed at national facilities. Results of the proposed research
will add to the scientific basis needed for engineering advanced materials and
for other technological processes dominated by wetting. ***
