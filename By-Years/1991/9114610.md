The study of "asteroseismology," or the properties of pulsation modes to
determine the interior structure of stars, has been among the most important and
exciting areas of research in astronomy during the last decade. The Principal
Investigator (PI) intends to continue previous work on the pulsations of several
types of stars using a computer program which determines the pulsation periods
of a star precisely and self-consistently as the star's structure evolves in
time. Such effects as mixing, nuclear "burning", and differential diffusion
among the chemical elements is taken into account, as are some types of magnetic
field structures. The PI will use this code to determine the thermo- dynamic and
magnetic structural properties of magnetically pulsating "A" stars and delta
Scuti stars, whose properties in many ways mimic the Sun's. This work is
expected to help place solar and stellar physics within the same context so that
advances made in one area can benefit the other.
