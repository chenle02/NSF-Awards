This new symposium on nobel form of carbon is organized by the Material
Research Society because of the recent explosion of interest in physical and
chemical forms of carbon. It shall include 8 half-day sessions to be held during
April 27-May 1, 1992 in San Francisco. Each session shall include one to two
invited speaker and a number of contributed papers. The objective is to bring
together researchers working in different sub-fields to discuss topic such as
diamond and diamond-like film, spherical carbon molecules, novel composites, and
extraterrestrial carbon. Funds requested from the National Science Foundation
(NSF) will be used as partial travel expense for the invited speakers and
limited number of outstanding graduate students. A total of 14 prominent invited
speakers have confirmed their participation at this meeting. This proposal is
co-funded by SSC ($1000) and CHEM ($1000) with the total support of $2000.
