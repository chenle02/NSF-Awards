Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Science
Foundation (NSF) will continue the AAAS/NSF Fellowship Program for a second
year. Up to five Fellows for 2001-2002 year will be selected and placed in
offices throughout NSF, working on projects of mutual interest to the Fellows
and the host directorate or office. Fellows will learn how NSF funds science,
while providing scientific, engineering and educational input on issues relating
to NSF's mission support of fundamental science and engineering research and
education. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Fellows will work with staff involved in
planning, development and oversight of agency programs in all fields of
fundamental research. Assignments may involve significant interagency,
congressional or international activity, as well as involvement with the
National Science Board, NSF's policy-setting body. The program includes an
orientation on executive branch and congressional operations, as well as a
yearlong seminar program on issues involving science, technology and public
policy. The fellowships potentially are renewable for a second
year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
