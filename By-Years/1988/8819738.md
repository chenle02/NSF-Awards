Phospholipids are major components of biological membranes and undergo a
continuous cycle of synthesis and degradation as part of normal membrane
function. Within this cycle, lysophospholipids exist as metabolically active
intermediates, the amounts of which are regulated by the catalytic activity of
several enzymes. The potent effects of lysophospholipids on numerous biological
processes and the accumulation of these compounds under pathological conditions
suggest a requirement for stringent regulation of the concentration of
lysophospholipids. The working hypothesis of this research project is that
specific lysophospholipids are transiently released during stimulation of brain
synaptosome, and that these compounds serve as modulators in regulating
neurotransmitter release. Recent studies have provided evidence for such
regulation and have implicated these compounds in intercellular communication
mechanisms. Studies currently are underway on the characterization of some of
the relevant enzymes in these metabolic pathways and on the factors responsible
for controlling the metabolism of these compounds. The research will extend the
studies to (a) determine the quantitative importance of different chemical
reactions which generate and remove lysophospholipids in brain synaptosomes
under resting (basal) conditions, (b) determine the physiological mechanisms of
lysophospholipid production in brain synaptosomes under conditions of
stimulation, and (c) purify and characterize some of the key enzymes
(phospholipase A2, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase, and
lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase) controlling these processes. The
overall goal of the project is to elucidate the biochemical pathways responsible
for regulating the amounts of these important biomolecules. The studies are
expected to lead to a better understanding of the molecular events occurring
during neurotransmission.
