Snyder The goals of this research are the development of: 1. improved image
restoration algorithms for dealing with stochastic inverse problems; 2. methods
for assessing the quality of the images which are produced; and 3. strategies
for parallel implementation of the resulting algorithms. The primary focus is on
quantum-limited data which arises in such diverse applications as imaging faint
objects in outer space and imaging radioactivity concentrations within human
tissue.
