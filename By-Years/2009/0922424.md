Arizona State University doctoral student, Jaime Holthuysen, with the guidance
of Dr. Hjorleifur Jonsson, will investigate how ethnicity and socioeconomic
status affect the structuring and commodification of male gender identity. This
research will examine scientifically how cultural ideas of masculinity are
constructed and contested in the United States, where most research on cultural
and social aspects of gender has focused on women. Such research is important
because as culturally accepted ideals of gender roles shift, it is essential to
develop more current theories that incorporate
men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holthuysen will employ a multi-sited ethnographic
research design. Participant observation will take place in sport training
facilities and competition venues. The researcher also will conduct semi-
structured interviews and focus groups (employing photo-elicitation techniques)
with athletes, organizations, and media. These data will be complemented by
content analysis of media to examine understandings of masculinity in the public
domain and trace its historical trajectory in sport contexts. This research
funding also supports the education of a social scientist.&lt;br/&gt;
