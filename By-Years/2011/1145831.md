This is a small EAGER project to explore alpine cairn structures that exist in
Southeast Alaska and which have been described in the historic record as early
as the Russian contact period. Because of the focus on coastal migration
theories of early peopling of North American and the development of social
complexity among the coastal tribes, no previous research has been done to
understand the construction or prehistoric context of these cairn structures
that are quite numerous in the region. This project would support the research
team to do preliminary testing of an alpine cairn and will allow PIs to travel
to consult and coordinate their research with the tribal communities of Sitka
and Angoon on whose traditional territories the project would take place.
