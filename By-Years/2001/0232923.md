This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
piezoelectric motor-drive with Ultra-High-Vacuum (UHV) compatibility for high-
speed driving of positioning platforms. The proposed piezoelectric motor-drive
will provide an as-yet unrealized combination of several desirable
characteristics: nanometer and sub-nanometer precision; speeds in excess of 500
mm/s; drive capacities in the range of 10's of kilograms; and, ranges of travel
in excess of 500 mm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of this
concept will provide a revolutionary means for rapid and accurate materials
handling for fabrication, inspection, metrology, and packaging of microparts and
microsystems. &lt;br/&gt;
