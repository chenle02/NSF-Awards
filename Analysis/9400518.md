9400518 Latushkin The Principal Investigator proposes to solve some problems at
the intersection of the asymptotic theory of linear semigroups and infinite
dimensional dynamical systems to describe the asymptotic properties (dichotomy,
hyberbolicity, Lyapunov exponents) of evolutionary systems and semiflows on
Banach spaces. The main technical tool is to involve for this description the
semigroups of weighted translation operators. This technique would allow one to
view the classical Lyapunov theorems in a fairly unexpected perspective. This
work has its roots in the analysis of stability of processes. These processes
are frequently described by differential equations and the stability is
determined by an analysis of the asymptotic or large time behavior of the
solutions. The solutions of these equations live naturally in abstract
structures called Banach spaces and the study of stability questions can be
formulated in terms of a metric or norm. In this way the techniques of operator
theory can be used effectively to study stability of dynamical systems. The
theory has applications in dynamo theory and the dynamics of chemical reactors.
