Sophisticated methods of separation by gas chromatography with component
identification by mass spectrometry, routine in the chemical profession, is now
included in the undergraduate laboratory experiences in chemistry at Canisius
College. An integral part of this development has been the acquisition of a gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry system which, as a key component of, and in
conjunction with existing instrumentation- FTIR, NMR, UV-Visible, HPLC, etc., is
being used to develop new laboratory experiences in separations and microscale
organic and inorganic syntheses. The microscale approach to chemical syntheses
is very attractive because of shorter reaction times, faster work-up procedures,
greater laboratory safety, and facile chemical waste disposal.
