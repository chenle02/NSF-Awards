9418982 Cohen It is currently possible to acquire images of the brain so as to
reveal the regions that are active while people are performing particular
cognitive tasks. However, massive amounts of data (many successive images ) are
produced from these neuroimaging studies, and it is not clear how to efficiently
analyze all of the functional information that the data contain. With this
award, a research group comprised of a psychologist, statistician, computer
scientist and a radiologist (headed by Dr. Jonathan Cohen) will be developing
new ways to analyze large sets of neuroimages. They will improve techniques for
image reconstruction, expand available statistical tools for image processing,
and implement these improvements on a supercomputer. This work should greatly
advance the non-invasive analysis of brain function.
