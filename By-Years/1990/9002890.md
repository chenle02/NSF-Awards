This project consists of an experimental study of the first onset of dissipation
in the flow of superfluid 4He through an orifice of micron or submicron
dimensions as the rate of flow surpasses a critical threshold. Measurements will
be made of the magnitude of the critical rate of flow and its dependence on
temperature, pressure, and shape of orifice and of any statistical rounding of
the onset as a function of temperature, in order to gain information about the
fundamental processes involved, for which no satisfactory model now exists. Use
will be made of a small mechanical resonator capable of resolving single-
quantum-vortex events in the oscillatory flow of superfluid through an orifice
that is fabricated by means of electron-beam lithography and ion- beam milling
or reactive plasma etching. Studies will be made using both a single-hole
configuration and a closed-loop configuration analogous to an rf-biased
superconducting quantum interference device.
