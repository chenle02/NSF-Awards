The University of California at San Francisco has been awarded a grant to
develop new database designs and informatics tools for the discovery,
exploration, and application of the links between protein structure and
function. Specifically, the project will generate a flexible and rapidly
searchable method of representing enzyme function. This representation will
include specific protein structural information related to the reaction
catalyzed by the enzyme. Methods allowing such reactions to be chained together
into novel pathways will also be developed. Enzyme active-site representations
which link the structure of a given protein to its specific chemical
functionality will be developed as well. This work will be done in concordance
with the development of the Structure-Function Linkage Database (SFLD), a
resource based upon well-established work on enzyme structure-function
relationships in the context of enzyme superfamilies. The successful completion
of this project will provide informatics and database tools not currently
available in any biological database system, as well as the integration of these
methods with other biological database efforts. These new methods will be freely
distributed to enable researchers to store, search, and manipulate chemical
reactions of biological interest, as well as identify the likely function of new
proteins. Workshops to assist researchers and others in using these new
resources will be held.
