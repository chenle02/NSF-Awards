David Oxtoby, University of Chicago, and Vincente Talanquer, University of
Arizona, are supported to continue their research on the dynamics of first-order
phase transitions. They use classical density-functional theory to understand
the dynamics of first-order phase transitions with applications aimed at
formation of bubbles in heated or expanding fluids. The research proceeds by
determining which order parameters play a role in phase transitions and in
determining the conditions that lead to a breakdown in classical nucleation
theory. The methodology allows one to systematically study how generic types of
molecular characteristics influence nucleation. In addition to a strong focus on
secondary school chemistry education, Talanquer actively participates in
physical-chemistry research with density-functional-based studies of partially
miscible binary liquid interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When mixtures of
surfactants, water and oil are brought together bilayer membranes occur which
can spontaneously distort into closed bubble-like structures referred to as
micelles or vesicles. Such structures have many uses and may be used as
templates for fabrication of small particles, for the capture and subsequent
encapsulation of chemically aggressive constituents, or for programmed drug
delivery. Further, such structures carry cholesterol in the human body. Fusion
of such structures has been implicated in the growth of gallstones. This work is
aimed at computationally understanding growth and evolution of such structures
using classical density functional theory. In addition to the biological impact,
understanding gleaned from this work is of import to metallurgical applications,
atmospheric science, protein crystallization and petroleum
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
