This proposal seeks to acquire a state-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS) system
for a range of metabolomics and proteomics applications. Mass spectrometry has
emerged as the technology of choice for workflows seeking to identify, detect,
and/or quantify metabolites and other small molecules as well as proteins and
peptides in complex biological samples. The instrument specific benefits
include: very fast full-scan acquisition speed, large dynamic range, high
resolution,superior sensitivity, and mass accuracy. The proposed QTOF system
will support a diverse range of research projects for the PIs as well as a
number of major users and collaborators: (1) identifying immunomodulatory
microbiota metabolites; (2) in vitro disease model; (3) cardiac tissue
engineering and regenerative medicine; (4) lipidoids for nucleic acid delivery;
(5)biosynthesis of advanced biofuels; (6) non-invasive monitoring of tissue
metabolism;and (7)tendon development and regeneration.
