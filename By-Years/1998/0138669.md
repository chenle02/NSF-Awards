An ongoing observational record of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, total
peroxynitrates, total alkylnitrates, nitric acid, and total odd nitrogen (NOy)
at the University of California Blodgett Forest Research Station will be
extended. The PI has developed a novel instrument based on thermal dissociation
- laser-induced fluorescence (TD-LIF) with four channels. In addition, the PI
plans to measure UV irradiance. Through collaborations, measurements of ozone,
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide will be available. Box- and
1-dimensional modeling will be used to understand and interpret past and ongoing
measurements. Furthermore, the PI intends to demonstrate the capability of his
instrument for carrying out eddy-covariance flux measurements, and then carry
out a full annual cycle of measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, if
successful, will demonstrate new technology for trace gas concentration and flux
measurements, and will provide new insights into the photochemistry of forested
areas that are partially impacted by anthropogenic pollution.
