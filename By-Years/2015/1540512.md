Distributed algorithms underlie the efficient operation of large-scale
communication networks, e.g., distributed shortest paths algorithms are used for
routing in the Internet. Two fundamental performance measures of distributed
algorithms are the running time and the number of messages used by the
algorithm. Research in the last three decades has focused to a large extent on
optimizing either one of the two measures separately, typically at the cost of
the other. This project investigates how distributed algorithms can be designed
to work well under both measures simultaneously. This may have significant
implications in many emerging applications, especially in the context of large-
scale distributed communication networks and distributed processing of large-
scale data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project studies time-message
tradeoffs in distributed algorithms for various specific fundamental problems,
such as leader election, shortest paths, minimum spanning tree construction, and
random walks. These are fundamental primitives in distributed computing where
optimizing both time and messages simultaneously has so far been elusive.
Specific goals of the project are to: (1) design distributed algorithms that are
optimal with respect to the other measure when given a particular value of one
measure; (2) obtain lower bounds on the complexity of one measure while fixing
the other measure; (3) obtain tradeoff relationships that characterizes the
dependence of one measure on the other; and (4) obtain efficient distributed
algorithms that operate on large-scale graphs. This research will yield
efficient and scalable distributed algorithms with provable performance
guarantees. This project could potentially impact algorithm design in real-world
distributed networks and distributed computations over large-scale data. The
project trains students and postdoctoral fellows to tackle research problems in
distributed algorithms.
