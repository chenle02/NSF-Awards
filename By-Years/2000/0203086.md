Statistical methods will be developed to sharply improve time-resolution for the
recently proposed technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The
objective of the project is to improve the time-resolution of fMRI by sampling
only a small fraction of the Fourier transform of the spin density, and using a
prolate wavelet filter to approximately obtain an integral representing the
total activity of the difference in susceptibility between task and pre-task,
over various regions of interest in the brain at successive time -points. The
cost for this is a decrease in spatial resolution. This space/time trade-off
allows us to obtain, at high-time resolution, the total activity in specified
regions of the brain, believed to process the specific stimulus/task, to learn
or verify where the brain function takes place. Furthermore, the proposed
methodologies is believed to be applicable to other types of MRI studies,
especially magnetic resonance spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
focuses on developing statistical methods and related theory for fast functional
magnetic resonance (fMRI), to sharply improve the time resolution of present
techniques via 3-dimensional sampling. The principal investigators and their
collaborators have conducted a fMRI imaging experiment to answer the feasibility
question. The results based on this small experiment are quite encouraging.
Further experiments will conducted to confirm the preliminary results and
improve upon technology. Fast fMRI is expected to have profound and far-reaching
consequences in the understanding of brain function, a problem of central
scientific interest at the present time&lt;br/&gt;
