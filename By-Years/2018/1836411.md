TECHNICAL AND NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $5000 are
requested for support of US based participants in the symposium on "Block
Polymer Synthesis and Self-Assembly", to be held as part of the ACS POLY
Division at the 2018 National ACS meeting in Boston MA, August 18-22, 2018. The
funds will be used to pay the meeting registration fees for postdoc, junior
faculty, and other scientists in the early stages of post PhD independent
research. The symposium will cover a broad array of topics in newest
developments in block polymer synthesis, self-assembly , characterization and
morphology. Emphasis will be given to presentations by junior workers in the
field and their associated new directions with the goal of encouraging future
STEM development and people-power in the field. The symposium includes both
invited and contributed speakers. Of the sixteen invited speakers listed, two
are postdocs, seven are assistant professors and two are from industry.
Contributed papers include a majority from junior
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
