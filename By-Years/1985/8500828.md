The mechanisms of molecular sieve zeolite nucleation and growth are
investigated. The experiments are designed to determine the key variables
affecting rates of nucleation and growth, and to quantify these rates in
relation to the independent parameters. Most experiments are measured primarily
in batch crystallizers, but several other reactor geometries are investigated.
The aim is to control nucleation so that a crystalline product having a
predetermined average size and standard deviation can be produced. A
mathematical model for the synthesis process using the population balance model
is being developed. Results from the simulation model are being compared with
the experimental results to determine the rate constants associated with the
model.
