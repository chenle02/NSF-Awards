The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will contribute to the fields of low-cost
anthropomorphic robotics as well as machine translation. Leveraging advancements
in low-cost manufacturing and deep learning, the project is developing an
accessible and state-of-the-art complaint robot with robust remote processing.
Using remote processing to avoid expensive microprocessors and memory
capabilities, the proposed cloud server can capture any wifi-based communication
and entertainment, while translating language with custom standards and user
preferences in real-time. By granting DeafBlind (DB) individuals newfound
independence and privacy, the success of the project will revolutionize how DB
individuals interact with their community as well as provide immediate access to
the abled worldâ€™s resources. The market opportunity is estimated at $213 billion
annually. This product will have a significant impact on the assistive
technology field, targeting the historically underserved DB populations, for
whom there is little innovation. Importantly, this would be the first
commercialized signing robot. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide a convenient
and accessible method for DeafBlind (DB) people to interact with the world. The
current lack of communication aides among the DB community requires all people
with severe deafblindness to rely on human interpreters to interact with the
hearing/sighted world. However, with extensive lead times for these expensive
services, DB individuals regularly experience isolation and loneliness. This
research aims to achieve a fully compliant, flexible fingerspelling
anthropomorphic hand. Additionally, this research aims to develop the first
architecture for translating between a spoken and signed language. Technical
research requires investigation into motion capture mapping and storage of
continuous motion as well as tendon actuation schemes to achieve a low-cost 18
degrees of freedom robotic hand. Additionally, linguistics research explores DB
language usage (syntax, morphology, sign production, etc.) as well as
preferences based on demographic data. Anticipated technical results include a
robotic hand that can sign with &gt;90% recognition from DB users, signing at
variable speeds ranging from one to two signs per second with accurate
translation patterns between the source language and outputted tactile
signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
