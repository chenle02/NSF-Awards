The project described in this proposal involves the design and implementation of
a speech driven computer interface which could be used as a communication tool
for the disabled. The approach outlined involves the use os parallel filter
banks, followed by various signal processing stages and a gamma network composed
of gamma memory sections and a back-propagation neural network. The system will
be designed for use on a NeXT computer, which contains a microphone and a DSP
chip, so that no additional hardware will be required. The investigators will
test the system on isolated words although one of the justifications for the
neural network approach is so that a continuous signal stream could be processed
without necessitating the segmentation of the speech signal into allophones or
words. It is expected that this approach will perform better than techniques
that are presently used on low cost computers. Because this approach uses
networks designed to process time-varying signals in a speech recognition system
it could have an impact on the technology in this area if it can be extended to
process continuous speech.
