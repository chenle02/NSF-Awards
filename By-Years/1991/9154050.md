This Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) is a one-year Science Student
Internship Program designed to provide five talented minority science and
engineering students from a select group of colleges and universities with
summer internship experiences at the National Science Foundation (NSF), and
academic year follow-up activities at the students'home institutions. This
science-oriented initiative will be carried out through an expansion of the
existing Student Internship Program at the QEM Network. Students will be placed
with mentors in the NSF and the QEM Network. This is an opportunity for the
students to become familiar with the various agency programs, and gain some
understanding of: (a) how science policy is formulated, and how funding
priorities are set; (b) how the peer review process works; (c) how agencies
receive, utilize, amend agency policies based on external advice; and (d) how
interns can increase and continue their own MSE interest and study through the
doctoral level.
