9728983 Arimoto This project involves the study of mineral dust, a suite of
trace elements, and two radionuclides (210Pb and 7Be) as part of the AEROCE
Phase III Program. The studies will focus on Theme 2 (Marine Aerosols and
Climate). Daily bulk aerosol samples will be collected from four sites (Bermuda,
Barbados, Izana and Lanzarote), and they will be analyzed using instrumental
neutron activation. The analyses will generate data for mineral dust and several
chemical tracers (Se, Sb, and Zn). We also propose a continuation of studies of
two radionuclides (210Pb and 7Be) at Barbados. In addition, cascade impactor
samples will be collected on an intensive basis to characterize the mass
particle-size distributions of mineral dust and several tracer elements; these
data will also be used to characterize chloride deficits in size separated
particles, The relationships among these materials and various other substances
studied for AEROCE will be used to infer sources and to investigate the
atmosphere transport pathways responsible for their transport. Special efforts
will be made to relate the chemical data to news data on physical properties of
the atmosphere that will be collected for AEROCE Theme 2.
