This program is being supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program. The project involves the construction of a series of naturally
occurring compounds of unusual structure. The synthetic strategy into these
compounds involves a novel approach in that a large ring structure will be
transformed in a single step to structures which contain two or more rings of
smaller size. The goal is to demonstrate the viability of a powerful and little-
studied carbon-carbon bond forming reaction, transannular free-radical
cyclization, in the context of a complex synthetic problem. The method is to be
illustrated through the synthesis of the cembranoid natural product,
7,8-epoxy-4-basmen-6-one, which features as the key step two sequential
transannular cyclization reactions in a fourteen-membered macrocyclic precursor.
This synthetic strategy will allow certain structural and stereochemical
features of the macrocyclic ring to be employed in a highly specific fashion
during the transannular ring-closures. Molecular mechanics calculations will be
employed along with X-ray crystallographic to predict preferred transition state
geometries of the reactants and relevant reactive intermediates. High field NMR
spectroscopy will be used to determine conformations in solution as an adjunct
to the tools noted above.
