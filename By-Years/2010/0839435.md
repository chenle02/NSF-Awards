This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes to develop high
photospeed, low line edge roughness, and low outgassing photoresist for extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) lithography.

Although EUV lithography at 13.5 nm wavelength has emerged as a promising
candidate to meet the resolution requirements of the microelectronic industry
roadmap, yet the development of novel photoresist materials with all of the
required imaging properties is still challenging and is one of the major
subjects of current nanolithography research. The critical requirements for EUV
lithographic photoresist include high photospeed, high resolution, and low line
edge roughness. The design of novel resist materials that can achieve all three
characteristics is the key for the continued success of high resolution
patterning in integrated circuit manufacturing.
