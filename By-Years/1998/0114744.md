The Center for Health Management Research, then based at Arizona State
University (since moved to the University of Washington), received its initial
designation as an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in July 1992.
From the outset, this has been a multi-university center, drawing its academic
resources from a consortium of 15 universities.

The goals for the Center are to: 1) Develop a research agenda in collaboration
with the corporate members; 2) Undertake research, development, and evaluation
projects on behalf of the corporate members; 3) Disseminate to the members
findings of health services research; 4) Identify and disseminate to the members
successful innovations and management practices from other health care
organizations; and 4) Identify and disseminate to the members relevant research
findings, successful innovations, and management practices from other
industries.
