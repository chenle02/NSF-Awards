This project will be conducted by Clare Reimers of Oregon State University
&lt;br/&gt;and plans to utilize US academic research vessels, R/Vs New Horizon
and Endeavor, for two training program cruises involving 14 participants per
cruise. Members of the UNOLS Office and an impressive number of scientists from
throughout the oceanographic community also will contribute to the effort as
either at sea mentors, workshop speakers, or lenders of equipment.&lt;br/&gt;
