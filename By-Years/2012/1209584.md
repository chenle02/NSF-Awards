This action funds Ayla Susan Pamukcu of Vanderbilt University to conduct a
research project, entitled "How long did it take to develop the giant magma
bodies that resulted in the Oruanui and Whakamaru supereruptions?" during the
summer of 2012 at University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The
host scientist is Dr. Darren Gravley.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop a greater
understanding of the timescales over which giant magma bodies persist in the
Earth's crust prior to eruption, through the study of textures (sizes, shapes)
and compositions of crystals, bubbles, and glass. Such results can aid in the
development of volcanic hazards programs. In addition, this work serves to
further develop analytical techniques in the fields of igneous petrology and
volcanology, such as conventional, differential absorption, and propagation
phase-contrast x-ray tomography and cathodoluminescence.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
