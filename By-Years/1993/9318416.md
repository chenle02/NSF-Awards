9318416 Cruz The principal investigators will use their expertise in the areas
of communications networks, optical devices, fiber optics, and systems
engineering in a cohesive research effort aimed at demonstrating the feasibility
of time-based optical multiplexors. Time-based multiplexing is a fundamental
operation that must be performed in large-scale wide- area networks. The
research will examine architecture alternatives and demonstrate feasibility by
building and testing scalable prototype multiplexors. A major difficulty in the
design of multiplexors is dealing with contention. The conceptual prototype of a
time-based optical multiplexor, in this study, is based on the detection of
optical packets at the packet rate, as opposed to the detection of the optical
data at the much higher data rate. For example, the optical packets can be
detected by splitting off a small part of the optical signal using an optical-
fiber directional coupler, with these signals detected by a high-sensitivity
detector. For a two-to-one multiplexor, the packet detection will be used to
configure a 2 x 2 guided-wave directional coupler switch. If only one input has
a packet, the packet is routed to the output. If both inputs have packets, then
one packet is routed to the output while the other packet is sent through an
optical fiber delay line, and subsequently fed back into another switch. Several
packet detectors and switches can be used to implement various scheduling
algorithms, and to offer a higher degree of system reliability. The multiplexors
will be developed using commercially available fiber optic and optoelectronic
components. We will iteraltively examine architecture alternatives and refine
our prototypes. This will maximize the interaction between the device and
network researchers. ***
