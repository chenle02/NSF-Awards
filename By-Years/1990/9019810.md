This is a proposal to continue and extend work in progress on the systematics
of salamanders from the western United States and from Middle America. The main
emphasis of the study is the morphology and genetic variation of the species.
The main morphological topic is the development and comparative structure of the
brains of salamanders that use extreme fast and far- reaching tongues to capture
prey. Comparative anatomical studies of other parts of the organism will also be
conducted. Both protein and nucleic acid variation will be studied in a number
of species. A long range goal of this study is to determine how many species of
salamanders there are in these regions, and to determine the patterns of
phylogenetic relationships among them, as they are important to our
understanding of ecology and earth history.
