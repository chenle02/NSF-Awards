Dynamical processes for coupling energy and momentum of the solar wind into the
magnetosphere, for transporting and heating the plasma within its boundaries,
and for coupling the motions of magnetopause and ionosphere have received
increasing attention in recent years. This grant is for studies to examine a
variety of processes that are important for the coupling of solar wind plasma
through the magnetosphere and the magnetospheric cavity and into the ionosphere.
Because of the nature of the studies, this grant will be part of the GEM
(Geospace Environment Modelling) program. The project will focus on: 1) How
pressure pulses in the solar wind affects the magnetosphere and ionosphere, 2)
The structure and the ionospheric signatures of disturbances called Flux
Transfer Events (FTE's) that are produced by bursty reconnection on the
magnetopause, and 3) ionospheric boundaries conditions for ultralow frequency
waves. ***
