This award supports the Artemis project, a 5-week Summer program administered by
Brown University's Department of Computer Science designed to encourage girls
from local public schools to pursue careers in Computer Science, and more
broadly in science and engineering. Participants are rising ninth graders and
are exposed to the breadth of applications of Computer Science, and are
introduced to a variety of the technologies underlying computing. An equally
important goal of Artemis is to develop the leadership and entrepreneurial
skills of undergraduate women who serve as coordinators each year. These
coordinators serve the local community in their capacity as social
entrepreneurs.
