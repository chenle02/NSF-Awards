9729257 Geist Funds were requested to help subsidize the costs of young
scientists (graduate students and early-career professional) to attend the
Geological Society of America Penrose Conference on the Evolution of Ocean
Island Volcanoes that will take place in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, form
June 4 to 12, 1998. This meeting is being co-sponsored by the Geological Society
of America, the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the
Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) and the Charles Darwin Foundation. Funds will be
distributed by the three co-convenors of the conference and is their intention
to recruit as diverse a group as possible, especially in terms of experience
level (the main purpose of this request), areas of interest and specialty, and
nationality; this strategy will hold for students as well as academics. Students
and professionals will apply for funds by submitting a CV, a short statement of
financial need, topical interest in the meeting, qualifications, and title of
proposed poster session.
