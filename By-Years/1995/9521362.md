In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Michael Topp
will use Rotational Coherence Spectroscopy, and other laser based techniques to
probe the dynamical and spectroscopic properties of gas phase clusters
containing 3-aminophthalimide and bianthryl. These systems are chosen because of
the strong solvent dependence exhibited by the excited state lifetimes and
fluorescence spectra of these species in the liquid phase. This research will
determine the interactions responsible for changes in the charge distribution,
including charge-transfer, induced by electronic excitation. Such information is
essential to a complete understanding of the structures, properties, and
interactions of molecules in condensed phases. Gas phase clusters provide an
ideal environment to probe the details of molecular interactions between solute
and solvent. Professor Topp's research will determine how solvent molecules
affect the structure and properties of a solute molecule in these clusters. This
research will enhance our understanding of the stabilities and reactivities of
liquid phase species, and the forces responsible for these properties
