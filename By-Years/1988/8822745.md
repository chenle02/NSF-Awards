The objectives of this research are to determine how the microstructure of a
mixed metal catalyst system on an oxide support or on carbon influences
reactivity and selectivity in ways not predictable from the properties of the
individual components, and to use variation in microstructure to control the
properties of supported catalysts. Three types of systems are under study:
multicomponent particles containing a noble metal and halogen, alkali metal,
rare earth, base metal and/or another noble metal; base metal catalysts on
various oxide supports; and particles on carbon. High- resolution transmission
electron microscopy is used to characterize interactions between constituents of
multicomponent particles as well as interactions of particles with supports.
Particles on graphite, amorphous carbon, and carbon black are studied to
determine how different types of carbon supports and treatment affect structures
and catalytic properties. Microscopic particle characterization techniques for
multicomponent systems are expanded by using high- resolution analytical
transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy. This is an
extension of ongoing efforts in the laboratory of the investigators. The systems
studied are selected for their relevance to catalysts actually used in
industrial processes or in environmental control.
