This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
program, will study the effect of the recent terrorist events and subsequent
American actions on the nature and structure of trust in political and social
institutions in the United States. The researchers are undertaking a two-wave
national panel survey designed to capture the effects of information on the
levels of various forms of trust and the relationships among these forms of
trust. The research offers the unique opportunity to study public trust in the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks and assess the effect of a national crisis on
the dynamics of trust. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These data will be of value to
scholars interested in the topic and also to decision-makers trying to
differentiate between various forms of trust and how it rises or falls as new
information becomes available to the public. The researchers will be able to
gauge how public trust changes over time based on the actions taken by the U.S.
government in tandem with changes in the perceived threat.&lt;br/&gt;
