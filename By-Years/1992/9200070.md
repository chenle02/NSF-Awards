A REU Site will be established in the School of Chemical Engineering of Purdue
University. The goal of this site is to expose students (who would not otherwise
receive such exposure) to the opportunities provided by research careers and
advanced degree work. The goal will be met by expanding the academic
undergraduate research program to provide a summer research opportunity for 12
students. During their summer at Purdue the students will work on original
research projects in the chemical engineering sciences. Special effort will be
expended to attract women and members of historically underrepresented groups to
the program.
