0954986 Prather The proposed work will result in the development of experimental
tools to control glucose flux. The Glucose Valve will explore a new paradigm for
biochemical production that allows the decoupling of biomass growth and
metabolite production in the same way that inducible promoters have done for
recombinant protein production. The Valves are intended to facilitate the
metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways for the production of a variety
of organic compounds in microbial chemical factories. The proposal incorporates
both fundamental research and educational initiatives. Mathematical models to
describe and predict the behavior of the Glucose Valves will also be developed,
which should facilitate the extension of this experimental device to other
metabolites and organisms. Undergraduate students will be educated in both the
classroom and the laboratory, with course materials being made available through
the OpenCourseWare portal at MIT. Additionally, a proposed "What-I-Do"
Initiative seeks to introduce school age children to science- and engineering-
intensive careers through a series of interviews of professionals working in
representative STEM fields.
