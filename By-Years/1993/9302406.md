John R. LaGraff has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. LaGraff's doctoral degree was in Materials Science from the
University of Illinois under the supervision of Professor David Payne. Dr.
LaGraff will continue research at the University of Illinois under the
sponsorship of Professor Andrew Gewirth. Dr. LaGraff's postdoctoral training
will provide him with skills in advanced surface science techniques such as
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Longer
term, he plans to apply AFM and STM to study the interfaces and surfaces of
oxides such as barium titanate in order to determine the role of local defect
chemistry in controlling nanoscale and bulk property responses. %%% The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastuctural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
