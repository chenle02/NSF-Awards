There are two major focal points of this research. The first focal point is the
use of fast atomic beam radiofrequency spectroscopy to measure with high
precision the fine structure of H and He+. These measurements will be used to
provide fundamental tests of quantum electrodynamics and to provide an
independent precise value for the fine structure constant. A second focal point
is the study of the triplet Rydberg states of the hydrogen molecule through a
molecular beam-laser spectroscopy technique in which metastable molecules
produced by electron bombardment are excited to high lying Rydberg states
through radiation from a single uv laser or from two lasers via a resonant
intermediate state. The goal is to study the structure of the energy levels and
the mechanism for decay by autoionization, predissociation, and emission of
radiation.
