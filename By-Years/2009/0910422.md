Rifting is a fundamental process in the evolution of continents; continental
rift zones are widespread around the world and have occurred from the Archaean
to the Present. Although investigations of well-developed rifts worldwide have
resulted in increased understanding of advanced stages of continental rifting,
almost no research has focused on the processes that initiate and control the
earliest stages of continental rifting. Key controversies exist regarding models
explaining the initiation of continental rifting and several unsolved process-
oriented questions about global continental rifting
remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for a focused workshop
centered on identifying major research gaps and key research questions on the
geodynamic controls of continental rift initiation and propagation. The workshop
is designed to identify research priorities, and to explore possible areas of
joint research collaboration between different investigators. Other important
issues to be discussed during the workshop include examination of the logistics
necessary to conduct the large scale geophysical investigations that will be
necessary to answer these questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take
place at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts in
March, 2009. Output from the workshop will be a well thought out science and
logistics plan that will guide community researchers in preparing proposals to
perform the research outlined above. Participants at the workshop will include
scientists from Catholic University of Malawi, the Zambian Geological Survey,
the University of Dar es Salaam in addition to oil/mineral industry
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
