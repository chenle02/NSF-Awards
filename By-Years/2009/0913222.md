&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Proposal: OISE-0913222 &lt;br/&gt;PI/Institution: Padin,
Carlos; Universidad Metropolitana &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wetlands are
deteriorating faster than other ecosystems and more research is needed to inform
the scientific community on the issues that are impacting these ecosystems. This
U.S.-Brazil Planning visit proposal will support U.S. researchers from Puerto
Rico, under the leadership of Dr. Carlos Padin, to establish a collaborative
research agenda on wetlands and their ecosystem services with Dr. Marina Suzuki
and Dr. Carlos Rezende from the Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense. The
international U.S.-Brazil research team will use the Millennium Ecosystems
Assessment approach to focus on three particular issues: (1) develop a focused
collaborative interdisciplinary research agenda; (2) identify environmental
science courses that could be enhanced by integrating research projects into
them; and (3) determine topics for collaborative sponsored research projects.
