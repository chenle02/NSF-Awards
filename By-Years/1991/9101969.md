The principal investigator will work in collaboration with both experimental
and theoretical biologists in the area of cell surface receptors. Biological
cells sense their environment primarily through the interaction of cell surface
receptors with specific extracellular ligands. These molecular interactions
serve as signals, initiating cell responses to hormones, neurotransmitters,
immune response mediators and other molecules. The planned work is the
mathematical component of theoretical/experimental collaborations aimed at
identifying particular cell signals and response pathways. These models are
essential for the understanding of the biology, because the mechanisms cannot be
observed directly. The mathematical tools will involve the analysis of spatial
data. The principal investigator will work in collaboration with both
