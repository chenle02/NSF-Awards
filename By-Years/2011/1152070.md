With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the
research of Professor Olivucci of the Bowling Green State University. With the
help of Dr. Xu, a microbiologist working in the same institution, Dr. Olivucci
intends to study the mechanism of double-bond photoisomerization in protein
mutants by combining quantum chemistry and genetic techniques. The research
focuses on a photochromic sensory rhodopsin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena
(ASR) as a reference lab model. The investigators will construct, starting from
known crystallographic data, computer models of the ASR wild-type and of a
series of its mutants and study the changes in their photoisomerization dynamics
via excited state trajectory computations. A sub-set of these mutants will be
constructed in the laboratory for validation purposes. The investigators seek to
analyze the information derived by the study of multiple series of mutants, and
in so doing gain an understanding of how specific amino acid replacements can
tune/control the photoisomerization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impact of
this project emerges from the possibility to use computation in predicting and
ultimately designing the photochemical properties of chromophore-containing
proteins. The project stimulates collaboration across distant disciplines:
computational quantum chemistry and molecular biology. Accordingly, the graduate
students will receive a multidisciplinary training. The results will be
disseminated not only through the conventional media but also through the on-
line publication of a Protein Model Database. The results will also help to
improve the quality of undergraduate/graduate courses at BGSU and thought via
long-distance learning technologies. Professor Olivucci supports the
undergraduate BGSU program Building Ohio's Sustainable Energy Future by teaching
how to use computers and computational chemistry tools to characterize the
absorption spectra of organic compounds.
