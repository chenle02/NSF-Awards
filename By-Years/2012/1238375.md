ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;#1238375&lt;br/&gt;Raveche&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major
objective of the proposed research is to employ advanced flow-cytometry-based
instrumentation to develop methods and protocols for isolating distinct
subpopulations of cells. This in-depth analysis of cell characterizations using
fluorescence detection to distinguish 17 or more characteristics simultaneously
on individual cells and employing multiple parameters to sort these populations
while maintaining the viability of the cells will advance the employment of flow
cytometers in biomedical research. The isolation and identification of the
cancer progenitor cell is only recently feasible because the technology has
evolved such that multiple fluorochromes excited by specific wavelengths emitted
from several lasers and unique detectors can sort cells based on multiple
markers simultaneously. This requires stable laser lines, careful compensation
controls, defined fluidics and sensitive optics and detectors. The hypothesis to
be tested is that based on identifiable characteristics, the earliest cancer
progenitor cell in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can be identified.
