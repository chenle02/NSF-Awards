This program provides academic and financial support to talented low-income
students in applied computer science, mathematics, and industrial computer
systems. Program objectives include expanding the professional development
opportunities for students, strengthening partnerships between the university
and employment sectors related to the targeted disciplines, and retaining
project students at a rate that exceeds the retention of non-project students in
the same disciplines. Student support structures include group meetings, faculty
mentors for scholars, involvement in professional organizations, industrial
internships, and shadowing of working professionals in industry.
