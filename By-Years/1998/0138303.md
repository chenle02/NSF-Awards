AST-0138303&lt;br/&gt;Schloerb, F. Peter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sensitivity of
the three-telescope IOTA, a Michelson Stellar Interferometer will be improved
through the addition of a new high speed visible light tip/tilt tracker, single-
mode IR fiber optics, and an improved IR tip/tilt tracker, which will be used to
observe highly reddened objects that are untrackable with the visible sensor.
These improvements will extend the limiting astronomical magnitude for science
measurements from the current 7.5 magnitude limit (R-band) to a 9.0 magnitude
limit (R-band). This new system will enable studies of surface features and mass
exchange interactions across the surface of the photospheres of Herbig Ae/Be
stars and T Tauri stars. . &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
