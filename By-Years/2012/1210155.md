This action funds Erin Sanehira of University of Washington to conduct a
research project, entitled "Using self-assembly to fabricate a novel photonic
signal transmission device," during the summer of 2012 at University of Tokyo in
Tokyo, Japan. The host scientist is Professor Motoichi Ohtsu.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is that this technology utilizes
a self-assembly technique to fabricate a nano-scale optical waveguide from
cadmium-free, visible-wavelength emitting quantum dots. Photonic signal
transmission has the potential to replace conventional electronics with smaller,
more energy-efficient optical devices. By using optical near-field interactions
to transmit signals, there are fewer propagation losses compared to alternative
waveguide technology.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
