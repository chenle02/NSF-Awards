The concept of a group arises naturally in mathematics, and has wide
applications in physics, chemistry and materials science to name a few. One
example is the collection of symmetries of an object. These symmetries can also
be "multiplied", that is performed one after another, to obtain new symmetries.
Sometimes different combinations of symmetries might have the same overall
effect, leading to "relations". Abstractly, a group may be specified with a
finite list of "generators" and relations among the generators, collectively
called a presentation. An important question in mathematics is whether two
presentations define the same or similar groups. Geometric group theory seeks to
use geometric tools to differentiate groups, and to study their large-scale
features. This project will develop new tools to explore such large-scale
features and to classify groups according to these features.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this project is to study
groups which act properly discontinuously and cocompactly on non-positively or
negatively curved spaces, particularly right-angled Coxeter groups (RACGs),
geometric amalgams of free groups, and hyperbolic groups. Newly emerging
techniques such as hierarchical hyperbolicity and contracting boundaries will be
used to further the program of classifying RACGs up to quasi-isometry and
commensurability. Geometric amalgams of free groups will be studied up to
elementary equivalence, a notion of equivalence of groups coming from logic.
This will provide an illuminating class of examples illustrating deep theorems
of Sela. Furthermore, the project will study stable commutator length in RACGs,
contributing to a growing program which has connections to the theory of
quasimorphisms and bounded cohomology, and has applications in a variety of
areas. The last part of the proposal seeks to understand the set possible
distortion functions of subgroups of hyperbolic groups, and conjectures that
this set is vast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
