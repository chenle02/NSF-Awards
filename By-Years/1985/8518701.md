This research project will conduct integrated experimental and analytical
studies on simple components, main subassemblages, and finally a complete
multistory masonry building (Masonry Research Building). These studies will be
conducted using small, medium, and full scale specimens. The objective of the
studies is the development of a reliable methodology for investigating the in-
plane behavior of multistory reinforced hollow unit masonry wall elements when a
building is subjected to earthquake ground motions. Emphasis will be given to
the development of the experimental methodology which will be used as a basis
for studying the earthquake behavior of the full scale Masonry Research
Building. Results from the two and three story in-plane wall tests will be used
to verify the analytical models developed by others.
