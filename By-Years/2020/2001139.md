Representation theory is broadly understood as a study of symmetry. More
precisely, it is a study of ways for a given algebraic object to be realized
concretely via linear symmetries. Quantization means a passage from Classical
Physics to Quantum Physics. An interplay between Representation theory and
Quantization has been, and still is, of enormous importance for both mathematics
and physics. This is a project to both solve some long-tanding classical
problems at the interface of Representation theory and Quantization and to
uncover and study a new kind of "double affine" symmetry. The principal goals
are to fully describe special kinds of symmetries arising from Quantization and
determine their crucial numerical characteristics. This project provides
research training opportunities for graduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of two parts. The first part centers
around the Orbit method, an idea going back to Kirillov in the 1960's, that
suggests that interesting representations should be constructed from geometric
data related to suitable group actions. The PI plans to classify quantizations
of equivariant covers of nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras and use this
classification to solve several important problems in Lie representation theory.
The PI also plans to classify certain interesting Harish-Chandra modules. The
second part concentrates on the study of the representation theory of double
affine type including that of the rational Cherednik algebras over fields of
large positive characteristic and of quantum affine algebras of type A. The
primary goal of this part of the project is to obtain character formulas for the
corresponding categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
