This project will study stochastic optimization from the point of view of
recursive algorithms with improved convergence speed, asymptotic properties of
identification procedures for distributed parameter systems, algorithms for
adaptive filtering and nearly optimal controls for differential delay systems
with wideband noise. An attractive and easily implementable stochastic
approximation algorithm will be analyzed under correlated noise processes. The
idea is to take the average of the iterates obtained in the classical
approximation approach without using "prewhitening". Dealing with the
identification algorithms for distributed systems, a functional invariance
approach will be taken. The resulting properties will help to get a better
understanding on the rate of convergence issue. In the adaptive filtering
problem, algorithms with delays and projection procedures using "sign" will be
investigated. Sufficient conditions for with probability one convergence will be
derived. Nearly optimal controls for differential delay equations subject to
random perturbations and with a small parameter will be developed by means of
weak convergence methods and the use of relaxed controls. Applications of these
studies are found in areas ranging from the analysis of financial markets to the
construction of more precise software for radars.
