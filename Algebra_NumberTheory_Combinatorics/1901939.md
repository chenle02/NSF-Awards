Algebraic number theory concerns numbers that are solutions to polynomial
equations. The number systems in which these solutions live are called algebraic
number fields. One of the central motivating questions in number theory for over
a century has been whether one can construct certain special algebraic number
fields using analytic techniques. Hilbert stated this problem as the 12th in his
famous list of 23 problems at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians.
The problem has been solved in only the simplest cases. These solutions use
special values of modular forms, which are certain analytic functions that have
a rich supply of symmetries. This project outlines a program to give a solution
to Hilbert's 12th problem in an infinite family of new situations. The key ideas
are to use a modern form of analysis, called p-adic analysis, in conjunction
with other advanced techniques in number theory including modular forms, Galois
representations, and Iwasawa theory. Solving Hilbert's 12th problems in these
new cases will be a major advance in our understanding of algebraic number
systems. The PI has stated a conjecture with Spiess for an exact p-adic analytic
formula for Gross-Stark units. These units, along with other easily written
elements, generate the maximal abelian extension of totally real fields.
Therefore, solving this problem can be viewed as providing a solution to
Hilbert's 12th problem for totally real fields. Such a solution to Hilbert's
12th problem is not provided by the usual framework of conjectures for
L-functions, such as Stark's conjectures. The PI will continue his work with
Kakde on attacking his conjecture. Two new ideas relative to previous work on
this topic are the use of the Taylor-Wiles "horizontal Iwasawa theory" method,
as well as the introduction of group-ring families of modular forms. Next, in
joint work with Spiess, the PI has stated a conjecture for the principal minors
and characteristic polynomial of Gross' regulator. The PI plans to work together
with Spiess and Kakde to generalize the techniques described above to higher
rank (in particular the application of the Taylor-Wiles method) and thereby
prove his conjecture on principal minors, which again goes beyond the usual
framework of p-adic L-functions. Finally, the PI will work with Guido Kings to
apply the Eisenstein cocycle to the study of abelian L-functions of general
number fields. Two important test cases to consider are ground fields that are
almost totally real and ground fields that are abelian extensions of CM fields.
