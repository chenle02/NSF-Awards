This project investigates the normative structure of explan- ations for
actions. The investigation is based on sociological theories of the need to
develop 'accounts,' acceptable explana- tions for potentially disruptive acts.
Hypotheses tested are: (1) that acceptance of explanations increases with the
degree of agreement upon norms of acceptable behavior; (2) that independent of
norms, acceptance increases if the person offering an explana- tion has high
status; (3) that role and status expectations determine what type of accounts
are most acceptable; and (4) that where dissension exists on norms, higher
levels of justifications are required. Implications for support or
disconfirmation of each hypothesis, in terms of several competing theories, are
stated. The project uses controlled social experiments to create norms,
violations, and justifications, to test the hypotheses.
