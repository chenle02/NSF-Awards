Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the problem of trust
computation (or trust inference) within distributed and completely decentralized
systems. Work will specifically focus on trust inference in peer-to-peer
networks for distributed resource sharing, where no central authority is
assumed. Most systems of this sort are designed based on the assumption that a
large fraction of users are "altrusitic" while a smaller percentage of users may
be arbitrarily "malicious". This research is intended to address the more
realistic case where all users are "selfish" (or "rational"), and are motivated
by their own self-interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work aims to develop
appropriate models for analyzing trust inference in distributed systems; to
design efficient protocols and mechanisms to ensure cooperative behavior by the
users of the system; and to implement such protocols (and test their
effectiveness) within the NICE framework developed at the University of Maryland
as well as other existing peer-to-peer
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students will be
involved in all aspects of this research. Software developed as part of this
research will be freely distributed for public use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
