A number of systems have now been developed that obviate the need for the use
of animals in the scientific investigation of biological processes. This
research seeks to develop a new model system for the study of neuronal
differentiation in cell culture. When maintained under cell culture conditions,
a small fraction of embryonal stem (ES) cells differentiate into neurons. The
studies that will be performed will investigate methods to maximize the
percentage of ES cells that choose the neuronal development pathway. Success in
this endeavor will provide a number of significant advantages for future
neurobiological research. As an example, the effects of the modification of a
specific gene on neuron development can be studied in culture, without the
necessity of generating animals that carry the modified gene. Further, since the
developmental process under study can be continually monitored, the entire
process is subject to investigation. Development of this technological advance
has the potential, therefore, to be of fundamental importance in understanding
the processes involved in the development of the nervous system.
