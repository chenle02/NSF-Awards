Variations of sensible and latent heat fluxes between different soil and
vegetation conditions can in some cases be significant and may influence the
local development (timing, location and intensity) of deep convective cloud
systems. The Principal Investigators will perform a systematic set of numerical
experiments in order to quantify the mechanisms and effects by which surface
thermal and moisture forcing affect the development of deep convective clouds
over different types of terrain. Emphasis will be placed on vegetated and bare
soil surfaces as well as sea surfaces under a variety of evapotranspiration
conditions. The results will contribute to a basic understanding of the ways by
which surface characteristics influence the development of local deep convection
and may suggest refinements in the forecasting of such events.
