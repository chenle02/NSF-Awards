The University of Indianapolis requests support from NSF for connection of its
campus network to NSFNET. They will contract with INet at Indiana University to
provide a medium speed (56 thousand bits per second) connection to the NSFNET, a
high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The
University needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.***//
