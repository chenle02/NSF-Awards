ABSTRACT 0204377 Shewchuk, Jonathan U of Calif Berkeley

We intend to develop fast, versatile, and visually accurate computational models
for viscoplas-tic materials ranging from stiff, non-compliant solids to low
viscosity fluids. We are designing these models for applications where visual
realism, computation speed, and robustness are the predominant requirements
(with numerical accuracy being subordinate). Examples of such applications
include real-time interactive training simulations (e.g. surgical simulation or
haz-ardous duty simulations) and off-line generation of visualizations (e.g.
cinematic effects or accident reenactment). To achieve this goal, we must
develop fast, guaranteed-quality methods for generating and in-crementally
updating unstructured (irregular) triangular and tetrahedral meshes. Dynamically
changing meshes are a necessity to model the complete range of viscoplastic
materials, espe-cially where large deformations and mixing may occur. Thus, the
actions of the numerical simulation and the remeshing algorithms must be tightly
integrated, especially if we wish to minimize errors due to interpolation and
reinterpolation. To ensure that our dynamic meshing algorithms and
implementations are useful for other applications as well, we will develop a
general methodology for communicating information between the numerical
simulation and the mesh generator.
