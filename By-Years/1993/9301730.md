9301730 Gieskes The objectives of this research project (a renewal) include work
on (1) design, construction, and testing of an ocean borehole-fluid water
sampler that could be deployed using wireline borehole reentry techniques, (2)
sampling of selected ocean boreholes using opportunities provided by French
NADIA/NAUTILE reentry facility activities near selected Deep Sea Drilling
Project/Ocean Drilling Program boreholes in 1993-1994, (3) water sampling at
holes of opportunity, to be collected from the JOIDES Resolution during ocean
drilling legs during 1993-1994, and (4) laboratory experimentation and modelling
of water-rock geochemistry at varying temperatures and pressures. Sampling and
chemical analysis of ocean borehole fluids will provide insights to the nature
of seawater - borehole wall rock chemical reactions, and should help answer
fundamental questions about the role that formation fluids may play in seawater-
borehole interactions. Together with modelling efforts, these observations will
also ultimately be of importance in understanding hydrothermal reactions in
high- temperature ocean boreholes. ***
