This project consists of three separate but related research projects in maximum
simulated likelihood estimation, semiparametric minimum distance estimation and
estimation of nonlinear error-in-variables econometric models with validation
data information. These projects investigate simulation and semiparametric
methods of estimation and statistical tests for many important microeconometric
models. The methodologies will be useful for the estimation and testing of
discrete panel data models, simultaneous equation models with limited dependent
variables, multimarket disequilibrium models, consumer demand and production
systems with nonnegativity and/or quantity constraints, and nonlinear models
with error-in-variables. More specifically, the first part of the project
involves the generalization of bias correction procedures for maximum simulated
likelihood estimation methods developed under the previous NSF grant for
discrete choice models. These estimation and inference procedures are applied to
empirical estimation of consumer demand and/or production systems with data from
Indonesia. The second part introduces semiparametric estimation procedures for
the classical minimum distance estimation method for simultaneous equation
models with qualitative and limited dependent variables, multimarket
disequilibrium models, and sample selection models with conditional expectation
specifications. Semiparametric estimation methods of such models are limited in
the current econometric literature. The third part develops estimation methods
which take into account the information of validation data and survey panel data
and the measurement errors in all of the variables. The proposed methodologies
will be applied to the study of a labor supply model using data from the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics.
