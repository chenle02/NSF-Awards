This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Students from underrepresented groups are being especially
targeted for support and student scholars are enrolled in a Master's program in
either computer science or computational mathematical modeling. The scholarship
program builds on a successful CSEMS program on campus, but focuses only on
graduate students in the targeted academic programs. Students are participating
in research projects, with direct supervision from faculty, and are being
strongly encouraged to pursue a PhD upon completion of their Master's degree.
The results from the project are being rigorously evaluated through both
qualitative and quantitative measures.
