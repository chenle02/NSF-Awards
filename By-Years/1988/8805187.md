The underlying theme of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program is the chemical elucidation of highly reactive
species and the study of products derived therefrom. Metal vapor and
conventional synthetic methodology will be employed to prepare fluorocarbon
complexes of early transition metals. Trapping of metallic and molecular
clusters will be accomplished by solvation and/or ligand injection during
cluster growth in low temperature solvents. Further elucidation of bimetallic
solvated metal atom dispersed (SMAD) catalysts will be carried out using
structure sensitive reaction chemistry coupled with spectroscopic probes,
especially EXAFS, Mossbauer and XPS techniques. In order to develop the highly
reactive synthon CS to its full potential, attempts will be made to synthesize
precursors which evolve CS at relatively elevated temperatures. Several of the
substances under study in this project have potential for industrial
applications. Of particular interest in this connection are the metal atom
clusters of carefully-controlled size and the highly reactive SMAD catalysts.
