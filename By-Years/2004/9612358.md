9612358 Kelly This conference proposal brings a total of 200 teachers, at least
50 of whom are directly funded through this award, from across the country to
the Supercomputing '96 in Pittsburgh, PA , for three days of conference
workshops. This year the workshops and the educational theme are integrated into
the whole conference, with open sessions appropriate for teachers and for
computer scientists and technicians. The educational strand includes hands-on
workshops, presentations and demonstrations by experts as well as teachers in
currently successful high school supercomputing programs. Teachers will pay
their own reduced registration for Supercomputing '96 and can visit the
exhibits, poster sessions, keynote address and special presentations at the
conference. Other commitments are expected to support 150 additional teachers.
Many other expenses are covered through other agencies or other participation
such as hardware rental, all the PI time, web access, sustained on-line
interactions after the meeting, etc. The only expense for which funds have been
requested is that which will go directly for participant support. Formal cost
sharing is $3200 of administrative fees is committed by IEEE, slightly less than
1%. However, all personnel, equipment and other costs are supported by the
conference.
