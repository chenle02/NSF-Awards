This award supports a Postdoctoral Fellow--Dr. Samantha Hansen--to explore
Antarctica's crust and upper mantle using new seismic methods. The project's
goal is to understand the tectonic processes that shape the Antarctic continent.
Two recently developed methods will be used: (1) joint modeling of S-wave
receiver functions and surface wave dispersion to provide improved estimates of
crustal thickness, and (2) adaptive gridding tomography using body wave travel
times to produce a new upper mantle velocity model for the whole of Antarctica.
The broader impacts are increasing the participation of an early career, woman
PI and graduate and undergraduate education with outreach to groups
underrepresented in the earth sciences. The results have societal relevance by
providing new geologic constraints for ice sheet models relevant to
understanding sea level rise in warming world.
