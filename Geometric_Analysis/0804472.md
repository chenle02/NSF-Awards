The P.I. will study three problems. The first problem involves the study of heat
kernel bounds by stochastic methods. The goal is to find estimates which are
independent of dimension and hence applicable to infinite dimensional heat
flows. In the case of hypoelliptic heat kernels, the P.I. is looking for precise
heat kernel upper and lower bounds. The second problem is to study the quasi-
invariance and smoothness properties of heat kernel measures on infinite
dimensional Lie groups. The P.I. hopes to find examples of infinite dimensional
subelliptic operators which are hypoelliptic. The proof of these results will
rely on the results of the first problem. The third problem relates to the
understanding of Euclidean Feynman path integrals by finite dimensional
approximations. In particular, it is proposed to carry this program out for
super-symmetric path integrals. These results and their generalizations should
have ramifications to the Stolz-Teichner program of geometrizing elliptic
cohomologies.

In the 1940's, Feynman proposed a beautiful, but highly heuristic, theory for
understanding quantum mechanics in terms of the more familiar concepts arising
in classical mechanics. Feynman's heuristic ideas have had a significant
influence on the mathematical theory of topology. (Topology is the study of the
basic shape properties of surfaces and other more general "manifolds.") The P.I.
will investigate a number of problems related to Feynman's model in the context
of elementary particle physics. Despite being studied for 70 plus years, the
mathematical foundations of these types of theories are still not well
understood and many interesting questions remain open. For example, physicists
believe that "quarks" should be confined. However, with the current state of the
models, the theoretical derivation of quark confinement is out of reach. The
specific goals of this proposal are: 1) to use probabilistic techniques to
describe qualitative and quantitative behavior of the flow of heat in high
dimensional spaces, and 2) to develop methods for understanding the "super-
symmetric Feynman path integral." It is hoped that the results developed during
this grant period will be applicable to the particle physics models and to
mathematical topology. This proposal includes a training component as some of
the problems will be given to graduate students.
