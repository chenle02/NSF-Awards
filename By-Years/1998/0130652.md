0130652&lt;br/&gt;Pinder&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
investigate the use of a new approach to the modeling of groundwater flow and
transport systems. A Monte-Carlo simulation approach is the only viable method
for the solution of such problems involving large uncertainties in parameter
values, such as hydraulic conductivity; but current methods require enormous
computational effort and they require the use of rectangular numerical meshes.
The goal of this research is to explore a new approach to generating random
fields for both parameters and state variables that results in significantly
less computational effort when simulating groundwater flow and transport and
that can also be used on a triangular (or other irregular) finite-element mesh.
The approach uses a variant on Latin-hypercube sampling to perform the necessary
Monte-Carlo simulations. The overall goal is to increase both computational
speed and mathematical flexibility when solving such problems described using
parameters characterized by random fields. The computational efficiency will be
achieved by reducing the number of realizations required to represent a random
field to a specified degree of accuracy. The mathematical modeling flexibility
will be enhanced by extending current random field representation technology to
accommodate irregular finite-element simulation meshes, a technology that does
not currently exist. This project could lead to significant gains in efficiency
and effectiveness in solving difficult problems of groundwater contamination and
flow, as well as a wide range of other problems in engineering and
physics.&lt;br/&gt;
