Through this project, a novel photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) instrument will
be developed to measure aerosol absorption throughout the UV-visible range of
the spectrum. In addition, the role of charge-transfer complexes in the
absorption of UV-visible light by ambient aerosols will be investigated, as will
the hypothesis that this factor may be subject to change upon oxidation by O3
and OH radicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide insight into
the nature of brown carbon in ambient aerosol and investigate how it may evolve
through oxidation and aging. The project will also improve the state-of-the-art
for determining aerosol optical properties, and for understanding the impact of
carbonaceous aerosols on climate change and air quality.
