This research addresses theoretical and algorithmic aspects of integer and
combinatorial programming. Among the theoretical questions are: when is a
combinatorial optimization problem whose constraint matrix has coefficients of
0, 1, or -1 solvable as a linear program (balanced 0, +1, -1 matrices); how can
one restate a given problem in a higher dimensional space so that projecting it
back on the original space results in a better formulation (lifting/projecting
techniques); for a given Lagrangean formulation, how can one find a valid
inequality whose inclusion into the Lagrangean is guaranteed to improve the
bound provided by the latter (the face separation problem). Among the
algorithmic objectives of the project are: an efficient branch and cut algorithm
for mixed 0-1 programs based on lift and project cuts; improved bounding
procedures for the traveling salesman problem and some of its relatives, based
on the use of newly identified facets, and expected to produce improved
algorithms for difficult industrial scheduling problems and several types of job
shop scheduling problems.
