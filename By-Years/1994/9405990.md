Babcock 9405990 The Chengjiang Biota is the oldest known fossil assemblage of
exceptionally preserved organisms in the world, including soft- bodied and
shell-bearing animals, as well as marine plants. This assemblage is a unique
window into the history of early metazoan evolution. In collaboration with
Chinese colleagues, PI will 1) complete systematic and comparative studies of
the organisms, 2) determine biogeographic affinities of the organisms, 3)
describe the small shelly fossils, 4) interpret aspects of preservation of the
fossils, and 5) describe and interpret associated trace fossils.
