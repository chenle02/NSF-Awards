9409045 Massone The research proposed in this application is concerned with
investigating the relevance of dynamic motor maps in the design of control
systems for biological and artificial plants using a computational, neural
network based approach. Dynamic motor maps are found in one area of the brain
called the superior colliculus. The superior colliculus plays a major role in
the control of gaze shifts, that is, a combined movement of the head and eyes.
Dynamic motor maps exhibit a number of interesting properties that make them
very general, flexible and effective devices that can be employed to control not
only the head and eye movement system, but any kind of system. The specific aims
of the project are to: (1) continue and extend ongoing studies of dynamic motor
maps in the oculomotor system, (2) extend the use of dynamic motor maps to the
arm motor system, and (3) study mechanisms of hand-eye coordination by coupling
the eye motor map and the arm motor map. ***
