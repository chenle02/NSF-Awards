9527553 Awschalom This interdisciplinary, two-campus project employs cutting-
edge techniques from the fields of optical science and condensed matter physics.
An ultra-high-vacuum scanning tunneling microscope will be used to synthesize
both individual and arrays of magnetic structures directly on III-V
semiconductor substrates and devices. The intrinsic magnetic behavior of the
structures will be examined using microscopic Hall bar magnetometers, Aharonov-
Bohm rings, ballistic transport, and high-sensitivity mechanical torque
measurements. The influence of magnet particles on the spin-dependent electronic
state in semiconductors will be investigated through femto-second-resolved
Faraday and luminescence spectroscopes. In particular, the latter studies
include spatially-resolved optical microscopy. %%% This experimental and
theoretical project employs atomic-scale lithography, low-dimensional electronic
transport, and ultra-fast magnetooptical spectroscopies at low temperature to
investigate quantum magnetic structures. A unique aspect of the work is the in
situ fabrication of "nanomagnets" only a few dozen atoms in diameter, whose
optical and magnetic properties will be investigated. The work encompasses
semiconductor physics, optics, and magnetism. The training gained by students in
the areas of optical science and engineering will prepare them for a wide
spectrum of career opportunities. The nanosize magnetic semiconductors exhibit
novel magnetooptical phenomena that are currently incompletely understood, but
which are felt to have great potential as possible device structures. ***
