In prior research on models of political party competition as it affects policy
formulation, researchers have assumed either that parties seek to implement
policy as close to a preferred position as possible, or that they adopt policy
positions in an attempt to maximize their electoral support. Prior theoretical
work by the Principal Investigator suggests that both considerations are
relevant for party competition in multiparty democracies. In this investigation
the researchers will draw on recent theoretical analyses using game theory and
social choice as well as empirical work on party policies to construct a general
model of political competition in multiparty democracies, principally in
European countries. Coalition politics in such countries has proved very
difficult to analyze from a general theoretical perspective. However, careful
study of the declared policy positions of parties in a number of these countries
(including Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Denmark) has provided a
clearer picture of the process of inter-party negotiation and bargaining and
hence of government coalition formation in these countries. This research should
provide insights that are of general validity on the process of policy
implementation and on the stability of the political process.
