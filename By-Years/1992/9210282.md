This study will use a porohyperelastic model to study fluid transport, and in
particular lipid transport, within the arterial wall. This model will include
history-dependent finite deformation, stress, and transmural tissue fluid flow.
Experimental studies will be used to verify and/or modify the model. The model
that will be developed in this study is a step towards achieving a comprehensive
arterial wall model that would help explain the etiology of atherosclerosis. The
results could have an impact on the design of arterial vascular prostheses and
be useful in the study of other tissues including cartilage and skin.
