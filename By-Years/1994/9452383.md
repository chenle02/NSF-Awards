9452383 Mickley Research in the field of Neuroscience is progressing rapidly and
student demand is high for curriculum in this area. To support this need, we
provide a laboratory for undergraduates (psychology majors and non-majors at all
levels) with some demonstrations and a variety of hands-on experiences in
behavioral neuroscience. The project focuses on laboratory experiences in a
physiological psychology course. However, demonstrations of basic neuroscience
techniques and knowledge gained from these techniques are integrated into other
courses in the psychology curriculum. The project utilizes equipment to enhance
skills with computers as research tools, the learning of brain anatomy, the
brain's structural-functional relationships and the practical methods of
neurophysiology and behavior. These enhancements also support our emphasis on
the learning of general scientific principles.
