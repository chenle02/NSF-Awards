The National Science Foundation funds over seven billion dollars of research
annually, nearly all of which relies heavily on information technology. The
digital data produced and computing systems used by that research are subject to
risks from cyber attacks, in some cases similar to other data and computing
systems on the Internet and in other cases particular to their research mission.
Cybersecurity appropriate to the research mission is necessary both to make
today's scientific discoveries possible and to ensure that the science is
trustworthy. Appropriate cybersecurity must respect the collaborative
environments that span organizational and national boundaries, the high-
performance technologies used to manage large scale data and computation, and
the dynamic information technology demands common in NSF research. Different
science domains also have varying requirements for data confidentiality,
availability, and integrity. These aspects challenge the use of traditional
cybersecurity paradigms and technologies to manage the risks to trustworthy,
reproducible research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the NSF Cybersecurity Center of
Excellence, Trusted CI brings together experts in cybersecurity, knowledgeable
and experienced in the NSF research endeavor, who provide the NSF community with
the leadership and support necessary to tackle the cybersecurity challenges to
NSF research. Trusted CI directly supports individual NSF cyberinfrastructure
projects and Major Facilities through collaborative engagements that address
specific project needs. Trusted CI engagement activities include (but are not
limited to) security reviews, security architecture design, identity and access
management, and software assurance. Trusted CI provides cybersecurity
situational awareness to the NSF cyberinfrastructure community through timely
advisories and notices. Trusted CI organizes the annual NSF Cybersecurity Summit
for Large Facilities and Cyberinfrastructure, providing the community with the
opportunity to share lessons learned, attend practical training sessions, and
collaborate on solving common challenges. Trusted CI performs outreach and
dissemination of best practices via the Trusted CI website
(http://trustedci.org), blog posts, email lists, and online chats, as well as
providing cybersecurity training in person and via online courses. Leadership
activities of Trusted CI include developing a cybersecurity framework for NSF
science and fostering the transition to practice of NSF cybersecurity
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
