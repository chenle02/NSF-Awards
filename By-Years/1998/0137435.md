This grant by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports work by Professor Reuben H. Simoyi at West Virginia University to
investigate the reaction mechanisms of small organic sulfur compounds. Focus
areas are: S-oxygenation, enzymatic and nonenzymatic metabolic activation,
radical species, decomposition and autoxidation reactions, and toxicity effects.
These areas of investigation relate to important physiological, environmental
and industrial processes involving oxidation, C-S bond cleavage and radical
intermediates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reactions of sulfur compounds will be
studied, particularly with regard to their utility in understanding sulfur
reactivities in physiological, environmental and industrial
processes.&lt;br/&gt;
