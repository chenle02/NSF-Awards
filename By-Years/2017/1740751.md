The aim of this project is to plant the seeds for an interdisciplinary institute
devoted to foundations of data science at MIT. During the three years of Phase
I, the project goal is to stimulate research and educational interactions
between mathematics, statistics and theoretical computer science, both within
MIT and in the research community at large. On the way, the team will also
develop the organizational capabilities and visibility needed for the
(potential) Phase II activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project activities in
Phase I will be organized around 5 semester-long themes. Each theme will be
devoted to a topic at the intersection of at least two (and often three) TRIPODS
areas, and will focus on catalyzing interactions between them. The specific
themes are: statistical and computational tradeoffs, sub-linear algorithms and
distribution testing, learning with complex structures, graphical models and
exchangeability, and non-convex optimization. Within each theme, the PIs will
organize numerous activities, including a workshop, a fall/spring school
covering introductory material, and regular seminars. They will also support
knowledge transfer activities, including office hours that will offer free help
and consultation on algorithmic, mathematical and statistical aspects of data
science. To facilitate the interactions between the participants, the project
will support two project postdocs, who will play the role of connectors between
different disciplines.
