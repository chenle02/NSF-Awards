ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Gerald J. Meyer of Johns
Hopkins University is developing new methods for the rapid screening of
biological warfare agents by FTIR spectroscopy. The idea is to develop porous
substrates to filter and trap spores for subsequent identification with FTIR
spectroscopy. The eventual goal of this work is to develop a reliable, sensitive
method for the discrimination between biological warfare agents and ubiquitous,
naturally-occurring species. The work will develop the method using Bacillus
Subtilis var. niger first, a biological warfare surrogate. Various types of
porous substrates will be synthesized using electrochemical and reactive ion-
etching techniques. One female graduate student will be involved in this work on
the rapid identification of biological warfare agents by
FTIR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the NSF and the
Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in the
Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic
research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
