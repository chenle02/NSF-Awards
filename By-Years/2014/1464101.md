Increasing the safety of high-capacity, high-discharge rate batteries is
essential for all battery technologies. The safety problems stem from the
breakdown of membranes separating the positive and negative poles of the
battery. Such events lead to short-circuits leading to overheating and fires.
Polymers for these membranes must be strong, temperature resilient, and have
very small uniform pores. Successful preparation and use of these new materials
could raise the specific energy of batteries to 200 Wh/kg, making possible a new
generation of electrical vehicles with longer range, lower weight, higher speed,
and better safety standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
focused on new approaches to resolve this problem of safe membranes by
evaluating the platform technology of aramid nanofibers membranes recently
invented at University of Michigan. They are made from well-known Kevlar and
show exceptional resilience to high temperature as well as high strength. Aramid
nanofiber sheets can be potentially applicable for a wide spectrum of batteries.
In the course of this project the team will establish the technological
potential of the nanofiber-based membranes for automotive industry and consumer
electronics producers. The team will also evaluate other potential uses of
aramid nanofiber membranes for filtration and desalination.
