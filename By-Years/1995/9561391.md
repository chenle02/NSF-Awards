95-61391 Girone This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
demonstrate the technical and economic merit of a recently invented and patented
self-cleaning filter. The novel device permits localized sequential backwashing
of a filter element in a continuously operating filter. The result is a filter
with extremely long run times, very low maintenance requirements, and a clear
potential for substantial cost savings. A wide variety of conventional filter
media can be employed thus enabling a broad range of possible commercial
applications. The idea appears especially promising for filtration and
separation systems that recover product from a process effluent stream as well
as for those that require a final polishing stage beyond a conventional solids
separation process. In both these cases, ultimate disposal of the backwash
stream is not required and there is a strong potential for significant pollution
prevention. The conceptual design has been completed and some encouraging
preliminary test results have been obtained using an early prototype. The
research objectives are therefore to design and build the second generation
prototype, conduct filtration and backwash performance tests, further delineate
the range of potential commercial applications, and begin to assemble a
computer-based performance and cost model to facilitate process optimization.
The initial market focus is to provide final effluent polishing filters for
wastewater treatment facilities The way this filter works, however, has very
important implications for the future: The backwash flow generated is returned
to the head of works eliminating the need for additional residuals treatment.
Thus, as solids and bacterial discharge standards to rivers, lakes, estuaries,
and oceans become more stringent, this filter could be used to substantially
improve the final effluent quality without any major upgrade to the treatment
plant.
