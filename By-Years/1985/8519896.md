This work will apply robust controllers developed to handle aerospace problems
to the chemical process industries. Robust controllers perform a required task
even though the mathematical model of the system to be controlled might be a
poor one. The reachers will try to adapt and improve synthesis, and combine it
with internal model control (IMC) now being successfully used for chemical plant
control. The specific issues to be addressed include: (1) mathematical
formulation of practical control problems suitable for synthesis; (2)
qualitative understanding of the factors determining the optimal solution; (3)
alternate controller parametrization; and (4) contrained control.
