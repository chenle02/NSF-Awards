The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the area of
Materials Chemistry. For a three-year period beginning in 1992, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer engaged in research
activities, ranging from synthesis of new materials to characterization of their
physical and chemical properties. The goal of this program and its unique
feature - its concentration on highly-qualified women - will ultimately
introduce into graduate programs women who have been directly involved in the
creative fusion of Chemistry and Materials Science.
