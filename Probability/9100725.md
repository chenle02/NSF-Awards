The project will support research into a number of problems in probability
theory. Liggett will consider several questions related to interacting particle
systems: survival and extinction of contact processes in random environments,
rates of convergence to equilibrium in the exclusion process, survival of the
threshold voter model, and the limiting behavior of an infinite series of
queues. Schonmann will consider problems in interacting particle systems and
large deviations: metastability for stochastic Ising models, critical behavior
of cellular automata, and large deviations for random fields. The principal
investigators will conduct research on several problems in probability theory.
The primary focus will be on interacting systems of particles. These systems
arise in modeling physical and biological systems, and have applications in
other areas, such as computer science.
