The main focus of this project is on the development of technology that predicts
the behavior of certain mathematically defined dynamical systems that are
platonic idealizations of a broad class of mathematical models used to describe
everyday physical processes of the real world. Apart from helping us understand
natural phenomena amid random fluctuations, this technology is also becoming
increasingly necessary for understanding complex systems built by humans to meet
the demands of modern society. The principal investigator will participate in
various workshops and conferences around the world to disseminate the most
recent discoveries of his research program and to keep up with latest
developments in the field. These trips also provide the opportunity for PI to
work with his collaborators. PI will also invite some of his international
collaborators to the U.S. to work with him on their joint projects.

This project addresses a long-standing problem to generalize the well-known
combinatorial description of geodesics on the modular surface whose dynamical
behavior is intimately tied to the theory of approximation of irrational numbers
by rationals. The principal investigator proposes several generalizations of the
seamless integration of number theory and dynamics to higher dimensions using
several well-chosen Poincare sections of homogeneous flows to replace the all-
powerful Gauss continued fraction algorithm, and introducing Farey tilings to
take the role of continued fractions and provide a combinatorial description of
the special linear group under its full diagonal subgroup. These generalizations
germinated in the principal investigators previous work on the determination of
the Hausdorff dimension of the set of singular vectors and promise to lead to
new insights of fundamental significance in simultaneous approximation theory.
