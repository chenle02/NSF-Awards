This collaborative research proposal aims to combine high-resolution tomographic
datasets with state-of-the-art pore-scale modeling techniques to investigate the
flow and entrapment of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). We will focus on mixed-
wettability systems and the impact of geometric descriptors and anisotropy on
multiphase flow. Synchrotron microtomography stations at Center for Advanced
Microstructures and Devices at Louisiana State University and the Advanced
Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory will be used to capture highly
resolved images from multiphase porous medium experiments. In addition to
capturing the morphological structure of these systems, pore-scale properties
(e.g., pore body/throat distribution and correlation, tortuosity, connectivity,
etc ... ) can be calculated from these images. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins
University will use the data and results from these experiments to extend their
pore-morphological approaches to model imbibition. LB methods will be used to
accurately model various aspects of multiphase flow including thick wetting
phase films in strongly water-wet systems, heterogeneous wettability, and
anisotropic spatial correlations of the pore space.
