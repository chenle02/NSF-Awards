Abstract ATM-9502776 Kappel, Ellen Joint Oceanographic Institutions Inc. Title:
NANSEN Arctic Drilling Program Secretariat FY 95 and FY 96 This award supports
the program Secretariat for the NANSEN Arctic Drilling Program (NAD), a major
international research effort designed to understand the geological evolution of
the Arctic as well as the history of Arctic environmental change and its forcing
functions. This knowledge will help predict the future of the Arctic basin and
its effect on global processes. NAD is developing strategic plans for acquiring
long, high-resolution sediment cores and deep basement cores needed to
understand the Cenozoic and Mesozoic paleoceanography, paleobiology, and
structural history of the Arctic region. The program is composed of eight member
countries (Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and
the USA) and four observer countries (Denmark, Iceland, The Netherlands, and
Russia). The NAD Secretariat which is housed at Joint Oceanographic Institutions
Inc. and will provide logistical support, communication, public awareness, and
inter- program cooperation.
