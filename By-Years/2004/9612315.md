9612315 Chong We propose a one-semester three-credit laboratory course in which
first-year graduate students are introduced to several competing modern
multivariable control schemes applied to a variety of physical processes. In
this first development phase of the laboratory, we propose to purchase one
complete set of the hardware and software required for each experiment. In
addition, we required for each half-time graduate assistants. The School of
Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University will provide matching
funds to cover half of the total cost of the hardware and software. ***
