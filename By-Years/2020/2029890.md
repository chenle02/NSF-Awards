Anecdotal news accounts make clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is having profound
impacts on crime and on jail and prison populations in the United States. The
short-term reductions in most crimes are consistent with various opportunity-
based theories of crime with fewer people on the streets and visiting places
like bars. The reports of increased domestic violence align with opportunity-
based theories and in addition strain-based theories. Over the longer term,
however, the reported crime reduction trends may reverse themselves as people
become more economically impacted. Impacts of restricted admissions and
accelerated releases from local jails and prisons on crime and on infection
rates, within these facilities during this pandemic, are also unknown and of
policy interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Analyses will be conducted at the level
of county and city for crime and jail population impacts and at the level of the
state for prison population impacts. To estimate these effects we aim to do
difference-in-difference type analyses. The main objectives of this project are
to provide a rapid analysis of these impacts on crime and corrections
populations to be completed prior to a possible future resurgence of the
pandemic, and to share with policymakers rigorous analyses that will assist in
informing their decisions in dealing with the crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
