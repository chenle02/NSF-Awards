Community Ambassadors in Science Exploration (CASE) is a new model for
encouraging the appreciation and understanding of science among underserved
families through: a corps of teen and adult peer presenters; a curriculum of
hands-on learning experiences for families of diverse ages and backgrounds; a
regional network of museum-community collaboration; integration of community and
museum resources through joint programming; and a longitudinal research study of
program impacts. CASE will serve over 20,000 people over three years with peer-
presented family learning opportunities and museum experiences. In addition,
CASE will train a total of 108 science ambassadors who will offer science
workshops at community-based organizations in the languages spoken by their
constituencies. Through CASE, the ambassadors will gain training and experience
in informal science education that can open the door to possible future career
opportunities in community and museum settings. Building on a ten-year history
of museum-community collaboration, CASE will be conducted by PISEC, the
Philadelphia/Camden Informal Science Education Collaborative. PISEC includes
four major Philadelphia informal science institutions: The Franklin Institute,
the Philadelphia Zoo, The Academy of Natural Sciences and The New Jersey State
Aquarium. This organization conducts research and outreach projects in support
of family science learning.
