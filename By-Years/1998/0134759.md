Professor Urs Jans, of the Department of Chemistry at CUNY City College, is
supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies to
generate data to help in evaluating the persistence and fate of two major
classes of contaminants in sensitive ecosystems. Phosphorothionate esters and
carbamates are among the most widely used insecticides in the U.S. Such
contaminants are of toxicological concern in sensitive coastal ecosystems such
as estuaries and salt marshes. It is likely that reactions with reduced sulfur
species (particularly polysulfides) present in anoxic subregions of coastal
water bodies could have a significant impact on rates of removal of such
contaminants. Providing the necessary data is the principal objective of this
research. Some of the products of these reactions may be of environmental
significance; hence, an additional goal of these studies is to provide data
related to the ultimate fate of such compounds by examining their ability to
bind covalently to natural organic matter. Rates of reaction of reduced sulfur
species with a group of phosphorothionate esters and carbamate insecticides will
be determined in well-defined systems, additional experiments will be conducted
using more complex matrices of natural sulfuric waters.

Therefore, with this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Programs supports Professor Urs Jans, of the Department of Chemistry CUNY City
College who will generate data in his research that will help in evaluating the
persistence and fate of two major classes of contaminants in sensitive
ecosystems. The results will be useful to EPA for establishing scientifically
based limits on insecticide usage in coastal areas. Dissemination of the results
from the proposed curriculum development will benefit other universities to
modify the ways in which students learn. Being located at a minority serving
institution this proposed project will promote the training of students from
underrepresented groups.
