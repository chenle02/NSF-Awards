9361545 Meador Waveguides are used to transmit light through optical processors.
Combining the resolution potential of deep-UV photolithography and the extreme
sensitivity/high contrast of chemically amplified positive acting (CAMP) resists
offers a potentially simple method for fabricating highly resolved, polymeric
waveguides structures. CAMP resists can be mated with other cladding materials
with lower refractive indices to provide the necessary gradient. The objectives
of this program (Phases I and II) are to optimize CAMP resists for waveguide
applications, to directly fabricate structure using deep-UV exposure, and to
characterize the structure's performance. CAMP resists (thin film) are noted for
outstanding sensitivity, contrast, and resolution; but thick film performance is
not well documented. For the Phase I effort, we will synthesize two acid-
sensitive polymers {poly(p-t-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene) and poly(p-
t-butoxycarbonyloxystyrene-sulfone)} and two photoacid generators
(2,6-dinitrobenzyl tosylate and triphenylsulfonium triflate). The polymers and
photoacid generators will be chemically characterized; and formulated resists
will be tested for thick film application performance, deep-UV sensitivity,
contrast, resolution, near infrared absorption, and refractive index. Resist(s)
will be micromachined into waveguides and at least one structure characterized
(optical loss, SEM, refractive index). The resist materials and waveguide
fabrication procedures developed in Phase I will be further improved in Phase II
and preferred light guiding structures characterized. ***
