This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward
improving Flexible Integrated Manufacturing (FIM) by making robots more
flexible, thereby increasing economic competitiveness. Specifically, this will
be achieved by researching and developing robust triaxial force sensor arrays
for robot end-effectors so that less specialized end-of-arm tooling can be used
for a variety of automation tasks. Besides reducing the need for custom end-
effectors, the triaxial arrays, or triaxial tactile sensors, will also provide
critical force information during robot tasks. This information can be used to
monitor the process or in feedback control of the robot to assure that parts are
properly grasped, to detect and possibly correct of slippage, and to guide
manipulation. In Phase I Bonneville Scientific, Inc., will attempt to establish
the feasibility of an ultrasonic technique for triaxial force sensing. If
successful, this will provide the basis for the further research and development
in Phase II, culminating with a complete computer-based triaxial tactile sensor
system. Besides use in industrial automation, the triaxial sensors will have
application ranging from automotive tire testing and development to foot force
sensing and gait analysis.
