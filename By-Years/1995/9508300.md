9508300 Engebretson This Research in Undergraduate Institutions project will
investigate the regional geological significance of rock units within the
eastern San Juan Islands of the Pacific Northwest. Preliminary work has shown
there to be similarities between these rocks, those of the western San Juan
Islands and those of the North Cascades to the east. The study will comprise
detailed geological mapping of critical contacts, paleomagnetic analysis,
geochemistry, and radiometric and paleontological age control. The data will
provide an indication of the overall tectonic evolution of the area and its
relationship to other parts of North America, and will be synthesized into up-
to-date plate reconstruction models. Undergraduate students at Western
Washington University will be involved in every phase of the study. The results
will have significance for many other tectonic regions that contain
ophiolitic/continental arc assemblages.
