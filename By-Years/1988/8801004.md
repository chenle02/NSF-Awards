This renewal award will continue support of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
MRG glass science group. Its research is focused on chemical and microstructural
aspects of glass stability. Topics of a chemical nature include diffusion of
water into glass, dissolution rates of glass in aqueous solutions, rates of
attack in seawater, stability of fluoride and chalcogenide IR transmitting
glasses, and defects in ion- implanted silica glass. Additional research deals
with glass structure: influence of dissolved volatiles on phase separation and
phase stability, structural relaxation processes, light scattering and phonon
attenuation mechanisms, behavior under high pressure, and effects of nitrogen
doping. The collaborative, multi-investigator group includes four faculty from
materials engineering, one from physics, and one from geology.
