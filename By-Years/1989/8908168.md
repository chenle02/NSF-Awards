Nine controlled-environment plant growth chambers will be utilized to provide
the climate control necessary to conduct important studies in the area of plant
physiology and biochemistry. Specific studies include the investigation of: 1)
carbon metabolism in C3-C4 intermediate plants, 2) the regulation of
photosynthesis at super-optimal light intensities, 3) the utility of stable
carbon isotopes in studying the integration of the C3 and C4 photosynthetic
pathways and 4) the regulation of fungal hyphae during the formation of
parasitic or mutualistic relationships.
