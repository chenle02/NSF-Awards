9727096 Ladisch This proposal addresses the processing of cellulose- containing
wastes and residues into sugars which can be fermented into oxygenated chemicals
and fuel additives. The proposed approach builds upon a recently confirmed
pretreatment method in which cellulosic materials are pressure cooked in water
to make them susceptible to enzyme hydrolysis. The proposed research will carry
out exploratory research to screen, identify, and characterize biodegradable
enzyme mimetic(s) for formation of glucose from cellulosic materials pretreated
by aqueous pressure cooking. The research is directed toward identifying organic
acid catalysts, particularly fatty or long chain acids which will adsorb on
cellulose and hydrolyze the -glycosidic bonds to give glucose. The general goal
of the research is to con tribute to the reduction in cost of converting a
renewable material, cellulose, into fermentable sugars. Specific objectives are:
1. Rapid screening of a range of organic and fatty acids for their combined
potential to adsorb onto cellulose, hydrolyze glycosidic bonds and pretreated
cellulose, and give only minimal degradation of glucose 2. Selection of one or
two of the organic acids, determination of their rate constants for cellulose
hydrolysis as a function of acid (catalyst)concentrations and temperatures
ranging from80 to 180C 3. Development of a hydrolysis model based on a
mechanistic analysis of adsorption and rate phenomena for the purpose of
bioreactor design, and calculating the cost of the catalyst. Preliminary
experiments using pressure cooker pretreatment of cellulose have shown the
potential of succinic acid as a hydrolysis catalyst. Succinic acid has the added
property of being soluble in boiling water while precipitating from solution at
room temperature. ***
