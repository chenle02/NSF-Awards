This project permits undergraduate students to study human factors/ergonomics in
a state-of-the-art laboratory. Students focus on gathering information on human
capabilities and capacities for use in optimal design of jobs, products,
equipment and the workplace. The equipment included in this laboratory includes:
gas analyzing equipment used to determine physiological cost of heavy physical
work; an environmental chamber which is used to simulate different environmental
conditions - for the study of the effect of factors such as heat on work
performance; anthropometric instruments used to measure body dimensions in
relation to the design and evaluation of the workplace and equipment; and, a
microcomputer that is interfaced to the laboratory for data acquisition and
analysis. The equipment is used by students to conduct laboratory experiments as
part of their coursework and independent studies and project. This award is
being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
