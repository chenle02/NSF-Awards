Rapid advances have been made in recent years in the technology of detecting
and analyzing optical emissions from the upper atmosphere, to yield physical
parameters related to the photochemistry and dynamics of the region. The charge-
coupled device (CCD) allows the simultaneous measurement of many wavelengths
with higher sensitivity than photomultipliers, and with computer control and
digital readout of data into memory, the amount of information now retrievable
on upper atmosphere emissions is around two order of magnitude greater than
previously. As part of the CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of
Atmospheric Regions) program, A new spectrograph has been constructed utilizing
CCD technology. The unit also includes several small imagers, that provide
monochromatic images of structures (such as auroral forms) that the spectrograph
is being directed toward. Several campaigns of observations of upper atmosphere
emissions are planned in conjunction with investigators from other institutions,
and a similar instrument is to make observations from orbit, so that
simultaneous ground and satellite observations of the same volume of space will
be possible.
