Objective: To penetrate the full visible spectrum using a single nanocrystalline
material system, based on colloidal semiconductor quantum dots, to develop
coherent microemitters and their arrays. The proposed approach is guided by two
key research objectives: (a) methods to create ultrahigh density closely-packed
quantum dot thin film red- green-blue optical gain media which can be tightly
adhered on selected substrates and microscale patterned surfaces, and (b)
integration of optical microresonators with the quantum dot media which
incorporate the high gain medium to enable operation for a color-tunable
microlaser at room temperature under practical and realistic excitation
conditions.

Intellectual merit: At the basic level, research aims to maximize the optical
gain in densely packed colloidal quantum dot-based microresonators by
investigating fundamental competition and interaction within interacting quantum
dot excitonic states between radiative (stimulated emission) and nonradiative
processes. At the applied level, this knowledge is employed to design low-cost
thin film gain media which can be patterned and/or conformally deposited and
integrated within optical microcavities for microscale lasers.

Broader impacts: The single material based full spectrum coherent microemitters
may offer a transformative means to develop new types pixelated laser projection
devices, a technologically important outcome for portable displays. The PI aims
to recruit women and other minority students under the REU program and will
participate in outreach events with students and teachers through the already
established program at Brown with Providence Public Schools system. Graduate
students will have opportunity to work with a start-up company to gain
experience transitioning research to technologies.
