The ACM MobiCom conference is the leading international conference focusing on
systems issues in mobile computing and wireless communications. The topics
addressed by MobiCom 2017 are at the core of the current wireless network
evolution. The conference attracts research contributions spanning multiple
disciplines, including wireless networking, vehicular communications, mobile
sensing, personal area networks, mesh networks, distributed algorithms,
scheduling, sensors, and signal processing. In addition to the main session, the
conference also provides good opportunities to students and researchers to
participate in panels, workshops, demos and startup competitions that bring in
brilliant ideas and applications in mobile, wireless networking and
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF travel grant program will help increase
representation and participation of United States-based graduate and
undergraduate students at this conference, and enable sharing of information and
preliminary research results among participating students. Participation of top
conferences like ACM MobiCom is an extremely important part of the graduate
school experience, providing students with an opportunity to interact with more
senior researchers, and exposing them to leading edge research in the field. The
award will enable graduate students who would be otherwise unable, to attend the
main MobiCom 2017 and the associated workshops.
