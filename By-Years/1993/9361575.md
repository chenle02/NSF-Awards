9361575 Rivera This project is to research and develop a knowledge-based,
metalanguage-based object abstractor for the automatic transformation of Ada
programs. This Object Abstractor (XOA) will recognize relationships in existing,
non-object-oriented (OO) Ada, COBOL and C program, and will transform these
programs into a higher-level object-oriented Ada 9X, C++, or COBOL 95
architecture with reusable components. The automatic abstraction and
transformation of existing sources, which for COBOL are valued at $2.3 trillion,
may be the only opportunity to modernize and rescue these sources from
obsolescence. This system will be applicable to other languages at little extra
cost. ***
