This research will continue a project to study climatically induced changes in
biogenic sedimentation in the oceans. The type of biogenic material found in
core samples varies with the paleoclimate and, therefore, appears to be
temperature controlled. This research project will develop more rapid methods
for doing the analysis of the biogenic material, an extend the earlier studies
to both older sediment and other cores where independent estimates of
paliotemperature have been made. The results of this research will lead to the
understanding of causes for changes in primary productivity in the oceans during
climatic changes.
