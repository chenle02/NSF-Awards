This is a geochemical study of organic matter transformations in the sediments
under the Peru Current upwelling system. The Principal Investigator will
evaluate new lipid biomarkers by determining the accuracy with which they have
recorded the history of El Ninyo (El Nino) derived productivity fluctuations.
Such studies of organic matter transformations in sediments are important
because they will lead to an understanding of petroleum formation as well as to
an understanding of the regeneration of inorganic nutrient salts at the
sediment-water interface. Testing the accuracy of the new lipid biomarkers is
important because they could be used to determine the past record of oceanic
productivity, an important goal of current geoscience initiatives. The PI's
samples were taken last year; now he will use high- resolution glass-capillary
gas chromatography, column chromatography, and electron impact mass spectrometry
to analyse these samples for alkanes, stereness, hopenes, aromatics, and fatty
acids.
