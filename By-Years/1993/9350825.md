9350825 Whisnant The goal of this project is to complete the development of a
series of general chemistry laboratory experiments which reflect the practice of
modern chemistry. The two-semester series of experiments is structured as a set
of multi- experiment projects which give students an early introduction to
modern instruments and to the different fields of chemistry. A diode-array
UV/visible spectrophotometer is being used for a discovery-based organic
spectroscopy project in which 32 students record the spectra of a number of
compounds in one class period. It also is being used for a phosphate analysis
which, for the low levels of phosphorus often found in natural water, requires a
sensitive instrument capable of accommodating long path lengths cells. Finally,
it also is being used in a coordination chemistry project. ***
