The computation of the electron distribution function is essential for
comprehensive semiconductor device modeling. The primary objective of this
research initiation project (RIA) is to formulate physically accurate
semiconductor transport models which are suitable of the efficient numerical
computation and develop paralledl algorithms for the evaluation of the electron
distribution function. The novel aspect of the the work is to describe the
motion of electrons in a semiconductor by stochastic differential equations.
This approach provides a direct connection between stochasic differential
equation theory and classical transport theory, and makes it is possible to
apply a plethora of results in stochastic differential equation theory to
semiconductor device modeling. Specifically, transport models will be fornulated
by approximating discontinous random scattering processes with continous random
processes; develop parallel numerical algorithms for the efficient solution of
such transport equations; simulate MOSFET devices by solving the transport
equations self- consistently with the Poisson equation; analyze the asymptotic
behavior in energy of the electron distribution function, etc. The impact of
this research is twofold. First, it will introduce a novel approach to the
developement of semiconductor transport models based on the theory of stochastic
differential equations. Second, the new numerical techniques will lead to
powerful CAD tools for comprehensive semiconductor device analysis.//
