This proposal is to conduct a purposeful Tracer Release Experiment (TRE) in the
North Atlantic Ocean as a component of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE). The PI will systematically release sulfur hexafluoride at predetermined
depths in the ocean and periodically revisit the area to measure its
distribution. Additional supporting observations of the internal wave and
microstructure climate will be made. From these, a measure of the mixing rates
may be determined. Ocean mixing rates are essential ingredients in models of the
circulation.
