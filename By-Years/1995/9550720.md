9550720 Barrera New Mexico State University proposes the improvement of their
science and engineering facilities by purchasing a high resolution scanning
electron microscope. The first objective is to acquire and install an
environmental scanning microscope which can image both "natural" specimens,
without drying or coating, as well as conventionally prepared conducting
specimens, with high resolution, at low as well as high scanning electron
energies. This will enhance on-going research projects on endophytic fungi,
senso- neural cell ultrastructure and characterization of stomatal structure
cells in wilty plants. The second year objective is to acquire and install an
x-ray detecting system, and hardware and software for digital image acquisition,
storage, manipulation and analysis. Sixteen undergraduate and nine graduate
students will participate in the first two years alone. ***
