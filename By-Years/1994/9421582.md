9421582 Martin A major challenge facing brain researchers is to explain how
signals arriving in the brain from sensory receptors is translated into commands
for movement. In this grant, Dr. Martin will examine the organization of the
region of the brain known as the motor cortex and its relation to the steering
of forelimb movements directed toward visual targets. There appear to be
functional subregions of the motor cortex, and they will be analyzed in this
work by selectively, and reversibly, inactivating parts of the motor cortex as
movements are made. This research will increase our understanding of the
principles underlying biological motor control. This understanding should have
important implications for the design of robotic control circuitry and the
development of prosthetic devices. ***
