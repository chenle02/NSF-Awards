Focusing on Appalachian salamanders (Desmognathus ochrophaeus and related
species) whose biology is well characterized, the PI's: (1) developed and
applied new experimental procedures for measuring sexual incompatibility, (2)
established that geographically isolated populations of ochrophaeus have evolved
substantial incompatibility, (3) found that the magnitude of incompatibility is
related to the geographic separation of populations but only weakly related to
genetic differentiation, (4) identified the critical courtship stages which
underlie incompatibility, and (5) found some evidence for stronger
incompatibility in areas where related species occur together. These results lay
the groundwork for the detailed studies of sexual and developmental
incompatibility that the PI's plan to pursue in this proposal. First, the PI's
plan to identify the behavioral mechanisms responsible for the sexual
incompatibility observed between geographically isolated populations of
ochrophaeus. Because there are very few observational studies of sexual
incompatibility in vertebrates and other animals, the proposed behavioral
studies will greatly increase understanding how such incompatibility evolves.
Second, the PI's plan to survey developmental incompatibility among ochrophaeus
populations. This survey will enable the investigations to determine whether
sexual and developmental incompatibility evolve in parallel, an issue that has
never been resolved in vertebrates. Third, the PI's plan to take a statistical
approach to the question of whether sexual incompatibility is enhanced in areas
where related species occur together. Such enhancement has been the centerpiece
in textbook discussions of the evolution of reproductive incompatibility, yet
empirical support for the process is mixed. The PI's plan to test for enhanced
sexual incompatibility in several transects through areas of co- existence, and
to identify the behavioral basis of enhanced sexual incompatibility.
