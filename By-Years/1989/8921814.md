The Marine Science Institute (MSI) at University of California- Santa Barbara
will acquire a modern, atomic absorption spectrophotometer for shared use by a
number of NSF-sponsored researchers at UCSB. The instrumentation will be
installed and maintained as a shared use facility. Atomic absorption
spectrophotometry is a widely used process to analyze the amount of metallic
elements in a solution. It is a very precise process that can detect parts per
million to parts per billion. A variety of NSF-sponsored researchers will make
use of the instrument for studies of ecology, biochemistry and oceanography.
This equipment will be maintained for use by all investigators and will
especially benefit NSF-sponsored research projects by increasing the
capabilities of the institution to support research and engineering activities.
