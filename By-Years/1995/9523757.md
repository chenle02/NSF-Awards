9523757 Bernstein The P.I. propose to create experiments designed to offer
students at the middle and high school levels an exciting view of electronics
principals. Using oscilloscopes donated by the Department of Electrical
Engineering, as well as microphones, speakers, and inexpensively built function
generators and spectrum analyers, we will demonstrate at the appropriate
educational level such skills and concepts as oscilloscope operation, wave
behavior, frequency spectra, harmonics, distortion, and filtering. These
experiments will be written by undergraduates at the University of Notre Dame as
well as presented by them at local schools. In addition, where requested by the
instructor, the lab setups will be donated to the schools for demonstration to a
larger number of classes. ***
