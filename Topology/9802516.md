9802516 Ravenel Professor Ravenel's current research is focused on the telescope
conjecture of stable homotopy theory, one of several conjectures he formulated
20 years ago, and the only one that is not well understood at this time. Other
conjectures he made then have since evolved into the nilpotence theorem of
Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith, the periodicity theorem of Hopkins-Smith, and the the
thick subcategory theorem. All of these are part of the chromatic approach to
homotopy theory, which continues to attract the interest of numerous algebraic
topologists. More specifically, Ravenel has constructed and will study the
Thomified Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence, which includes the usual Eilenberg-
Moore spectral sequence, the Adams spectral sequence, and the Adams-Novikov
spectral sequence as special cases. He also has a program for the computation of
the Morava K-theory of interated loop spaces of spheres. Stable homotopy theory
is a branch of algebraic topology, which has been central to pure mathematics
since its founding by Poincare a century ago. It has been a continuing source of
new ideas in algebra and geometry, as seen in the work of Lefschetz on complex
algebraic varieties in the 1930's, the efforts leading to the proof of the Weil
conjectures of arithmetic algebraic geometry in the 1960's and 1970's, and most
recently, in the successful application of motivic cohomology to the Milnor
conjecture in algebraic K-theory by Voevodsky in 1997. It has also found
numerous applications in differential geometry, in graph theory, and in
theoretical physics. The University of Rochester is one of the leading centers
of algebraic topology in the world. ***
