Polysaccharides are one of the largest classes of naturally occurring
substances. They are found in every form of life where they exhibit complex
structures and are associated with a wide range of biological functions. Their
study is important in order to understand their structures, popoerties and
biological functions. These goals can be achieved by the characterization of
conformational, crystalline and morphological structural features of these
substances. Dr. Sarko will use diffraction analysis, primarily X-rated and
electron diffraction in this project. These methods will be complemented by
computer- based model analysis. The purpose for this is both to increase the
reliability of structural analysis and to make prediction of structure possible.
The modeling techniques to be used will involve the methods of molecular and
quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics.
