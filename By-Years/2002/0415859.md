In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. James Lisy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign will conduct research to study the cooperative and competitive effects
in ion-molecule interactions. The ion-molecule complexes will be studied with
mass-selective mass spectrometric detection, coupled with infrared laser
spectroscopy. The ultimate goal of the research is to gain a better
understanding of the competition between the different kinds of non-covalent
interactions in systems that influence ion selectivity and transport in
biological systems as well as materials science.

The proposed research will train research students in modern experimental
techniques, and will provide basic knowledge that could help lead to
improvements in areas of health and energy technologies.
