This award supports the research in number theory and arithmetic algebraic
geometry of Professor David R. Hayes of the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst. One of Dr. Hayes's projects is to carry out a high-precision
verification of the Refined Stark Conjecture for special values of a p-adic zeta
function defined from a real quadratic field. Another project, more geometric in
nature, is to settle completely a Goldbach-like problem in function fields over
finite fields. As with the Stark- Conjecture problem, Dr. Hayes will make
extensive use of supercomputers in these investigations. Except for counting,
number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, is the
oldest branch of mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have
furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the fields of pure
algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most astonishing
applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer science and
coding theory.
