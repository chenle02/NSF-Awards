DMI-9734914 Tu High speed machining is a technology that has the potential of
drastically reducing machining time, improving product accuracy and surface
finish, and eliminating some finishing processes. One of the major problems in
high-speed machining is the development of spindles with sufficient reliability
to afford the high machining speed. The objective of this GOALI project is to
develop a high-performance spindle prototype which is inherently reliable with
high forgiveness for production error, and to study issues related to its
implementation to high-speed, high-reliability processes. The research tasks
include: 1) Development of an electro-thermo-mechanical model of an entire
motorized spindle system for design sensitivity analysis, 2) Development of an
inherently reliable spindle prototype using the model and new designs, and 3)
Development of a Multiple-sensor based spindle/process monitor. The project will
be performed jointly by Purdue University and Cincinnati Milacron Inc. The
project is expected to have significant impact on the design of next-generation,
high-performance machine tools. The knowledge of spindle dynamics, thermal
behavior, and process factors critical to spindle reliability obtained from the
project could reduce the cost of lost production, spindle inventories, and
spindle rehabilitation due to unexpected premature failures.
