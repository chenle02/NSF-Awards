award will partially support travel costs of some participants in the minitrack
for Data and Knowledge Base Issues in Genomics, which is part of the Hawaii
International Conference on System Sciences/Biotechnology Computing Track. The
conference takes place in Maui, Hawaii, January 4 7, 1994. The minitrack is a
one day workshop consisting of paper presentations and discussion sessions that
will bring together biologists and computer scientists interested in genome data
management and retrieval. Topics to be considered by this workshop include
design and use of databases for genomic mapping and sequences, interchange and
interoperability between genome databases, and integrating genome databases with
knowledge bases. This award is made in conjunction comparable support from the
National Center for Human Genome Research and from the Department of Energy. ***
