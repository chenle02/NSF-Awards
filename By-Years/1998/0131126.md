The objective is the joint effort of the National Science Foundation Directorate
for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Technology Office (ITO) to
establish a National Experimental Platform for Hybrid and Embedded Systems
Technology (NEPHEST).

The Goal of NEPHEST is to provide a common experimental infrastructure for
hybrid and embedded systems research. NEPHEST will include the following major
components:

1. An open framework for integrating hardware and software components of both
laboratory and large-scale experiments for hybrid and embedded systems research.
2. Reusable hardware and software components and tools for experimental systems.
3. An evolving suite of challenge problems, reference solutions, and baselines
for validation and verification of technologies. 4. A National Repository of
components, tools, verification results and documents.
