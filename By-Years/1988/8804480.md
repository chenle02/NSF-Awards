MIT's Minority Summer Science Research Program is an institutional effort to
address the issue of under-representation of blacks, hispanics, and American
Indians in mathematics, the physical and biological sciences in the United
States. This summer program from June 5 to August 12, 1988 will identify ten
talented minority sophomores and juniors from around the country who could
benefit from spending a summer on MIT's campus working in a research laboratory
under the tutelage and guidance of experienced researchers such as MIT faculty
members, postdoctoral fellows, and advanced graduate students. Students who
participate in this program will be better prepared and properly motivated to go
on for the Ph.D. degree in the sciences and help to curtail the under-
representation of minorities in these very critical fields of scientific
investigation.
