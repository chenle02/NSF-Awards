The REU site at the University of Utah is designed to create a unique and
effective research environment for 10-weeks during the summer for 8 students
that are selected from around the country. The University of Utah Department of
Physics and Astronomy currently offers a wide variety of research programs in
which undergraduates are making significant contributions. The research
opportunities within the REU program are numerous and can range from theoretical
modeling to experimental work. For the REU student participants, this program
has six specific goals: 1) acquiring research tools, 2) hands on research
experience, 3) scientific social networking and activities, 4) fostering
diversity through mentorship, 5) developing writing and presentation skills. 6)
exploring future directions.
