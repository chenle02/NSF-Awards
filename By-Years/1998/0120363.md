This effort will develop the computational tools that will enable the
integrative analysis of the multi-genetic functions that metabolic maps
represent. Transcriptional regulatory events will be represented by applying
time-dependent Boolean constraints. With this description one can potentially
interpret, analyze, and predict the effects of transcriptional regulation on
cellular metabolism. Additionally, it is proposed to extract how different
regulatory mechanisms can drive the solution to the edges of a solution space,
where optimal solutions are calculated and where experimental data is available.
Overall, integrating metabolic fluxes with the Boolean representation of
regulatory structures will lead to the broadening of genome-scale models of
microbes, by which optimal growth and metabolic secretion patterns are
represented. Several graduate students will acquire cross-training in
computation, life science, biochemical engineering, and biotechnology.
