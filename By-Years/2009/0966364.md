The project is designed to improve the enrollment, persistence, retention,
graduation and transfer of disadvantaged, underrepresented, and academically
talented students in science, computer science, engineering, and mathematics
majors. The present project is based on a successful CSEMS project. The
college's student body is comprised largely of disadvantaged and
underrepresented students, two-thirds of whom receive financial aid, have a
migrant farming background, or are first generation college students.

During the project's five years, 100 scholarships are being awarded to students
in STEM majors in two categories: incoming freshman with demonstrated academic
ability; and current students with demonstrated academic ability. Scholarship
awards can be up to $5,000 over two years, based on financial need.

Scholarship recipients are recruited on the college campus and at regional
feeder high schools through outreach activities on campus and at regional high
schools, and through the electronic and hard copy dissemination of detailed
program information. The S-STEM project links and leverages existing resources
providing all scholarship recipients access to: academic support; tutoring;
priority registration; counseling; educational planning; academic excellence
workshops; internships; career development; priority transfer support;
additional financial aid; and state-of-the-art computer and technological
equipment and laboratories.
