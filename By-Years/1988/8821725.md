This project continues previous work on the creation of a very large data set,
the "Penn World Table", which enables policymakers and researchers to compare
countries around the world in ways not possible working with the data released
by individual countries or the various international agencies. In addition to
wide dissemination of these "real" data, this project analyzes on a selective
basis the data in conjunction with associated International Comparison Project
(ICP) benchmark data. The System of National Accounts of the United Nations and
other international agencies provides standardized data on expenditures and
prices for many countries. While useful for making judgments about changes over
time in individual countries, these data are of limited value in comparing
different countries because they are denominated in the national currencies of
the individual countries. The upcoming Mark 5 version of the Penn World Table
(PWT5), the next step in the investigators' construction of a System of Real
National Accounts, utilizes the price information collected in the latest (1985)
benchmark study of the ICP as well as the earlier studies to convert national
currency expenditures to a common currency unit. For purposes of productivity
comparisons, some attempt will be made to deal with the production side of the
national accounts as well as the expenditure side, the usual focus of the ICP
and PWT. The analysis component of this project focuses on the price and
quantity structures of countries at different income levels. The structures,
estimated from PWT5 and ICP benchmark data, are examined to see the patterns of
change associated with economic development. In the absence of the basic data
developed by the project, it has been impossible to analyze definitively these
and other critical issues of comparative economic performance.
