Aguilera 9603905 An enzyme which is thought to be involved in the lymphocyte-
specific process of immunoglobulin isotype-class switch recombination has been
identified and partially purified. The enzyme preferentially cleaves tgggg and
tgagc switch repeat motifs commonly found at switch recombination breakpoints.
The enzyme activity has been purified to near homogeneity from nuclear extracts
of murine b lymphocytes and bovine splenocytes. Preliminary biochemical
characterization with the purified enzyme, now called endo-sr, support the
initial assumption that the enzyme is novel. The biochemical characterization
will be continued in the search for data to validate the hypothesis that this
enzyme is a putative switch endonuclease activity. To that end, work will be
initiated to clone the gene based upon the information gained by determining the
peptide composition of the purified enzyme. Further characterization of the
various factors, including the involved enzyme(s), implicated in somatic DNA
rearrangements in lymphocytes should lead to a better understanding of not only
the ig switch recombination process but also the underlying mechanisms of
somatic DNA recombination in mammalian cells.
