An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Gallium Arsenide Advanced
Electronic Devices is being initiated at the University of Texas-Arlington. The
Center's reaearch program for the first year addresses: (1) the modelling of
Gallium Arsenide FETS, (2) MESFET breakdown/power FETS, (3) SAGUFET - self-
aligned gate undercut FET, (4) ohmic contacts, (5) semi-conductor/microstrip
components, (6) YIG/MMIC oscillators, and (7) large-signal gallium arsendide
power MESFET model.
