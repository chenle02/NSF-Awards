This research seeks to develop an instrument to measure the speed of
impulsively generated shear waves in liquids. The proposed device consists of
concentric cylinders with a fluid-filled gap between them. The outer cylinder is
rotated impulsively, and the transit time of the shear wave is detected by
monitoring the motion of the inner cylinder. This instrument should be useful
for probing the molecular structure of liquids. The work proposed here builds on
a previously developed instrument, upgrading that instrument in many ways, such
as improved bearings, etc. Upon completion of instrument development, it will be
tested, as funding permits, on a number of fluids.
