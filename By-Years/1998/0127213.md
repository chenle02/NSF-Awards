The investigators will determine the impact of adverse space weather conditions
on the electricity market. The main effort is to by formulate an econometric
model of electricity supply in which space weather conditions, because they
impact the transmission of electricity, are a variable. The work addresses the
economic consequences of space weather events. While some of the economic
impacts are fabled within the space weather community (e.g. Quebec Hydro in
1989), to date no one has systematically documented and quantified the true
economic costs. The research proposed here will begin to rectify that
shortcoming. The fundamental reason why space weather may adversely impact the
performance of the power grid is because adverse space weather conditions can
interfere with the transmission of electric power. Specifically, the power
transmission grid can act as an "antenna" of sorts, picking up geomagnetically-
induced currents (GIC) at distances of hundreds of kilometers. The GIC are the
result of electric currents high in the atmosphere of Earth (at ionospheric
altitudes), produced by geomagnetic storms and sub-storms as the magnetosphere
interacts with disturbances in the solar wind.
