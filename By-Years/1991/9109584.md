Past research by this investigator established a new method for analyzing
outdoor scenes. Thermal and visual imagery was combined to extract internal
object properties that serve as physically meaningful features for region
labeling. This new research presents an improved formulation of the energy
exchange model used for this purpose. The energy exchange model is formulated as
a linear regression model. Statistically robust techniques will be used to
extract reliable estimates of internal object properties such as thermal
capacitance. These techniques allow reliable estimates in spite of almost 50% of
the data being arbitrarily corrupted due to misregistration of images and
segmentation errors. Statistically robust techniques have been shown to be
beneficial in many important computer vision problems such as pose estimation,
straight-line extraction, computation of image structure, and surface fitting.
The proposed research will explore statistical robust approaches to another
important problem, i.e., sensor fusion. The computational characteristics of the
robust algorithms will be explored for the chosen sensor fusion task. The new
formulation also allows iterative refinement of surface parameters (such as
thermal emissivity) which were assumed known in the previous formulation of the
model. The new approach thus improves the accuracy of the internal property
value estimates and also provides new information regarding surface parameter
values. The method thus provides a greater number of stable features for object
classification.
