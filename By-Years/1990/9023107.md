This project is concerned with the dynamics of random magnetic systems
consisting of two classes: spin-glasses and random-field Ising magnets. These
systems are incompletely understood theoretically and it is hoped the
experiments will shed light on the fundamental physics underlying their
dynamical behavior. The experiments on spin-glasses wil address the relaxation
properties of systems with highly degenerate multiple free energy minima.
Temperature cycling is introduced in a new way so that new insights into the
movement of the system through phase space can be followed. Experiments on
random-field Ising magnets below the transition temperature to experimentally
check the predicted the logarithmic growth in time of domains. These results are
important in understanding the dynamics of these systems.
