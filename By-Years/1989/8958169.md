Based on her outstanding research accomplishments and her devotion to
undergraduate education, Dr. Barbara Beltz of Wellesley College, received the
prestigious Presidential Young Investigator award. With this award, she will
continue her work on the development of neuronal plasticity. Dr. Beltz pioneered
methods in immunocytochemistry, an invaluable neuroanatomical procedure. She has
taught a very popular and first-class course in immunocytochemical methods at
the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, which developed into a book. Dr.
Beltz will use this award to focus on an number of important questions in
developmental neurobiology: the acquisition of transmitter and peptides systems,
plasticity in identifiable neurons, and the emergence of specific motor programs
and behaviors during development. Her emphasis will be to characterize the
anatomy, physiology and development of neurotransmitter and peptide systems of
neurons. These data will add important insights to our understanding of how the
transmitter and peptide choices in developing neural networks are made. Her
research area is of great importance and the studies are likely to reveal
underlying principles of how neurons develop.
