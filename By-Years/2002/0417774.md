This project is an investigation of the dependence of the behavior of the
atmospheric boundary layer on a variety of parameters including surface heat
capacity, Rossby number, long wave radiation and heating rate, as well as the
dependence of the behavior in numerical models on vertical discretization. The
approach used is that of a numerical bifurcation analysis of the one-dimensional
system of partial differential equations that describe the atmospheric boundary
layer and a comparison of the results to integrations of horizontally
homogeneous implementations of MM5 or WRF. The approach to be used will be
similar to that used by one of the investigators to look at the role of
geostrophic wind and roughness length as bifurcation parameters. On the
mathematical side, the project will apply and extend research on the use of sub-
space projection to extend continuation schemes for large systems. Some of the
bifurcation analysis tools developed will be useful in other atmospheric and
oceanic studies. One consequence of this work should be a better understanding
of the nonlinear behavior of the atmospheric boundary layer which can then be
incorprated into numerical weather prediction models to produce more accurate
predictions of surface temperatures, especially at night.
