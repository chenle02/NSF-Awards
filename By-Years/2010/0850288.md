The Alverno College Futures in Mathematics, Science, and Technology project
provides scholarships to thirty students in the college's Biology, Molecular
Biology, Chemistry, Computing and Information Technology, Environmental Science,
or Mathematics majors. The overall goals of this project are (1) to increase the
numbers of students graduating from Alverno College with degrees in STEM-related
majors, and (2) to help them enter the work force or graduate schools in STEM-
related fields. This is accomplished through three efforts:

Assistance to participants, Futures Scholars, through scholarships awarded based
on both talent and financial need;

Support of Futures Scholars in order to improve retention by expanding faculty
involvement in advising, engaging a full array of academic and counseling
support services to help participants succeed, and increasing programs to build
a sense of community among students in STEM related majors; and

Connecting Futures Scholars to STEM professions through internships,
participation in professional conferences in their fields and annual on-campus
conferences, which bring them together with all STEM-related students and with
Alverno College alumnae and others working in STEM-related fields.

As a women's college with a high proportion of minorities (32%), the program
helps add underrepresented persons to STEM-related fields. Eighty percent of
Alverno College students enrolled in STEM related majors receive need-based
financial aid, with an average unmet need of $5,105. The project helps by
providing thirty talented, financially needy STEM-related majors with
scholarships; supporting these students with an array of academic supports
including expanded faculty advising, peer mentors, counseling, instructional
services and career assistance programs; connecting participants with the
profession through internships, workshops and professional conferences related
to their majors. New sustainable initiatives, such as the formation of a
mathematics and science teacher network, and improved career information, will
aid in recruitment to these majors.

To create a diverse cohort of Futures Scholars, approximately ten scholarships
are awarded to current sophomores and juniors and the remaining twenty to new,
incoming students.
