The PIs propose holding a three-day conference on mathematical logic at UCLA
from February 1 to February 3, 2013. The conference will cover mathematical
logic, broadly interpreted, including set theory, model theory, recursion
theory, logic in computer science, and philosophy of mathematics. The conference
will continue a series of biennial logic meetings at UCLA which, starting in the
mid 1970s, has been one of the most important forums for mathematical logic on
the West Coast.

The conference will be a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and
discuss important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on
scientific projects. The conference will be advertised to attract a large
audience. Graduate students and researchers at early career stages, in
particular, will be encouraged to participate. The organizers will ensure that
women and minority mathematicians are made aware of the conference and are
strongly encouraged to participate.
