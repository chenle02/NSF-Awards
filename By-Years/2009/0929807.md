0929807&lt;br/&gt;Feinberg &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Granted funds
will support development of a cryostat capable of full vector magnetic remanence
measurements in magnetic minerals to low temperatures (range 25 to 350 K). The
cryostat design would mate to standard 2-G Enterprises RF and DC SQUID rock
magnetometers. Research application of the developed cryostat is likely to
result in new techniques for determination of phase specific low temperature
magnetic behavior of ferromagnetic minerals in rocks, sediments, meteorites and
synthetic magnetic media, the development of new rock magnetic proxies of past
environmental conditions, and industrial applications may result in the
development of improved magnetic media devices. The proposed cryostat design
involves a collaboration between the University of Minnesota and a U.S.
cryogenic device manufacturer (ColdEdge Technologies). The grant supports two
early career scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
