Collaborative research will be conducted between Andre Wyss (University of
California, Santa Barbara) and Mark Norell (American Museum of Natural History,
NY). Isolated from other continents for nearly all of the Cenozoic, there
developed in South America a highly peculiar and endemic land mammal fauna that
has captured the interest of evolutionary biologists and paleontologists for
more than a century. An extraordinary new fauna from the Andes of central Chile
falls within what previously represented the most poorly known span of the South
American Tertiary record, an approximately 15 million year post-Mustersan
(middle Eocene), pre-Deseadan (?late Oligocene) interval. As this span coincides
with a major faunal transition, it is crucial to the understanding of several
long-standing problems of phylogenetic relationship among the major groups of
indigenous South American fossil mammals. The new fauna thus marks the first
well represented fauna clarifying the Eocene-Oligocene transition from the
continent. In addition to being of major paleobiologic importance, the new fauna
bears significantly on interpretation of the stratigraphy and tectonic history
in a very broad segment of the central Andes. This study has three points of
focus. The first involves a continued vigorous field collection and
reconnaissance program. The second concerns description of this diverse, well
preserved, and highly unexpected fossil assemblage, and placement of its
constituents into a rigorous phylogenetic framework. The third consists of the
discovery's placement into a highly integrated geochronologic context. To that
end, biochronologic, magnetostratigraphic, and radioisotopic methods will be
employed.
