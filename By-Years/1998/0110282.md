SUMMARY: The muscle type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is located in
the vertebrate neuromuscular junction and in the electric organ of some species
of fish. Its function is to promote the depolarization of the endplate. As a
member of the ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) superfamily, its structural and
functional properties are closely related to those of other members of the
family such as the neuronal AChR, the GABAA receptor, the glycine receptor and
others. The experiments in this proposal have been designed to study the very
basics of the receptor-ligand interaction and channel gating, such as which
residues on the receptor interact with which functional groups on the agonist,
and the contributions made by the individual agonist binding sites to channel
gating. The long-term goal of this project is to facilitate the understanding of
the properties of the AChR and LGIC, in general. The proposed experiments will
utilize single-channel patch clamp coupled to the kinetic analysis techniques
which will allow detailed studies of the effects of changes in the structure of
the receptor or the ligand, and to correlate them with changes in the functional
response, i.e. affinity, gating or desensitization, of the receptor. The
analysis of the interactions between the receptor and the ligand will be
examined using thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis. This method is based on the
determination of whether mutations are additive or not, and allows to establish
whether amino acid residues or functional groups interact with each other. The
AChR is used as a biophysical model system as it possesses relatively simple
kinetic properties and a high single-channel conductance (or signal-to-noise
ratio), necessary for studies involving kinetic analysis. The results of these
studies can be applied in studies of other LGIC due to a high degree of homology
between the members of the LGIC superfamily.
