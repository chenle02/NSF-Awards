It is proposed to study the stationary and dynamic properties of far-from-
equilibrium nonlinear stochastic dynamics systems. It is intended to elucidate
the methematical structure of these complex systems while studying specific
physical problems in fluid dynamics, non equilibrium statistical physics and
quantum field theory. Reaction diffusion equations for the kinetic and
stationary states of chemical reactions will be treated microscopically. Finite
dimensional models will be investigated starting from their infinite dimensional
hydrodynamic formulation.
