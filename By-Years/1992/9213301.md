The objective of this proposed study is to develop applicable mathematical
theories for the feedback control of nonlinear distributed systems with free-
boundaries. The main effort is focused on systems describable by coupled Navier-
Stokes and heat equations. This problem is motivated from the development of
precision feedback controls for the crystal growth process to achieve high
quality crystals and high productivity. This problem is of basic importance in
the manufacturing of microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. Computer
simulation studies will be made for determining effectiveness and feasibility of
the proposed feedback controls. The use of neural networks for modelling and
real-time control of the crystal growth process will also be explored by means
of computer simulation using both computer generated and real experimental data.
