9214986 Carpita This award supports Professors Nicholas Carpita and Robert
Dunkle of Purdue University, and students in their research groups, to
collaborate in cellular biology research with Professor Hans Hohl and Dr. Robert
Dudler of the Institute of Plant Biology of the University of Zurich,
Switzerland. They are studying some fundamental microscopic aspects of plant
cell structure that change as the cells respond to unfavorable environmental
stress. The combined talents of the U.S. participants in protein biochemistry
and plant pathology and the German scientists' expertise in cytology and
genetics create an unusually strong team to work on understanding the
intracellular processes in stressed plants. Plant cells have membranes inside
them adjacent but not connected to the cell walls that react to some types of
stress by adhering to the cell walls. These investigators are attempting to
understand the mechanisms for that adhesion by examining the individual protein
constituents of the membrane-wall adhesion complex. By characterizing the
components, they will obtain information necessary for understanding the
adhesion process, and perhaps controlling it in useful ways to improve plants'
reaction to saline stress and pathogen attack. ***
