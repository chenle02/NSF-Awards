9512356 Vitter Duke University proposes the establishment of an ATM-based
network cluster of high-performance 64-bit workstations for supporting
collaborative research and applications. Three fundamental systems performance
concerns are considered for supporting a wide mix of workloads and applications
of these collaborative activities: locality management, resource conflicts, and
resource reduction. Seven specific projects have been identified: (1) toolkits
and interfaces for explicit control of disk resources, (2) parallel file system,
(3) virtual memory support for memory-intensive computations, (4) distributed
shared memory, (5) cluster virtual storage, (6) data compression, and (7)
predication for locality management. The workstation cluster instrumentation is
necessary to perform state-of-the-art experimental research on methods to make
the cluster viable for next-generation collaborative computing. The proposed
cluster testbed is indispensable for conducting the research. The
instrumentation is both the vehicle for and the subject of research. ***
