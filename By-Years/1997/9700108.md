This starter grant award to the University of California at Los Angeles supports
the research of Professor Benjamin J. Schwartz. The theme of the research is
ultrafast studies of condensed phase chemical reactivity. Both experimental and
theoretical studies explore the details of solute-solvent coupling in different
charge-transfer-to-solvent systems, particularly alkali metal anion systems.
Experiments take advantage of the newest generation of solid-state ultrafast
lasers, allowing direct one-photon excitation of the charge-transfer-to-solvent
band in the iodide system, for example. Spectral studies in both the ultraviolet
and infrared wavelength regimes will distinguish between the various physical
pictures proposed for charge-transfer-to solvent. Additional studies varying the
solvent, the ion, and the excitation conditions will provide an essentially
complete understanding of the dynamics important in these reactions. This
research will advance the fundamental understanding of solution phase chemical
reactivity through both experimental and theoretical study of solvation
dynamics.
