Rostislav&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:
Algebraic, Geometric, and Asymptotic Properties of Branch
Groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on properties of branch
groups.&lt;br/&gt;Branch groups are abstract mathematical objects that play an
important &lt;br/&gt;role in solving major problems on the intersection of
different parts of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, such as Algebra, Number Theory,
Analysis, Geometry and &lt;br/&gt;Probability Theory. The proposer will study
these groups and their relation &lt;br/&gt;to a number of important and long-
standing problems in modern mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;such as the Burnside and
Milnor Problems in Group Theory, Atiyah &lt;br/&gt;Conjecture in Topology,
Kadison-Kaplansky Conjecture in Functional Analysis. &lt;br/&gt;The results
obtained in this project have useful applications in Cybernetics &lt;br/&gt;and
Computer Science, as well as Cryptography and Theory of
Algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorial Group Theory is one of
the most rapidly developing parts &lt;br/&gt;of modern mathematics. Starting
with works by Poincare and Klein this &lt;br/&gt;area received contribution from
some of the most prominent &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians of the twentieth century,
such as von Neumann, Milnor and &lt;br/&gt;others. In recent decades
Combinatorial Group Theory became an object of &lt;br/&gt;especially intensive
research due to newly found connections with &lt;br/&gt;Statistical Physics,
Quantum Chaos Theory and Computer Science. New &lt;br/&gt;promising directions
of mathematical research have been developped, one &lt;br/&gt;of them being the
theory of branch groups. This theory has strong &lt;br/&gt;connections to
several mainstream open problems in modern mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;Tremendous
progress acheived in recent years indicates that the &lt;br/&gt;exploration of
these connections leads to most fruitful ideas and results.&lt;br/&gt;
