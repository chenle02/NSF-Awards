9522651 Kitanidis The objective of the proposed research is to quantify the
interaction of heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivity, local dispersion,
and other factors in controlling the temporal behavior of dilution in porous
media. Although the effect of heterogeneity on the spreading of plumes of
dissolved chemicals has been studied extensively, the effect of heterogeneity on
dilution of contaminants remains to be determined, especially at "early" times,
which are relevant in tracer tests and remediation projects. Dilution is
quantified by measures such as the peak concentration and the volume occupied by
solute. Spreading is quantified by the spatial second moment of the
concentration distribution. In assessing environmental impacts of groundwater
contamination, if is important to be able to anticipate peak concentration in
addition to the spatial extent of contamination. In this work, we will conduct
theoretical analysis, detailed numerical experiments, and comparisons with field
data. Contaminant dilution measures will be related to the porous media
constitutive parameters and, primarily, the variability of hydraulic
conductivity. Predictions of dilution will be made via analytical approximations
or "closures" which lead to deterministic equations and through variational
analysis. The performance of the approximations will be numerically assessed and
the results will be evaluated by comparison with results from field experiments.
The contribution of this work will be a better understanding of the time-
evolution of contaminant concentration levels in heterogeneous porous media, and
guidance to the practitioner to assess dilution of contaminants in the
subsurface environment.
