This project involves a five-year multidisciplinary study of the Neogene,
Quaternary and active deformation of the Longmen Shan and Sichuan Basin, located
along the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau. This study, to be conducted
jointly by scientists at MIT and at the Chengdu Institute of Geology and Mineral
Resources in China, will consist of: 1) Field mapping of older structures to
determine the Cenozoic tectonic evolution along the Longmen Shan and adjacent
areas; 2) A neotectonic study of young and active faults in this portion of the
plateau margin; 3) An 11-site GPS network to establish a map of active crustal
strain within the area; and 4) A geological and geophysical (flexural and
gravity) study of the Sichuan basin. The wide variety of techniques with which
the Principal Investigators plan to address this problem will complement and
enhance one another, and thereby provide the most complete picture of regional
deformation possible. The immediate goal of this project is to document the
Cenozoic deformation history of the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau, but
the broadest aim of the project is to develop a better understanding of the
nature of intracontinental deformation in Tibet, China and southeast Asia.
