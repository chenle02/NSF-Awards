The objective of this project is to explore disorder introduced in crystalline
and mesophase states of linear macromolecules and small molecule model compounds
by conformational, large-amplitude motion. Better understanding of this topic
will enable us to better manage such important technological processes as the
improvement of materials performance by annealing, large-scale deformation on
drawing and rolling, and the design of new polymeric materials with specific
properties. The central technique used in this project is the thermal analysis
for evaluation of the degree of disorder (entropy). A special Advanced THermal
Analysis System (ATHAS), developed over the years, permits the establishment of
the thermal properties of fully ordered solids as a vibration-only reference
state, as well as fully disordered solid (glassy) and liquid reference states.
The deviations from these references states are interpreted in terms of mobile
disorder (mesophases) or rigid disorder (mesophase glasses or rigid amorphous
fraction). On a microscopic level the disorder and motion are then analyzed in
detail by solid state NMR, X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, optical and
atomic force microscopy. The experimental results are compared to molecular
dynamics simulations carried out on supercomputers. Typical materials to be
analyzed are: nylons and proteins, stiff-chain polymers, partially and fully
fluorinated short-chain and long-chain molecules, tetraalkylammonium salts, and
mesophase polymers.
