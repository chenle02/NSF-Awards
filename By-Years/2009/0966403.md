The intellectual merit of this project rests in the documentation of Mandan,
which represents a separate branch of the Siouan language family and which, to
date, has received little careful analysis. The researchers will work with the
last fluent speaker of Mandan. This project, submitted by the Fort Berthold
Community College, a tribal college of the Three Affiliated Tribes, will provide
linguistic training to tribal members in technologically advanced methods of
linguistic data collection and analysis aimed at preventing the loss of the
highly endangered Mandan language. It will allow the Mandan Language Project to
continue documenting conversational Mandan, and to produce a Mandan Dictionary.
Data collected through the project will be used to construct a web-based Mandan
Language database, which can be used for language acquisition by members of the
Three Affiliated Tribes and other interested individuals. All data will be
archived via the Fort Berthold Community College website.

This project will contribute to the Mandan language's continuation as a
historically significant spoken language. The Mandan Indians, communicating in
their language, represented one of the most important merchant tribes of the
plains and contributed greatly to the success of Lewis and Clark's Corps of
Discovery by providing them with foodstuff and vital information during the
winter of 1804. Additionally, of critical importance is the project creation of
the web database, which will be accessible to all tribal entities, including the
schools for instructional purposes, and to the linguistic community in general.
This project's educational benefits to tribal members in linguistic fieldwork
and language analysis are far-reaching in terms of their being able to share
their acquired expertise with the community at-large. Finally, the project will
provide a model for other tribal colleges in developing their language programs.
