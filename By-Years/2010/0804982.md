Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This project will demonstrate a performance
annotations approach to tune a production simulation code for use with computers
containing more than O(1000) multicore processors. The code to be optimized is
FLASH, a publicly available astrophysical simulation code. The work will focus
on three code units of broad interest to the astrophysical simulation
community:&lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamics (Euler equations), particle transport, and
gravitation (Poisson?s equation). PI will focus on two machines, the TACC Ranger
machine and the Argonne BlueGene/P, both of which are new and relatively
untested architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The
annotation based approach to tunig codes for petascale can have tremendous
impact on a number of other "legacy codes" if successful&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
