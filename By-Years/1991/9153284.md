Efforts are under way to collect and broadly disseminate gems of exposition in
elementary linear algebra. These include especially insightful proofs, short and
open-ended problems, longer expositional items, and machine-oriented,
computational exercises, all of which are designed to communicate fundamental
liner algebra ideas to beginning students. Items are being solicited from a wide
range of individuals worldwide and are being published in a volume designed to
be available at low cost.
