This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Old Dominion
University provides opportunities to eight undergraduate students each summer
for ten weeks of research with continued opportunities for two students during
the academic year on topics in accelerator and nuclear physics. The REU students
will conduct the research at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.
In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the
students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research
stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly
experience. By the end of the program, every student will have written a
research report and presented the results of their work in a talk, as well as
prepared a poster. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of
broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to
undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics careers. Additionally, the site focuses on providing research
opportunities to students from institutions with small or no research programs
in physics. The site has a strong plan to recruit students from groups
underrepresented in physics.
