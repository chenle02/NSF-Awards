Research will exploit repeated measurement techniques which were developed both
as preparation tools for unusual quantum systems and to monitor the dynamics of
quantum systems. Considering instabilities and chaos, it will be determined
whether a class of quantum measurements exists that leads to classical-type
behavior. It is conjectured that quantum nondemolition measurements may play
such a privileged role. Work will concentrate primarily on micromaser-type
situations, where repeated measurements are handled simply, but also on other
examples such as ion traps.
