Some information retrieval (IR) queries can be best answered with a web page,
others can be answered with a single fact or named entity. Many other queries
could best be answered with a text passage and we propose to develop new
techniques for this task that will be a significant improvement on the current
state-of-the-art. Developing effective passage retrieval would have a major
effect on search tools by greatly extending the range of queries that could be
answered directly using text passages retrieved from the web. This is
particularly important for mobile search applications with limited output
bandwidth based on using either a small screen or speech output. In this case,
the ability to use passages to reduce the amount of output while maintaining
high relevance will be critical.

We will study research issues that have either been ignored, or only partially
addressed, in prior research, such as showing whether passages be better answers
than documents for some queries, predicting which queries have good answers at
the passage level, ranking passages to retrieve the best answers, and evaluating
the effectiveness of passages as answers. To address these issues, we will
develop new retrieval models that can define and rank "answers" for different
text granularities such as sentences and passages, models of query properties
that are associated with good passage-level answers, and models that
differentiate between topicality and information content. Understanding the
relevance of text passages will also involve obtaining new types of relevance
assessments at passage granularity, and developing new evaluation metrics that
combine relevance with the size of the result output. For further information
