Residue currents are multivariate generalizations of one complex variable
residues, which have found many applications in algebra and analysis, including
effective versions of Hilbert?s Nullstellensatz, Brian√ßon-Skoda type theorems,
and explicit versions of the Ehrenpreis-Palamodov Fundamental Principle for
solutions of systems of PDE?s. These applications all rely on the central idea
that ideals of holomorphic functions can be represented as annihilator ideals of
residue currents. The classical multi-dimensional residue theory concerns
complete intersection ideals. The PI recently constructed residue currents
representing general ideals; these currents were used to extend several results,
previously known for complete intersections. The list of proposed projects using
the residue currents developed by the PI includes: constructing integral
formulas on manifolds, characterizing multiplier ideals in terms of residues,
and recovering intersection cycles as products of residue currents.



Residue calculus is a classical complex analytic tool for computing integrals
and series, with applications in mathematics as well as in science and
engineering. The PI?s work has been in the borderland between analysis, algebra,
andcombinatoricsandshewillcontinueworkingonproblems of both analytic and
algebraic nature.
