It is proposed to write a history of "Fracture Mechanics", one of the
breakthrough achievements of mechanics research in past half century. The
history will be divided into three periods. The first period will cover
developments from Leonardo da Vinci (1452- -1519) up to the conclusion of World
War II. The second period will deal with the emergence and acceptance of
fracture mechanics - -- 1947 through 1965. The third and final period will deal
with modern developments from the mid sixties to the present time.
