Many chemicals released into the environment disrupt the function of endogenous
hormones by acting at their receptors and/or by influencing hormone production
by interfering with synthesizing enzymes. These endocrine disrupting chemicals
(EDCs), which have been found to have effects in several taxa during development
and in adulthood, exert their greatest effects in tissues that are responsive to
endogenous steroid hormones. These responsive tissues (e.g., reproductive tract,
brain) often differ by gender (i.e., are sexually dimorphic) and are involved in
display of gender-specific behavior (e.g., reproductive or courtship behavior).
The overall objective of the research plan is to determine whether exposure of
songbirds to environmental endocrine disruptors affects the normal function of
sexually dimorphic (and hormone-sensitive) structures. In particular, effects on
the brain regions that control singing (song control system), the song behavior
itself, and female responses to song will be assessed after non-stressful
exposure to EDCs.

Abnormal function of the song control system could have implications for the
ability of males to attract mates and of females to choose them, which
ultimately could affect songbird populations. Songbirds have long been effective
models for investigating hormonal effects on brain and behavior; as such, they
also could serve as powerful models for investigating EDC effects on brain and
behavior.
