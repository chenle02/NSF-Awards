Under their previous grant, the PIs have shown that diabatic heat anomalies at
the surface due to snow have large and extensive impacts on atmospheric
dynamics, especially in mid- to high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (NH).
Work under this award will examine the role of snow cover in forcing or
triggering the dominant mode of variability of NH winter climate. Two parallel
paths of research will be followed: (i) to focus on the relationship between
Eurasian snow cover and winter climate through observational analysis; and (ii)
to study cause and effect mechanisms using general circulation modeling. The
work is important because it will enhance understanding of NH winter climate
variability, and consequently, the potential of improved seasonal forecasting.
This has great societal benefits.
