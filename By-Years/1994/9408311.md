9408311 Peccei Support is requested from the National Science Foundation to
partially cover the costs of holding a two-week Summer Study in Snowmass,
Colorado on future directions in Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics and
Cosmology. The Summer Study is jointly sponsored by the Division of
Astrophysics, the Division of Nuclear Physics and the Division of Particles and
Fields of the American Physical Society. The principal goal of this meeting is
to allow members of the disparate high energy and nuclear physics communities
and of the community of astrophysicists and astronomers to examine jointly the
opportunities that are opening up in this cross disciplinary field and to
provide a critical evaluation of the future course of this emerging discipline.
