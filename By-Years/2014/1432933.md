An advanced meteor radar, the Drake Antarctic Agile Meteor Radar (DrAAMeR), was
installed by our team at the Brazilian Antarctic Base Cmd. Ferraz at 62.1oS on
King George Island in March 2010 under NSF Grant OPP-0839084. Initial
measurements contributed to several multi-radar studies addressing large-scale
and small-scale dynamics, and several other papers partially prepared under
previous NSF funding. Unfortunately, these measurements were terminated in late
January 2012 when a fire destroyed Ferraz Base. However, our Brazilian
colleagues at INPE have now rebuilt Ferraz, and power was restored in January
2014. Given the success of the Ferraz repairs, our Brazilian colleagues are now
eager to also restore the various measurements in the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere (MLT) that were previously being made at Ferraz,including those
with DrAAMeR.
