In walking and running, the arms and legs move like pendulums and produce
regular, repeatable intervals, like clocks do. They also move at the same
frequency. This research aims to further the understanding of the general
principles behind this absolute coordination of pendular, clocking movements.
Experiments in which people will swing hand-held pendulums of variable mass and
length at their wrists will be concerned with the following kinds of issues: How
is energy gained and lost by a movement cycle? How do these gains and losses
relate across limbs? How does the amplitude of a movement cycle relate to its
duration? How does preferred amplitude change with changes in mass and length?
How many between-limb phase relations are possible, and how stable are they? How
is absolute coordination to be defined in physical terms? The data will be
analyzed through various formal methods of nonlinear dynamics. These results
should facilitate the formal modeling of rhythmic activity. They should
ultimately be useful in teaching various types of rhythmic physical activity and
also in extending the basis for understanding the causes of rhythmic movement
disorders.
