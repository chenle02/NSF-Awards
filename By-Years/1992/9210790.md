In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project, funded by the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Cynthia Jameson will use xenon NMR and molecular dynamic
simulations to determine the nature of elementary processes in microporous
zeolites. By monitoring how xenon is partitioned between cages of different size
in the zeolite, long standing questions regarding the diffusivity of adsorbates
and the potential role of intercage transfer in catalysis will be answered. %%%
Zeolites, microporous solids which have enormous utility as catalysts, are among
the most significant commercially available classes of materials. Prof. Cynthia
Jameson (Univ. of Illinois, Chicago Circle) will adsorb xenon gas into these
materials, and use a battery of modern spectroscopic and computational
techniques to determine how the xenon atoms are distributed among the pores, how
they move from place to place, and how long they stay there. The result will be
an improved understanding of dynamic events related to catalytic activity of the
micropores.
