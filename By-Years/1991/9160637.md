This is a SBIR Phase I project. Recently, a method was introduced in which on
the order of 100 to 1,000 different peptides could be synthesized on a solid
support. The development of a significant improvement to this technique is
proposed. The object of this research is to demonstrate the potential of the
improved system to synthesize megapeptide arrays (1 - 10 M different peptides).
Successful completion of this research will result in determination of the
critical parameters required for the synthesis of megapeptide arrays.
