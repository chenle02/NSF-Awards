With support from the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Massimo Bertino from Virginia Commonwealth University and
colleagues Dexian Ye, Joseph Reiner, Everett Carpenter and Collen Taylor (the
latter from Virginia State University) will acquire a scanning confocal Raman
microscope. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all
levels, especially in areas such as (a) surface-enhanced Raman scattering on
noble metal coated metal nanotips; (b) detection of NO in blood and tissue; (c)
nanopore-facilitated loading of nanosharps; (d) functionally-graded silica films
and their characterization on multiple length scales; and (e) aerogel cross-
linking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raman spectroscopy measures the vibrational
frequencies of molecules in a sample which are characteristic of the chemical
content, composition and structure of the material. A Raman microscope scans
across a sample to provide a spatial image of the chemical composition in
response to the laser probe. This widely used technique, employing lasers to
probe the material, is non-destructive. This instrument will strengthen graduate
and undergraduate education as students use this instrument in their research
projects and in laboratory courses.
