This research program considers a series of mathematical problems connected
with singular bifurcation equations, limit point instabilities and free boundary
problems. They include effects of time- dependent parameters, steady bifurcation
and Hopf bifurcation with a slowly varying control, slow passage through a
critical point, transition to periodic solutions from a homoclinic orbit, etc.
The research results will have direct applications to laser problems and polymer
devices, especially in the rate of drug release from capsules.
