9311409 Leith We propose several methods for imaging through highly scattering
material, all based on the use of light that is either spatially or temporally
incoherent, or both. We propose using for this undertaking a sophisticated
imaging system, comprising a cooled CCD camera, a computer, and extensive
software we develped. In addition, the equipment and the proposed techniques are
to be developed for a range of other imaging areas, including optical
sectioning, phase contrast imaging, and a multiple-wavelenght depth contrast
imaging, and a multiple-wavelength depth contouring. ***
