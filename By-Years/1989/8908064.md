The principal investigator will study the global differential geometry of
surfaces in three dimensional manifolds. The research focuses on surfaces which
are extrema for natural symmetric variational problems arising in mathematics
and physics. Computable geometric moduli for extremal surfaces will be
developed. The robustness of this theory will be investigated by relaxing some
symmetry assumptions on the ambient space. And these methods will be extended to
other geometric variational problems with symmetry or approximate symmetry.
Three-dimensional space is an example of a three-manifold. If infinity is
collapsed to one point, this space becomes the three-dimensional sphere. This
sphere has constant sectional curvature because relative to every plane at every
point, the sphere bends the same. The principal investigator will study deep
problems concerning the minimality of surfaces which lie in such three-
manifolds. Soap films are familiar examples of such minimal surfaces.
