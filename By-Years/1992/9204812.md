This award will support the research of two individuals in the area of
statistical sciences. Dr. Nandram will develop bayesian methods for the analysis
of categorical data from similar sources. Dr. Guo will work on three different
problems in the analysis of non-linear time series. Together, these two projects
represent interesting problems in modern statistics. This award will support the
research of two individuals in the area of statistical sciences. Dr. Nandram
will develop bayesian methods for the analysis of categorical data from similar
sources. One example of categorical data would be "yes" or "no" responses in
questionnaires. Dr. Guo will work on three different problems in the analysis of
non-linear time series. Together, these two projects represent interesting
problems in modern statistics.
