EEC-9527377 Thompson This award provides funds for the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State
University to continue research in the area of nondestructive evaluation. The
research emphasizes advanced ultrasonic techniques, eddy current, thermal, and
optical techniques, radiographic techniques, signal processing, pattern
recognition, and nondestructive evaluation of composite materials. The research
includes development of novel techniques, computer-based modeling, analysis of
states of stress, advanced signal processing, and investigation of the structure
and properties of materials.
