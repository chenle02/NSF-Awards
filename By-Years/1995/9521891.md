The NBER/Yale Center for Global Change is designed to further the study of
problems of the environment with particular attention to the international
dimension, to linking economics and other social sciences, and to bringing
together American and foreign researchers in the social sciences working on
human dimensions of global change. The project will encourage the creation of an
`invisible college` which encompasses two major elements: (1) it will bring
together active researchers from U.S. research organizations under the umbrella
of a National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) project; and (2) it will
generate substantial domestic and international cooperative research through
conferences and workshops. These meetings will bring together U.S. and foreign
researchers under the auspices of Yale University, the NBER, and the
International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria. The NBER
has long served the role of encouraging collaborative research among different
institutions. This function is particularly important for research in the human
dimensions of global change because of its broad scale, international scope, and
interdisciplinary nature.
