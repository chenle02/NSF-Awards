Mutual learning can happen between two humans, a human and machine, or between
two machines. The first class is of interest to researchers in the field of
social psychology. The importance of human machine interactions is being felt in
many situations and most recently in the interaction between the human driven
and completely autonomous vehicles. The proposed research deals with machine-
machine learning to investigate efficient cooperation between machines, but also
reveal the limitations of this cooperation. In particular, the research will
attempt to answer questions such as whether two agents, although individually
using schemes that will result in the desired behavior, may arrive at wrong
conclusion using mutual learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the term mutual
learning has been used by other investigators in the past, our objective is to
investigate it in a quantitative sense within the framework of mathematical
systems theory. The problems proposed for investigation include deterministic
optimization in high dimensional spaces, stochastic reinforcement learning in
static/stationary environments (learning automata) using both deterministic and
stochastic schemes, learning in dynamic environments such as the ones described
by Markov Decision Processes, and learning/adaptation by multiple agents in
dynamic environments described by deterministic or stochastic difference and
differential equations. The results on mutual learning obtained during the
proposed project will be widely disseminated at national and international
conferences as well as the bi-annual Yale Workshops on Adaptive and Learning
Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
