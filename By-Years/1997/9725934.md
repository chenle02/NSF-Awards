9725934 Low, Philip S. The oxidative burst constitutes an important early
defense mechanism linked to disease resistance in plants. The burst response is
characterized by the rapid synthesis of highly reactive oxygen compounds
(superoxide or hydrogen peroxide) within minutes after stimulation of the plant
cell by pathogens or pathogen-generated elicitor molecules. Because this oxygen
burst is found throughout the plant kingdom, and since it may be a critical
component of several plant defense mechanisms, its detailed characterization is
of considerable importance and interest. The overall goal of this project is to
elucidate the signal transduction pathway that is activated when an elicitor
binds to a cell surface or cytoplasmic receptor and which culminates when the
oxidase enzyme complex is assembled and activated to produce the burst of
reactive oxygen. The specific aims are (a) to characterize a specific elicitor-
activated protein kinase that initiates the response to oligogalacturonic acid,
(b) to determine the timing of activation of possible intermediate components
(G-proteins, Ca++, phospholipase C, other protein kinases) that relay the
resulting signal to the oxidase to activate it, and (c) to clone the genes for
both the kinase and several of the oxidase subunits. Completion of these
objectives will greatly enhance our understanding of the specific signal
transduction processes that lead to the oxidative burst and will provide
insights into general principles of signal transduction strategies in plant
cells. One practical extension of this work is that if the oxidative burst can
be engineered to respond more rapidly or to a wider range of pathogens, reliance
on toxic pesticides in agriculture could be reduced.
