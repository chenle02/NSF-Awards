Mid to deep levels of continental crust are exposed in the collisional orogen
of the Coast Crystalline Complex of South- eastern Alaska and adjacent British
Columbia. Crustal thicken- ing and metamorphisms as well as later uplift were
accomplished by movement of crustal blocks along regional shear zones and
accompanied by emplacement of tabular bodies of intrusive igneous rocks. This
project aims to determine the timing of shear zone formation relative to
metamorphism and igneous intrusion. The deformation mechanisms, amount of shear
strain, sense of displacement and the P and T of the deformation will be
obtained by a combination of detailed field and microstructural studies, fluid
inclusion and isotopic studies. Results will evaluate the role of fluids, magma
and hydrothermal, in shear zone initiation, movement and closure and will be of
considerable utility in understanding crustal evolution in orogenic zones
generally.
