This energy dispersive x-ray analyzer will convert the current electron
microscope at Marquette University into an analytical microscope capable of
chemical analysis of elements with atomic numbers greater or equal to 4, and
capable of analyzing areas as small as 20 nm in diameter. The analyzer will be
used in studies of diffusion induced grain boundary migration, liquid film
migration in binary alloy systems to determine the alloy element concentration
profiles behind boundaries and liquid films which have migrated;
characterization studies of metal-oxide varistorboundary regions and phases; and
characterization of microsegregation of metallic elements in rapidly solidified
superconductors. In addition, students will be trained on this instrument. The
analyzer will be shared by three groups, and made available to other users in
engineering, physics, and chemistry on the campus, as well as interested local
industrial groups.
