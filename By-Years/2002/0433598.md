The multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center, Connection
One, will be a joint effort between Arizona State University, the North Carolina
A&amp;T State University, and perhaps additional institutions in the future. The
center will support a wide array of research activities related to circuits and

has a potential to have a significant impact on the broader telecommunications
industry. This industry has become an essential element of national economy.
