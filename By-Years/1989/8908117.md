The chemosensory functions of taste and smell are particularly important for
many insects to use for finding appropriate food, mates, or sites for egg
deposition. Insects provide relatively simple systems for examining the
molecular basis for stimulant binding to receptors, and how nerve cells code
information for the brain to control behavioral responses. This workshop will
exchange information and techniques for addressing insect chemosensory
mechanisms. The emphasis is on discussion of ideas and experimental analysis of
chemoreceptor biochemistry, physiology, and coding; and of new techniques,
including computer processing of data as well as some standardization to allow
easy communication of information among investigators who are widely distributed
around the world. This conference is unique, the first international workshop
specifically addressed to chemosensory function in insects. Because of their
relation to plants, insects are very important to world ecology and world
agriculture. The increased understanding from this workshop, of why insects eat
or lay eggs on some plants but not others, will have substantial impact on
ecology and insect biology, as well as on chemosensory science.
