The international conference on the Progress on Difference Equations (PODE) 2012
will be held May 13-18 in Richmond, Virginia on the campus of Virginia
Commonwealth University. Web site: http://www.math.vcu.edu/PODE2012index.html.
The PODE 2012 conference is the latest in a series of PODE conferences that have
focused on the study of difference equations. Traditionally, these conferences
have been held in Europe. This will be the first of these conferences to be held
in the United States. The goal of the conference is to exchange significant
ideas and results in the field of difference equations, as well as to establish
research contacts across borders, not only between countries, but also between
different ethnic and cultural groups and between novice and seasoned
mathematicians. Varied and novel ideas are shared both formally with talks and
informally in casual settings. Dissemination of information throughout the
mathematics community at large is to be facilitated by the posting of the slides
of talks on the conference web site and by the publication of the proceedings of
the conference.

The field of difference equations, once primarily ancillary to differential
equations, has within the past two decades evolved into an autonomous branch of
mathematics, with applications to areas such as engineering, biology, medicine,
physics, economics, and the social sciences. During this time it has attracted
mathematicians from other areas, who have brought to difference equations their
diverse set of tools. The PODE conferences are a significant means of fostering
fresh ideas, enthusiasm, and collaboration to the expanding the field of
difference equations both in breadth and in depth.
