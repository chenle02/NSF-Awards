The objective of this project is to provide new insight into biological
elasticity and other properties of proteins that are tied to hydrophobicity. The
uniquely resilient and elastic properties of skin and blood vessels have been
traced to elastin, the principal protein component of the fibers that comprise a
large portion of these tissues. Elastin is comprised primarily of long
hydrophobic chains interspersed with alanine-rich crosslinking regions. The very
nature of this protein precludes the use of classic high-resolution structural
tools, such as crystallography and solution NMR spectroscopy. With the prior
support from the NSF's CAREER program, the PI used solid-state NMR in
conjunction with a novel approach in isotopic labeling to elucidate new
structural information on this complex biopolymer. In this project, the
structural and dynamic characterization of elastin and elastin peptides will be
expanded. The major focus is the structural characterization of isotopically-
enriched insoluble elastin from cell culture using solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
These studies will be complemented by analogous work on elastin peptides from
synthesis and bacterial expression. Finally, investigations of the dynamics in
these systems will be pursued. All results will be integrated to provide a
comprehensive picture for biological elasticity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research will involve students at all levels - undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral. The research training experience provided herein is cross-
disciplinary, exposing students to a range of techniques and expertise,
particularly as the project involves several collaborators in elastin
biochemistry and matrix biology.&lt;br/&gt;
