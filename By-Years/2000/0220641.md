This project outlines a solution to a two-fold problem in Texas. The two-fold
pieces of this problem are: 1) the productivity of the flourishing high
technology economy in the state of Texas is being negatively impacted by the
severe lack of well-educated engineering professionals; and, 2) a significantly
large human resources, particularly minorities living in the state, do not
participate in the development of the high technology industry. Consequently,
economic prosperity bypasses this group. Therefore, what is needed is some
economically feasible funding source that allows all Texas state residents to
gain employment in the high technology industry. Hence, the scholarships
afforded through this grant are assisting in alleviating this dual dilemma. The
MEET-SWT project management plan is providing a system of prudent strategies for
recruiting, retaining and ultimately graduating traditionally underrepresented
individuals. These graduates enter into and to become productive members of the
Texas high technology workforce. The Department of Technology at SWT is
optimistic about the opportunity that this scholarship program is having in
promoting education and career opportunities in engineering and engineering
technology for all Texas state residents.
