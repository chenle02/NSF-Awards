The PI proposes to study mixing properties of Markov chains used as a backbone
of Monte Carlo algorithms and in industrial tasks such as mixing of liquids. A
key innovation is studying continuous problems, which normally use the
difficult-to-work-with equations of fluid mechanics, by discrete approximations
which allow tools from combinatorics, group theory, and topology to be used. An
exciting new tool, the use of Hopf algebras, is proposed to unify the discrete
methods. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are a basic tool of scientific
computing used in physics, chemistry, statistics, and many industrial
applications. The basic running time questions - How long should an algorithm be
run to do its job? are largely open research problems. The PI proposes attacks
on two fronts. The first is spatial mixing of tracer particles in a two-
dimensional grid under various stirring protocols: Baker's transformations,
twist maps, and periodic figure eight stirring. Using tools from topology to
bound stretching of line segments and tools from ergodic theory and probability
to bound the behavior of measures after stretching gives a program for analysis.
The second front uses new tools from algebraic combinatorics - combinatorial
Hopf algebras to give explicit diagonalization of a host of non-reversible
Markov chains. These include fragmentation processes studied by Kolmogorov, the
riffle shuffling process, and many others. The first front is heavy on analysis,
the second on algebra, but both fronts use analysis and
algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed builds bridges between different
areas of mathematics and applications. The use of probabilistic analysis in
fluid mixing and the new discrete methods introduced to study continuous
problems should contribute to both probability and the kinematic study of
practical mixing. The Hopf algebra front similarly interfaces probability and
combinatorics in new ways. The PI is an internationally visible expert who will
continue to give talks to both experts, outside scientists, and lay audiences
about these exciting new developments. He currently gives about 50 outside talks
per year. The PI currently has eight graduate students working in these areas,
as well as a comparable number of undergraduates doing senior theses. He has
reached out to a much broader audience: the book Magical Mathematics: The
Mathematical Ideas That Animate Great Magic Tricks (with Ron Graham, Princeton
University Press) has just appeared.
