9308980 Segnan This one-year award supports U.S.-Italy cooperation between Romeo
Segnan, American University, and Drs. Gianfranco Albanese and Cesare Bucci,
University of Parma, Italy. They will perform detailed Mossbauer Effect (ME)
measurements in rare-earth-iron compounds that exhibit huge magnetoelastic
interactions. Magnetostriction processes cannot be explained easily by currently
available models and theories. It is possible that the proposed Mossbauer Effect
studies will provide the data and the information that will elucidate this
problem. There may be technological benefits as well in fields such as active
vibration control and precision machining, where large forces and small
displacements are required. The Mossbauer measurements will be performed at the
University of Parma and will complement the magnetization and magnetostriction
measurements carried out in the U.S. at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC).
This laboratory will provide samples of the desired composition for the
collaboration. Dr. Segnan, who has worked extensively in Mossbauer spectroscopy,
has collaborated at NSWC in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostriction
measurements. The Parma group is known for its research in Mossbauer
spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and hyperfine interactions. * * *
