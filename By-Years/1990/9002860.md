This grant provides partial support for the collaboration of Prof. Sally F.
Hicks, University of Dallas, Prof. Jeffrey R. Vanhoy, U. S. Naval Academy, and
the University of Kentucky to study the collectively excited structure of 140Ce.
Inelastic neutron scattering will be used to bombard isotopically enriched Ce
targets for this work. The quadrupole and octopole excitations can be understood
from measurements of elastic and inelastic differential neutron cross sections.
Additionally, the states of 127Xe will be studied by means of the 127I(p,n)
reaction because of the importance of 127Xe as a neutrino detector. Completion
of some work involving a systematic study of nuclei in the Pb region is also
planned as part of this grant.
