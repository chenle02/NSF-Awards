ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0217902&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve estuarine
biogeochemists will be selected from the U.S. scientific community to
participate in the 7th International Estuarine Biogeochemistry Symposium to be
held in Grimstad, Norway in May, 2002. During this meeting, special emphasis
will be placed on discussions regarding new results on the biogeochemistry of
high and low latitude fjords. In addition, the biogeochemistry of arctic,
tropical, sub-tropical and temperate estuaries also will be addressed.
Thematically, the symposium will discuss issues such as interactions between
organic matter and trace metals, redox boundaries, nutrient control on
productivity, climate change effects, experimental design of mesocosms, modeling
of sediment-water exchange and new sampling techniques. Results from the
symposium will be published most likely in a special edition of the journal
Marine Chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
