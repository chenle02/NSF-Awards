9971657 Forman Robin Forman is continuing his work on the global geometry and
topology of combinatorial spaces. The emphasis is on adapting techniques from
the study of smooth manifolds. In particular, he has developed combinatorial
versions of Morse theory and Bochner's method, two classical techniques from
differential topology and differential geometry, respectively. Many others have
approached the study of combinatorial spaces from this point of view, but it
seems that Forman's approach is simpler than that which has come before, and
also retains more of the flavor of the motivating subjects of differential
topology and geometry. Applications have been found to the study of smooth
spaces, combinatorial spaces, and complexity theory. The ultimate goal is a
unification of the study of smooth and combinatorial spaces. Compact
combinatorial spaces can be described, in a very convenient way, with a finite
amount of data describing the local structure near each point. There has been a
resurgence of interest in such spaces because they are well suited for computer
experimentations and calculations. It is not always clear how to go about
determining the global properties of such a space from the local data with which
it is encoded. On the other hand, the subjects of differential topology and
differential geometry are largely devoted to this problem, except that the
spaces under investigation are not combinatorial, but rather smooth (and cannot
be described with a finite amount of data). Some very general techniques have
been developed over recent decades for the study of smooth spaces. Forman's work
is devoted to showing that many of these ideas can be adapted to apply to
combinatorial spaces. This had already led to new techniques for the study of
combinatorial spaces (which have been applied to find the global topology of
same very complicated combinatorial spaces), as well as new insights into the
structure of smooth spaces. ***
