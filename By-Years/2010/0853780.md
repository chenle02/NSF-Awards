This research effort focuses on the development of a closed loop sense-and-
respond biotherapeutic sensor for thyroid hormone control. With an objective
towards biological engineering of "humanized" lux-based bioluminescent
bioreporters for autonomous sensing of hyper and hypothyroid states, it is
hypothesized that new biophotonic silicon platforms can be fabricated to
intelligently diagnosis and respond to health related insults. The intellectual
merit of this research advances our understanding of coordinate multi-gene
expression in mammalian cell lines and promotes novel strategies for controlling
gene expression in mammalian cells using electrical induction. The research has
broader impacts and benefits society because it structures a new foundation for
future lab-on-chip array sensors for metabolic monitoring in blood, breath,
saliva, urine, and perspiration and for applications in in vivo whole-body
imaging. The multidisciplinary nature of the research additionally promotes
teaching, training, and learning at a level where the boundaries of biology and
engineering merge, thus creating a cross-training regimen critical to advancing
the biotechnological knowledge of participating graduate and undergraduate
students.
