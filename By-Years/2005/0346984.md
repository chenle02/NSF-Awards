Songbirds possess a talent rare among non-human animals: the ability to learn
complex vocalizations. The system of brain regions that controls the learning
and production of song has become perhaps the most popular model for studying
the neural basis of a complex learned behavior. Despite this popularity, few
researchers have investigated how the song system is connected to and affected
by brain regions outside it. Song is produced only in specific social contexts,
and is undoubtedly controlled in part by a distinct network of brain regions
involved in the regulation of social behavior in general. Here, the PI proposes
to map this "social behavior network" in songbirds and explore how it affects
song and its perception. Neuroanatomical methods will be used to identify
connections among these regions, and to determine which brain cells and proteins
in the network participate in song and other social behaviors. By connecting
brain areas that mediate social behavior with those processing social
information, the project effectively merges cognitive and affective
neuroscience. The results will help us understand how the brain perceives social
cues as well as how it organizes and implements an appropriate social response.
The PI's multi-disciplinary approach offers exciting pedagogical opportunities
to train new scientists in a variety of laboratory and field techniques, and
challenges students to ask questions on many levels, from molecular to
evolutionary. The teaching plan emphasizes writing skills, and includes
development of new writing-intensive courses in the sciences. The PI hopes to
help train future scientists to communicate effectively, not only with each
other, but also with the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
