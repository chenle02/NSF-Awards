This study aims to observe and analyze the car-following behavior of subjects
who do not know they are part of an experiment, and to develop a model that can
explain the stochastic effects in car-following behavior across and within
drivers, as well as those caused by variability of critical factors such as
human characteristics, traffic and road characteristics, and environmental
characteristics. This is a significant improvement over previous empirical
studies, conducted sparingly by pairs of trained professional traffic engineers
on closed test tracks. The results of this project should contribute
significantly to the development of more realistic microscopic car-following
laws that incorporate variation across and within individual drivers. A
combination of inertial, GPS, infrared sensing, and video equipment will be used
to collect the data. The lead (control) vehicle will be driven by an
experimenter, but it is the behavior of the follower (random members of the
driving population) that will be observed. Video will be used for manual
confirmation of recorded events, as well as to record certain characteristics
that might play a statistically relevant role, including human, traffic and
road, and environmental parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
