This project in precision measurements focuses on the completion of a test of
CPT (Charge-Parity-Time) and Lorentz invariance using a dual magnetometer. This
experiment could reveal the sign of quantum gravity effects, such as anisotropy
or non-commutativity of space-time. In addition, an experiment searching for a
permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) using liquid Xe-129 will be continued. A
finite EDM would be a signature of CP (Charge-Parity) violation beyond the
Standard Model. The broader impact involves education at all levels from K-12 to
post-doctoral as well as applications to medical imaging.
