This award provides travel support for students to participate in the 2019
Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Atomic Physics to be held June 9 - June 14,
2019 at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island, and the Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS), "Cold Controlled Atoms and Molecules, Ultrafast
Spectroscopy and Precision Measurements," to be held at the same location on
June 8 - June 9, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference program includes many
emerging research topics that are important for atomic, molecular, and optical
physics, as well as several recent advances in this field. The meeting offers an
opportunity for students to study new applications of atomic, molecular, and
optical science, and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the
United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided
only for students enrolled at U.S. institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
