Dr. Arthur G. Humes of Boston University proposes continuation of his study of
the taxonomy and distribution of copepods (a common representative of the
Crustacea) found in deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems in several oceans. Dr.
Humes has been actively describing representatives of these unusual ecosystems
since their discovery through the use of submersibles ten years ago, and he has
discovered dozens of new species under the auspices of an earlier award. The
existence of heretofore unknown species on these isolated patches of biological
richness in the deep sea raises important questions about evolution and
biogeography. Are they the survivors of previously widespread species that
dwindled and became isolated, or are they specialized and long-lived inhabitants
that diverged long ago, or are they recently evolved and short-lived residents
on these ephemeral food-sources? Can they disperse among the distant vents, or
do they arrive there infrequently and accidentally? The proposed taxonomic work
will form the foundation for future research projects that explore these
controversial subjects, and will have impact on a wide audience of biologists.
