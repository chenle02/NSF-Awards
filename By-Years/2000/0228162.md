EIA- 0228162&lt;br/&gt;Lynette Hirschman&lt;br/&gt;Mitre
Corporation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: BioLINK Biological Language, Information
and Knowledge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BioLINK workshop will focus on the
interconnections in biology among literature, information (in databases), and
knowledge (in ontologies). The challenge for BioLINK is to improve information
access and management through a better understanding of how to combine and
synchronize the complementary resources and techniques provided by these
different approaches to information management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address
these challenges, the workshop will bring together senior researchers to
exchange perspective and develop a multidisciplinary perspective on information
management in the rapidly expanding area of biology. The specific goal will be
to create a research roadmap that identifies the following:&lt;br/&gt; The use
cases for biology: how do researchers uses databases, ontologies, literature,
and what would they like to see?&lt;br/&gt; Various ways in which these various
areas interact&lt;br/&gt; The missing science for how to connect these
resources&lt;br/&gt; A graded set of challenge problems that the BioLINK
community can address, to make progress on the underlying issues of
connectivity, access, and discovery.&lt;br/&gt;
