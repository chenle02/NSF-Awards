The PI is organizing the 4th Winter School J.J. Giambiagi titled "Nanophysics,
Nanoscience and Nanotechnology." This meeting will take place at the University
of Buenos Aires in Argentina. Support is requested for 1.5 graduate students
from U.S. Institutions. This interdisciplinary program is to provide a forum for
discussion of the latest advances in the general nano area and to foster
collaboration between the scientists in U.S. and Argentina. The challenges and
issues with science and application of nanotechnology will be identified and
discussed along with identification of emerging areas requiring research and
analysis.
