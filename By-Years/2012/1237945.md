This grant provides travel support for doctoral students at the 2012 Model-
Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Conference (MODELS). The students will
attend a doctoral symposium, where they will get feedback from a panel of
leaders in the field on their research. They will also participate as scribes in
workshops related to their research area. The broader impacts of this grant is
the education and training of the students as well as the building of the next
generation of researchers in this area. In this important area of Software
Engineering field, the US is seriously underrepresented, and this grant will
help increase participation from US students.
