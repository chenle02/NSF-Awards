ABSTRACT 96-15523 Werner Mechanisms and consequences of trait-mediated indirect
interactions in a larval anuran community This project examines indirect
interactions between species in a food web, and their effects on the structure
of ecological communities. The effects transmitted from a species A to species C
through an intermediate species B are termed density-mediated indirect
interactions when they are transmitted through changes in the abundance of
species B. There are compelling reasons to believe that trait-mediated indirect
interactions also can be important in shaping communities. These are indirect
effects transmitted by changes in the traits (behavior, morphology, and life
history) of species B. Presently only a few studies have illustrated these
effects. In this proposal, we use a model system of frog larvae and their
dragonfly predators to examine when we can expect the density-mediated or the
trait-mediated indirect interactions to dominate, and how they will interact
when both are important. We develop a model that indicates that the trait-
mediated indirect interactions have been strongly underestimated, and devise
experiments to test these predictions.
