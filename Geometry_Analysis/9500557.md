9500557 Maskit This project is concerned with several different aspects of
complex analysis and function theory: moduli of Riemann surfaces via Eichler
cohomology of Kleinian groups, the Schottky problem, geometric formulation of
2-dimensional quantum gravity, and Hausdorff dimension and the boundary behavior
of conformal mappings are among the topics proposed. Function theory is the
study of functions of one independent complex variable, and has a classical
origin. A notable aspect of function theory is the use of Riemann surfaces;
given a locally defined complex function one associates an abstract (multi-
sheeted) surface, called the Riemann surface of the function, via analytic
continuation. This Riemann surface carries all the essential information about
the original function and its possible regular extensions. The proposed project
has to do with classifying and understanding the totality of such Riemann
surfaces.
