Many research groups have started work on projects to aid in the use of complex
software systems, and to guide non- specialists in the many choices that have to
be made when they want to use computers for scientific applications. This
international conference is aimed at bringing together active researchers
working in those areas, to allow for exchange of ideas, viewpoints and
techniques for incorporating expert systems techniques in scientific computing.
