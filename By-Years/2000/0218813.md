Modern buildings and structures equipped with embedded control technology can
dramatically increase structural and occupant safety during earthquake or other
hazardous load conditions. Recent progress in wireless communications and
embedded systems can potentially eliminate the main impediments faced in
developing such intelligent structural systems. In the proposed research, a new
class of semi-active devices will be developed, along ith an analytical
framework for their optimal design and operation, using specially designed
embedded chips that will lead to significant benefits regarding the cost of
maintenance and installation, as well as reliability. Testing and demonstration
of the proposed approach with a large-scaled building model on a shaking table
will also be conducted. The breath of this multi-disciplinary research project
(PI's from Mechanical, Civil, Electrical and Computer Engineering) provides a
unique opportunity for training of students that can bridge several critical
fields, with eventual development of curriculum modules for long-term
educational impact.
