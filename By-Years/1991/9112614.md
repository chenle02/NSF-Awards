The equipment requested will be used for several projects, including: Structure
and Dynamics of Antigen-Antibody Complexes; Applications of Antibody
Engineering; Protein Engineering of Allosteric Antibodies; Protein Separations
Utilizing Temperature Sensitive Microemulsions; Engineering Protein
Crystallization Processes; Mechanisms of Neurite Outgrowth and Guidance;
Development of Hepatocyte Long Term Culture and Storage Techniques; Cellular and
Developmental Biology in Plant Cell Cultures; and Immobilized Recombinant Cells.
The wide dynamic range offered by the combination of the two instruments, and
the simultaneous use of the instruments in certain projects, will allow for an
enhanced understanding of underlying biochemical and biophysical phenomena.
