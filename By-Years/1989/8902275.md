Professor Rovnyak will pursue developments consequent upon the proof of the
Bieberbach conjecture in complex analysis. The latter has led to a study of
contractive substitution trans- formations in certain Krein spaces that include
and generalize the Dirichlet space. Properties of these transformations will be
explored both from the point of view of invariant subspace theory and the theory
of linear operators on spaces with indefinite metric. A long-range goal is a
coefficient body problem that seeks to characterize initial segments of power
series which represent normalized Riemann mapping functions that map the disk
into itself. Related abstract extension problems and commutant lifting theorems
for contraction operators on Krein spaces will also be studied. The research
envisioned here is about analytic functions, a central preoccupation of
mathematics for well over a century. They can be defined variously as solutions
of a certain simple system of partial differential equations, as maps which take
planar regions to other planar regions in a way that preserves angles except at
isolated singularities, or as limits of polynomials in a suitably precise sense.
Corresponding to the diverse ways of describing them, analytic functions can be
studied in a variety of ways. The approach favored in this project is operator-
theoretic, building up Hilbert spaces of functions by taking polynomials and
their limits in a particular fashion, then studying operators on the spaces that
arise naturally from the functions, e.g. by multiplication or by composition.
Conversely, these function-theoretic operators often turn out to be quite
general in operator theory, so by studying the functions one can learn a great
deal about operators in the abstract.
