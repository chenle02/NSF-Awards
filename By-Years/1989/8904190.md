This is a continuation of the PI's research on the design of small to medium
scale shared-memory multiprocessors where the number of CPU's ranges from a very
few to several hundreds. The emphasis is on the management of the memory
hierarchy. Innovative architectural features, such as multi-level cache
hierarchies and interconnection networks with memory in the switches are
studied. An important component of the research is providing qualitative and
quantitative evaluations through trace-driven and synthetic simulations. In the
case of multi-level cache hierarchies, the emphasis is on the design and
evaluation of a two level virtual-real cache hierarchy, the effect of inclusion
properties on the protocols for cache coherence and performance in bus-hierarchy
based architectures, and on techniques for speeding up trace driven simulation
(inclusion properties, trace reduction, parallel simulation). A second area of
research is techniques and architectural enhancements to reduce the memory
latency in architectures where processors and memory modules are connected by a
multi-stage interconnection network. The first part of the research considers
caching as a viable alternative and studies improved self-invalidation cache
coherence schemes and compares their performance and cost with those of
previously published protocols. The second part continues the PI's investigation
of the introduction of memory in the switches of the interconnection network.
