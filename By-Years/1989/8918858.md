THis grant is focused on analyzing ISEE-1 and -2 MEPI energetic particle and
LEPEDEA plasma data, along with UCLA magnetometer data, to characterize the
particle energy spectrum throughout the plasma sheet and its adjoining regions,
and to gain insight into the processes by which plasma and energy enter and
leave the magnetotail. This program will concentrate on extending the spectral
analysis into the adjacent regions, i.e. the low-latitude boundary layer, life,
and mantle. It will also be examining plasma energization mechanisms in the tail
current sheet during geomagnetic activity, the formation of ion and electron
beams and energy transport in the plasma sheet and plasma sheet boundary layer,
and the collapse of the tail field to a dipolar configuration when the cross-
tail current disrupts.
