The research projects to be undertaken are in the following two areas of
algebraic topology: the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and the homotopy
limit problem. In the first problem, the investigator will study certain third-
order periodic phenomena in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. This is a
continuation of a general program for studying the global behavior of stable
homotopy groups of spheres, as formulated by Miller, Revenel and Wilson. Results
obtained from this research will enhance our understanding of the underlying
periodicity of stable homotopy. In the second problem, the author will study the
so called "homotopy limit problem." The importance of this problem lies in the
fact that various well-known conjectures and theorems can be formulated as
particular homotopy limit problems. One of the goals is to extend known
affirmative solutions to the homotopy limit problem to include other important
spaces from algebraic K-theory. The result can them be applied to the study of
important homotopy theoretic questions. Bascially, homotopy theory is a tool for
investigating the topology of spheres in all dimensions and other such natural
geometric objects. It is an algebraic tool, useful because algebra permits
computation.
