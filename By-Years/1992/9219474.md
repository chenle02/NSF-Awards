Professor James Skinner is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work in studies of relaxation,
spectroscopy, and transport in condensed phases. Skinner employs a model system
consisting of two quantum levels coupled to a quantum mechanical bath which is
used for studies of relaxation processes, and has applications to many different
branches of spectroscopy. In the usual approach it is assumed that the coupling
between the quantum levels and the bath is weak, and that the initial density
matrix factors into a product of density matrices for the quantum levels and one
for the bath. Skinner's approach differs in that his studies of the relaxation
properties of the reduced density matrix do not involve either of these two
assumptions. Skinner will develop a microscopic theory of inhomogeneous
lineshapes in crystals which he will apply to results of several experiments. He
also will develop a statistical mechanical dynamical theory of electronic
spectroscopy in liquids and dense gases such as supercritical fluids. %%% The
last decade has shown that disorder is responsible for many important properties
of materials. In addition, the transport of electrons in condensed matter, which
has important implications for biology and solar energy collection, is greatly
affected by disorder. Skinner's research provides important insights at the
molecular level which will lead to a clearer understanding of the way in which
disorder influences the important material properties of condensed phase
chemical systems.
