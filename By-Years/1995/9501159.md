Professor Jeremy K. Burdett at the Department of Chemistry, the University of
Chicago, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program at NSF to study the solid state chemistry of a variety of
compounds. In particular, the supported research addresses problems in four
important areas of structural chemistry where, although there is a great deal of
experimental data, the chemical understanding of this data is very limited. The
four areas being studied concern: (1) nonstoichiometric materials; (2)
stabilities of differently coordinated crystal structures; (3) oxidation states
of transition metal ions; and, (4) Zintl phases. The approach being used
involves accurate LMTO and LAPW band structure calculations followed by more
approximate tight binding, TB, calculations. The accurate LMTO and LAPW results
are being fit to a set of TB parameters so as to be able to make maximal
connections between chemists ideas of orbitals and solid state physicists band
structure results. An important and, in some measure, unique feature of the work
supported under this grant is that the accurate band structure methods are used
in combination with the more approximate but conceptually valuable tight binding
methods. This combination has the capability to provide real chemical insights
which can guide understanding and which provide predictive power. The great
advances in computer hardware and programs have made it increasingly easy to
generate accurate numbers for the problems being studied under this grant. The
challenge being addressed by the supported work lies in understanding the
chemical and physical meaning of the accurate numbers.
