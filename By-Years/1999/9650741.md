The goal of the project is to significantly enhance student performance in
Structure and Function laboratory. The major objectives are to introduce the
nonmajor students to the relevance of modern research techniques to the society
at large and to transform the static observation-based laboratories into dynamic
participation-oriented sessions. It is critical that students understand the
principles of cell function before they can learn about the general physiology
and pathophysiology of the human body. Therefore, it is essential that students
understand the nature of DNA and proteins. To gain this understanding, students
are being introduced to SDS-PAGE, zymography, and agarose gel electrophoresis of
DNA. Through these hands-on techniques, students can understand the nature of
proteins and develop an insight into and appreciation for recombinant DNA
technology. A laboratory on morphogenesis is included and forces the students to
synthesize physiological concepts from isolated facts. To enhance student
appreciation of form and function, the project is replacing/supplementing
memorization-based models with actively learning models such as Maniken and
functioning eye and ear models. These models promote cooperative learning and
stimulate critical thinking through active experimentation. For efficient use of
the limited laboratory time, instructions and demonstrations are given to the
entire class with the aid of a visual presenter. For example, the visual
presenter enables the instructor to demonstrate the methods of dissection,
details of a skull structure, radiographs, angiograms, etc., to every single
student in the class at a given time. Of equal importance, the visual presenter
enables the students to demonstrate to the entire class what they have learned
in a given laboratory. The project enhances student creativity and promotes
active student participation. Above all, the students can understand human
anatomy and physiology through the eyes of modern science.
