Robots today can assist surgeons and explore space; however, they cannot be
trusted to drive autonomously in a real city. Robots either perform simple or
hard-coded tasks fully autonomously or they operate with close human
supervision. While most of the sensing and actuation technology exists, what is
lacking is the ability to provide guarantees for safety and correctness of a
robot's high-level, autonomous behavior.

The objective of this project is to develop mathematical formalisms and
algorithms that will provide guarantees for the success of a high-level task,
specified by a human using temporal logic and performed by a robot operating in
an uncertain world. These techniques will pave the way towards creating truly
correct autonomous robots thus making a significant impact in our community.

Specifically, the PI is developing mathematical theory, algorithms and open-
source tools to address the following challenges: (i) When a robot task is
infeasible determine and communicate why it cannot be achieved; (ii) Given known
bounds on sensor and action uncertainties, provide offline guarantees for task
success; (iii) Provide online guarantees and task progress as new information
regarding the workspace is gathered.

Broader impacts of the project include: (i) building a community of researchers
interested in formal methods for robotics and automation, and (ii) increasing
the number of women pursuing an engineering career. For the former,
undergraduate and graduate students are mentored, two courses taught by the PI
are enhances and workshops are organized. For the latter, the PI is designing
and supervising a robotics-based project for female high school students during
a summer program, and is working to recruit women through recruiting weekends
and a series of talks at other institutions.
