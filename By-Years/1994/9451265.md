9451265 Saltarelli The purpose of the current project is to expand the breadth
and diversity of the laboratory component in the human physiology offerings at
Central Michigan University to meet the specific needs of students in
undergraduate and pre-professional health science curricula. The program
specific needs and individual student needs for laboratory instruction in human
physiology require a versatile laboratory system that can serve a diverse
population of students with individualized laboratory experiences. The proposed
equipment will upgrade the laboratory learning experience of students in health
fitness, health education, sports medicine, pre-physical therapy, pre-medicine,
nursing, and pre-dental students by offering a wider variety of laboratory
experiences which could then be tailored and chosen to meet individual and
program needs. The equipment will also greatly expand the capacity of the
university to meet the specific laboratory needs of the non-traditional student
who requires greater flexibility and self-direction in obtaining laboratory
instruction. The laboratory system which is being proposed is the Thorton
Modular Physiograph System. This system was chosen because of its versatility
and user friendly components. It enables the student to directly observe a wide
variety of physiological phenomena in discrete laboratory experiences which can
be specifically applied to the various clinically oriented programs. The Thorton
system is a computer based system which allows for diversity in its applications
to specific programs (specifics are discussed in narrative). The versatility of
this system would also enable the instructor to develop individualized and self-
directed laboratory experiences to meet the needs of the expanding population of
non-traditional students requiring instruction in the health related
professions.
