This award provides funding for a three-year Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, a Hispanic
Serving Institution on the Texas Gulf Coast and a Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) approved site for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), to offer a
ten-week summer research experience in UAS technology to ten students per year.
Students are selected through a nationwide recruitment process that encourages
participation of underrepresented groups. This unique undergraduate research
experience opens the door for researchers to a wide range of applications, as
well as new areas in UAS technology that address problems of regional and
national significance, such as coastal management, coastal ecology, precision
agriculture, and security of UAS technology. The REU Site organizes activities
such as mentoring of participants by a team of experienced faculty, skill-
building seminars and workshops, research presentations, graduate school
preparation, and other professional development activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the program is to provide participants
unique research experiences in a stimulating environment that involves
developing secure, autonomous UAS technology. Activities include research in
applied computing for UAS-based applications as well as a series of skill-
building training sessions designed to enhance group cohesiveness and to hone
their technical writing, communication, and research skills. Primary research
activities occur in the areas of autonomous UAS, security of UAS, and
applications of UAS in a variety of domains. The participants will write and
submit research papers on their work in local, regional, and national
symposiums. Through the REU Site participants will be able to explore
opportunities of UAS technology in commercial, civilian, and governmental
applications, to develop confidence and passion for research, to motivate
seeking advanced degrees, and to inspire life-long learning in
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
