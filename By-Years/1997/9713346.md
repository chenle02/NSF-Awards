In large-vocabulary spontaneous speech, the variability of the pronunciations of
words is much higher than in read speech situations. At the 1996 Summer Workshop
on Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition (WS96), a model for this
variability to be used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems was
developed based on machine- derived descriptions of speech data. The
continuation of this work in this grant focuses on studying the correlation of
variation in pronunciations in continuous speech and higher-level information
not usually brought to bear in an ASR pronunciation model. One important element
in this model is the rate of speech, which has been shown to be a good predictor
of word error rate on both read and spontaneous speech corpora. Investigations
into the effects of resyllabification (movement of syllable boundaries when
words are spoken in sequence) and word frequency on word pronunciations are also
undertaken. The goal of this project is to improve the predictability of
variation for speech recognition models, in particular for the reduction of
recognition error for spontaneous and conversational speech. The techniques will
be evaluated on the Switchboard corpus.
