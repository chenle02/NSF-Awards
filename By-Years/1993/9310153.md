The award will support the development of a new mathematical model for
intrapolymer diffusion and will apply it to kinetics of protein folding. Protein
folding is one of the important problems in computational structural biology.
Understanding how a protein folds, and what the final state (conformation) a
protein will have has tremendous implications for many areas in biology and
medicine. In addition, this award will help support the retraining of a
mathematician, David Anick, to work at the interface between biology and
mathematics. This award is being co-funded with the Biochemistry and Molecular
Structure and Function program.
