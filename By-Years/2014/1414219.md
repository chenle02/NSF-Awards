A conference on the impact of computation on number theory will take place July
30 to August 3, 2014, at the National Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS), in
Hsinchu, Taiwan. The purpose of this conference is to gather international
experts to share experiences in how computation has impacted their research in
number theory (broadly understood), to present cutting-edge results, and to
discuss the future role of computation in number theory. Support from this award
will partially defray the expenses of the invited speakers and invited
participants from the US.

Calculation has always played a significant role in number theory. Beginning in
the middle of the last century and continuing today, machine computation has
played an increasingly prominent role. Many important statements in number
theory, like the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer and the formula of
Gross and Zagier, were formulated based on extensive data collected from
computation. In situations where we lack a deeper understanding, such as in
Grothendieck's theory of dessins d'enfants, the only way to gain understanding
is to compute examples first. It is hoped that this conference will shed light
on how important conjectures in number theory were discovered, how to comb
through numerical data to detect phenomena, how to take advantage of modern
technology to assist future research, and to learn the types of problems better
suited for numerical explorations. One of the goals for the conference is to
broaden participation by inspiring young participants and to encourage them to
build connections with people from all over the world. A three-week course in
arithmetic geometry and number theory will serve as a good prelude and
preparation for the conference for graduate students.
