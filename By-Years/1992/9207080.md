This project will cover a number of mathematical problems arising in fluid
dynamics. Areas covered are attractors for dissipative nonlinear equations,
turbulence, numerical analysis of singularity development, the study of coherent
structures in turbulence, low dimensional dynamical systems modelling the origin
of binary stars, and hyperbolic conservation systems. Fluid dynamics studies the
motions of liquids and gases. Computational and analytical mathematical analysis
of such motions is crucial to our understanding of flow of air over an air foil
and microbursts in the neighborhood of thunderstorms for example.
