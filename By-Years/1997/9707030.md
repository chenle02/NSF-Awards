9707030 Reyes This Planning Grant is to develop a systematic study of the
interaction between hydrolysable polymers and microbial enzymes that can
catalyze the polymer degradation. Polymers will be chosen that have potentially
hydrolysable backbone functionality, e.g., polyesters, polyamides, etc. The
enzymes will be chosen from four classes of hydrolases including lipases,
proteases, and cutinases. The enzymes will be tested individually and in
combinations. The impact of physical environment and the possible impact of
natural adjuvants such as salts and biosurfactants, will be investigated. ***
