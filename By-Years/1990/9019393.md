The long term goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between
the structure of parallel algorithms and the structure of parallel computing
systems. It seems clear that it will be necessary to match the structure of an
algorithm to the structure of the parallel computer on which it executes in
order to realize the computing power of the parallel system. Whether this
matching is done by the applications programmer or a compiler, a basic
understanding of the structural relationship between parallel algorithms and
parallel computer organization will be needed. This investigation proposed here
will provide needed insight into this process. During the phase of the project
covered in this proposal, the investigation will concentrate on the basic
question of how the structure and design of a parallel computing system's
interconnection network affects the overall performance of the system. The
interconnection network provides communication paths between the modules of a
parallel system and is a major source of system overhead. For Parallel systems
composed of a large number of processors, this overhead can significantly reduce
the system's performance relative to its theoretical maximum. This project will
evaluate the effect of this overhead using the Rice Parallel Processing Testbed,
a sophisticated simulation system developed for predicting the performance of
real parallel programs executing on parallel processors.
