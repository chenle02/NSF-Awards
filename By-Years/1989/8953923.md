A National consortium of institutions is developing an innovative core calculus
curriculum that is practical and attractive to a multitude of institutions. The
consortium is led by Harvard University and in addition to that institution
consists of the University of Arizona, Colgate University, Haverford-Bryn Mawr
Colleges, the University of Southern Mississippi, Stanford University, Suffolk
Community College, and Chelmsford High School. The refocus of calculus will use
the "Rule of Three" whereby topics are explored graphically, numerically, and
analytically.
