Inadequate security and privacy threaten the development of computer and
communications networks. There is a window of time available now in which to act
to rapidly develop policy guide lines consistent among the various national and
international networks. Delay in considering these issues will result in
inadequate privacy and security, cancellation or rejection of some otherwise
fine networks, or costly retrofits. A workshop is proposed to address these
policy questions, consider the adequacy of existing policy setting mechanisms,
and identify a number of legal issues which keep cropping up as networks
expand.***
