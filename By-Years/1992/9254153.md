The project will design an interdisciplinary laboratory science course for non-
science majors that explores the earth's past and its place in the universe. The
course will be based on concepts common to all of science. It will include
elements of and be taught by faculty from cosmology, physics, chemistry, geology
and the life sciences. The centrally significant ideas of these disciplines will
provide the focus for presentations and laboratory experiences. Faculty members
who will teach in this course will themselves become "master learners",
attending classes in other disciplines. There will be a 4-week workshop to
design the course in 1993, a two-week workshop to review, evaluate and revise it
in 1994, and a two-day evaluation session in May, 1994. Upon completion of the
grant, there will be six to eight faculty prepared to teach this innovative
interdisciplinary class.
