Under this award the PIs will be responsible for the duration of the Oregon
State University/College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences ocean core
repository. Since its establishment in 1972 the repository has collected and
described over 13,037 meters of sediment samples, 14,700 rocks, 2200 deep-sea
manganese nodules, 1537 sediment trap samples, 693 plankton tow samples, and
other materials have been archived and described with continuous NSF funding.
Over 34,340 samples have been distributed since 2000. This represents a 300%
increase in sampling activity relative to the previous grant period. Since 1972
the repository has expanded and modernized five times most recently in 2002 with
expansion of weatherproof rock storage. Additional expansion of refrigerator
storage for sediment cores, and freezer storage for ice cores, will take place
in the next three-year grant period.
