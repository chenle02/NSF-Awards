Partial travel support for 25 young United States scientists to attend the XXI
International Ethological Conference to be held in Utrecht, The Netherlands,
9-17 August 1989 will be provided. The International Ethological Conference is
the only international gathering in the field of ethology which brings together
scientists studying all aspects of animal behavior, including mechanisms,
development, evolution and adaptiveness (behavioral ecology). The biennial
conference attracts scientists from over 40 nations and covers a multitude of
disciplines including ethology, comparative psychology, ecology, evolution,
neurobiology, sociology, anthropology, psychobiology, animal science,
conservation, primatology and human ethology. Previous travel awards for the
1981 meeting at Oxford, England, the 1983 meeting at Brisbane, Australia and the
1985 meeting in Toulouse, France provided lasting benefit to 61 young
scientists.
