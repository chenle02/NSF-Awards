The numerical and experimental investigations of high-speed grinding of
structural ceramics are performed with emphasis on the associated damage
mechanisms. The primary goal of the computational effort is the inclusion of
inertial and rate effects and the capture of complex dynamic fracture process.
The experimental effort is used for validation and high strain version of the
scratch test commonly used to characterize the machinability of ceramic
materials is performed. The overall effort results in an efficient high speed
grinding process which leads to enhanced productivity with minimal subsurface
damage. ***
