Developing and maintaining software is a key challenge in computer
science,&lt;br/&gt;with failures costing up to one half of one percent of the US
GDP each&lt;br/&gt;year. Most code is retained and evolved, rather than created
from scratch,&lt;br/&gt;and professional software developers spend over three-
fourths of their time&lt;br/&gt;trying to understand existing code.
Understandability and documentation&lt;br/&gt;have become key components of
software quality, yet they remain poorly&lt;br/&gt;understood by both
researchers and practitioners. In a future where the&lt;br/&gt;software
engineering focus shifts from implementation to design and&lt;br/&gt;composition
concerns, program understandability will become even more&lt;br/&gt;important.
This research develops tools and techniques for
mechanically&lt;br/&gt;generating documentation to help make programs easier to
understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research follows the insight that modern
analysis techniques can form&lt;br/&gt;rich descriptive models of programs that
are both precise and succinct.&lt;br/&gt;Human-readable documentation can then
be synthesized from such models.&lt;br/&gt;The approach applies to large
programs across multiple application domains.&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on
documenting how code should be used correctly, a&lt;br/&gt;critical aspect in an
era of components-of-the-shelf development, as well&lt;br/&gt;as documenting how
code has changed and evolved over time, a key&lt;br/&gt;part of software
maintenance. The research leverages program analysis&lt;br/&gt;techniques,
machine learning, and textual synthesis, with results&lt;br/&gt;disseminated
through academic publication; the education, training and&lt;br/&gt;mentoring of
students; as well as freely-available, open-source tools.
