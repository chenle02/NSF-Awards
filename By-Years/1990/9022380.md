Research is the field of power system modeling and simulation with particular
emphasis on steady-state and transient conditions, including system frequency
dependence and unbalanced conditions. Three projects will be pursued. 1)
Development of new methods and techniques for the measurements, control, and
design of distribution power systems in the presence of harmonics and
distortion. This project was started by building a three-phase harmonic
generator and then investigating the measurement errors in the induction and
solid-state watt hour meters in the presence of harmonics. The experimental
results were compared with the theoretical results in the induction watt hour
meter. 2) Develop a microprocessor-based technique to detect and locate high-
impedance faults in power systems which can cause damage by fire or personal
injury by contact with an energized conductor. This project is started by
developing a proper fault model and a measurement scheme for on-line tracking of
voltages and currents during such a fault. 3) Development of new techniques for
optimal design of harmonic filters for power systems (transmission and
distribution). The objective of these techniques are to minimize harmonic
distortion, to allow power factor improvement and to improve voltage regulation.
This project has been started by studying and reviewing different types of
filters and their applications.
