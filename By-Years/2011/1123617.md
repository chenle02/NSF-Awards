Investigators from Rice University and Duke University will build a Personalized
Cyberlearning System, designed around three principles from cognitive science
(retrieval practice, spacing, and enhanced feedback), that leverages advances in
machine learning and makes use of an existing instructional content material and
problem set database aimed at undergraduate engineering students. The system
will use artificial intelligence methods to optimize practice and feedback for
students. Research will seek to advance knowledge, in a real-world setting,
about a range of issues concerning how feedback facilitates learning, how
individual differences come in to play, as well as those more specifically aimed
at the development of the learning technology system
itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is important as part of the effort to
harness the vast quantities of information on the web to personalize instruction
for a wide range of learners. Moreover, the development of such cyberlearning
technologies holds promise for opening up STEM education for motivated self-
learners while also allowing access to a large volume of material for a range of
students who might not otherwise have it.
