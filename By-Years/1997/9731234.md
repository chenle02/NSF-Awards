ABSTRACT Squires 97-31234 During the three years of this project teachers and
students from six Washington State high schools will work on research projects
at Pacific National Laboratory (PNL). Each year one teacher and three students
from each school will work together with a scientist at PNL for 8 weeks. This
working partnership will continue during the academic year in a research course
which each district has committed to and with ongoing support of the scientist
mentor. In the senior level research course the teacher-student teams will
mentor other students. Teachers will participate for two years each. Students in
the eleventh grade will participate in the 8-week summer research experience
once. During the second year of the project another teacher from the same school
but from a different discipline will begin their participation along with their
team of three students. The six school represent a blend of 4-school districts
near PNL, one district 70 miles away, and the sixth district is 240 miles away.
Over the life of the project 12 teachers and 72 students will participate
