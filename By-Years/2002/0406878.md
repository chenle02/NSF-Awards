AST-0406878&lt;br/&gt;Panaitescu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in understanding
Gamma-Ray Bursts in recent years have come from observations of the longer
wavelength emission, the afterglow, following the burst. Modeling this radio,
optical, and X-ray afterglow has become an essential procedure for obtaining
information about the explosion, such as the energy release, the opening angle
of the emergent jet, and the density of the surrounding medium. This is a
project for extensive development of the theoretical and numerical tools for
this modeling, incorporating the hydrodynamical evolution of outflows endowed
with angular structure, emission from the reverse shock propagating through
ejecta with a non-uniform magnetic field subject to a continuous injection of
mass and energy, and various effects on the jet dynamics and emission of the
electron-positron pairs created ahead of the forward shock. The work focuses on
early afterglows, within one hour of the burst, and involves extensive use of
data in the optical, millimeter, and radio bands from a large number of ground-
based telescopes. The results will also be useful for studies of pulsar winds
and active galactic nuclei, and will help to probe the high redshift Universe
and improve predictions of the neutrino fluxes relevant to new large neutrino
observatories. Knowledge and insights gained will be included in courses for
students and high school teachers, and used in public lectures and other
outreach activities.
