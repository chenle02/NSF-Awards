The principal investigator will continue his study of hydrodynamic behavior of
a class of density dependent stochastic reaction-diffusion models. Laws of large
numbers, central limit theorems, and large deviation behavior will be
investigated. Applications to related models and related areas such as
stochastic partial differential equations driven by jump processes will also be
pursued. The work will contribute to the interaction of mathematics and the
physical sciences. The principal investigator will continue his study of the
derivation of certain macroscopic reaction-diffusion equations from certain
microscopic models of chemical reactions. The work will contribute to the
interaction of mathematics and the physical sciences.
