With funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the "Improving the Success of Low-Income Students
in a Cybersecurity Program" project will support high-achieving, low-income
students with demonstrated financial need. The program targets students in the
Cybersecurity program at Old Dominion University. This five-year S-STEM Track 2
project will fund up to 18 scholarships and will provide students with academic
support through mentoring and other program activities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This S-STEM program at Old Dominion University consists of
the scholarship program, the support systems, and a strong evaluation and
research plan. It aims to accomplish the following outcomes: (1) generate
knowledge about the effectiveness of curricular and extracurricular activities
that increase retention and graduation of low-income students from three
specific groups: military-affiliated, first-generation, and underrepresented
minority students; (2) develop a student-support approach that solves the
challenges in this cybersecurity STEM program, which is inherently
interdisciplinary; and (3) implement a program that engages students in hands-on
labs, cyber competitions, research, and internships, so that they develop the
hands-on skills desired by the cybersecurity industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
