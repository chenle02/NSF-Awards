9505421 Amado Low energy nuclear physics theory should be derived from the
fundamental theory of the strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics or QCD.
The difficulty is that the principal ingredients of low energy nuclear
phenomena, the nucleon, pions, the nuclear force...are not simple features of
QCD but rather come out from the nonperturbative domain of that theory. Hence
obtaining low energy nuclear physics from QCD is a difficult task. Happily,
classical QCD is also obtained from the nonperturbative end of the theory. We
have begun to show that starting from classical QCD and reintroducing some
leading quantum corrections one can understand low energy nuclear physics
phenomena as disparate as the static nuclear force, nucleon-antinucleon
annihilation at rest and the disoriented chiral condensate. Here we propose to
continue these investigations with a view to improving their predictive power
and widening their investigations with a view to improving their predictive
power and widening their domain of application. Our major effort will be on
annihilation and on the disoriented chiral condensate while we continue to
search for new avenues for application of our classical/quantum approach to QCD
in nuclear physics. ***
