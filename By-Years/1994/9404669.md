This project develops optimizations based on object behavior prediction to
improve the performance of manual and automatic storage reclamation algorithms.
Programs written in languages such as C, C++, or Fortran that use manual garbage
collection, and program written in language such as Common Lisp, ML, Smalltalk,
or Modula-3 which uses automatic storage reclamation benefit from the techniques
developed in this project. The project uses profile-based optimizations to
predict properties of allocated objects at the time they are allocated. The
properties include object lifetime and object reference behavior. By correctly
predicting these properties, the space usage, CPU overhead, and reference
locality of programs using either manual or automatic storage reclamation is
improved. The project first investigate empirical properties of program in
languages using manual and automatic storage reclamation and determines if
behavior prediction is feasible. Then the project develops and evaluates
alternative algorithms that exploit observed predictable behaviors. Finally, the
project prototypes the most promising algorithms and measures their performance.
