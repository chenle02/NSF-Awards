This meeting will provide a forum for the presentation for both invited and
contributed original papers on the subjects of devices and architectures
suitable for switching, multiplexing, or routing optical signals. The purpose of
the meeting is to foster and enhance interaction between two groups that share a
common interest in exploring possible applications of photonic switching
technology: people working on optical switching devices and components; and
people working on future switching systems and networks.
