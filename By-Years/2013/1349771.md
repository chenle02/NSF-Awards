Dr. Scott Burdick has been awarded an NSF EAR Postdoctoral fellowship to carry
out a research and education plan at the University of Maryland. The
investigation will focus on developing seismic images of rifting continental
lithosphere and the underlying mantle in order to provide new constraints on the
factors that control continental rifting. Continental rift zones, localized
regions where extension occurs and the lithosphere is ruptured, play a central
role in continental evolution. Despite progress in modeling of rifting
lithosphere, fundamental questions concerning the initiation and evolution of
continental rifts remain. The education plan will include developing teaching
modules for introductory classes, and mentoring graduate and undergraduate
students in developing tomographic models

To accomplish the goals of the project, Dr. Burdick will use whole-mantle
traveltime tomography and a novel reflection tomography method that
simultaneously constraints both smooth variations in seismic velocity and
locations of seismic discontinuities, such as the lithosphere-asthenosphere
boundary and mid-lithopsheric discontinuities. The proposed research is focused
on two active and well-instrumented continental rifts: the Rio Grande Rift and
the Salton Trough. In order to provide a point of reference on the preexisting
seismic properties involved in the initiation of rifting, the project will also
examine the South Georgia Suture. All study regions are covered by dense
broadband seismic arrays. Data from these arrays, as well as the USArray
Transportable Array and global catalogues will be used in the continental-scale
research component that will help provide a connection to deeper processes.
