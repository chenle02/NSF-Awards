9512216 Kwitter, Karen B. The funds are requested for a performance-upgrade
package for the Williams College 24-inch telescope and for a computer system
that will significantly enhance the ability of the faculty and undergraduates to
analyze and interpret observational data. The work will install a new focus
housing on the 24-inch DFM telescope to allow high resolution focus readout,
thereby increasing the speed and efficiency of all observations, especially
multi-filter CCD observations. Also, a DEC Alpha 3000/900 will be purchased on
which to run IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, a package from the
National Observatories that has become the standard astronomical analysis tool),
and auxiliary equipment for data transfer and storage. The new instrumentation
will substantially improve the ability to conduct on-campus research, and to
continue the student research participation-often involving data acquired at
national observatories-that is a hallmark of the Williams College astronomy
curriculum.
