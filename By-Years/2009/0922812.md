The objective of this project is to acquire, install, and maintain a near-field
antenna test system at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) - Southern
Methodist University (SMU) Antenna Characterization Lab for use by the UTD-SMU
faculty and students for research, development, and class instruction in the
area of antennas and wave propagation as well as by local industries in the
Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
proposed 3-D scanner measurement system will facilitate the development of
antennas for wireless communications, particularly cellular phone antennas,
window-unit antennas for satellite-ground communication, and antennas for
spatial and polarization diversities. The antennas of cellular phones will have
improved efficiency and produce substantially reduced harmful radiation to the
user's head, while the window-unit antenna will be conveniently mounted flat
over a window pane for satellite reception such as cable viewing. The spatial
and polarization diversity will increase the reliability of currently available
wireless devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The UTD-SMU Antenna
Characterization Lab expects three broad impacts from the acquisition of the
facility on the academia and industry in wireless communications in the Dallas-
Fort Worth metroplex: Research and development of antennas by the university
faculty and students in terms of diagnosis and characterization; classroom
instruction at both SMU and UTD for demonstration as well as training antenna
engineers; and accessibility of the facility by the local industry.
