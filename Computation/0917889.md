The Southeastern Clustering and Ranking Group (PI Amy Langville, College of
Charleston, Carl Meyer, North Carolina State University, Davidson College)
focuses on the computational mathematics associated with ranking and clustering
items. This work uses numerical linear algebra algorithms applied to very large
datasets from the group's industrial collaborators. We propose to host a three-
day student-centered workshop with industrial participation to be held in mid-
August 2009. This workshop will be an information exchange and planning meeting,
allowing members of the group to establish relationships that will facilitate a
planned Wiki website and student exchange program.
