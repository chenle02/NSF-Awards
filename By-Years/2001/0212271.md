0212271&lt;br/&gt;Benkman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the central problems in
evolutionary biology is to understand the processes that lead to new species.
This project will determine whether and how the coevolutionary arms race between
red crossbills and lodgepole pine is leading to new species of red crossbills
(finch-like birds). First, mark-and-recapture methods will be used to determine
whether natural selection as a result of coevolution has caused the observed
morphological divergence between crossbill populations. Second, aviary
experiments and field studies will address how reproductive isolation (i.e.,
speciation) might have occurred as a by-product of divergent selection. Finally,
genetic studies using AFLP primers will be used to determine the extent of
genetic differentiation between different crossbill populations and to develop a
phylogeny of all North American red crossbills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work
aims to link two of the most important evolutionary processes, coevolutionary
arms races and speciation, to patterns of biodiversity and to how geographic
patterns of diversity arise. Being able to document such coevolutionary
interactions, with the real possibility that they are now contributing to the
origin of new species, is not only exciting, but may also provide insights that
will help prevent undesirable extinctions. Such interactions have rarely been
well documented for any taxa, let alone for birds, which capture the attention
of many citizens.&lt;br/&gt;
