This research is the renewal of a special Creativity Extension Award. The prior
grant was highly productive resulting in more than twenty publications in
refereed scientific journals with more than five addition being prepared. A
summary of the significant accomplishments includes determination that the
defect structure in barium titanate dielectrics was very dependent upon the
processing of the material with little difference in stoichiometry noted; the
defect structure of beta alumina solid electrolytes has both long range order
and long range disorder which depends upon the stoichiometry and the thermal
history; the mixed ion effect in beta alumina was explained and shown to be
related to the defect structure (conductivity varies by as much as several
thousand times for the same material); solid electrolytes with more control of
the structure and properties were synthesized using ion exchange techniques. The
renewal grant will emphasize research on increased understanding of the critical
chemical factors affecting the structure and properties of oxide ceramics and on
synthesis of new oxides using this understanding. Materials being investigated
include layered transition metal oxides, copper oxides, and lanthanide beta
alumina. Analytical techniques used include high resolution electron microscopy,
x- ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis,
and electronic characterization (conductivity, dielectric loss, magnetic
susceptibility). The materials being investigated have technological importance
because of their potential application in thermal batteries, lasers, high
temperature superconductors, dielectrics for communications etc.
