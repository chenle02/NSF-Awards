The Santa Fe Institute (SFI), a non-profit research and graduate teaching
organization, proposes to continue its programs of interdisciplinary research
and education on the principles that determine the dynamic behavior of complex
systems. The Institute is founded on the premise that there are common
principles that determine the behavior of various complex systems, especially
systems that are sufficiently complex to learn and adapt. Our approach is to
understand these principles by studying specific systems in the context of more
general themes. Since 1987 it has operated a center in Santa Fe where leading
scholars in the physical, computational, life, and social sciences come
together. The project includes: a) A program on the basic physics, mathematics,
information sciences, and computational aspects of complexity including work on
the shared properties of complex systems, and innovative computer modeling. b) A
residential research program on adaptive computation employing the techniques of
general algorithms and classifier systems and including work on developing
computational and visualization tools. c) A residential research program on
economics as a complex, adaptive system. d) A program on life sciences, that
includes modeling of the immune system, generic data analysis, and models of
protein folding. e) A Summer School on the Sciences of Complexity in Santa Fe,
managed by SFI in collaboration with a number of other institutions.
