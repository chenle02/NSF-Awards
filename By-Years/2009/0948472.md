This engineering education award to the University of Virginia will develop an
innovative model for an accelerated masters degree in systems engineering that
is customized to the needs and strengths of veterans. A particular emphasis will
be including research experiences and industrial internships within the degree
program. The results will also be presented on the web, at technical conferences
and published in professional journals. The project is expected to assist the
transition of veterans to civilian life and to enhance the number of students
who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs or start
new high tech businesses.
