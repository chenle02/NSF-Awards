This award supports an investigation of the climate of the Precambrian era (600
million to 4 billion years ago). This investigation of climate has two major
efforts: 1. Clarify the long standing paradox of the faint young sun and the
climate evolution of the earth's atmosphere, and 2. Examine current climate
theory in light of the great changes in parameters of the Precambrian. The
geologic and planetary records have definite evidence for four earth parameter
changes of consequence for Precambrian climate: a smaller solar luminosity , a
faster Earth rotation rate, a different atmospheric composition and a much
reduced land area. Because of the critical importance of the hydrologic cycle
and eddy properties found in previous studies, this study will use GCM modeling
with the NCAR Community Climate Model. Profound changes in the general
circulation found in the Precambrian offer a fundamental way to study current
climate balances and the current climate state of the Earth.
