This project is in the area of the Materials Chemistry Initiative dealing with a
collaborative effort in the general area of molecular thin films with the
primary goal of elucidating structure-property relationships of the films. The
synthetic techniques are centered around electrochemical deposition and
polymerization processes which have been demonstrated to produce interesting
electronics materials. The chemical and physical properties characterization is
extensive and will include: chemical analyses, structural, mechanical, optical,
and electronic properties. The program is designed to enable feedback between
synthesis and characterization so as to chemically enhance desired materials
property.
