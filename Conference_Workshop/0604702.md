An abstract:

The investigator and his colleagues will organize the New Researchers
Conference, a scientific conference for roughly ninety new researchers in
statistics and probability. This consists of organizing an application process,
selecting participants from a pool of applicants, coordinating talks and poster
sessions, arranging for senior speakers, and a variety of other administrative
tasks (arranging for travel, housing, food, etc.).

The New Researchers Conference (NRC) is a conference for recent recipients of
doctoral degrees in Statistics and Probability. The primary purpose of this
conference is to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new
researchers. At present, researchers develop contacts with others in their field
either through their own institutions or at meetings of professional societies.
It is often the case that junior researchers have limited contact with senior
colleagues, even at their own institutions. Meetings of professional societies
are rather large and junior researchers often find them overwhelming. The
proposed meeting of new researchers will provide a unique opportunity for these
junior researchers to exchange ideas and initiate contacts among themselves as
well as provide them an opportunity to interact with the invited senior
participants.
