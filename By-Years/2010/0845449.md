This proposal will demonstrate a software infrastructure specialized to study of
cerbrovasculature. The problem is of great societal importance and is typical of
a number of multiscale multiphysics problems encountered in multiple branches of
science. The investigators will focus in this project on: ? Scalable Continuum
Models using their highly accurate hp adaptive spectral element code NEKTAR, ?
Stochastic Continuum/Atomistic Modeling (LAMMPS-DPD); ? Multi-Level Parallelism,
and, finally an effort to make computing across multiple grids by doing a pilot
of TeraGrid-DEISA Grid Computing.
