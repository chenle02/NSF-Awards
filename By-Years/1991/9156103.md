This project develops and tests tutorial software which demonstrates basic
topics of engineering mathematics necessary for entry level engineering courses.
It also provides demonstrations of typical engineering applications. This
tutorial software will help students understand and use these mathematical
concepts in their engineering courses. The software will be developed for
terminals or workstations using X Windows and should be easily portable to many
universities. The software will be designed for low overhead use with no
knowledge of programming languages, operating systems, or database structures
required of the user. The first electrical circuits course will be used to
evaluate the effectiveness of the tutorial software and results of the
evaluation will be used to improve the design and content of the system. The
feasibility of using stored video recordings of real experiments for use with
computer generated visualizations will be explored. The structure of the
tutorial software will be documented so that others can add modules to the
system. Distribution of the software will be handled by the Office of Continuing
Education at Santa Clara University and through Sun Microsystems' Catalyst
Education Program.
