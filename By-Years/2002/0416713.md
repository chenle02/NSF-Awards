The resolution of ecological and genetic conflicts of interest governs virtually
all social relationships, from genes to societies. Families represent a
universal and especially intense arena for cooperation and conflict: fathers and
mothers, sons and daughters, and brothers and sisters may often die for each
other, but given the right circumstances, they will also kill each other. The
development of kin selection theory 40 years ago provided the foundation for
analyzing the resolution of conflicts between family members, clarifying how and
when pairs of relatives of any species should and should not help each other.
However, social conflicts rarely involve isolated pairs of relatives. Instead,
the conflicts play out on a matrix of interactions between different family
members, and beyond. This proposal focuses on the resolution of multiway
intrafamily conflicts in a remarkable marine snail, in which females enclose
their offspring in "nurseries" that they attach to males. As the offspring
develop, they cannibalize each other, an extreme form of sibling competition for
resources provided by their mother. Because females mate with several males, the
offspring within a nursery are usually a mixture of full- and half-brothers and
sisters. This widespread habit of multiple mating by females increases the scope
for conflict between parents and offspring, and among the offspring. Theory
predicts that offspring should consume their half-sibs before their full sibs,
and testing this prediction using experiments and genetic analyses is a major
goal of this proposal. In addition, the studies in this proposal will use
experiments to determine whether females control the mixture of full- and half-
siblings, so as to adjust the rates of cannibalism within nurseries.

The research involves extensive international collaboration with colleagues and
students in Mexico. The project will support infrastructure, including a
molecular ecology website and associated workshops, and a multi-user genetics
facility used to train students and postdoctoral researchers in state-of-the-art
molecular analysis. NSF support over the last three years has supported the
training of 6 Ph.D. students (3 women, 1 Hispanic), 4 postdocs (1 woman, 1
Hispanic), and 9 undergraduates(5 women, 1 minority). This proposal will support
the training of a comparable number of young scientists, giving them
multidisciplinary training at the interface of behavior, ecology, evolution, and
marine biology.
