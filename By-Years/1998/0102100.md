This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Evolutionary genetics of ecological
diversification in cyanobacterial populations from hot spring habitats differing
in nitrogen availability." Understanding how ecological differences evolve in
microbial populations is essential for explaining the magnitude and distribution
of microbial diversity. This research uses a combination of quantitative,
population and developmental genetic approaches to: (1) test for ecological
divergence between populations of the cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus
from habitats differing in nitrogen availability; (2) evaluate the evolutionary
processes shaping ecological structure in these populations; and (3) link
molecular genetic variation to variation in the ability to assimilate different
nitrogen sources.
