Abstract for proposal 0429901/0430065&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern technology
enables the creation of digital 3D polygon meshes with incredible detail.
Current mesh formats, which were designed when models and meshes were orders of
magnitude smaller, complicate the processing of large, detailed data. This
project will fully develop a new streaming mesh representation, and use it as a
framework for algorithms that produce and/or consume large polygonal and
polyhedral meshes. At its core are several simple, new ideas that get around
current limitations in computer memory hierarchies. The immediate benefit of
compressed storage, faster loading, and better memory use appeal to any
application creating large models, including scientific and engineering
visualization for data exploration, scanned artifacts for artistic and museum
displays, landscape modeling for flood or fire control, mesh generation for
scientific computing, virtual environments for collaboration and education, and
3D models for e-commerce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project identifies the
parameters that characterize a streaming mesh, then designs and implements
algorithms whose behavior can be analyzed in terms of these parameters. Initial
algorithms include surface simplification, compression, and transmission for
geometric models for computer graphics, and extend to include 2D and 3D stream-
based Delaunay triangulators. The key ideas grew out of work on geometric models
in computer graphics; the project's investigators will apply them in more
general contexts. The result will be useful software, embodying a computation
paradigm that can process arbitrarily large meshes while avoiding geometric
artifacts, degradation of quality, and other difficulties of approaches that cut
meshes into pieces to fit into available memory. This project will ensure its
broader impact though distribution of software (both source code and
executables) for streaming and compressing meshes, and stream-based 2D and 3D
Delaunay triangulation. The project will impact education of undergraduate and
graduate students, and reach out to high school and elementary students through
demonstration days. The principle investigators use several means to reach
groups that are underrepresented in computer science.
