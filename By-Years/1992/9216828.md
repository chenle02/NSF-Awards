9216828 Berry-Lowe A multi-component chromatography system, including fast
protein liquid chromatography, will be used for a number of studies including
the following: Purification, characterization, and site-directed mutagenesis of
the enzymes involved in porphyrin synthesis in higher plants; study of the
adaptive mechanisms by which conifers requlate rates of essential metabolic
processes as a function of altitude (malate dehydrogenase will be purified and
characterized initially); identification and purification of bacterial proteins
involved in localization of lipoproteins in membranes; and protein engineering
of a novel yeast qlucoamylase. This equipment will also be utilized in several
undergraduate classes by the Biology Department of Colorado Springs: for
demonstrations in lecture courses (Cell Biology, Immunology, Plant Physiology),
for hands-on use in laboratory courses (Biochemistry, Biotechnology) and for
hands-on use in research (Independent Study, Senior Thesis). ***
