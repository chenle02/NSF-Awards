The 2012 Midwest Geometry Conference will take place May 12-13, 2012 at the
University of Oklahoma, located in Norman, Oklahoma. The conference will
highlight recent developments and new research directions in a number of areas
that include (but are not limited to): p-harmonic geometry, minimal varieties,
geometric flows, complex and Riemannian geometry, conformal geometry, geometry
of submanifolds, convex geometry, stochastic geometry, algebraic geometry,
geometric measure theory, metric geometry, partial differential equations,
several complex variables, Finsler geometry, mathematical physics, and related
problems. They represents a wide spectrum of the topic. As a complement of the
talks in the conference, the participants will have considerable opportunities
to have discussions with the speakers and each other. The Midwest Geometry
Conference had been an annual meeting since its founding in 1991 until 2007.
This 2012 conference is committed to revive the Midwest Geometry Conference, in
addition to bring in researchers of national and international statue, and
students around the world to discuss their research and to interact with
mathematicians and students from the Midwest and other regions at all levels.
Summaries of talks are publicly reported.



It is a wonderful event or phenomenon in mathematics that the results of one
discipline of thought have startling and unexpected consequences in another. The
conference is a valuable networking opportunity, as well as a great venue for
dialogue on mathematical concepts, ideas, methods, problems, collaborations, and
the direction of mathematics. By design, the Midwest Geometry Conference has two
high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the exchange of
ideas among members of the geometry community in the Midwest, as well as
dissemination of important recent advances, nationwide and worldwide, in
differential geometry, geometric analysis, integral geometry, and related fields
in the broad sense. This helps cement research collaborations, brother-sister-
hood, and mathematical contact. Second, the conference is committed to create a
focused environment, conducive to a lively exchange of ideas, in which members
of this regional community can benefit from each other's ideas, and from contact
with leading geometers from outside the region. The intent of the conference is
to be a top-drawer, cutting-edge research conference, attempting (as much as
resources permit) to bring in the appropriate speakers at all levels,
independent of where they are based. The conference will reflect, complement, or
interact the main areas of focus of geometers in the Midwest. Funds will be used
to for the travel and hosting costs for speakers, and participants. Minorities,
women, persons with disabilities, graduate students, and junior faculty are
especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Prior to the
conference, experienced conference participants will present one or more
introductory warm-up talks for interested graduate and undergraduate students.
Public talks will address audiences for the public at large. Other events
include Professor Shihshu Walter Wei's third (volunteer) graduate course without
extra pay, Math 6683 Differential Geometry II at the University of Oklahoma in
the spring of 2012, providing a general background for the conference.
