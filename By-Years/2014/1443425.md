Since 2012, high school Advanced Placement Biology exam includes molecular
evolution and suggests using open-access NCBI BLAST engine for sequence database
search to illustrate principles of gene evolution and its applications in
biotechnology. BLAST has many other uses in school curriculum. The goal of the
proposed workshop is to give teachers, including those working at schools
serving high numbers of students from categories underrepresented in STEM, an
understanding of the functionality of the sequence databases and methods of
their search. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pairing the proposed workshop with ISMB 2014
will provide teachers with an opportunity to interact with researchers to
discuss the science, techniques, and posters from the Bioinformatics Education
Special Interest Group, which will be displayed at the conference on the day of
the workshop.
