One of the most important and least understood processes operating at ocean
ridges is the decomposition melting and melt extraction from upwelling mantle
peridotite. This project will determine the mechanisms of deformation in
partially molten Iherzolites at conditions appropriate to melting under mid-
ocean ridge systems, and will determine the distribution melt generation during
deformation. These experiments will be done in a high-pressure deformation
apparatus utilizing an improved drive system and molten salt cell that allows
differential stresses as low as 3-5 MPa to be measured at any confining
pressure. A suite of synthetic Iherzolites of progressively less basaltic
constituents will be synthesized in order to simulate the progressive melting
and melt extraction that occurs in ridge environments. The effects of pressure
on partially molten Iherzolite rheology and the effects of melt chemistry and
viscosity will be investigated.
