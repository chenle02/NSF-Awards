Timothy Carlson's work in finite and infinite combinatorics provides powerful
unifying generalizations of various so-called Ramsey theorems. The simplest
Ramsey theorem is the following: if six points in space are connected in all
possible ways by straight line segments and each segment is painted either red
or green, then there will always be an entire triangle whose sides are of the
same color. This theorem has been generalized beyond easy recognition in a
variety of different ways, but all such generalizations are referred to as
Ramsey theorems. They have a host of significant consequences in geometry and
number theory and elsewhere, and it is very useful to have unifying principles
which provide economical derivations for these corollaries. Further results of
this nature will be sought.
