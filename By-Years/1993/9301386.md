Erdogen Gulari 9301386 This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER). It
is concerned with the use of hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) to
deposit high-purity films of nitrides of titanium, gallium, and boron. In this
technique a hot tungsten filament is used to decompose ammonia; the unstable
nitrogen-containing radicals then react with a vapor-phase form of the desired
metal or metalloid to deposit a thin film of nitride on a semiconductor
substrate (silicon in this study). Composition, microstructure, optical
properties, and electrical properties of deposited films are studied. Films are
characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy,
electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering,
photoluminescence, and electron/hole mobility. The gas phase chemistry of the
method is studied through experimental measurements and theoretical modelling.
The materials produced in this study have potential for a variety of
microelectronic applications, from insulators to LEDs to high- temperature
applications. Reliable methods for producing high- quality thin films of
materials are badly needed.
