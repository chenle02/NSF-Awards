&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the development of a conference on Cognitive
Neuroscience Across the Lifespan. The conference will be a satellite to the
Cognitive Neuroscience Meeting in April 2002. The primary objective is to push
development in this emerging area with the ultimate goal of understanding how to
maintain lifelong cognitive function, and how to maintain a healthy mind. The
conference will focus on understanding the link between overt cognitive
behaviors and underlying neural functions across the lifespan. The conference is
designed to bring together for the first time, leading researchers in the
cognitive neuroscience of aging, to highlight emerging issues, methodological
challenges, and the small body of existing research in this domain, and to
foster the exchange of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
