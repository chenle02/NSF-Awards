Dr. Willman will use Milky Way stellar streams and dwarf galaxies to study the
Galaxy's dark matter sub-halos and formation history. She will implement a
photometric technique to mitigate contamination from unresolved galaxies in
Sloan Digital Sky survey and Dark Energy Survey point source catalogs. She will
apply new techniques to optical (Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Dark Energy Survey)
and infrared (UKIDSS) datasets to study known stellar streams with higher
fidelity and to reveal the presence of previously unseen streams and dwarfs in
previously unmapped Milky Way volume. The data are already publicly available
for both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and UKIDSS. The Dark Energy Survey is
scheduled to begin survey operations in 2012. Dr. Willman will also use N-body
and N-body + SPH simulations to explore a possible new method to "see" purely
dark sub-halos. She will investigate the merging histories of the Milky Way's
dwarf galaxies and possible observational signatures thereof. This work provides
a direct approach to astronomically measure the properties of dark matter on the
smallest possible sub-galactic scales - a major problem facing observational
cosmology. It will also leave the field well-poised for the upcoming wide-field
optical and infrared surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A postdoctoral researcher and
undergraduate students will be trained as they participate in this research and
in related public outreach. The postdoctoral researcher will also engage in
closely mentored undergraduate teaching experiences at Haverford College. Dr.
Willman will lead an undergraduate seminar in science diversity in Years 1, 3,
and 5. Students and Dr. Willman will collaborate on developing Haverford's
student-run Strawbridge Observatory public program. Numerous undergraduates will
have the opportunity to participate in a student-led research program based on
KPNO 0.9m telescope observations. Dr. Willman will also release star catalogs
for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Survey informed by broad-
band photometry.
