Chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene, vinyl chloride and chloroform
are widespread, persistent contaminants in the environment. These compounds have
been shown to be readily biodegradable by methane-oxidizing bacteria. We propose
to design and field test a pilot scale innovative biological treatment system,
utilizing these bacteria in a Rotating Biological Contractor (RBC). The RBC will
provide maximum gas transfer (methane and oxygen) to the organisms to bring
about the breakdown of the chlorinated compounds by co-oxidation. This approach
will have broad applications in the treatment of waste waters, ground waters and
leachates contaminated with trichloroethylene and other chlorinated solvents.
