The quasi-permanent sea ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is a central component of
the northern high latitude climate system, and secular changes in the
concentration and thickness of the sea ice can be important proxy indicators of
wide-spread arctic climate variations. While interannual differences in ice
concentration and extent are relatively easily documented from microwave
satellite imagery, variations in thickness require the analysis of direct in-
situ observations. This project is an effort to analyze selected sea ice draft
profiles obtained with an upward looking sonar by U.S. submarines while crossing
the Arctic Ocean. These data have been obtained routinely since 1975, but have
not yet been subjected to a rigorous examination, nor have they been related to
other in situ and remotely sensed environmental data. The proposed statistical
techniques are expected to be sufficiently precise to reveal interannual
variations in the arctic ice thickness on the decadal time scale, which may be
an early indicator of hemispheric climate change.
