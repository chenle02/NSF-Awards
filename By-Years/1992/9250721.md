The objective of the project is to create a Signal Processing Instructional
Facility (SPIF) based on NeXT workstations and real-time digital signal
processing development systems to augment, enhance, and interconnect required
sophomore- and junior-level courses in linear systems. The SPIF is also being
used in an advanced senior-level elective course in digital signal processing.
The project uses Mathematica Notebooks for symbolic transforms and symbolic
signal processing along with several public domain applications written for the
NeXT platform.
