The variations observed in compact extragalactic radio sources will be
investigated both observationally and theoretically. These variations manifest
themselves as changes both in the structure as revealed by very-long baseline
interferometry (VLBI)studies and in the total flux density. The VLBI technique
will be used to monitor two quasars, 4C39.25 and NRAO 140, which are under going
particularly interesting variations which may also lead to new understandings of
phenomena previously observed. Investigations of theoretical explanations for
the observed variability in quasars and similar sources will be carried out.
Models involving shock waves propagating through turbulent regions in
relativistic jets appear capable of explaining the general characteristics of
the observed variations, especially the frequency dependence of the variability
timescales. Numerical calculations of emission patterns and spectra of shocks in
turbulent jets will be performed and compared with the observational data. The
ultimate goal of the proposed project is to better understand the nature and
origin of high-speed compact jets in quasars, and through this the nature of the
"central engine" in these objects.
