9414472 Bentsman This International Cooperative Research Project involves
collaborative research effort between the PI and five leading researchers from
the Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries. Innovative techniques are developed for
the control of mechanical systems subjected to energy and magnitude constraints.
Such control situations are encountered in many diverse applications, e.g.,
reorientation and maneuvering of spacecrafts, and positioning of robotic
manipulators and flying heads in hard disk drives. In this project, mathematical
models are formulated for complex nonlinear mechanical systems that admit both
impulsive and conventional control inputs. Optimal solutions are generated under
the integral and magnitude constraints for this class of systems using a
generalized control approach in a closed-loop setting. ***
