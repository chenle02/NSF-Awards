Semiclassical quantum gravity is a bridge between the classical theory of
Einstein and a full quantum theory of gravity whose exact nature is not yet
known. It therefore applies to phenomena that are both close to the classical
theory of gravity, but have implications for the search for a quantum theory of
gravity. Several investigations into semiclassical quantum gravity will be
carried out. These include an investigation into the pair production of charged
black holes. Investigations into the nature of the full theory of quantum
gravity will also be carried out. A problem of particular importance is the
status in quantum gravity of the singularities which limit the predictive power
of the classical theory. This will be investigated using the techniques of
string theory. The objective is to establish whether singularities are smoothed
out or removed at this fundamental level. A central issue of modern cosmology is
the problem of providing a theory of the initial condition of the universe which
will make testable predictions for observations today. Since gravitation is the
dominant force governing the structure of the universe on the largest scales of
space and time, and since the early universe is likely to be quantum mechanical
in an essential way, the search for this initial condition is carried out in
that branch of quantum gravity called quantum cosmology. A broad based research
program will be carried out into the nature of this initial condition, the
generalizations of quantum mechanics which may be needed for its interpretation,
and the models which allow for comparison of its predictions with observations.
The objective of this research is to encapsulate the simplicity of the early
universe as revealed by observation, together with the features which arise out
of this simplicity, in one physical law.
