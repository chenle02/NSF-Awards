AST-0307384&lt;br/&gt;Fan&lt;br/&gt;This project will carry out three aggressive
observational campaigns aimed at obtaining large, complete samples of quasars at
the highest redshifts, based on imaging data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). A wide field survey of luminous candidates in the North Galactic Cap
will find 15 to 20 quasars above redshift 5.7, a survey using the deep
equatorial stripe data will provide a sample of about a thousand faint quasars
above redshift 3, and a multi-wavelength follow-up will produce an unparalleled
high-quality dataset for a selected sub-sample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data
will be used to study the evolution, luminosity function, and clustering of
quasars, to map the accretion history of the earliest quasars and constrain
their evolution, and to consider the relation between super-massive black holes
and galaxy evolution. The investigators will also measure the quasar
environment, including metallicity and spectral signature. Other research will
follow the evolution of the intergalactic medium and the end of reionization,
using absorption features in the quasar spectra and the Gunn-Peterson troughs
along different lines of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will involve
graduate and undergraduate students, and all of the data will be made available
to the community in a timely fashion, including not just the quasar catalog but
also the quasar spectra.&lt;br/&gt;
