The 2019 ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC) is the tenth in an established
series of symposia that bring together researchers, developers, users, and
practitioners interested in cloud computing. The SoCC is co-sponsored by the ACM
Special Interest Groups on Management of Data (SIGMOD) and on Operating Systems
(SIGOPS). As the premier conference on cloud computing, and through the
continuous efforts of the community, ACM SoCC is today a dynamic and
comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction. In
particular, the program includes research and industrial papers, poster
sessions, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. The scope of
SoCC is broad and encompasses diverse data management and systems topics, such
as software as a service, virtualization, scalable cloud data services, and data
management and analytics at scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To increase
participation from a diverse array of students, the funds through this grant
will assist approximately 25 US-based graduate students to attend the 2019 ACM
SoCC. The conference provides a unique opportunity for students to share their
knowledge, experience, and research works with internationally recognized
researchers from both academia and industry. The conference also offers an
excellent environment for participants (especially students) to interact with
industry (such as such as Oracle, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Salesforce, VMWare,
and Facebook, and others) leaders during regular program sessions. These
opportunities will have a long-lasting impact on the future career of the
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
