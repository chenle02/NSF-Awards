Title: Student Travel Support for the CGO 2015 and PPoPP 2015 Symposia

This award will support student travel to two co-located conferences: the
International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2015) and the
ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP
2015). The symposia will be held in San Francisco, California, in February 2015.
These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of compilers and parallel
programming. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and
workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include
fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as
providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In
particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art
methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior
researchers in their areas of expertise.
