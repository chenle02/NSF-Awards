NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0072496 Mathematical Sciences: Hyperbolic Systems of
Conservation Laws - Viscous Conservation Laws - Applications

Abstract

0072496 Trivisa

This research deals with the general areas of hyperbolic conservation laws and
viscous conservation laws. The first set of questions concerns the well-
posedness of solutions to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with large
initial data, the uniqueness and regularity of solutions, and the study of some
hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in several space dimensions. The second
set of questions lies in the area of viscous conservation laws and deals with
the study of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with applications in fluid
dynamics and combustion theory. The main objective of this research project is
to initiate a systematic investigation of the qualitative behavior of solutions
to general multidimensional Navier-Stokes equations with large initial data.

This is interdisciplinary research, lying on the interface between continuum
physics and the theory of hyperbolic (and viscous) conservation laws. The
investigator studies partial differential equations arising in continuum physics
with the expectation that the underlying physical structure will direct the
analysis, while in return the mathematical analysis of some nonlinear partial
differential equations will further the understanding of continuum physics.
