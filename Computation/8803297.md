There are three foci of this research. The first one concerns Artin's
conjecture for composite numbers. That is, what can one say about the elements
of maximal order modulo a composite number. The second problem concerns finding
efficient discrete logarithm algorithms and efficient algorithms for factoring
large numbers. The principal investigator and his colleagues have built a
special purpose computer for implementing his quadratic sieve algorithm for
factoring large integers. He will study the practical aspects of implementing on
this and other computers linear and cubic sieve algorithms which are promising
practical methods and he will also attempt to find new methods, especially for
the discrete logarithm problem. The third problem concerns elliptic curves over
finite fields and their applications to primality testing. It is hoped that a
polylog algorithm for constructing an elliptic curve with a prescribed order
modulo a given prime can be found. This is known from a result of the principal
investigator to give a polylog primality test. This research is in the area of
computational number theory with a heavy concentration on algorithms for
factoring integers and testing whether they are primes.
