This is the first year of a three-year continuing CAREER award. This project is
developing computer algorithms that find object boundaries in CCD camera images
using cues other than changes in average grey-scale intensity: color, texture,
and stereo. Intensity edge finding is complicated by slopes and boundaries
within regions, caused by shading. These effects are much smaller for non-
intensity features, particularly color. In the presence of texture, non-
intensity features may offer comparable spatial resolution. Techniques are being
developed for computing each feature with low noise and at high-spatial
resolution. Better opponent color values can be produced by modifying the
framegrabber interface. Several broadly-tuned energy operators are being
evaluated for use as texture features. Preattentive stereo information can be
computed using a narrow-range matcher or by meauring the degree of fusion with
texture energy operators. The comparative reliability of different cues is being
assessed. Finally, boundaries can be extracted using a new robust estimation
technique and used as input to existing shape analysis and attentive texture
identification algorithms.
