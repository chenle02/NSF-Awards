Continuing the high quality of science education which historically has been
provided by the small liberal arts colleges of this country will require serious
consideration of the problems now being faced by the administrations, faculties
and departments of these institutions. The National Science Board's recent
report on Undergraduate Science and Engineering Education states that "Serious
problems, especially problems of quality, have developed during the past decade
in the infrastructure of college-level education in mathematics, engineering,
and the sciences." This conference focuses on fostering collaboration among
institutions as one method of addressing these problems, capitalizing on the
increased resources and diversity which could be provided through cooperative
programs. The conference will address problems now affecting the undergraduate
science curriculum. Too often these complex problems are given a simplistic
diagnosis and routine prescription: more time, more equipment, better students.
In contrast to that approach, this conference will raise questions about
undergraduate science education aimed toward provoking discussions of new
cooperative approaches and new answers. Conference participants will be drawn
from 25-30 institutions representing a broad range of geography, institutional
types, etc. An administrator and a faculty member will comprise a team from
each. The conference will be held in November, 1986 with a schedule beginning on
a Thursday evening with a banquet and keynote address, followed by 1 1/2 days of
conference activities. The conference format will invoke three Sessions: Session
1 (The Issues) - A plenary session in which questions concerning faculty,
physical facilities and curricular strategies will be raised by a group of
panelists with experience in the cooperative programs conducted by Five
Colleges, Inc. This will be followed by small group sessions led by one or two
of the panelists in which agreement on precise descriptions of the problem in
each area will be sought. Session 2 (Collaboration) - Demonstrations and
discussions of Five Colleges, Inc. cooperative programs will be the focus -
including cross- registration, faculty exchanges, and joint appointments. This
will be followed by small group discussions led by Five Colleges, Inc. faculty.
Session 3 (Strategies and Solutions) - The workshop discussions of the previous
session will continue in greater depth. The final activity will involve a
plenary session devoted to further discussion of the problems defined earlier
and how cooperation might address them. In order to reach a wider audience, a
conference report will be prepared for dissemination to colleges around the
country.
