The late Iron Age site of Kelheim, located at the confluence of the Altmuhl and
Danube rivers in Bavaria, Germany, covers an area of approximately 600 hectares
of land and is enclosed by a wall about 3300 meters long. It provides mute
testimony to the size and complexity of European "cities" which existed before
Julius Caesar and his Roman legions marched northward and conquered large
portions of Western Europe. While archaeologists have known for some time that
such indigenous sites existed little is understood about how they developed and
functioned. This project, under the direction of Dr. Peter Wells, will shed new
light on this process. Following a preliminary season of excavation, Dr. Wells
and his colleagues will now conduct an additional two field seasons of work at
Kelheim. They will open broad horizontal areas to expose structural and
artifactual remains. They will analyze the artifacts they recover, as well as
associated floral and faunal materials. Large heaps of iron slag indicate that
large scale metal production was carried out, and the team's research will also
focus on this. Slag and iron samples will be collected and subjected to
laboratory analysis to provide insight into the manufacturing process.
Archaeologists wish to know how these early sites were organized and the extent
to which a strong central authority existed. By examination of the spatial
distribution of activities across the site as well as the degree of
standardization of manufactured remains, this question can be addressed. This
research is important for several reasons. It will provide additional
information on a little-understood aspect of European prehistory. It will shed
new light on how complex societies such as our own first arose and were
maintained. Finally, it will contribute to the training of several graduate
students.
