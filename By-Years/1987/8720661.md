This project undertakes to produce the first neo-classical economic history of
seventeenth-century Russia. It also is the first Russian economic history to
study closely the link of society and the legal structure of the economy. Russia
was primarily an oral society well into the sixteenth century. Massive
destruction of those documents which were created has made detailed study of
Russian history prior to 1611 (the "Great Fire of Moscow") difficult. Previous
neo-classical attempts at Russian economic history began no earlier than l700,
the reign of Peter the Great, as summarized in Arcadius Kahan's work on the
eighteenth-century Russian economy. This study is based in part on the gathering
and analysis of 15,000 prices and wages in the social context of their
transactors. More than 1200 different commodities are in the study. Price
indices show that the price level was falling for the majority of commodities.
This was especially true for imported goods and substitutes manufactured in
Russia, a process that began in the 1630s and accelerated in the 1650s as Russia
became increasingly integrated into the European market. The result was a rise
of real incomes. The picture of a non-stagnant economic structure that emerges
from the data belies the traditional nature of 17th century Russian society and
the relatively unfavorable legal climate that prevailed. The study seeks to
analyze the mainsprings of development that were at work and to delineate and
better understand the shifting balance between stagnation and change.
