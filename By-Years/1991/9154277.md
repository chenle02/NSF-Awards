The one-week workshop on lasers and their application to solving chemical
problems providing exposure to both the theory and practical application of
laser technology to all branches of chemistry for 15 chemistry faculty. The
course will includes: (1) lectures on the fundamentals of lasers and related
topics, (2) laboratory experiments to illustrate the principles presented in
lectures, (3) lectures and laboratory experiments dealing with current
applications of lasers to chemically interesting problems, and (4) an
opportunity to engage in a special project of interest to the participant, the
technology of which will be transportable to the participant's home institution.
