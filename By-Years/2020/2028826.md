The water wettability of a solid surface is usually changed either by using a
different material for the solid surface or by coating the surface. However,
research over the past eight years has shown that water can (at least partially)
“see through” an atomic-thick layer of a material such as graphene, giving rise
to so-called “wetting transparency” effect. This finding provides a unique
opportunity for designing multi-functional devices since it means that the
wettability of an atomic-thick film can be tuned by selecting an appropriate
supporting substrate. The picture becomes even more appealing if the substrate
is a liquid, since one can readily change the liquid underneath the graphene,
thereby providing real-time control of the wettability, a capability that would
be very useful for water harvesting of moisture from the air and in droplet
microfluidics devices. The research objectives of this project are to use
experiments and computational simulations to understand the mechanisms of
wetting transparency of graphene on liquid substrates and to demonstrate the
real-time control of surface wettability. This project will promote the interest
and participation in research from K-12 to graduate students in many ways, e.g.,
by providing research training to graduate and undergraduate students,
developing new courses, and conducting outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will integrate experimental and computational efforts to
pursue two specific aims. First, how liquid substrates affect the wettability of
graphene will be uncovered by investigating how molecular mobility, charge
doping, polarization, and dispersion interactions impact the wetting
transparency. Second, the range of wettability modulation as well as the
mechanical robustness of floating graphene will be enhanced, and the real-time
manipulation of the wettability will be demonstrated. The nature of wetting
transparency of graphene on liquid substrates will be elucidated, and a state-
of-the-art force field, including charge-flow polarization and many-body
dispersion, will be constructed and utilized to compute the wettability of
floating graphene and to establish the relative importance of various types of
interactions for the wetting transparency. Using liquid as the supporting
substrate opens a new dimension for designing devices with real-time wettability
control, which is highly desirable in water harvesting, biomedical devices, heat
exchange, micro reactors and chemical separation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
