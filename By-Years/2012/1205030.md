This proposal aims to investigate several aspects of the interplay between
combinatorics and representation theory. First, the PI will investigate the
enumerative cyclic sieving phenomenon introduced by Reiner, Stanton, and White
as it applies to combinatorial actions on the cluster complexes of Fomin and
Zelevinsky as well as actions on tableaux arising from the theory of crystals.
The PI will use objects from representation theory such as Kazhdan-Lusztig bases
and cluster algebras to investigate these combinatorial problems. Second, the PI
will investigate connections between hyperplane arrangements and the Hilbert
series of certain rings related to the diagonal coinvariant
module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enumeration of objects in a finite set is the
fundamental problem of combinatorics and has many scientific applications
outside of pure mathematics. Symmetry groups were introduced by the ancient
Greeks and are the primary motivation for the study of representation theory.
So, the study of enumeration up to symmetry is of paramount importance in
combinatorial representation theory and algebraic combinatorics. This project
uses representation theory to indirectly count the elements of finite sets,
yielding a deeper and more elegant understanding of their enumeration.
