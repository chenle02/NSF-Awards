9703691 Pitman Recent work of the principal investigator and co-authors has made
connections between random partitions, random discrete distributions, random
trees, and the lengths of excursions of Brownian motion and other stochastic
processes. The present project continues the study of these relations and their
applications. Sheth's model for gravitational clustering of galaxies leads to
problems related to the additive coalescent in which each pair of sets in a
partition of a finite set is merging at a rate which is the sum of the sizes of
the two sets. Asymptotics of this additive coalescent define a discrete measure
valued process which can be constructed by cutting Aldous's continuum random
tree at points of a suitable Poisson process. It is proposed to study this and
other measure-valued Markov processes which model coalescent phenomena, and to
look for novel applications of these processes. Brownian motion provides the
doundation of the modern theory of continuous time random processes with
continuous paths, and has applications in fields as diverse as physics and
mathematical finance. Random partitions find applications to combinatorics,
physics and genetics. Statistical models for physical processes of coalescence
and fragmentation are of interest in a number of fields. The evolution of a
partition of particles into clumps can be variously interpreted, for example, as
a partition of atoms into molecules, a partition of molecules into polymers, or
a partition of stars into galaxies. In a chemical setting, atoms coalesce to
form molecules, and molecules coalesce to form polymers. In a cosmological
setting, stars coalesce to form galaxies. The proposed research focuses on
models for an irreversible process of coalescence of a partition of a continuum
with finite total mass into a finite or countable collection of sub-masses, with
conservation of mass.
