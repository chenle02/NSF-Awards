Saleh This research is on simulation techniques and modeling approaches for
analog circuits. Accuracy of the analysis is the key goal. High-level modeling
approaches are being developed for functional blocks in the circuits that
improve the overall efficiency of simulation. Software is being developed that
checks for the integrity and robustness of new macro-model primitives before
they are used in a simulation. A consistency checking and optimization tool is
being used to verify and correct the performance of a given parameterized macro-
model. The new models and algorithms are being integrated into a multi- level
analog simulation tool that includes the ability to perform circuit level,
functional level and behavior level simulation within one simulation run.
Circuits considered include sigma- delta modulators, phase-locked loops, and
switched capacitor circuits among others.
