This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University to acquire
a CCD area detector diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) extended metal arrays with
paramagnetic centers, (2) electride structures and properties, (3) exploratory
synthesis of metal chalcogenide compounds, (4) magneto-structural studies of
layered vanadyl phosphates and phosphonates, and (5) reactions of transition
metal anions with haloboranes. The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate
and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule.
The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and
bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
