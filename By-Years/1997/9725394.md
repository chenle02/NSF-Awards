9725394 Meurer Crystals that nucleate and grow in magma chambers can separate
from the liquid and accumulate on the chamber floor. This process, termed
fractional crystallization, is of fundamental importance in the study of igneous
rocks. Rocks formed by the accumulation of crystals are called cumulates and
provide a record of how fractional crystallization proceeds. Cumulates host
significant economic minerals deposits including platinum group metals, chromium
ore, and copper-and nickel-sulfides. The bulk of the ocean crust and most of the
moon are also made of cumulates. During slow cooling, accumulated crystals can
undergo compaction driven by the density contrast between the crystals and
interstitial liquid. Compaction can expel liquid from the crystal pile or simply
redistribute it within it. During compaction, recrystallization may take place
changing the shape of grains and allowing them to pack more efficiently. Modern
computer technology now allows quantitative textural study of cumulates. This
study will provide the first large scale analysis that combines both chemical
and textural data. By documenting the consequences of compaction we will further
our understanding of fractional crystallization and hence the formation of
cumulates and the mineral resources they host on the Earth and moon.
