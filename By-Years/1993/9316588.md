This research is developing a new and significantly better method for the design
of a wide variety of digital filters. The new method is based on a successive
approximation algorithm called Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS). One
form of IRLS, Lawson's algorithm, has been used before but not extensively
because of slow and inconsistent convergence. Initial results with the new
method using a second order IRLS with a form of path- following or homotopy
modification have produced a robust, quadratically converging, efficient,
versatile filter design technique. The method finds general L^p approximations
with 1<=p. It also allows different criteria in different bands for the design
of mixed criteria optimal filters. The new method solves, not only the standard
filter design problems, but many that the Parks- McClellan Remez algorithm or
windowed least wquares will not. Initial results on designing with constrained
L^p criteria, complex approximation, and two dimensions show great promise.
Robust convergence is crucial for the practical success of any iterative
algorithm. We feel that we have a potential breakthrough on that issue. This
research is doing a theoretical analysis of the convergence for the more general
optimization criteria, developing a practical adaptive filter design program,
and presenting it in a form accessible to the practicing engineer. The algorithm
will be applied to three filter design problems: a) the constrained least-
squares and, more generally, the constrained L^p approximation problem. This is
often what people really want when they use a straight Chebyshev or window
design. b) The important problems of complex approximation which is important in
equalization adaptive filter design. c) The multidimensional filter design and
image processing problems. This new approach shows excellent promise and a
possible great improvement over present techniques.
