Abstract Lisan

The aim of this project is to pursue preliminary investigations into the study
of dynamical systems or flows via algebraic (semigroup) approaches. It is
anticipated that a regular proposal for an NSF grant will be submitted
subsequent to this planning project. The study of dynamical systems has received
considerable attention through out this century, and this interest has
mushroomed in recent years with topics like chaos, turbulence, fractals and
stability. One particular approach to the theory of dynamical systems is the
field of topological dynamics. Although significant amount of literature exists
on the subject, algebraic (semigroup) approaches have, however had limited usage
in the area of topological dynamics. The proposer feels that these approaches
give more insights into the field and that there is richer theory waiting to be
developed. Some of the groundwork has already been laid out in this direction.
The proposer and J. Lawson have investigated transitive flows and have shown
that these flows reduce to the study of closed left congruences on the universal
compactification of the acting semigroup and that the minimal flows are the
corresponding quotients of a minimal left ideal in the universal
compactification. Important notions of distality and proximality are also
studied via factorization of these congruences.
