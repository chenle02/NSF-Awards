Wide-bandgap semiconductors such as beta-silicon carbide (B-SiC) have the
potential to be useful in the fabrication of electronic devices that can operate
at high temperature and high power levels in corrosive environments. Such
devices currently under consideration include MESFET, IMPATT diode, and bipolar
transistors. These devices are commonly fabricated from silicon or gallium
arsenide and are used at microwave and millimeterwave frequencies. The results
of simulations indicate that B-Sic has considerable promise for use in
microwave-power MESFETs, with an RF output power capability greater than can be
obtained with any of the commonly used semiconductors. A properly designed and
fabricated B-Sic MESFET should be capable of producing about four times the
microwave RF output power capability of a comparable GaAs MESFET. Chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) techniques have been primarily
used to date as the method for growth of B-SiC. Neither of these processes,
however, lends itself to the economical production of large single crystals from
which wafers can be obtained. In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to
utilize vacuum liquid phase epitaxy (VLPE) to grow B-SiC.
