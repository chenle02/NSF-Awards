This project will extend the materials developed under the Math and the Mind's
Eye project (MDR 840371). By drawing upon capacity for visual thinking using
manipulatives, models, sketches, and diagrams, students develop an understanding
of mathematical concepts and create meaningful mental images that help them
retain and recall this information. Presently the materials consist of (1) 335
pages of classroom activities organized into six units, and (2) The Visual
Mathematics Course Guide, volumes I and II, containing 160 sequential lesson
guides based upon the classroom activities. The project will develop volumes III
and IV of the series to cover formulas, functions, graphs and equations, ratio
and similarity, introductory probability, descriptive statistics, and geometric
transformations. When complete, the four volumes will comprise a two to three
year integrated middle school curriculum in mathematics which can be used also
with high school students with limited mathematical backgrounds.
