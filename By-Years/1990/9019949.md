During 1991, the Bureau of the Census will conduct the fifth National Survey of
Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers. This survey series collects
information on the demographic, educational, and employment characteristics of
experienced scientists and engineers. The initial survey was conducted in 1982
and was based on a sample of respondents to the 1980 Decennial Census who
reported occupations in science and engineering. The National Science Foundation
is the principal agency in the Federal Government for data on the U.S.
population of scientists and engineers. The Scientific and Technical Personnel
Data System (STPDS), maintained in the Division of Science Resources Studies, is
the primary means for collection of this information. In addition to the
National Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers, the STPDS
comprises the biennial Survey of Recent Science and Engineering Graduates, the
biennial Survey of Doctorate Recipients, and the Science and Engineering
Tabulating Model, a computer model used to integrate survey results.
