This award is to fund a workshop to explore the impact of the forthcoming
increase in the number of satellites in orbit to ground-based astronomy. The
number of satellites in orbit will increase by several thousand in the coming
few years and may double or triple in the coming decade. These satellites are in
lower-Earth orbit than many of the existing satellites and have found to be
highly reflective in optical wavelengths. This optical brightness will impact
the ability of astronomers to conduct their investigations, especially near
twilight. This workshop will bring together experts in astronomy and the
satellite industry to discuss the challenge and explore solutions, resulting in
a public white paper for the entire community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several
companies have licenses to launch low-Earth orbit non-geosynchronous satellite
constellations of hundreds to thousands of satellites to provide broadband
internet globally. The design and orbital parameters of these satellites has led
to optical reflectivity much brighter than expected, even visible to the naked
eye. Fainter reflections from other NGSO satellites are still expected to be
bright enough to saturate pixels in CCDs, rendering many nighttime images
unusable. These reflections are especially bright at twilight, when optical
ground-based observatories conduct a large portion of the near-Earth object
observations (e.g. potentially hazardous asteroids). These NGSO constellations
are being built-out and satellites launched at the same time optical and
infrared astronomy is moving to deep and wide field-of-view surveys. This
workshopâ€™s purpose is to quantify the scope of the problem and to bring together
experts to discuss potential mitigation strategies for the coming
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
