Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project implements the concept of
higher-order discovery experiments (DEXS) into the chemistry curriculum,
enhancing conceptual learning of chemistry. This involves modification of
existing expository experiments, adaptation of new discovery experiments from
the literature, and the creation of virtual computer-simulated discovery
experiments. The project involves eight general chemistry, introductory
chemistry, and organic chemistry laboratory courses and honors courses in
general and organic chemistry. The model is also extended to upper-level
chemistry courses , non-science major laboratory courses, and the Pre-Collegiate
Development program for minority students who are planning to attend a college
or university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coupling discovery-based experiments with
inquiry/problem-based experiments (tandem experiments) enhances conceptual
understanding and critical reasoning skills and increases student interest and
involvement in the laboratory. The laboratory transformation leads to additional
team building and cooperation among the faculty who construct the program and
who instruct the lecture courses that accompany the laboratory sections.
Materials are available on CD, web pages and in publications.
