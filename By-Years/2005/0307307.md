This project will develop a linked series of 3D hydrodynamic and chemical models
for the impact, plume blowout, and plume flight/splash phases of the Shoemaker-
Levy 9 (SL9) events. These models will advect tracer particles, whose
temperature (T) and pressure (p) histories will drive chemical and grain models.
Chemical and grain results will be re-inserted into the splash model to
calculate realistic light curves and impact-site images. Several investigations
will be carried out with the models, which will run on a small cluster
supercomputer. The model is required for full interpretation of the puzzling SL9
data, and will yield basic information about Jupiter's atmosphere and comet
composition. The models will test theories for the expanding rings seen by the
Hubble Space Telescope.

This work has a very broad impact. It is the first observationally-constrained
3D radiative-hydrodynamic chemical model of all phases of a cometary impact. The
models and model grids will be archived with the Planetary Data System so that
they will be quickly available for use in planning observations of the next
impact, be it 10 or 500 years from now. The models will make predictions for the
Cassini mission. Public interest in impacts is high, so results will appear in
both the scientific literature and in popular science magazines. ***
