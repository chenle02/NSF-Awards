This grant supports travel funding for early career and/or underrepresented
groups to attend the 11th Light and Color in Nature Conference. For 34 years,
researchers have been gathering at approximately three-year intervals to share
the latest results of their investigations into optical phenomena observed in
nature. These meetings are truly special occasions where topics from rigorous
mathematical theories of halo formation to the existence of rainbows in ancient
Native American art are discussed. The topics addressed at these meetings
include, but are not entirely limited to, the following: Rainbows, ice crystal
halos, glories, coronas, iridescence, sky color, atmospheric visibility,
refraction effects, contrast phenomena, noctilucent clouds, optics of lightning,
auroras, colors created by absorption and scattering in water and air, color and
light in water and on water surfaces, iridescence and colors in biology and
geology. These meetings have been particularly successful at motivating archival
research papers and popular articles, films, and books on the subject of optics
in nature. Each meeting is followed by a Light and Color in the Open Air feature
issue of the Journal of the Optical Society of America or Applied Optics.
