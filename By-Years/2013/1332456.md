This project seeks to further develop a proprietary rapid supercritical
extraction (RSCE) method for aerogel fabrication. Aerogels are unique nanoporous
materials with remarkable properties that make them beneficial for a number of
applications such as insulating materials, windows, sensors and catalytic
converters. However, aerogels are not widely available or widely used due to the
complex and expensive methods currently used to produce them. The research team
has developed a rapid supercritical extraction (RSCE) technique. The method
utilizes a confined mold in an automated hydraulic hot press. The method is
advantageous for the following reasons: (a) it can be easily automated; (b) it
is relatively fast; (c) it is environmentally friendlier than other methods; (d)
it minimizes the use of solvents and (e) it is potentially less expensive than
other methods. This I-Corps project plans to determine whether its proprietary
RSCE method is ready for application out of the laboratory and to identify any
barriers to achieving this transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerogels have
potential applications in a number of areas that foster sustainability. As
thermal insulators in building materials aerogels can be used to improve energy
efficiency. Catalytic aerogel materials could eliminate the use of rare precious
metals in the cleanup of automotive exhaust. The RSCE method itself provides an
environmentally friendlier method for producing aerogels and the method is
suitable to scale up and large-scale production of these materials.
