The goal of this research is, based on our initial success, to continue
investigating and developing ultra-high speed metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM)
photodetectors that have a sub-100nm finger spacing and finger width, operate
with a sub- picosecond response time and a tera-hertz cut-off frequency, and can
detect a broad range of wavelengths from visible to infrared. The proposed
research will focus on the following four aspects: (1) Fabricate tera-hertz MSM
photodetectors with sub-100nm finger spacing and finger width using ulta-high
resolution electron beam lithography, initially on GaAs, and later
InGaAs,InGaP,SOI (Si on insulator), and Si-Ge for different response
wavelengths. (2) Investigate experimentally and theoretically the factors that
can increase the detectors' speed and sensitivity. (3) Investigate the dynamic
performance of the MSM photodetectors using femto-second pulsed lasers. And (4)
use the ulta-high speed MSM detectors as a vehicle to study ballistic transport
of electrons and holes between a sub-100nm finger spacing and in a high electric
field, particularly carrier velocity overshoots, and explore their application
on improvement of detectors' speed.
