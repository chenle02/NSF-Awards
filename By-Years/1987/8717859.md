The research is in the area of multivariate estimation. The first project is
estimation of multivariate normal covariance matrix. A strategy for correcting
the eigenvalue distortion will be followed. Solutions of some optimization
problems will circumvent the inadequacies of invariant Bayes estimators and the
Stein estimator. Other topics include the estimation of discriminant
coefficients and the development of principal components within the context of
discriminant analysis. Discrete analogues of the methods in the first project
will be used to estimate several Poisson means. The principal investigator has a
record of some of the best existing work in this area. He will continue to
pursue his ideas.
