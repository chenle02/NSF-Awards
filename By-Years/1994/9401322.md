9401322 Richards Richards will continue his research on hypergeometric functions
defined on matrix spaces and symmetric cones, with special attention to be paid
to developing the theory of operator-valued hypergeometric functions on
symmetric cones. This research is in the area of analysis on symmetric spaces.
The main objective is to develop a theory of special functions similar to the
classical case of special functions defined on domains in complex n-dimensional
space. ***
