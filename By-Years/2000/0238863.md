This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will implement a
software system that allows domain experts to specify programs that transform
unstructured or partially structured data from a variety of document sources,
such as World Wide Web sites, PDF files, and text into structured, coherent, and
readily usable information. The system will consist of a set of tightly
integrated syntactic and semantics-driven data extraction technologies that are
managed from a graphical user interface. The goal will be to retrieve
information that was created for human understandability, and work with it to
create knowledge that can support automated decision-making and transactions.
The system will empower users, who are knowledgeable about their application
domains but are not necessarily trained as computing technologists, to rapidly
structure data into knowledge. The Phase II implementation effort will build
upon the results from the Phase I feasibility study to produce a fully
functional system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase III will make the system
commercially available to clients with diverse business interests including
content aggregation, e-procurement, ERP, and supply chain management
vendors.&lt;br/&gt;
