(mathematical) This proposal is concerned with the analytic theory of
automorphic forms. Specifically the study of the size of a general automorphic
L-function on the critical line and the size of an eigenfunction on an
arithmetic locally symmetric space .In both cases the main goal is to establish
a subconvex estimate . In the first case the sharpest form of such an estimate
would follow from the Grand Riemann Hypothesis .However many of the desired
applications of such estimates only require subconvexity. The applications are
varied ,one such being the recent subconvex estimate by Cogdell,Piatetsky-
Shapiro and the proposer which allows for the resolution of Hilbert's 11th
problem on the representation of integers by quadratic forms in a number
field.Other applications are to problems in mathematical physics ,specifically
the behavior of quantum states in quantizations of classically chaotic systems.
The second problem of the size of an eigenfunction on such locally symmetric
spaces is closely associated with the first and the proposal is concerned with
understanding this more difficult problem.It constitutes a generalization of the
Ramanujan conjectures.

(general): The proposal is concerned with the study of special types of
geometric spaces which are defined via arithmetic and number theoretic
constructions. This has been an active area of investigation for the last 60 or
so years ,primarily since it carries some of the most powerful tools that we
know in number theory (to diophantine problems as well as ones associated with
prime numbers). Specifically the seemingly technical issues that are being
investigated have applications to resolve some simple well known problems in
number theory. One such is one of Hilbert's problems from 1900 concerning which
numbers are sums of 3 integer squares in an extention of the ordinary whole
numbers to integers in a number field. Other applications of this theory are
perhaps less traditional and are to Mathematical Physics,specifically Quantum
Chaos. These spaces provide one of the few (in fact the only one) classically
chaotic Hamiltonian systems whose quantization can be satisfactorally studied
mathematically. The techniques to do so are number theoretic and the results are
often quite surprizing.
