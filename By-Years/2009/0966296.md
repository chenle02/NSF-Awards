A goal of the Achievement Scholarship Program (ASP) program is to increase the
number of well-educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national
need. An emphasis on students from the Four Corners area, especially Native
Americans, is important to the continued growth and development of this region.
To achieve the goal of increasing the number of well qualified US citizens in
technical areas the following objectives are central to ASP.&lt;br/&gt;Objective
1: Increase the number of students graduating in engineering, physics, and
math.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2: Provide 15 scholarships per year to financially
needy, academically talented students who meet the academic criteria and show a
strong potential to be a successful graduate.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3: Provide
academic mentoring, cohort activities, and support services that enable ASP
Scholars to successfully complete their undergraduate
degree.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 4: Improve workforce integration by strengthening
partnerships between the College and industry partners throughout the Four
Corners Region.
