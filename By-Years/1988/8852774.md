Fourier transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is being incorporated
into the chemistry program. Acquisition of the instrument is modernizing the way
NMR is taught in the laboratories associated with Physical, Organic, and
Analytical Chemistry as well as the course for nonscience majors. In addition
the Instrumental Chemistry and Spectroscopy lecture courses and the student
research program are being impacted. The acquisition is consistent with the
department's effort to provide state-of-the-art instrumentation for both the
year long and summer student research program. On average since 1980, thirty-six
chemistry majors (35% women) graduate yearly from the program with 20% going on
to graduate school. Since almost all of the undergraduates enroll in research
courses and are utilizing the instrument, it is having a positive impact on the
continued competence of the chemistry majors. The grantee is matching the award
from non-Federal sources.
