In a cooperative study with Colorado School Mines the effects of implantation of
very large concentrations of ions on friction and wear properties will be
evaluated. The microstructure, microhardness, residual surface stresses and
tribological behavior of ferrous surfaces, which have been implanted with up to
20 atomic percent of nitrogen, oxygen, boron and/or carbon, will be determined
and correlated with processing variables.
