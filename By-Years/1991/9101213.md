This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry at Colorado State
University to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The
program in Molecular Biosciences will enable qualified undergraduates to spend a
summer doing independent research projects in a range of areas and using a
variety of experimental approaches. Biochemistry/molecular biology employs the
methods of chemistry, physics, cellular biology, microbiology, and genetic
manipulation to study the structure and function of complex biomolecules, how
these molecules generate the phenomenon we call life, and how alterations in
these molecules perturb the living organism. Because of its breadth,
biochemistry/molecular biology serves to integrate didactic and experiential
material learned in a multitude of basic science courses. The REU program is
designed to ?a! offer the participants a wide variety of research areas from
which to choose an independent studies project; ?b! offer project areas that are
meaningful and exciting to the student; ?c! teach the student how to formulate
and test hypotheses; ?d! help develop the ability to trouble-shoot and problem-
solve when confronted with the unexpected; ?e! instruct the participant in
state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation of biochemistry/molecular
biology; ?f! develop the ability to communicate with one's peers concerning
ongoing research efforts as well as more formal presentations of completed
research projects; and, ?g! provide, in CSU faculty and in outside scientists
invited to speak to the REU students, role models that will reinforce the
intellectual excitement of a scientific career.
