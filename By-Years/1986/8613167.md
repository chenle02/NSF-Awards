Production of high volume biologically active compounds imortant in animal
health, food processing, and human health require large bioractor ovolumes.
Consequently, scale-up of downstream processing steps become an increasingly
important factor. Examples include insulin, human and animal growth hormones,
and selected classes of antibiotics. Key areas in bioseparations include
adsorptive and chromatiographic separations and these form the focus of this
research. Fundamental data bases and scale-up protocols for adsorptive and
chromatographic purification of fermentation-derived molecules are generally
lacking relative to other bioseparation processes. The goal of this research
program is to expand the knowledge base of process chromatography and adsorption
to promote its use on a large scale.
