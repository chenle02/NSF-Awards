9625683 HANSELL WEATHERBIRD II is a general purpose research vessel owned and
operated by the Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Inc. The 1996 schedule
for R/V WBII has a total of 170 operating days, of which 148 are in support of
NSF-sponsored research. The vessel operates mainly off the coast of Bermuda.
Bermuda is the site of one of the two U.S. JGOFS funded time- series stations,
the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). This program is scheduled for 99
days and is in the third year of a five year program. Additional programs
conduct research on an ancillary basis on the BATS cruises. In addition to BATS
the WBII will support the biweekly Hydrostation S sampling program, which has
been conducted for the past 40 years. The WBII is part of the UNOLS fleet that
supports oceanographic research. These vessels do not operate in the same manner
as general cargo or fishing vessels. NSF supports the operation of a variety of
these vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research and operated by
universities and research institutes around the country.
