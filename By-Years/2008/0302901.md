The Education Development Center is continuing the development of a common
approach to the teaching and learning of information technology (IT)
applications across the sixteen career clusters defined by the U. S. Department
of Education. The first phase begun under NSF award 0101703 undertook work in
six clusters: 1) Transportation/Distribution/Logistics; 2) Manufacturing; 3)
Education/Training; 4) Science/Technology/Engineering/Mathematics; 5) Health; 6)
Agriculture/Food/Natural Resources. Phase two is developing materials for the
following four clusters: 1) Law/Public Safety/Security; 2)
Architecture/Construction; 3) Arts/Audio-Visual/Communication Technology; 4)
Hospitality/Tourism. A set of four web-based IT Applications Resource Guides to
enhance instruction in community and technical college programs is also being
developed.
