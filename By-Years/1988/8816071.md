The objectives of this research are to study the physics of fatigue (by
experimental analyses and development of predictive models based on the
cumulative damage concept) and corrosion enhanced fatigue (based on interaction
of a passive surface film with the localized deformation which occurs at and
near surfaces during the fatigue process). The planned load-controlled
cumulative damage studies will include single crystal and polycrystalline
copper. The corrosion/fatigue studies will examine the
electrochemical/mechanical behavior of passive surface films using 316L
stainless steel as the model system. This research will involve extensive
scanning and transmission electron microscopy and mechanical testing (under a
series of polarization potentials) studies.
