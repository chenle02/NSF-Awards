Devarajan Thirumalai of the University of Maryland is supported by an award from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry division for studies that discover
new principles governing the folding of larger proteins under conditions that
more closely mimic the cellular environment. These studies span a wide range of
scales, from the single molecule to chaperone-assisted rescue of substrate
proteins. Particular problems include 1) understanding single molecule
spectroscopy; 2) examining folding and kinetics of peptides under confinement,
3) modeling the effects of crowding on protein folding and 4) simulating
chaperonin-assisted folding. In order to solve these problems Thirumalai uses a
variety of theoretical and computational methods. They include ideas from
statistical mechanics, principles of polymer and colloid science, and novel
simulation methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is addressing one of the
central challenges of modern biology: to understand the physics and dynamics of
large molecules such as proteins in a living cell. Thirumalai's work is expected
to provide a conceptual framework for understanding how proteins fold. The
outcome of the researches will set the stage for providing a quantitative and
integrated picture of folding and dynamics with potential applications to a
number of other topics including protein-protein and protein-RNA association.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program in a co-funding arrangement with the
Molecular Biophysics Program and with the Physics of Living Systems Program.
