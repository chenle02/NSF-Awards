Bacterial invasion of crop plants is a major cause of economic damage. Plant
breeders have for a long time attempted to develop cultivars that are resistant
to phytopathogenic bacteria. The objective of this proposal is to apply modern
genetic engineering to achieve the same aim. Specifically, the approach is to
express a lysozyme of high specific activity in a plant and thus render it
resistant to bacterial infection. The gene of hen egg-white lysozyme is selected
for manipulation. An intronless version of this gene has been shown to be
expressible in yeast. In Phase I the concentration of hen egg-white lysozyme
required to lyse several species of phytopathogenic bacteria under physiological
conditions will be determined. If the results indicate that hen egg-white
lysozyme is effective at a concentration that is expected to be achievable
through transformation and expression in a plant, then Phase II support will be
requested to insert the lysozyme gene into the genome of tobacco and the
transformants tested for resistance to a series of a bacterial pathogens.
