The principal investigator will map, sample, and make a mineralogic-petrologic-
geochemical-isotopic study of selected plutonic and volcanic rocks in north
Luzon, Philippines. The purpose is to determine the chemical and isotopic
compositions of four distinct increments of crustal rocks that have led to the
progressive transformation from basaltic island arc crust to more highly evolved
crust. The investigation will address the question of whether the Luzon arc
systems formed largely from melts of the mantle wedge above subduction zones,
followed by modification via assimilation zone-refining of the arc crust, plus
fractional crystallization, resulting later in the production of more granitic
compositions. This area offers a unique opportunity for geologists to trace the
early stages of crustal evolution of a microcontinent.
