This research will focus on understanding and modelling the fundamental
mechanisms governing the finite strain, multiaxial deformation of polymers.
Physically-based constitutive models developed in this research will be used in
conjunction with the nonlinear finite element method to enable the numerical
simulation of thermo-mechanically coupled deformation processing. Simulations
which compute the evolution of material state with processing parameters such as
straining, deformation rate and temperature can be used to manufacture products
with specially tailored properties and to define efficient paths to achieve
those properties. Furthermore, the potential of closed-loop control to further
enhance processing will be investigated where current information of material
state (e.g. stress, strain, temperature, strength, orientation) will be used as
feedback parameters to determine the remaining processing path in numerical
simulations.
