This project focuses on organizing a 2-day international conference entitled
Conference on resampling methods and high dimensional data at the Texas A & M
university, College Station, TX, March 25-26, 2010. The conference provides a
unique platform for bringing together researchers working in two cutting edge
areas of current research in statistics, namely, Resampling methods for complex
data structures and Inference for high dimensional data, in order to facilitate
the exchange of research ideas on the two topics and to further the development
of these booming fields. The meeting is co-sponsored by the National Institute
of Statistical Sciences and by the Section on Nonparametric Statistics, American
Statistical Association. The conference has an international program committee
chaired by Professors S.N. Lahiri (Texas A & M), and an Advisory Committee,
consisting of Professors R.J. Carroll (Texas A & M), Bradley Efron (Stanford),
and Hans R. KÂ¨unsch (ETH, Zurich, Switzerland).

The two-day conference Conference on resampling methods and high dimensional
data brings together top and junior researchers to define and expand the
research frontiers of two highly active research areas of statistics and
probability that deal with complex data structures. There are a number of areas
of science and engineering, such as bio-informatics, brain imaging,
econometrics,electrical engineering, finance, meteorology, etc., where such data
appear frequently and which directly benefit from advances in these topics. The
funding provides support for selected groups of participants including graduate
students, minorities, and young researchers who can not attend the conference
otherwise, thereby promoting human resource development.
