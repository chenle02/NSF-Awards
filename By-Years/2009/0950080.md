The primary scientific objective of this project is to unravel how elevated
atmospheric carbon dioxide, nitrogen pollution, climate change, sea-level rise
and plant invasion interact to control the sustainability of tidal marsh
ecosystems. The wealth of long-term global change research at the study site
affords an unprecedented comparison of the relative importance of these factors.
This twenty-three year record of global change has shown that effects that
appear important in the short term may be obviated or reversed when longer-term
trends are considered. The central hypothesis is that changes in plant community
composition will mediate the most important effects of global change on
ecosystem sustainability. To address this, the researchers will extend the
record of ongoing global change treatments, continue monitoring ecosystem
response and initiate new experimentation with plant communities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information garnered from the proposed research will
inform management practices aimed at protecting and restoring coastal wetlands.
Tidal wetlands make up the ecological fabric of coastal and estuarine ecosystems
providing ecosystem services such as nourishing food chains, filtering water and
protecting coastal populations. The most important ecosystem endpoint is soil
elevation gain, because tidal marshes must gain soil to keep up with sea-level
rise. Otherwise, the marsh will be converted to open water and the critical
ecosystem services will be irreversibly lost. This interdisciplinary project
will train researchers at all levels and inform the public about the critical
issues of sea level rise and elevated carbon dioxide. Six undergraduate students
will be involved in the project, and the study site hosts thousands of
elementary and high school aged students through intensive science
camps.&lt;br/&gt;
