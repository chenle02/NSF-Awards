9724924 Jorge C. Escalante-Semerena The long-term goal of this project work is
to improve our understanding of procaryotic cell physiology, and to learn more
about how the metabolic web of procaryotes is integrated. For the past several
years the physiology, biochemistry and genetics of vitamin Bl2 biosynthesis and
the vitamin B12-dependent catabolism of ethanolamine (EA) and 1,2-propanediol
(1,2-PDL) have been studied in the enteropathogenic bacterium Salmonella
typhimurium. Observations made during the course of this work, uncovered
features of the catabolism of these poor carbon sources that have important,
global implications for cellular physiology. The studies have discovered that
glutathione (GSH) and DNA polymerase I (Po1I) are required for the utilization
of propionate, EA, and 1,2-PDL. This work established for the first time a link
between GSH, Po1I and cell growth. The unexpected involvement of GSH and Po1I,
brought into focus the serious problems generated when the cell catabolizes
carbon/energy sources such as propionate, EA, or 1,2-PDL. The conclusion reached
by this work was that catabolism of these carbon sources requires cellular
systems to protect both proteins and nucleic acids from reactive metabolic
intermediates. However, to identify damaging intermediates of a pathway, it is
essential to understand its biochemistry. This project will define the
propionate catabolic pathway in S. typhimurium. This work is needed due to the
gap of knowledge of how this bacterium (and other enterics) catabolize
propionate. Recent work suggests that S. typhimurium catabolizes propionate via
a pathway found in yeast, not via the acryloyl-CoA or the vitamin B12-dependent
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase pathways typically found in procaryotes. This project
will begin the biochemical analysis of the functions encoded by the recently
described propionate (prp) catabolism operon, and by the cobB gene which is not
part of the prp operon, but whose product is required for propionate breakdown
in this bacterium. This project will provide a solid foundation for future
studies on the role of metabolic intermediates in the endogenous mutagenic
process, and on the strategies the cell uses to protect proteins and DNA from
damage, a critical issue to cell viability and evolution.
