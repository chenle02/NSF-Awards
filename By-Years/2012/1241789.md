This proposal seeks to improve the educational experience of cyber operations
students around the nation by creating and deploying culturally diverse
educational content in a proven remotely accessible environment, allowing
students and faculty to obtain vital hands-on experience. While several academic
institutions are developing programs dedicated to cyber operations, and many
more are attempting to incorporate materials designed to give students a strong
fundamental understanding of the challenges in this arena, experiential learning
opportunities are currently limited by individual institutional funding; the
need to provide isolated lab infrastructure in which these topics can be safely
studied; and the challenges associated with developing realistic multicultural
scenarios. This CyberCorps: SFS capacity-building proposal seeks to build on the
successful NSF-funded Remotely Accessible Virtualized Environment (RAVE) Project
and a decade of experience at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) in
developing and delivering computer security lab environments and exercises. It
develops cyber operations exercises and makes them available to faculty and
students at institutions around the nation at no charge. This project
incorporates culturally-appropriate virtual machines to extend the realism of
the resulting scenarios which have a consistent format following the NSF-funded
Security Injections @ Towson presentation model. The project uses an external
evaluator specializing in the use of remotely accessible environments.
