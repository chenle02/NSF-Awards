This proposal is to support the travel of 12 American scientists and engineers
to attend and present papers at the International Seminar on Seismic Zonation,
to be held in Guangzhou (Canton), China, from 6 to 10 December 1987. Seismic
zonation, which depends upon the quantitative evaluation of seismic risk, is a
particularly controversial and societally important topic at the present time,
and the international exchange of ideas and experiences is essential. The field
is unusually multidisciplinary in nature, and the American group will be made up
of geologists, seismologists, earthquake engineers, and risk analysts. The State
Seismological Bureau of China will sponsor the Seminar and publish the papers.
