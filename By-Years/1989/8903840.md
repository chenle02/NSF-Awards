A long, almost varved sequence of late Pleistocene-Holocene laminations and
bedding have been identified in the Estancia lake basin in central New Mexico.
Remarkable vertical continutity of laminations and bedding provide a basis for
reconstructing a stratigraphic time-series with decadel, centennial and
millenial resolution. Methods originally applied to varved sediments will be
adapted to reconstruct a time-series based on accumulated thickness of bedding
and laminations and "tuned" with radiocarbon dates. Changes in water volume and
expansion and contraction of the shallow lake are reflected in the rate of
accumulation of clay, calcium carbonate, and eolean influx of gypsum sand. These
parameters will be measured in closely spaced samples, indexed to the
reconstructed time-series, and expressed as sediment flux. Correlation of high-
stand shoreline deposits with basin-center strata will lead to the development
of an advanced hydrologic- climatic model. The project will determine the
feasibility of reconstructing high-resolution stratigraphic records in semi-arid
lacustrine environments and at the same time evaluate the hydrologic- climatic
sensitivity of a potentially important site and sediment record.
