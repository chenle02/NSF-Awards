This proposal by Dr. Lilian Alessa, PI, and Mr. Martin Robards, Co-PI, is to
research the social, cultural and economic vulnerability of isolated, primarily
Alaska Native, communities and to develop a methodology for the integration of
indigenous ecological knowledge with western scientific knowledge. One of the
outcomes of this research will be to inform crucial resource management
decisions in rural indigenous communities.
