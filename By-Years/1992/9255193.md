The Environmental Solutions Program and the Science and Technology Center
working in concert with the Civil/Environmental and Electrical/Computer
Engineering departments at UT Austin will involve approximately 175
undergraduate minority students (35/yr) in a variety of environmental problems
and a broad selection of tasks including synthesis, growth, and analysis of
electronic materials over a five year period. The Academic Year Program will
involve minority students from the College of Engineering at UT- Austin. The
Summer Program will invite students from schools which have a high predominance
of minority groups enrolled, such as Prairie View A&amp;M, Pan American, Texas
A&amp;I, UT San Antonio, UT El Paso, and other campuses that have NSBE, SHPE, or
SWE Chapters. Students chosen for this Research Careers for Minority Scholars
(RCMS) program will participate i state-of-the-art research under faculty
supervision and sponsored by industry or government. These students will meet
weekly with faculty supervisors and bi-weekly as a group to exchange information
and ideas about the progress on their various projects during their semesters of
participation in the program. The research work done by these engineering
students will allow them to receive three hours of research credit for
participation in their RCMS program. Successful conclusion of the student's
activity will include the writing and presentation of a final technical report
of the work that was performed.
