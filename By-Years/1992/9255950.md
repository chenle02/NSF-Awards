Boston University will initiate a six-week, residential, Young Scholars project
in mathematics for 60 students entering the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. The
heart of this summer year program is the experience gained by students through
their individual and collective efforts to solve an assortment of challenging
problems in Number Theory. Students also will study Abstract Algebra, Algebraic
Curves, and Combinatorics. Diverse weekly guest lectures introduce participants
to related scientific fields, philosophical and ethical questions, and career
options in mathematics and science.
