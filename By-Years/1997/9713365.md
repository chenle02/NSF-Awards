*** 9713365 Litke This grant will support the initial development of a system to
study how the retina process and encodes a visual image. This "Retinal Readout
System" will allow the simultaneous detection of signals from thousands of
output cells in live retinal tissue as a visual image is focused on the cells.
The signals from the output neurons will be detected in real- time, in a single
retinal preparation, with all spatial and temporal correlations recorded. This
system will be based, in large part, on technology developed in the field of
high energy physics for the study of short-lived particles: the technology of
silicon microstrip detectors. The silicon detector techniques to implement the
Retinal Readout System include: high-density wire-bonding, custom-designed
analog VLSI readout chips, and fast data acquisition. The specific items to be
developed include a variety of electrode arrays for the detection of the retinal
signals, a prototype VLSI chip (the "Neurochip") for reading out the electrode
arrays, and a fast data acquisition system based on an analog-to-digital
converter module installed in a PC. ***
