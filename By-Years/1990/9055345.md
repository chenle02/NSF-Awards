This project seeks to take advantage of recent work on performance assessment
methods for precollege science and mathematics by applying these advances to
assessments of computer competence and related skills. Performance assessment
tasks in science and math will be examined for their potential in assessing
computer competence, computer literacy, and other computer-related skills. The
proposed project will include a meeting of specialists in performance
assessments, especially in science and mathematics, as well as specialists in
educational computing. The outcomes of this meeting will be formulated into
general recommendations for the assessment community, as well as specific
recommendations for the IEA (International Association for the Evaluation of
Educational Achievement) Computers in Education Study meeting in October, 1990.
