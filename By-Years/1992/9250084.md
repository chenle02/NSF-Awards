The Executive Committee of Project Kaleidoscope is conducting two workshops on
undergraduate science and mathematics facilities, to be held at Lake Forest
College in the summer and fall of 1992. Project Kaleidoscope is an effort to
strengthen science and mathematics at this nation's liberal arts colleges. The
goal of this workshop is to present models for developing effective science and
mathematics facilities so as to: 1) advance the planning process for
undergraduate institutions involved in such construction and renovation
projects; 2) demonstrate how physical space fosters strong programs in science
and mathematics; 3) help undergraduate institutions effectively manage the
planning, design, and construction process in order to control costs and to
realize the building they envisioned. The workshops have been designed in
response to a need expressed by faculty and administrators at undergraduate
institutions for sharing information about the planning and management of new
and renovated space and for sharing successful models. The workshops are based
on two premises of Project Kaleidoscope, namely that: 1) architecture and
facilities must support good teaching and learning; and 2) we must work together
to build on successful models, so that every institution learns form others in
their individual efforts to strengthen their science and mathematics programs.
