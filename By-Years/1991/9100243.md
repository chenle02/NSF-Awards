This two year continuing award supports software capitalization for the
continued development of benchmarks for evaluation of image processing systems.
The tasks include investigation of the performance of new system designs and
design modifications, concentrating on massively parallel architectures and the
"software" image processing systems which run on high-performance workstations
under UNIX, MS/DOS, and Apple Macintosh operating systems; expansion of the
Preston-Seigart benchmark research to include a larger segment of the image
processing community; and conduct of a trend analysis on hardware and software
architectures to determine what areas of image processing research are likely to
produce the most cost-effective platforms. The results of this project will be
fed back to the participating organizations and also disseminated through
professional publications, conference presentations, and liaison with
professional society and industrial standards committees.
