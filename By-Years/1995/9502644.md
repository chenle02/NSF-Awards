In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Lucio Frydman of the
University of Illinois at Chicago will develop and apply new multidimensional
NMR techniques to the analysis of complex solids. These new techniques will rely
on non-Cartesian sampling of time-domain spaces which will shorten the duration
of multidimensional NMR acquisitions and establish new correlations between spin
interactions. These experiments will also focus on new methods of
characterization of quadrupolar spins, which comprise a large majority of
nuclides which play a key role in the structures of inorganic solid materials.
The techniques will be applied to characterization of high performance ceramics
used in the aerospace industry. The educational component of this program
involves integrating state-of-the-art NMR analysis techniques into the
undergraduate curriculum and establishing new courses in the graduate Analytical
Chemistry program aimed at providing students with a practical background
currently demanded by industry. NMR has proven to be a reliable and powerful
diagnostic technique in the biomedical profession. Similar analysis of solids
cannot currently be accomplished due to the different physical interactions in
the solid phase. Professor Frydman will develop techniques that will permit
characterization of solid materials such as high temperature ceramic fibers used
in the aerospace industry.
