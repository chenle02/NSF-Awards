*** 9415084 Addison Central Arkansas University (CAU) is the recipient of funds
from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program for the renovation of research
and research training space in the Lewis Science Center. CAU, formerly a
teaching college, is an undergraduate institution, that became a statewide
university in 1975. In recognition of the importance of research, the
administration has increased its emphasis on research by providing resources for
the renovation of the science center. One of the major limitations to student
involvement in scientific pursuits has been the lack of available space.
Laboratories vacated by the Chemistry Department will be renovated, providing
space to accommodate additional students in research training programs in
Biology and Physics. ARI funds will be used to reconfigure space and equip
laboratories with fixed equipment including fume hoods, sinks, safety showers,
cabinets and benches. The renovation will provide the science facility with
growth chambers, a tissue culture room, a radioisotope laboratory, a
photographic and an experimental dark room and an acoustic laboratory. The
isotope laboratory and radiation materials vault will be upgraded to provide an
isolated room for a neutron howitzer and a vacuum sputtering device. Provisions
will be made to furnish research training space for nuclear and atomic physics.
The electron microscope laboratory will be renovated to provide access
independent of an accelerator and for a clean operating environment. The
modernization of the Lewis Science Center will have a marked effect on the
quality and amount of Biological and Physical research that will be enabled by
the renovation. Not only will students become attracted to the programs, but the
newly renovated space will aid in the recruitment of new research oriented
faculty at CAU. ***
