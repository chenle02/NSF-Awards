9400202 Shemansky The PIs propose to examine theory for the consequences of the
encounter of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with the Jupiter system. The purpose is
twofold: (1) the Jupiter environment may provide a unique insight into the
composition, structure and physical chemistry of SL9 through the expected
enhanced extraction of the atomic and molecular components of the solid into the
magnetosphere through sputtering and desorption in the inner and outer regions,
and heating of the grains in the Io torus, and (2) the transient introduced into
the magnetosphere may be strong enough to allow an unprecedented exploration of
the intrinsic source and diffusive loss processes controlling the undisturbed
planetary system. Predictive abilities include established model codes that are
utilized to calculate the detailed emission properties of atomic and molecular
species excited by physical chemistry as well as the combined direct processes
of electron and photon excitation. ***
