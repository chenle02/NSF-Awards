The main goal of this project is to apply methods from geometric analysis to
study problems arising from general relativity (GR). In the first part of the
project, the PI plans to investigate properties of quasi-local mass in GR. The
research will be based on the PI's previous work with Mu-Tao Wang and Shing-Tung
Yau. The goal is to study the monotonicity and the variational properties of
quasi-local mass. For the second part of the project, the PI plans to
investigate other quasi-local conserved quantities in GR. The PI expects that
the method developed in the study of quasi-local mass will help anchoring the
definition of quasi-local angular momentum and center of mass. In the third part
of the project, the PI plans to investigate geometric inequalities arising from
GR. The PI expects that a good notion of quasi-local mass and angular momentum
will be important in the study of the Penrose inequality and the mass-angular-
momentum inequality. Finally, the PI plans to study gravitational radiation. The
research will be based on PI's previous work with Lydia Bieri and Shing-Tung Yau
on the memory effect where the radiation of gravitational energy is related to
measurement of displacements of test particles. The PI plans to investigate
gravitational radiation using quasi-local mass and to study the role of other
conserved quantities in gravitational radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the
concept of total energy of isolated systems is important in general relativity,
the measurement of mass, momentum or angular momentum contained in a finite
region is essential in many fundamental problems in general relativity. This is
particularly important due to the non-local nature of gravitation. The proposed
research evaluates the energy, momentum or angular momentum contained in any
region of the universe. This allows the study of general relativity in regions
where the gravitational field is strong. As a result, the proposed research will
lead to a better understanding of formation of black holes and the gravitational
radiation during the process.
