Solid-state storage technologies, such as flash, phase-change
memory&lt;br/&gt;and memristors promise large-capacity storage at speeds much
faster&lt;br/&gt;than disk. To date, mainstream use of these technologies has
been as a&lt;br/&gt;replacement for disks, storing a disk-oriented file system.
However,&lt;br/&gt;solid-state storage is and will remain far more expensive
than&lt;br/&gt;disks. Thus, it will often be used as a cache or special-
purpose&lt;br/&gt;store, and not as the main repository of
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops new interfaces to solid-state
storage that&lt;br/&gt;leverage its new features, such as access via ordinary
memory&lt;br/&gt;instructions, and its role in large software systems as a
middle layer&lt;br/&gt;between memory and disk. It focuses on two forms of
solid-state&lt;br/&gt;storage: flash memory, common in solid-state drives and
mobile&lt;br/&gt;devices, and forthcoming storage-class memory, which compared
to flash&lt;br/&gt;promises lower latency, better endurance, and access as
memory rather&lt;br/&gt;than as a device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
addresses important concerns about using solid-state&lt;br/&gt;storage: how best
to use the capabilities of these devices to improve&lt;br/&gt;specific
applications or use cases, such as caching; how to provide&lt;br/&gt;access to
internal management capabilities of solid-state storage&lt;br/&gt;devices, such
as address translation and garbage collection, to&lt;br/&gt;applications; how to
remove software layers between an application and&lt;br/&gt;storage to reduce
latency; and how to provide reliable storage while&lt;br/&gt;removing many of
the layers that currently provide reliability.
