In this project supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Schwartz will study chemical reaction dynamics in
condensed phases and complex systems using both quantum mechanical and classical
methods. The PI will develop his existing approach to extended modes in liquids
as well as a quantum Kramers methodology for examining the dynamics of chemical
reactions in condensed phases. A new enzymatic system will be studied in detail
using both this quantum methodology and a classical approach to discover rate-
promoting vibrations in complex systems. The investigation of the dynamics of
enzyme reactions and the search for "promoting vibrations" addresses central
problems in chemical and biological systems, such as the catalytic importance of
such vibrations.

This project presents a balance between developing new theory and applying it to
interesting and important problems in both isotropic fluid systems as well as in
highly anisotropic environments such as enzymes. The proposed research will
provide an approach for predicting rates for chemical reactions in which quantum
effects are important. The results are applicable to biological systems as well
as to systems in other branches of chemistry and materials science where
electron- and proton-transfer reactions are important.
