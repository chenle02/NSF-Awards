As personal robots become common in our homes, they will perform a broad range
of helpful tasks for their owners. In doing so, all sorts of physical
interactions will occur between the robot and the home environment, for example,
picking up a mug requires the robot to carefully control contact forces as it
secures a grasp. As tasks become more advanced, for example, operating a can
opener, the robot will have to "understand" how to grasp the can and the can
opener, so that it can operate the opener. The goal of this project is to gather
data and develop algorithms that will allow a robot to understand how to grasp
tools in a way that facilitates its ability to operate that tool safely and
effectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to improve the
understanding of the physical interactions between the instruments and the
environment in daily manipulation tasks with the goal of developing effective
robotic grasp and manipulation planners to facilitate the tasks. The research
designs and develops a physical-interaction observation system to observe both
the interactive motion and wrench between the instruments and environment in
several representative instrumental manipulation tasks by a number of
participants. Each manipulation task is characterized with its instrumental
motion models and wrench distribution models. Using the models, optimal grasps
are generated using the task wrench coverage measure and evaluated using a real
robotic arm and hand platform. The data collected in this work enables
researchers to fully explore daily living tasks and provide excellent training
and testing data sets for other related research. The optimal manipulation
grasping approach equips robot manipulators with the ability to hold instruments
with a firm grasp to withstand the disturbance in daily living interactions and
perform tasks efficiently.
