9412172 Williams A vertically scanning interference microscope will support
research on the tribological processes occurring in mechanical end face seals.
Its primary use will be as a full-field topographical measuring device to fully
characterize the conditions of mating seal surfaces of different materials and
operating under different condition. ***
