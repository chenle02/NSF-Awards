The objective of this project is to design, implement and evaluate a model for
primary mathematics instruction (grades K-3) to enhance student understanding
and support teacher change in predominantly minority public schools. The
"pedagogical content knowledge," mathematical content knowledge, and beliefs of
teachers of minority children will be addressed in summer inservice programs
designed to reflect a grade-related focus. The summer component will compel the
teachers to: investigate the premise that mathematics instruction should be
based on a child's existing knowledge, reflect on their perception of
mathematics and mathematical instruction, focus on the influence of affective
behavior in instruction, directly address equity issues, examine and develop
instructional activities to foster mathematical understanding and problem
solving, and experience organizing and conducting meaningful mathematics
instruction with a small group of minority children. Project research will be in
terms of longitudinal effect on students' mathematical understandings, teachers'
instructional approaches, classroom practices, and teacher beliefs. This will
include an on-going process evaluation of the implementation of the summer
inservice goals and a multi-year impact evaluation of the inservice effects in
terms of student learning and teacher beliefs and practices. This project is
jointly supported by the Division of Teacher Preparation and Enhancement and the
Division of Materials Development, Research and Informal Science Education.
