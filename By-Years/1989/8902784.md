This work will focus on problems of nonlinear partial differential equations.
Emphasis will be placed on elliptic equations in which the ratio of the forcing
term to the second variable are subject to certain restrictions. There are
different degrees of resonance and methods for solving such equations depend on
this degree. Relatively little attention has been given to the case of strong
resonance in which the integral of the forcing term remains bounded. Work will
concentrate on equations governed by this condition. A topological approach to
the existence problem will be used. The (now) classical mountain pass lemma of
Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz does not apply to this setting (the Palais-Smale
condition cannot be verified). An alternate approach is now proposed which may
bypass earlier difficulties by imposing boundary conditions which will lead to
some form of generalized pseudogradient mappings. The critical points of these
mappings will then represent solutions of the equations. //
