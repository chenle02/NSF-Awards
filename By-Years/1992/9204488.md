Przebinda will investigate distribution characters and matrix coefficients of
irreducible unitary representation of classical Lie groups from the viewpoint of
microlocal analysis in the context of Howe's theory of reductive dual pairs, via
the Cayley transform. Use will be made of Howe's theory, microlocal analysis,
and Harish-Chandra's theory of orbital integrals to construct irreducible
unitary representations of classical Lie groups, attached to nilpotent coadjoint
orbits. This attachment occurs on three levels: associated varieties, wave front
sets, and character formulas. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics. **//
