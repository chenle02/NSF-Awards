This study will focus on the feasibility of microbial degradation of chlorinated
organic chemicals that are a threat to the quality of groundwater. The
investigators plan to conduct further studies utilizing a bacterium that had
been previously isolated which utilizes methane as a substrate and which has
been shown to degrade chlorinated organic substances of pollutional
significance.
