The purpose of this CEDAR project is to better understand the coupling between
the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and to quantify the resultant energy input
into the neutral atmosphere. The proposed strategy has two components: first, to
establish empirical models of convection in the high latitude ionosphere for
various parameters of the interplanetary medium and magnetic activity; second,
to examine carefully selected events that correspond to stable wind conditions.
A combination of empirical modeling and case studies is needed because the
ionospheric conditions are highly variable; the ionosphere-magnetosphere system
is controlled by several processes, each with a response time characterized by
different time scale. Therefore, the empirical models might not provide an
accurate description of the pattern obtained for individual circumstances even
when events corresponding to stable conditions are considered. Another aspect of
our approach will be, when appropriate, to map electric fields, currents, and
auroral features to the magnetospheric equatorial plane.
