A study of the break-up of a liquid stream into droplets is to be continued. The
work is largely experimental, and will explore break-up behavior driven by
pressure oscillations induced in the flow nozzle, using amplitude modulation on
a carrier frequency. Very low droplet speed dispersion can be produced this way.
The effect of ambient gas pressure is to be investigated, as well as controlled
drop collisions to produce novel liquid forms. Processing applications, such as
ceramic precursors, spray coating, and net-form manufacturing will benefit from
an increased ability to control the shape and dynamics of liquid drops.
