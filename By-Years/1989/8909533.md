The electronics industry is searching for ways to design light weight
electronic packages which maximize the performance of the structural aspects of
their designs. The primary objective of this research is to provide industry
with the necessary tools and techniques to design light weight, reliable
electronic packages which are subjected to shock and vibration environments.
Specifically, the problem of determining the optimal support locations for
vibrating printed circuit boards will be investigated. Many of the required
design techniques currently exist in industry, however, they have not to date,
been coordinated and focused on this problem. The principal thrust of this
research is to synthesize current state-of-the-art engineering technologies from
the areas of computational mechanics, numerical optimization theory, and
experimental methods, to formulate, model, simulate, and experimentally evaluate
possible solutions to this problem.
