9530094 Mix Researchers from Oregon State University will undertake a research
cruise to sample sediments from the South American margin from Chile to Peru in
an investigation of the climatic and oceanographic history of the Eastern
Pacific Ocean. Their specific objectives will test hypotheses which 1) relate
the oceanographic circulation of the eastern Pacific Ocean to winds and mixing
processes in the Southern Ocean off Antarctica and 2) examine the symmetry of
ocean currents along the continental margin between the northern hemisphere
(California Current) and southern hemisphere (Humboldt Current). The piston
cores which will be collected during this project fill a large geographic void
in samples, and are important to the broader understanding of ocean-wide
circulation and climate questions in the Pacific Ocean. They will also collect
seismic reflection and detailed seafloor bathymetric data in the vicinity of
each of their 11 planned coring sites to prepare detailed pre-drilling plans for
their highly-ranked proposal for drilling this region in the future with the
JOIDES Resolution, the drilling platform for basic marine geological research
managed for an NSF-led international consortium of 18 nations by the Ocean
Drilling Program. ***
