9360384 Lafe This project will develop a new technique for achieving massive
compression of data based on Cellular Automata (CA) computing. The research will
make use of the special characteristics of a group of CA to evolve through
certain states regardless of the complexity of their initial configuration. For
certain kinds of data, the method will be capable of high quality compression
ratios in excess of 10,000:1. This technology will impact industries such as
telecommunication, cable television, computer data storage, aerospace and
defense. Three different products will be developed from this research: a CA
software compressor/decompressor, a VLSI implementation of the CA code, and
board level products based on the VLSI chip. ***
