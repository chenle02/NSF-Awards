The international conference on Current Trends and Challenges of Numerical
Solutions of Partial Differential Equations will take place at Purdue University
July 7-July 9, 2017. The meeting is a forum to promote, enhance, and stimulate
international research interactions and collaborations in applied and
computational mathematics. The conference provides a great opportunity for young
and minority researchers to closely interact with leading experts in a
stimulating environment.

Computational Methods, particularly those for solving partial differential
equations, have experienced major developments over the past several decades in
both algorithmic advances and applications to other fields. These developments
have had profound implications and applications in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics. This conference brings together leading experts who
will survey the current trends and challenges in the numerical methods for
solving partial differential equation. This will lead to identification of
promising new ideas and methods that can advance this active field in coming
years.
