The proposed research deals with developing tools for the design of suspended
micromechanical systems. A Schematic design methodology is to be devised which
complements and builds upon existing design tools, chiefly commercial CAD
packages that handle 3D visualization, finite-element analysis, macromodeling
and simulation. The work includes: general design methodology; schematic design,
including validation; identifying reusable components; generalized component
interface; creating a set of lumped-parameter component models and design,
fabrication and test of prototype components.
