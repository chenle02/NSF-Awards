Two important components are identified as missing from the undergraduate
geography curriculum as currently implemented: 1) a means of explicitly
integrating the varied substantive material covered in courses dealing with
spatial analysis, cartography, remote sensing, and geographic information
systems; and 2) access to the computer hardware and software needed to support
integrated instruction in these courses. Accordingly, this project provides
undergraduate spatial analysis, cartography, remote sensing and geographic
information systems. These have been restructured around common linkages and tie
courses together. Both theoretical and applied linkages are established, and
computer hardware and software are utilized. Also, laboratory exercises cross
course boundaries. A new capstone research course, recently added to the
curriculum, now provides students with the opportunity to apply spatial
analytical techniques to research problems within various sub-fields of
geography.
