It is proposed to experimentally investigate the performance of a vapor
compression heat pump with a two-stage solution circuit. It achieves high
temperature lifts at very low pressure ratios, promising improved performance.
The goal of this project is to verify the theoretical performance improvement
over conventional systems, to study the interaction of coupled solution
circuits, and to provide experimental data to verify a computer model that is
currently being developed. The advanced heat pump cycle has potential
applications in combined refrigeration/heating situations, and any other large
temperature lift condition in industry or district heating systems.
