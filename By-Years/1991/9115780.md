The proposed study will test the hypothesis that Creede Formation sediments
(Colorado) were a major source of mineralizing fluids for the Creede ore
district and will quantitatively evaluate the geochemical and isotopic evolution
of pore waters in the Creede Formation. The Creede Formation sediments have
undergone a complicated history that appears to include low temperature
alteration by fluids of controversial salinity and later hydrothermal
alteration. The project will involve a combined observational and computational
study to characterize the sediments and porewaters of the Creede Formation.
Previously collected outcrop samples and core samples from two planned drill
holes undertaken as part of the Continental Scientific Drilling Program will be
studied. The mineralogy, texture, chemical and stable isotopic composition, and
age of chemical sediments and authigenic minerals, including zeolites,
K-feldspar, clays, carbonates, and saline minerals will be characterized.
Analytical techniques will include XRD, petrography, SEM, electron microprobe,
stable isotope geochemistry, and laser 39Ar/40Ar and K/Ar age dating. The
principal investigators will work closely with Robert Rye (USGS, Denver) and
Marvin Lansphere (USGS, Menlo Park) in the collection and interpretation of
stable and radiogenic isotope data. They will also develop quantitative models
of the diagenetic alteration of Creede sediments using a geochemical and
isotopic mass transfer computer program. They also hope to gain new insights
into this and other similar systems by incorporating a broad spectrum of
mineralogical and geochemical methods with state-of-the-art geochemical and
isotopic modeling to develop and integrated model of the depositional,
diagenetic, and hydrothermal history of the Creede Formation.
