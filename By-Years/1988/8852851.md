This project seeks to provide an interdisciplinary approach for undergraduate
study of modern data management techniques and an interdisciplinary team
approach to environmental problem solving. This program builds on the Biology
Department experience with microcomputer- based laboratory work stations and the
Civil Engineering Department Design Center concept. The work stations interface
digital laboratory equipment, hand-held data loggers and weather telemetry
instruments with data acquisition hardware providing rapid data aquisition,
computer analysis and evaluation. The program focuses on collaborative work in
sanitary and toxic waste management, which requires training in modern data
management techniques and interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving.
Students learn data management and instrumentation techniques through course
work, laboratory exercises and an interdisciplinary design project. Students
benefit through learning and practicing modern data management techniques
appropriate to their disciplines and have the experience of working together as
a team to find solutions to the environmental problems. This interdisciplinary
approach models real life situations, increases student confidence in problem
solving ability, and opens new career opportunities for students in both
departments. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match
for the NSF award.
