9409166 Wei The investigator study the effect of curvature bounds on the local
geometric structure and global topology of a Riemannian manifold. In the compact
case, this includes the question of the structure of the fundamental group of a
near elliptic manifold. For open manifolds, the investigator are concentrating
on the structures of manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, especially the
question when they will have finite topological type. ***
