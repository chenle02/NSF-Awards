This project is responding to a need to assess the value of student-focused "Out
of School Time" (OST) science programs. The number of these programs has risen
substantially and there is increased interest in the value of such programs.
Three instruments that will allow implementers to assess the effectiveness of
their programs are being developed. These instruments are: (1) participant
survey, (2) observational protocol, and (3) program analysis protocol. Applying
the logic underlying the theoretical approach and instrument development in
career/occupational counseling, the project is addressing four issues. The
project draws on a theoretical framework to inform the development and
integration of instruments that assess OST science programs. In addition, the
project modifies single subject research designs to observe and document more
than one subject during an observational cycle of student engagement in OST
programming. By working with users of evaluation in the scientific and
engineering research community, the project addresses the need for practitioner-
oriented instruments that can be implemented by practitioners and have high
reliability, validity, and quality control across observations and sites. The
project is a collaboration among the principle investigator and principal
investigators and Directors of Education and Outreach of research centers
supported by the Materials Research in Science and Engineering Centers Program,
a program administered by the NSF Research and Research Activities Directorates.
