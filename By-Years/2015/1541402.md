Cyberinfrastructure is increasing diversity and adding new types of complexity
and challenges on campus for researchers and information technology staff at
Florida International University (FIU). Together they are encountering barriers
in interoperability and usability when attempting to integrate resources at the
campus level with sites connected across other campuses, regional, national and
international organizations. Researcher demand is growing dramatically for
network services and expertise to access cyberinfrastructure resources including
climate data, Large Hadron Collider data, remote observing on optical
telescopes, and computing and data resources for example. Simultaneously, the
campus network infrastructure must be operated with security and best practices
that protect day-to-day operations, financial and personnel data of the
university.

The Campus Cyber-Infrastructure Engineer Lead or C-CIEL (i.e. Campus Seal)
assists in the planning, designing and implementation of a seamless integrated
cyberinfrastructure. FIU is connecting researchers' laboratories to facilities
and cyberinfrastructure resources at destination end points providing friction-
free multi-institutional research collaborations through the campus science
network and Science DMZ, and Identify and Access Management infrastructure. The
C-CIEL guides the effort to coordinate and collaborate with the Information
Technology departments, academic units and research groups, to design and
engineer solutions that address their application requirements, from an end-to-
end perspective.

Broader impacts of this project are increasing multi-institutional collaborative
research, increasing uptake and use of campus science network, Science DMZ and
cyber security infrastructure; and, contributing towards a community of campus
cyberinfrastructure engineers by fostering engagement and coordination on
campus, regional, national and international levels.
