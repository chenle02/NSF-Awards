This CAREER award includes laboratory experiments, ambient measurements, and
modeling studies to investigate the role of chlorine chemistry in the formation
of particulate matter and ozone in ambient air. The latest developments in mass
spectrometric techniques will be used to investigate the formation of highly
oxidized molecules as a result of ambient chlorine chemistry. Results from this
project can be used in air quality models to make better-informed decisions
about environmental policies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed analyses and
measurements of highly oxidized molecules (HOM) in the gas and particle phases
formed from different precursors, with and without the addition of Cl, will be
performed in the laboratory chamber using a state-of-the-art high-resolution
chemical ionization mass spectrometer (HR-CIMS). The principal investigator
hypothesizes that Cl significantly enhances concentrations of HOM, ozone and
organic particulate matter. She also plans to investigate changes in the
concentration and composition of alkyl nitrates formed from different precursors
and under different experimental conditions due to the presence of Cl. Ambient
measurements will be conducted to observe Cl chemistry and quantify chlorine-
containing species in an oil and gas production region.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator recommends to model laboratory
chamber experiments to quantify the fraction of the initial hydrocarbon reacting
with Cl versus OH, as well as the extent to which the succeeding chemistry (e.g.
continued oxidation of product species) proceeds due to reaction with Cl or OH.
This will enable the evaluation of the relative importance of direct oxidation
by Cl versus its effect through secondary OH production. She also plans to
develop parameterizations that can be used in chemical transport models to
account for formation of secondary organic aerosol from Cl-initiated oxidation
of hydrocarbons.
