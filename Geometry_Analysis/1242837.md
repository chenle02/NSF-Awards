The Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University will host a week-long
conference entitled "Cycles, Calibrations and Nonlinear Partial Differential
Equations'' from October 22-28, 2012. The last two decades have seen a
flourishing of research on calibrations and cycles, sparked in part by the work
of Strominger, Yau and Zaslow, which relates a concrete form of the mirror
symmetry conjecture to singular foliations by special Lagrangian submanifolds.
This conference will bring together a large group of world experts on the many
aspects of this topic ranging from the study of nonlinearpartial differential
equations, through the geometry of special holonomy spaces, to aspects of string
theory in physics. There will be an internal workshop for young researchers
aimed specifically at fostering collaboration. Funds will be used largely for
housing and travel expenses of graduate students and post-docs, together with
some junior faculty who do not have NSF support, and a few of the principal
speakers.

The conference is dedicated to the mathematics surrounding cycles and
calibrated geometry, an area which has been the focus of much recent activity in
both mathematics and physics. A large number of eminent researchers, from a
variety of fields related to this topic, have agreed to give talks. This should
result in wide-ranging and fruitful discussions. There will be a focus on young
researchers. In particular, there will be a week-long internal workshop for
graduate students and post-docs designed to encourage interaction and
collaboration. This workshop will be directed by Blaine Lawson (Stony Brook)
together with Sergei Grigorian (Simons Center for Geometry and Physics), and
Sema Salur (University of Rochester). Further details on the conference can be
