This project uses homotopy theory to study questions in number theory and in
algebraic and differential topology. Homotopy theory studies those properties of
mathematical objects that do not change under small deformations. These
mathematical objects are often of a geometric nature, but the methods of
homotopy theory have been increasingly applied to objects of an algebraic nature
as well. Homotopy theoretic properties tend to be accessible to computation by
taking advantage of the invariance under small changes. Since they also
generally retain important information about the original mathematical objects,
homotopy theory is an effective tool for a wide range of mathematical problems.

The project has three main foci. The first focus concerns the algebraic K-theory
of the sphere spectrum, which connects to both differential topology and number
theory. The research pursues a program to identify the homotopy type of the
fiber of the linearization map between the K-theory of the sphere spectrum and
the K-theory of the integers; a program to identify the homotopy fiber of the
cyclotomic trace; and an approach to a conjecture of Hesselholt by constructing
an appropriate spectral category of cyclotomic spectra. The second focus is the
study of the complex cobordism spectrum as an E_infinity or more generally E_n
ring spectrum. The project investigates some concrete questions on the
multiplication on cobordism and approaches to solving them. The third focus
concerns the relationship between the E_n differential graded algebras and the
(unstable) homotopy theory of simply connected spaces. The work includes a
project for exploring the notion of "formal" E_n algebra, particularly the
question of when the cochain complex of a space can be formal and the related
question of when it is equivalent to a commutative differential graded algebra.
