The focus of this research is the development of compilers and interpreters for
Constraint Logic Programming (CPL) languages. This class of languages includes
Prolog, and it offers the users the capabilities of solving problems in various
domains, such as the reals, booleans, and strings. Research is planned in the
following subareas. 1. Meta-level interpretation: Study modular interpretation
of CLP languages in various domains. 2. Optimization: Investigate partial
evaluation to CLP programs over various domains. 3. Parallelism: Develop
accurate performance models of OR-parallel program execution. 4. Extensions of
CLP: Integrate functional, set-theoretic, and CLP languages in a single semantic
framework.
