This Presidential Young Investigator award is to support research on
understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate plant growth
and development. The specific model to be employed involves the specific
interaction between the nitroten-fixing bacterium, Rhizobium, and root nodules
of legumes such as alfalfa. Specifically the PI will examine the mechanisms by
which Rhizobium invades the root nodules of the plant without triggering the
host defense mechanism, the genes involved in nodule development, the structural
proteins of cell walls involved in nodule development and how the genetic
program for nodule development is programmed. This research has fundamental
importance to our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of plant
growth.
