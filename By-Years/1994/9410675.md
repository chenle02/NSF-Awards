This project consists of five areas of research. The first involves testing
hypotheses with a restricted parameter space. This research will focus on the
development of new tests that possess optimality properties and on the question
of whether the likelihood ratio test is asymptotically admissible. The second
area involves testing hypotheses when a nuisance parameter is present only under
the alternative hypothesis. This research will also focus on developing new
tests that have optimality properties for testing for random parameter
variation. The third area involves estimation of the intercept of a
semiparametric selection model. The forth area involves the estimation of
nonlinear models with time trends. Research in this area will consider
asymptotics for nonlinear estimators and models for data that exhibit
deterministic and stochastic trends. The final area of research will focus on
testing when a nuisance parameter is present only in parts of the null
hypothesis.
