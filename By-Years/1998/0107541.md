Birgitta Whaley of the University of California, Berkeley, is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to carry out microscopic
theoretical analysis of two classes of novel quantum solvation phenomena that
have been revealed by recent spectroscopic experiments, which remain
theoretically unexplained. The aim is to uncover the role played by the
underlying quantum structure and dynamics in the spectroscopic observables. The
first phenomenon to be explored concerns the effect of "wrapping" a molecule
with the solvation layer of molecular para-hydrogen and then embedding this in a
helium cluster at ultra-low temperatures. The extent of nanosuperfluidity
possible in the hydrogen and solvation wrap will be analyzed, along with the
relation between the quantum statistics of this and the molecular spectroscopic
constants. Secondly, helium solvent-induced modifications of structure and
excitations of embedded molecules and complexes will be addressed, focusing on
intramolecular tunneling, structures of heterocomplexes, and on the nature of
the local solvation environment and associated solvent excitations around planar
organic molecules. This research involves application of large-scale quantum
simulation methodology, algorithmic advances in some cases, and a combination of
simulations with theoretical analysis using dynamical models.

Small liquid clusters of helium that are produced in molecular beam expansions
are becoming an increasingly popular new medium in which atoms and molecules can
be embedded and studied experimentally. The clusters act as novel environments
in which to examine ultra-low temperature properties of molecules, chemical
reactions, and the energies of solvation. The outcomes of this project are
expected to lead to new insights into the fundamental understanding of chemical
and physical behavior in cold quantum mechanical solvents.
