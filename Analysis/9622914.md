DMS-9622914 PI: William Ross University of Richmond The principal investigator
will conduct research on operators on spaces of analytic functions. Such
problems explore the relationship between functional analysis and complex
function theory. The first part of the proposal examines the invariant subspaces
of the "backward shift operator" on a general Hilbert space of analytic
functions. In the second part of the proposal, the principal investigator plans
to examine the Bergman space on a "crescent" domain and examine certain
subspaces which are invariant under the linear transformation "multiplication by
z". In the third part of the proposal, the principal investigator plans to look
at the closure of the polynomials on the "standard crescent" (the region bounded
by two internally tangent circles). As mentioned earlier, these types of
problems combine two fields of mathematics, functional analysis and complex
function theory. This link was first noticed by Arne Beurling in 1949 in his
seminar paper on the shift operator. Further results on the shift were taken up
by several Russians such as Korenblum, Nikolskii, Havin, Shirokov, and Shamoyan.
In this proposal we examine these same problems but will pay closer attention to
the geometry involved.
