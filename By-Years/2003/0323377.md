The cytoplasm of a multicellular eukaryote is a surprisingly dynamic entity with
complex inter-organellar circuitries that influence nearly all aspects of
cellular function, metabolism and programmed death. This complexity, together
with a paucity of powerful model systems for study, has hindered progress in
understanding the underlying mechanics of mitochondrial behavior. Our focus in
this project is on the nuclear direction of mitochondrial genome maintenance,
sorting and inheritance in Arabidopsis. We have identified several putative
components of these processes, and we intend to study their function and
regulation. The central hypothesis is that mitochondrial sorting and inheritance
behavior derives from epigenetic and gamete-specific regulation of nuclear-
encoded mitochondrial DNA maintenance and transmission loci. We will investigate
the function of eight loci likely involved in DNA replication, sorting,
recombination and inheritance processes using mutation and transgenic analysis.
We will investigate their regulation using ectopic expression and in situ
hybridization approaches, complemented with genetic approaches that incorporate
enhancer and gene trap resources in Arabidopsis. As an outcome of this work we
expect to determine the function of the selected loci in mitochondrial genome
maintenance, and to characterize the nature of their regulation during
reproductive development. This information is of fundamental importance to our
understanding of nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions in higher eukaryotes. Data
derived from this study would impact our understanding of imprinting and gene
regulatory processes likely essential to successful in vitro fertilization
technologies. Moreover, our project participates in the Young Nebraska Scientist
training effort to enhance opportunities to recruit outstanding minority and
underprivileged high school students to the life sciences by providing summer
internship experiences in interesting and technically diverse project formats.
