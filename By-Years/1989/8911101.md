This award will support a special year in geometry to be held at the University
of Maryland, College Park during the 1989- 90 academic year. Support will be
provided for participants in the following activities during the special year:
(1) a conference in foliations to be held during the week of September 11-17,
1989, (2) a period of activity in metric differential geometry, (3) a period of
activity in deformation spaces and moduli problems, and (4) a period of activity
in cyclic homology.
