This one year, full-time award enables a philosopher who has specialized in
issues of ethics, policy and agriculture, to develop his capabilities in the
area of agricultural economics. His research focuses on value assumptions in
agricultural economics and in the teaching of agricultural economics, and on the
ethical implications of those assumptions. His host institution is the
Agricultural Issues Center of the University of California, Davis. The director
of the Center as well as several other agricultural economists will act as
advisors to the project. During the course of the award, the investigator will
audit undergraduate and graduate courses in order to gain formal training in the
mathematics of agricultural economics. This study will enable him to investigate
whether and how these mathematical tools incorporate or express value
assumptions and may magnify selected human impacts. With guidance from his
advisors, he will analyse textbooks, study their use in the classroom, and
discuss the texts and their views of them with faculty. He will examine relevant
research, attend seminars and lectures, and interview economists, in order to
identify value assumptions that are incorporated in their work. Based on his
research, he will prepare papers, distribute them, and present them in seminars,
for further discussion and evaluation. Publications will explore the
implications of these findings for teaching agricultural economics, and for
enhancing the ability of agricultural policy sciences to incorporate explicit
attention to values previously overlooked or treated as "non-economic" or
"externalities." This project addresses a central issue in ethics and values
studies in science, technology and society: the impact of values on the
development and use of scientific research. The investigator and his host
specialists and host institution are uniquely well-qualified to undertake and
support this project; collaborative efforts are likely to continue after the
period of the award. Results are likely to be appropriately disseminated and
useful. An award in the amount of $43,000 is therefore recommended.
