TERC is partnering with the Toxics Action Center to enhance the capacity of
environmental organizations to teach mathematical literacy skills to low-income
citizens, mostly women of color. Secondary collaborators include four
environmental organizations around the country. The project is (1) developing
math- and statistics-rich educational materials that help non-scientists
interpret environmental test results, (2) developing training materials that
help environmental organization personnel provide quantitative literacy training
to citizens, (3) helping environmental organizations institutionalize project
resources, and (4) evaluating the impact of project activities on environmental
organizers, community members, and the general public. Project deliverables
include bilingual, print- and web-based instructional materials (including
videos) for environmental organizations to use with staff and community members;
training sessions to create a cadre of environmental organization leaders who
can conduct environment-focused, math training workshops; a communications
toolkit for dissemination to journalists who cover environmental issues; and a
resource-rich project web site.
