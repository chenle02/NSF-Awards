The main objective of the Gordon Research Photonuclear Conference
is&lt;br/&gt;to provide the international community of nuclear scientists with
a&lt;br/&gt;unique forum in which the newest developments at the forefront
of&lt;br/&gt;this science can be presented and subjected to detailed and
extended&lt;br/&gt;discussions and criticism. The purpose of the conference is
to&lt;br/&gt;encourage communication and the discussions to be conducted in
an&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere conducive to open interactions between the
scientists,&lt;br/&gt;provoking new and even speculative ideas for future
research. To&lt;br/&gt;accomplish these goals requires the participation in all
of the&lt;br/&gt;conference activities of a significant number of leaders in
the&lt;br/&gt;field. The participation of younger scientists is essential
to&lt;br/&gt;address the future manpower needs of this rapidly changing
field.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral researchers
and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students have been specially selected for participation
in&lt;br/&gt;this conference and encouraged to present their ideas.
Their&lt;br/&gt;participation in this conference provides them with unique
and&lt;br/&gt;extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to
new&lt;br/&gt;research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for
the&lt;br/&gt;leadership roles they will assume in the future. This award
will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate participation from these junior
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
