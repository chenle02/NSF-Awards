The International Workshop on Prediction and Perception of Natural Disasters
will take place in Perugia, Italy, on November 1990. This workshop is sponsored
also by the National Research Council of Italy and the United Nations
Secretariat for the International Decade for Natural Disasters Reduction. The
purpose of the meeting is to determine the areas of research of common interest
to the United States and other nations suffering from the consequences of
persistent natural disasters, in the field of prediction and in the area of
public perception. Physical scientists, engineers and social scientists from
several countries will discuss the state-of-the-art of methodologies for the
prediction of various natural hazards and for the identification and evaluation
of factors influencing the perception of existing capabilities. Determining
which are the gaps in knowledge and the needed research in these fields will
improve our capabilities for warning and protecting populations at risk within
diverse cultural contexts.
