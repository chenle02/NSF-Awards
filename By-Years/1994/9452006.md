9452006 Hampikian The Cooperative Laboratory in Biotechnology introduces pre-
service middle level science teachers to the scientific method and modern
research. Students perform original research as a cooperative group, parelleling
a project underway at a neighboring research laboratory. Through this
experience, students are trained in modern biotechnology and are prepared for
future in-service research opportunities. This senior course is designed to
break down the barrier between prospective teachers and local researchers.
Investigative topics for each term are chosen in consultation with principal
investigators from nearby laboratories. These scientists have agreed to assist
in class experiments, and will give seminars explaining their own studies. In
addition, students will choose a local research group to follow and will prepare
a fellowship proposal for future in-service research. This course will be
required of all science education majors and will be open to other students as
space permits.
