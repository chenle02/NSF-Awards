This study will conduct a survey along the Easter/Salas-y-Gomex/ Nazca (ESN)
trail tobetter characterize and constrain movement of the hotspot over the last
25 to 30 Ma. The survey will involve geochronologic, geochemical, and
geophysical study of seamounts and volcanic ridges. Multibeam bathymetric data
and backscatter imagery will be used to define topography and structural
features at selected localities and identify targets for dredging. Dredged
samples will be dated using 40Ar-39Ar technique and their petrological, chemical
and Nd-Pb-Sr isotopic chracteristics will be determined. The new data will be
combined with re-analyses of existing samples to test Nazca-hotspot motion and
mantle flow models and compare them to Pacific-hotspot models.
