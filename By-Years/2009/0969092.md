The PI will develop the theory of hypergraphs, or families of sets, focusing on
extremal and probabilistic questions. A goal is to extend classical theorems in
the area and to discover new phenomena using modern approaches, which include
the semirandom or nibble method and hypergraph regularity. The PI and his
collaborators have recently used these tools to improve and extend several
results in combinatorics that have been around for decades. The plan is to
continue these projects. Several questions that were unapproachable for many
years have suddenly come within reach due to some ground-breaking recent
developments and the PI plans to continue exploiting these new techniques to
shed light on old problems. The specific questions to be attacked concern the
chromatic number of locally sparse hypergraphs, the structure of typical
hypergraphs that contains no copy of some fixed configuration, and the
enumeration of copies of one hypergraph in another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
extremal theory of hypergraphs impacts several areas of Mathematics and also has
consequences in other fields like information theory, coding theory, and
theoretical computer science. The study of random structures and randomized
algorithms has gained importance in recent years due to the proliferation of
large networks like the internet and various other social networks. Developing
new techniques to study these complex systems will be a major task for future
researchers. Part of this project seeks to develop randomized algorithms that
break a large complicated system into smaller, well understood pieces.
