Engineering - Chemical (53) We were previously funded under an NSF-sponsored
project, in that program we integrated design through the use of AspenPlus
simulation software which was developed for use in lecture courses throughout
the four-year chemical engineering curriculum. In this project, the integration
of design is expanded to include open-ended design-oriented experiences in the
chemical engineering laboratory. Under this project we have our students working
in an open-ended, design-build-test experiment in packed column design for gas
absorption. The experiment is now part of our required senior-year chemical
engineering laboratory course. It is modeled after a typical industrial project
in which students are required to make design choices between competing
alternatives where economics must be considered. Students are using AspenPlus to
model the absorption process and make choices between alternative columns and
column packing configurations. Our students are building and testing their
design in the laboratory and report their findings in a written or oral
presentation. We are assessing the effectiveness of this project by using
student interviews, surveys of senior students and graduates, employers as well
as the program's industrial advisory board.
