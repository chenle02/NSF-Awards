The research is concerned with the discovery and development of adaptive routing
protocols for massively parallel architectures using Hypercube Interconnection
Networks (HINs). This class includes the well known binary n-cube, k-ary n-
cube, and multidimensional arrays. A taxonomy of routing protocols is developed
and used to focus attention on distinct classes. Two new concepts will be
developed and explored in this study. First, the properties of conservatism and
optimism of these protocols will be rigorously characterized. The effect of
these properties on message latency, network bandwidth, and network topology
will be studied. Second, the class of multi-phase protocols will be introduced
and developed. These are protocols whose behavior is a function of the distance
of a message from the destination. The proposed router architectures will be
modeled and evaluated via simulation. Particular attention will be focused on
the evaluation of performance in the presence of implementation constraints such
as wiring complexity, pin count, and link layer protocols.
