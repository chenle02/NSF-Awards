0323067 Thompson The overall objective of this research is to perform the
fundamental studies of a novel optical reporter for further definition of its
interaction with cells and their internal organelles. The multi-modal probes
developed are lanthanide chelates and a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)
ligand. These molecules will be used in-vitro for the detection of specific
pathological cells and to lend insights regarding mitochondria function and its
relationship to disease.
