This is the sedimentary geology componenet of AMASEDS. The objective of AMASEDS
was to identify dominant processes controlling strata formation on different
time and vertical scales and their implication for paleoenvironmental
interpretations. This is a new award to allow the laboratory analysis of AMASEDS
samples to be continued towards the fruition of the project.
