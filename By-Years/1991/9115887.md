This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in experimental
physical chemistry between Tomas Baer of the University of North Carolina and
Paul Marie Guyon of the University of Paris (South). The primary objective of
the project is to investigate the mechanism for the formation of high-lying
electronic states in gases by producing low-energy electrons. The experimental
approach is based on the use of both pulsed synchrotron radiation as a light
source and laser-based techniques. The project will benefit significantly from
access to unique facilities in France. Dr. Guyon and his group will conduct the
initial electron and ion timing experiments on the Orsay synchrotron. The
dispersed light from the synchrotron is advantageous for scanning molecules
across a wide range of energy levels. This is complemented by subsequent
experiments at the University of North Carolina using laser light in more
limited energy regions. This combined effort will result in improved
experimental techniques for the physical and chemical analysis of gases.
