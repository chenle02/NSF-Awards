The international conference on Topics in Heavy Ion Collisions
&lt;br/&gt;provides the international community of nuclear scientists with a
unique venue to present the newest developments at the forefront of this
science. The scientific presentations will span the physics of hot and dense
strongly interacting matter, from intermediate to relativistic energies. The
conference organizing committee has sought to establish an atmosphere suitable
for scientific stimulating discussions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International
conferences such as HIC03 where noted scientists gather to discuss their
research are very educational and inspirational to our young scientists. Their
participation is essential to address the future manpower needs of this rapidly
changing field. The conference also provides them with unique and extensive
access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to new research opportunities
and techniques and helps prepare them for the leadership roles they will assume
in the future. Therefore, it is important to encourage bright and promising
postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to participate in this conference
and to present their ideas. This award will support and enable the participation
of students and junior scientists. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
