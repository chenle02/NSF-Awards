Pair programming is a coding practice where two programmers work together. One
programmer, the driver, writes code while the other programmer, the observer,
reviews each line of code as it is written. Twenty years of CS education
research has shown that pair programming significantly improves programming
competency and increases the likelihood that students will become and remain
computing majors. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing modern life and has
the potential to change how students learn to program. Modern AI tools like
OpenAI’s ChatGPT can write, summarize, comment, and explain programs without
human intervention. The goal of this project is to prototype, test, and study a
pair-programming AI agent named CoCode that can serve as a tool and tutor for
students. This project will help us to better understand the roles AI-based
tools play in computing education.

This project will explore a variety of theory-informed design options and
innovate on recent breakthroughs in language models and collaborative
reinforcement learning resulting in the development of an AI pair-programmer
agent. This agent will be able to interact with student programmers and guide
them using the pair-programming pedagogy. A series of human subject experiments
will serve both to refine design choices and benchmark and train the AI
algorithms. The tool will be evaluated in an educational setting. Students will
use CoCode in a series of trials to determine what use patterns and learning
successes are possible over longer-term interaction. Outcomes will be
behavioral, providing an understanding of how students’ tasks change as they
learn and become competent programmers. These results will be used to postulate
how such technologies will continue to be developed for educational settings and
how they might be integrated into workforce development for the re-skilling of
existing workers.
