This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project proposes to test a
method for conducting high-throughput, automated analysis of the protein content
of cell lines using a novel mass analyzed 2D liquid-phase separation technique.
The conventional method of 2D PAGE (Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) has
several limitations. It is labor intensive, time consuming, difficult to
automate and often not readily reproducible. In addition, quantitation,
especially in differential expression experiments, is often difficult and
limited in dynamic range. The proposed technology provides automated, faster,
and more accurate 2D protein maps, and can be used to purify specific proteins
and enact protein/peptide digest and sequencing information. These capabilities
will prove valuable for studying drug-protein interactions for detecting early
signs of cancer. Studies of cancer cell lines can reveal signatures of cancerous
cells that can serve as markers for actual diagnosis. The proposed system is
based on 2D liquid-phase protein separation using chromatofocusing (CF) in one
dimension and non-porous silica, reverse-phase, high-performance liquid
chromatography (NPS-RP HPLC) in the second dimension. The HPLC eluent is
monitored in real-time by on-line electrospray ionization (ESI) mass
spectrometry (MS) to provide molecular weight and intensity information.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of proteomics. This
market is forecasted to grow from $0.7 billion to $5.8 billion over the next 5
years. There is a tremendous need to develop automated methods of protein
analysis of cell lines to better understand whole system biological function for
improved drug therapy and early detection of disease, such as cancer.
