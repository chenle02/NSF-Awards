The Intelligent Structures Group within the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering at the University of New Hampshire will invite 10-14
undergraduate students from the New England area to work with faculty on
research projects in the area of control and signal processing. Students will be
able to choose from several interesting projects in machine vision, VLSI design,
and neural networks. The purpose of this program is to encourage promising young
students, especially women and minorities, to pursue graduate careers in science
and engineering.
