This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to
develop a new technology for the industrial production of high quality
semiconductor nanocrystals. Semiconductor nanocrystals are nanometer sized
fragments of the corresponding bulk crystals, which have shown great potential
for a variety of electronic and optoelectronic applications. At present, all of
those commercial applications rely on the availability of high quality
semiconductor nanocrystals on a large scale with an affordable price. The new
design maximizes the power of the existing batch synthetic schemes developed in
academic institutions, although it possesses a continuous production nature. In
this way, the quality and the quantity of the resulting nanocrystals are both
guaranteed and the optimization of the production is minimized. The proposed
technology should be extendable to the industrial production of other types of
colloidal nanocrystals as long as the related batch synthesis is available.

The commercial value of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals in the field of
electronic and optoelectronic applications lies on large area display, portable
electronic devices, imprinting of integrated circuits, solar cells, etc. A
multi-billion dollar market for the production of those electronic devices is in
rapid development. For all of those devices, colloidal nanocrystals with an
affordable price play a vital role, and will have a significant share of the
market. It can be predicted that the success of any of those active commercial
developments will open an economically significant market for the production of
high quality semiconductor nanocrystals. It is also true that the existence of a
commercial production technology with an affordable price will promote all of
those commercial efforts on electronic and optoelectronic applications of
nanocrystals.
