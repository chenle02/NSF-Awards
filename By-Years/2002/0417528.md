0417528&lt;br/&gt;Argamon, Shlomo&lt;br/&gt;Illinois Institute of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;"CRCD/EI: An Undergraduate CS Specialization in Knowledge
Management Systems"&lt;br/&gt;$269,999&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
involves a specialization option in Knowledge Management Systems, housed in an
undergraduate Computer Science curriculum. Knowledge Management (KM) theory and
techniques have taken on increasing importance in our information society. The
core areas of KM are text analysis, data mining, and information retrieval,
requiring students and practitioners to understand the fundamentals of
algorithms, statistics, machine learning, human-user interaction, and be
familiar with what commercial products exist and have some experience using
those products. This project builds on this institution's successful integration
of new courses in Information Retrieval and Data Mining, developed with NSF
funding, into their CS curriculum. The outcomes of the current project include
the following: a set of materials for the course Intelligent Text Analysis
(including presentation materials for a semester long course, notes for
students, assignments, and tests); course materials for Knowledge Management
Systems (including presentation materials for a semester long course, notes for
students, project ideas, and detailed recommendations for facilitating student
project management); a report describing research results obtained by students
who participated in these classes; a report describing specific results from the
three-year evaluation of these courses and the specialization as a whole
(including a recommendation as to whether or not these courses should be
included in the standard CS curriculum); and, assessments of the impacts of
teaching methods on different types of students (e.g.: gender, age, economic
status, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;
