The principal investigator proposes to study the kinetics of hydrogen and
majority point defects in olivine. Experiments on olivine will be carried out in
order to determine the dependence of hydrogen solubility on hydrogen fugacity.
Results, determined from infrared spectroscopic data, will be used to understand
the mechanism by which hydrogen affects important internal properties of
olivine. Additionally, coulometric titration measurements will be made to study
the mobilities of the majority point defects in olivine, as well as the
deviation in stoichiometry, as a function of various thermodynamic parameters.
Ultimately all studies will lead to the development of a point defect model for
olivine. This in turn will be critical to understanding the behavior of olivine
and, for example, to interpreting conditions in the earth's mantle, as well as
other geological environments.
