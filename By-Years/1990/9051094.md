This project improves an existing geotechnical laboratory by adding soil
characterization instrumentation having computer interfaced data acquisition.
These instruments are used to measure permeability, compressibility and shear
strength. The equipment acquired includes triaxial testing units with pore
pressure and volume change measuring apparatus, consolidometers, permeameters,
and data acquisition computers and software. This project permits the addition
of a required laboratory to improve the teaching of geotechnical engineering.
The laboratory introduces recent development in theory, practice, and methods of
testing. The addition of this apparatus permits a unified approach to theory and
practice while promoting the understanding of basic concepts and enhancing the
utility and creativity of graduates. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
