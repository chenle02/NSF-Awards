9401020 Kappeler This award supports mathematical research focusing on infinite
systems of differential equations known as Hamiltonian systems. They derive from
models of physical systems and nonlinear partial differential equations obtained
through variational principles. Work to be done includes the analysis of the
symplectic structure of the phase space of completely integrable Hamiltonian
systems to help understand Hamiltonian perturbations. Studies of regularized
determinants of elliptic operators will also be carried out. They appear in
modern physics (functional integrals) as well as in geometry and topology
(torsion and eta-invariants). This work continues efforts to extend results on
asymptotic expansions of the logarithm of the determinant of one-parameter
families of pseudodifferential operators. A third line of investigation concerns
the investigation of microlocal smoothing properties for a large class of linear
and nonlinear systems of dispersive evolution equations of Schrodinger type.
Finally, work will bedone on spectral problems and related inverse problems for
Schrodinger operators on line bundles over tori and Heisenberg manifolds.
Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the
physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the
equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the
solutions. This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness
and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of
solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations. ***
