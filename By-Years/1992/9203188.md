Successful colonization of plant tissue by Pseudomonas syringae appears to
require the ability to cope with oxidative stree caused by the HOOH produced
during early phases of the interaction. P. syringae strains were found to
contain 10 to 100-fold higher levels of catalase activity than their
nonpathogenic relatives, P. fluorescens and P. putida. At least 8 catalase
isozymes were detected in lysates of P. syringae pv. glycinea race 4. Two of
these isozymes were unique to the periplasm. Catalase activity in P. syringae
strains was dependent on the growth phase of the culture. The specific activity
of cytoplasmic catalases increased during the transition to stationary phase.
These results are consistent with the involvement of multiple catalase isozymes
in the reduction of oxidative stress during pathogenesis by these bacteria.
