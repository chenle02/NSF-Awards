The PI proposes to study several questions involving arithmetic aspects of maps
between algebraic varieties. These questions include new far-reaching
generalizations of major results about abelian varieties, including the Mordell
--Lang conjecture (Faltings' theorem) and Merel's uniform boundedness theorem
for rational torsion on elliptic curves over a number field. In the
generalizations, the group structure in an abelian variety is replaced by
objects which exist in any variety. The PI's study of maps between varieties
will yield results about dynamical systems, Diophantine equations, automorphism
groups of curves, and value distribution of meromorphic functions.

Polynomials whose coefficients are rational numbers are a fundamental tool in
many aspect of modern life, ranging from information security to weather
prediction. These basic objects have been intensively studied for over two
thousand years, but recent years have seen the discovery of previously
unexpected phenomena. The proposed research will examine these fundamental
objects from several perspectives. This will likely yield immediate consequences
in computer science, in addition to long-term consequences across many
disciplines. Finally, much of the proposed research will be carried out jointly
with graduate and undergraduate students, so that it will make an educational
contribution in addition to its scientific impact.
