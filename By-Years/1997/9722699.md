Oh 9722699 This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between
Dr. Hae-Soo Oh of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and Dr. Jae Heon
Yun of Chungbuk National University in Korea on a "New Method To Obtain Highly
Accurate Three Dimensional Analysis of Crack Propagation and Stress on Composite
Materials." The goal of the project is to develop a new method for numerical
simulation of crack propagation which deals with the three- dimensional
singularities of vertex, edge and edge-vertex. Fracture-related damage, metal
fatigue and material failure are critically important issues in the context of
our national civil infrastructure. Effective inspection and preventive
maintenance programs (for example, of the airworthiness of airplanes or the
integrity of nuclear power plants) require an accurate fracture analysis.
However, because of the complicated geometry and nonlinearities that
characterize fracture mechanics, the use of analytical techniques is very
limited. This project will combine the experience of the U.S. and Korean
laboratories to work on a practical and accurate numerical simulation for three
dimensional fracture analysis. ***
