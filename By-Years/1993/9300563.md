This award provides funds to the Biology Department at Oregon State to continue
a successful 10-week program (summers 1993, 1994, and 1995) that will provide 11
undergraduates in biological sciences with research experiences in ecosystem
studies at the Andrews Experimental Forest. This experimental forest is the site
for several interdisciplinary projects, including the NSF sponsored Long- Term
Ecological Research Program. Students will learn and develop skills as they
interact and work closely with scientists from several disciplines on individual
projects within larger established research programs. To foster student
development and monitor what careers they pursue after they complete the
program, a 4-phase program is planned: an overview phase which explains
integrated ecosystem studies, an apprenticeship phase to develop student skills,
a personal research phase, and an evaluation and follow-up phase. According to
their interests, students will join a collaborating scientist for the second and
third phases. An REU leader (the PI) will coordinate the program, organize the
overview phase, field trips, and seminars, integrating the students and
collaborating scientists, facilitate students' progress toward independent
scientific research, and monitor the evaluation and follow-up phase so that
students can be tracked. Students will be housed at the field station with other
researchers, an arrangement that encourages after-hours discussions and helps
break barriers between disciplines. The project will place promising students at
a scenic research site with an interdisciplinary team of scientists to produce
good science and develop an enthusiasm for biological research.
