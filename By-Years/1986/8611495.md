The liquefaction of soil below the water table is a major cause of damage to
constructed facilities during an earthquake. The present methods for analyzing
the liquefaction potential of soils is entirely empirical. By contrast, this
research program involves the formulation of a boundary value problem and its
solution via numerical computer methods to describe the liquefaction process. It
is a very challenging analytical, computational, and experimental program.
However, the principal investigators are individually recognized for their
research accomplishments, and together form a team which has the expertise and
institutional resources to complete the research proposed. The completion of the
research will represent a fundamental advance in the ability to predict the
liquefaction potential of soils.
