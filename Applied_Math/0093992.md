Solna 0093992 The investigator analyzes how a propagating wave pulse behave in a
medium with rough variations. Predicting the evolution of the wave pulse from
information about the `roughness' of the medium is a problem of deep
mathematical and practical interest, as is the inverse problem of deducing
information about the medium from measurements of a transmitted pulse. Most
often a detailed description of the (fine scale) variations of the medium is not
possible, only a description of their statistical character. Hence, the
investigator considers the fine scale medium variations as a realization of a
stochastic process. This entails analysis of differential equations with
randomly varying coefficients. The project has three specific objectives: First,
obtain a characterization of the transformation of sound pulses propagating in a
medium with a continuum of length scales, a medium defined in terms of a random
fractal. Second, extend and use theory about the transformation of a wave pulse
in some specific inverse problems, in particular, high contrast seismic imaging
and time reversal mirrors. Third, derive strict bounds for how an
electromagnetic pulse can be affected by the medium heterogeneity without
knowing the details of these variations. The main question the investigator
addresses is: How does a propagating wave behave in a medium that varies when
the variations are not small? For instance, when a laser beam propagates through
the turbulent atmosphere how is it affected by intense, turbulent, variations in
the local speed of propagation? When such medium variations are smooth, say with
a constant speed of propagation, the problem is well understood. For rough
medium variations, as in the above example, the interaction of a wave pulse with
the medium heterogeneities is a fundamental yet largely open question. This
problem, predicting the evolution of signal or wave pulse that propagates in a
rough medium, is of deep mathematical and practical interest. In addition to
wave propagation in the turbulent atmosphere there are many other applications.
In reflection seismology the earth's crust is probed with a wave pulse and the
reflected pulses are used to infer knowledge about macroscale variations in the
medium. It is then important to know how the rough microscale variations in the
medium affect the probing pulse. Remote sensing, ocean acoustics, and medical
imaging provide similar examples. In communication systems, it is important to
be able to describe how medium imperfections and variations affect the
propagating signal. In the theory of composite materials, it is important to
optimally construct a complex material so that it has some desired propagation
properties.
