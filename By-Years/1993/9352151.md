9352151 Weaver Title: Upgrading and Automating an X-ray Diffractometer for Use
in Undergraduate Teaching and Research X-ray diffraction is one of the basic
tools for identifying and understanding the structure of geological materials.
The current x-ray diffraction equipment was purchased in 1965 and is now
obsolete. The project will upgrade this equipment and computerize the data
acquisition and analysis tasks associated with it. This equipment will be used
in a new series of "hands- on" experiments in Mineralogy and Crystallography,
Petrography and Advanced Mineralogy, and Theoretical Petrology. These
experiments are designed to promote active learning and empower the students
with the knowledge and experience of using a powerful tool that is beneficial in
the study of a wide variety of geological problems. An upgraded x-ray
diffractometer will provide important support for student research, a key
component of the geology curriculum. ***
