One of the major problems in biological oceanography is obtaining accurate and
timely estimates of abundance and distribution of the microscopic animals
(zooplankton) which are the major plant eaters (herbivores) in the sea and which
are the primary food of young fish and other oceanic carnivores. The
distribution of zooplankton is patchy in both vertical and horizontal scales,
and their numbers fluctuate rapidly because of high birth and mortality rates.
Traditional methods of determining spatial and temporal variability, based on
fine- mesh net collections followed by laboratory counting, are tedious and
often inaccurate because they fail to detect sharp gradients or interfaces in
the zooplankton patches. Faster and more accurate technology is required to
advance this vital area of oceanographic research. This award is testing new
technology, specifically acoustic investigations of zooplankton ecology, to
determine scales of patchiness and relate them to oceanographic features. The
PIs are also developing the necessary computerized hardware and software for a
rapid analysis of the acoustic data.
