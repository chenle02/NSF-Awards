The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Maryland,
Baltimore County (UMBC) will host the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Summer Program in Computational Biology. This yearly eight-week program for
eight students, has been funded for a three-year period. Student scholars will
have a chance to select a research topic from either bioinformatics or
computational neuroscience, both high-demand growth areas. The goal of the
program is to provide a meaningful research experience to undergraduate student
participants, and to help them strengthen their oral and written skills through
required technical presentations and written reports on their projects. They
will also experience an intensive core workshop on background biology and
relevant mathematical, statistical, and computational methodologies. The
Department has a closer than usual relationship with the Biological Sciences
Department, and the program will draw on this relationship. The University has
considerable experience in summer programs for undergraduates, and this program
will take advantage of other organized social and educational activities,
including field trips to research facilities in the Washington-Baltimore region,
an ethics workshop, an informational workshop on graduate studies, and informal
social events with student scholars from other programs. Because the University
is considered the third most diversified campus in the country, and has
nationally recognized undergraduate programs for historically underrepresented
groups (Meyerhoff and MARU*STAR programs), there is a serious interest in
recruiting and selecting participants from these groups. The evaluation of the
program site will follow the methodology of one of our psychology professors who
specializes in evaluating undergraduate research programs, including other REU
programs at UMBC.
