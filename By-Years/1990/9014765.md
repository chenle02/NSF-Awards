The security of an electric power system is automatically and periodically
evaluated every few minutes by control center computers. Two main deficiencies
with the present analyses are the targets of this project. The index used to
measure the severity of a possible disturbance is the extent of the violations
for the post-contingency steady state conditions. The research in this project
is to improve this index by including the correctability of these violations.
The present analysis assumes that the post-contingency steady state is reached
without dynamic instabilities. In this work, the instabilities will be detected
and corrected. A main feature of the project is the use of parallel computation
to speed up these calculations -- especially the detection of the instabilities.
