This award will help to promote U.S.-Greece collaboration between Prof. Costas
Soukoulis of Iowa State University and Prof. E.N. Economou of the University of
Crete. The aim of the proposed work is to conduct research in the area of
disordered systems; in particular, to understand the fundamental mechanisms
responsible for the localization of light and other classical waves in random
systems. Until recently, most of the work on localization has focused on
electronic systems. Classical wave localization offers both the potential for a
direct check of localization theory as well as the possibility of understanding
other characteristics distinct from those of electrons. However, strong
localization of light has not been experimentally observed yet. What these
experienced collaborators intend to do is to improve our theoretical
understanding of the conditions under which localization of light, or more
generally, electromagnetic waves, can occur and make available several
configurations that will improve the search for the effect.
