Fundamental studies of nematic liquid crystals confined to micron and submicron-
size cavities in a solid polymer are described. The high surface-to-volume ratio
imposed by the cavities and the high density of cavities present in polymer
dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs) allow for NMR and light scattering studies of
unusual surface phenomena not possible before by these powerful experimental
methods. Unique measurements of surface anchoring energies, angles, and residing
times are proposed and experiments on the surface layer transition predicted by
theory are shown to be accessible by these techniques. Nematic director
configurations and modifications of the nematic-isotropic transition induced by
the confinement of a nematic liquid crystal to a small and highly curved cavity
will be studied. These basic studies are guided by applications of PDLCs in
light shutters for displays and other electrooptic devices. Other basic work to
investigate phase separation in the nematic phase essential to create new types
of PDLC materials and to determine the underlying reason for field induced
hysteresis of nematic configurations are topics which come from direct
interactions with applied and industrial interests in PDLC materials.
