Abstract

Award: DMS-9971628 Principal Investigator: Laszlo Lempert

The principal investigator will work on two topics. Motivated by examples from
geometry and physics, the investigator will study infinite dimensional complex
manifolds, especially the inhomogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equations on such
manifolds, a system of differential equations relevant to a host of geometrical
and analytical problems. If the program is successful, it may lead to extensions
of the Newlander--Nirenberg theorem concerning the very definition of complex
manifolds. There are very few methods to deal with complex analysis in an
infinite dimensional setting and one of the aims of this research will be to
invent the necessary tools. The other topic concerns embeddability of Cauchy--
Riemann manifolds. This research will focus on compact, strongly pseudoconvex
Cauchy--Riemann manifolds of dimension 3, which is the hardest dimension for the
subject. We will study how the size of the space of Cauchy--Riemann functions is
influenced by the geometry of the manifold itself, or by the geometry of complex
and almost complex manifolds spanned by the manifold. Another aspect is related
to discrete group actions on balls. The tools are from elliptic partial
differential equations, geometry and possibly algebraic geometry.

The main subjects of this research are functions of several, possibly infinitely
many variables. Such functions arise in the study of complicated systems that
can be described by a number of parameters. For example the position of a space
exploring rocket is described by three numbers, the coordinates; the rocket
might be spinning, in which case the speed by which it spins is also a
parameter, and so on. Other quantities may be determined by these parameters,
e.g. the necessary intensity of a radio signal to reach the rocket: they are
functions of the parameters. In addition to the above so called internal
parameters, there are also external parameters determined once the system is
constructed, e.g. its weight. This research investigates how certain functions
vary as parameters (internal, or external) are allowed to change a little; and
also how understanding "little" or even infinitesimal variations helps in
understanding large variations. Two specifics of this project are worth
mentioning. We will focus on parameters that are complex rather than real
numbers---despite its counterintuitive nature, this assumption has practical
value. Also, part of this project treats functions of infinitely many
parameters. Whether such systems exist in nature is up for debate, but
undoubtedly they represent approximations to systems with a huge number of
parameters, which do exist.
