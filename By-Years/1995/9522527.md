9522527 Salant Rotary lip seals are found in most machines containing rotating
shafts. Failure of the seals can lead to equipment failure and environmental
damage. During normal operation the seal surface is protected by a thin liquid
film that separates it from the shaft. However, during transient conditions the
film is not fully established and this will eventually lead to damage to the
lip, thereby limiting the life of the seal. In this project a numerical
elastohydrodynamic model of the transient behavior of the liquid film will be
developed, including fluid mechanics analysis of the film, solid body contact
mechanics between asperities on the two surfaces, structural analysis of the
lip, and analysis of the meniscus that separates the fluid from the atmosphere
on the air-side. The model will predict time histories of film thickness
distribution, contact force and fluid pressure distribution, cavitation and
starvation regions, torque, etc. The model will be validated with experimental
results and will be used for parametric studies to develop seal designs that
limit damage and extend seal life. ***
