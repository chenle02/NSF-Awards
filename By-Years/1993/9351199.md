The Chemistry Department will purchase a 200 MHz FT-NMR instrument for use in
four upper level chemistry laboratories and undergraduate research. It will
provide multinuclear capabilities and the introduction of two-dimensional
experiments. hands-on laboratory experience for our students. Thus, the
acquisition of a 200 MHz NMR spectrometer will not only allow the Department to
improve its curriculum in the theory and practice of nuclear magnetic resonance,
but the instrument will also enable chemistry majors to be trained in an
important experimental technique for the structural characterization of both
organic and inorganic compounds.
