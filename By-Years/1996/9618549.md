Dappen, Werner AST 96-18549 Drs. Dappen, Rogers, and Iglesias will continue
their theoretical work on the equation of state for stellar interiors. Knowledge
of the equation of state is of fundamental importance to the basic physics of
stellar structure and evolution. The investigators are particularly focused on
the use of helioseismic data from the GONG project and the SOHO experiment to
investigate and constrain details of the equation of state. They will also
calibrate a relatively simple equation of state representing the best physical
description for use in a wide range of stellar applications. ***
