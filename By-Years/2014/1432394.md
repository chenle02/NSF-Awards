Increasing persistence and retention in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) is essential for building a highly qualified STEM workforce.
This project at Rutgers University will support the development of a rigorous
and structured peer leader training program in STEM disciplines: Preparation in
STEM Leadership (PSL) Program. The PSL Program will serve as a model for
academic support services that moves beyond remedial support to create an
environment of scholarship and enrichment. Such a transformation will provide a
national model for maximizing the potential of academic support services using
similar active, collaborative, and student-centered methods. The complementary
development of content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and leadership and
communication skills at the college level will contribute to a better equipped
STEM workforce because these participants will be prepared for leadership
positions that involve mentoring, teaching, and training others. In addition,
this project will enable the compilation of a set of complementary valid and
reliable assessment instruments to measure the cognitive and professional
development of peer leaders. The evaluation of the PSL Program will identify
specific criteria essential for successful peer leader training, which will
serve as standards for programs within and beyond Rutgers. The PSL Program will
combine extended training in STEM content, mentoring, communication, leadership,
and group facilitation with a 3-credit, 300-level pedagogy course to create a
comprehensive professional development program. The PSL Program will be
evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to measure
learning gains in participants' content knowledge and pedagogical content
knowledge, changes in student?s attitudes and epistemological beliefs related to
learning science, improvement in job performance, and the development of
leadership and communication skills.
