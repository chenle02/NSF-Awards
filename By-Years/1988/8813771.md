Dr. Kinsey is supported by a grant from The Physicl Chemistry Program to
perform research in the field of molecular dynamics. Dr. Kinsey has devised
sophisticated spectroscopic measurement techniques which enable chemists to
observe individual molecules in the process of photodissociation after they have
absorbed a photon. The technique is being applied to photochemically important
atmospheric compounds such as ozone and hydrocarbons. When a molecule absorbs
photons of a wavelength that promote photodissociation, it usually falls apart
in a time which is short compared to the characteristic time for emission of
light. Thus only a very tiny fraction of the absorbed photons are re-emitted.
The spectroscopic properties of this miniscule minority are, however,
extraordinarily instructive in showing dynamic processes both in the
electronically excited state and in the ground state. Unusually long
progressions in ground-state vibrations appear. A time-dependent formulation of
Raman scattering reveals that the pattern of intensities in these wide-ranging
spectra relates directly to the excited-state potential energy surface. Dr.
Kinsey's research centers on extension and refinement of this newly discovered
approach to the dynamics of extremely short-lived molecules and stable ground
states. The approach will combine experimental and theoretical efforts to shed
light on the details of "half-collison" processes.
