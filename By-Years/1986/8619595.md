As the design of a complex object, such as a VLSI circuit, evolves, many
subcomponents are designed in parallel. Conflicts can arise when subcomponents
fail to meet the specifications that are assumed at a higher level, and
conflicts can also arise when two different representations of the same object,
such as the circuit and logic representations, become inequivalent due to
changes in one representation that are not reflected in the other. This research
project will investigate techniques for automatically detecting the presence of
conflicts through the information stored in an engineering information system
and will explore tools and methods for resolving detected conflicts. The process
of conflict recognition will be characterized by the use of complete and
formally correct methods to identify and classify all potential conflicts.
Conflict resolution will rely on artificial intelligence techniques involving
the use of encoded heuristic rules of thumb and human intervention as necessary.
The goal of this research is to construct a skeletal set of formal results on
conflict detection, enumeration, classification, and minimization, tailored to
the VLSI design process but applicable to other design domains.
