The University of Notre Dame will initiate a six-week, commuter, Young Scholars
project in biology, chemistry, engineering, physics, and mathematics for 35
students entering the 11th and 12th grades. This summer year program will
emphasize the study of general principles of research methods, literature
searches, hypothesis formulation, and qualitative and quantitative research
procedures. Participants are placed as members of teams working in research
laboratories in a variety of science and engineering disciplines where the
student applies this knowledge to the investigation of research hypotheses.
Monthly meetings to report on continuing research activities are scheduled for
the following academic year.
