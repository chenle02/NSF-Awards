The 29th Joint Meeting of the United States-Japan Panel on Wind and Seismic
Effects (UJNR) will be held in Tsukuba, Japan, on May 12-16, 1997. Funding for
the participation of five United States experts in wind engineering is provided
to promote exchange of information among experts from both countries and to
facilitate the development of cooperative research projects. The participation
of these experts is particularly important in light of the creation of a new
UJNR Task Group in Wind Engineering. The American Association for Wind
Engineering (AAWE), a non-profit professional organization, is responsible for
bringing these researchers to the meeting in keeping with its objectives of
stimulating wind engineering research and promoting the dissemination of
research findings.
