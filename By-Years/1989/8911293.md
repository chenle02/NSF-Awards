This is a multifaceted program aimed at diagnosing and understanding the
behavior of processes responsible for interannual fluctuations in the general
circulation and climate. There are three parts to the investigation. The first
part attempts to make better identification of the mechanisms responsible for
the interannual variations in tropospheric temperature discovered under the
current grant. The second intention is to explore the mechanisms responsible for
interannual variations in globally-integrated atmospheric angular momentum with
focus on the 1982-1983 El Nino event. The third task of the proposal is to
diagnose the intra-annual fluctuations in the different components of diabatic
heating and their role in generating available potential energy. The proposed
investigation is very important because the intended comparisons between the
large, model output and observed data sets will help to isolate the specific
deficiencies in the global observing network and the existing GCM formulations,
which should receive the highest priority by the scientific research community.
Equally important, this proposal will provide better understanding of the
atmospheric energy budget and angular momentum which could have significant
implications for understanding the climate processes.
