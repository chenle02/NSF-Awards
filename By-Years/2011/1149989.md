The objective of this project is to lay the foundation for comprehensive real-
time monitoring of traffic conditions throughout our urban streets and highways.
The end goal: a scalable, model-based sensor fusion system capable of merging
data from a large number of heterogeneous and geographically diverse sensors,
and maintaining a coherent view of sensed, and inferred, traffic conditions.
&lt;br/&gt;A city-wide, detailed and accurate view of current traffic conditions
enables improvements in a wide range of applications in transportation. A key to
achieving this goal affordabily is to find ways to extract more information from
existing sensor infrastructure. Through collaborations with the City of Chicago,
NAVTEQ, GCM Travel and the Chicago Transit Agency, the PI has access to Chicago-
area data from sensing modalities including underground magnetic loops as well
as bus, city-vehicle and crowd-sourced GPS traces. Complementing these sources
are opportunistic video feeds from security, red-light and other traffic
cameras, as well as vehicle re-identification based on radio frequency
transmitters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With increasing congestion, rising fuel
prices, and the threat of global warming, the need for improving the efficiency
of our transportation systems has never been greater. Comprehensive sensing and
inference of traffic conditions will help travelers make better travel decisions
and help traffic engineers identify and fix problems. This project combines
research with public service and open-source software development. The PI is
partnering with a local high-school to host traffic sensing research interns,
and the results from this project are used in a graduate course on
transportation sensing at UIC.
