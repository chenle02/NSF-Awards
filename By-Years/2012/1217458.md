This award explores connections between the computational complexity of
approximate counting problems and phase transitions in Statistical Physics
models. Recent work implies that the computational complexity of approximately
counting weighted independent sets in general graphs undergoes a phase
transition that coincides with a classical Statistical Physics phase transition
on trees. PI will explore whether such connections hold in other settings, for
example, the well-studied Ising model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another main theme
in this research are improved techniques for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods, which are often used in algorithms for randomly sampling from and
approximately counting the size of large sets of combinatorial objects. This
research has applications in a variety of fields which rely on MCMC algorithms,
including Statistical Physics and Bayesian inference of phylogeny in
Evolutionary Biology.
