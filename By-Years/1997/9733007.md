9733007 Moghe The research program of this career award is to develop a
technology to quantitatively evaluate matrix microstructure and the
corresponding cellular activities within biodegradable tissue analog matrices.
Specific aims are to: (1) develop a novel imaging methodology to quantitatively
investigate topological and bulk microstructure of 3-D biodegradable porous
tissue analogs under physiological conditions; (2) design novel microstructural
configurations of polymeric matrices that promote the phenotype and functions of
cultured liver cells; and (3) examine the effect of polymer degradation on the
topological and bulk matrix microstructure and the local physico-chemical
conditions to the physiology of liver cells. For the teaching component of this
award, the specific aims are to: (1) develop an innovative university-wide
curriculum in Tissue Engineering which reflects a focus on biomaterials
engineering; (2) establish a new course for students from regional high schools
with the goal of offering to selected students a broad study of bioengineering
as a field combining life sciences with the physical sciences and mathematics;
and (3) extend outreach to other universities and high schools by distance
instruction through an internet- based network. ***
