Robotic grippers used in industriall environments, in research projects, or by
individuals in unstructured environments tend to be bulky, expensive, limited in
use, or dependent on external drive components. This project will exploit
innovative and novel techniques to research and develop a self-contained robotic
gripper that can handle various object shapes and be attached to virtually any
robotic arm. The proposed modification and transformation of the robotic gripper
advances the use of robotics for individuals with disabilities to become more
independent and perform various activities of daily living
(ADL).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effective transformation of the proposed
technology will provide a great opportunity for researchers, manufacturers and
end-users to achieve a high level of robotic arm usability when performing ADL
and unstructured tasks.The PI and his team are involved in many outreach
activities to enhance educational and hands-on robotics applications and in
under-represnted and minority groups by allowing students to manipulate objects
with the gripper. The findings from this project will be disseminated broadly to
attarct researchers in the area of robotics.
