A station to receive, archive and process high resolution images from the NOAA
polar-orbiting satellites will be installed on board the R/V Thompson and
operated during the JGOFS cruises. Images of sea surface temperature will be
generated and will be accessible on the ship to support field studies requiring
real- time satellite coverage. After post-cruise quality control, the images
will be published on CD-ROMs for distribution to all JGOFS investigators. A
domain extending from 12.5oS to 12.5oN and 130oW to 145oW will be covered.
Processes that can be observed in this domain include the upwelling tongue along
the equator and the Intertropical Convergence Zone at 8oN. The data will be used
for statistical studies of the formation, evolution and decay of surface
temperature patterns, as well as for process-oriented studies for which
simultaneous shipboard sampling is available.
