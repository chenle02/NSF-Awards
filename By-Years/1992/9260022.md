Long-length remote sensor is proposed that will act as both a gas species
detection, identification, and quantification system (GSDIQS), and a temperature
measuring system (TMS). Particularly for use in downhole geothermal well
logging, the GSDIQS will use Raman scattering as the optical method to measure
such as CO2 and H2O vapor. Problems of fiber background have been solved through
the use of holographic and dielectric filters, and the use of a laser diode
source and telecommunication fiber-optics has extended the sensor lengths to 10
km. The TMS uses the same graded-index fiber-optic and diode source, and uses
the fluorescence amplitude dependence of Er:Glass with temperature (or other
material) as the near-IR temperature sensing mechanism.
