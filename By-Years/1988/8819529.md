The purpose of this Expedited Award for Novel Research (EANR) is to explore the
use of the ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique for determining
the nonlinear viscoelastic properties of thermoplastics. This seemingly obvious
application of ultrasonic NDE to nonlinear viscoelastic materials has never been
attempted in the past due to the nonuniqueness of the ultrasonic parameters
which are obtained through solving the inverse problem. Recent advances in the
modeling of nonlinear viscoelastic materials as well as the advances in
numerical analysis of nonlinear problems now provide the opportunity, possibly
prematurely, for the proposed research. Should this exploratory study
demonstrate the feasibility of using ultrasonic NDE techniques on nonlinear
viscoelastic materials, it will open a new research field in process control,
inspection and reliability assessment of commercially popular thermoplastics.
