9520898 Martin The institute of International Education (IIE) seeks $357,191
over four years from the National Science Foundation to implement the Global
Engineering Education Exchange (GE3), through which U.S. engineering
undergraduates can participate in overseas academic study and research for
credit, working in academic and corporate laboratories in Europe, Pacific Rim,
and Latin America. Through a consortium of U.S. and foreign engineering schools,
GE3 provides an efficient and cost-effective mechanism through which U.S.
faculty can secure overseas placements for large numbers of their students.
Participating students will maintain progress towards their degree while
studying and working abroad with academic mentors, at no additional tuition cost
and with stipends form internships offsetting overseas living cost.
