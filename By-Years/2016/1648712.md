Many of the optimization problems of interest to humanity are NP-hard and widely
believed not to have efficient algorithms. This includes problems in fields
ranging from operations research and economics to physics, chemistry, biology
and neuroscience. Even approximating NP-hard problems is often NP-hard, but
proving so rigorously is a difficult task, which - by a leap of thought - leads
to fundamental questions about the nature of proofs and their verification.
While this connection and the first proofs of NP-hardness of approximation were
discovered in the 1990's, even now, more than 20 years later, some of the most
difficult questions about checking of proofs and hardness of approximation
remain open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project attempts to answer such central
and difficult questions as the Sliding Scale Conjecture of Bellare, Goldwasser,
Lund and Russell and the Unique Games Conjecture of Khot. The Sliding Scale
Conjecture and its variants imply optimal hardness of approximation for problems
like Directed-Sparsest-Cut and Closest-Vector-Problem. The Unique Games
Conjecture implies optimal hardness of approximation for problems like Vertex-
Cover and Max-Cut, as well predicts the optimality of basic semidefinite
programming techniques for wide families of problems. Regarding the Sliding
Scale Conjecture, the project includes four lines of attack: through algebra,
through derandomized parallel repetition, through composition and through
algorithms (possible refutations). Regarding the Unique Games Conjecture, the
project focuses on a new and promising line of attack that involves a new
encoding scheme called the real code. Many of the problems considered in the
project are of interest well beyond their intended applications for PCP, for
example, to geometry, or, in the case of parallel repetition, to cryptography,
communication complexity and quantum computing. Both graduate and undergraduate
students would participate in this research activities.
