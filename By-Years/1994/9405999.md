9405999 Manning The project will continue experimental studies aimed at
providing data with which to evaluate high pressure fluid- rock interactions.
The proposed experiments will focus on determining solubilities of enstatite +
forsterite, diopside + enstatite, albite + quartz, and jadeite + quartz in H2O
at 5-25 kb and 400-900oC. Additional experiments will investigate the
compositions of natural slab dehydration fluids and fluid compositions in
equilibrium with eclogite. Results of this research will find application in
elucidating processes in in high pressure geologic environments such subducting
slabs, the mantle wedge, and Barrovian metamorphic belts.
