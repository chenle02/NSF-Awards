This proposal request funds to enable the continuance of a program of supporting
several small projects per year in macroeconomics and monetary economics by
Ph.D. dissertation writers and very recent Ph.D.'s. The program, formerly under
the auspices of the Federal Reserve, has enjoyed great success in the past in
encouraging a number of young economists to produce imaginative and significant
results at the critical stage of their professional careers. Professors Ando and
Sargent will administer the project under the auspices of the National Bureau of
Economic Research. Its basic objective is unchanged, namely, to target talented
individuals for research support at a time in their careers when financial
assistance is hardest to find.
