High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is one of the most effective tools
available in the modern chemistry laboratory for separating complex mixtures.
The objective of this project is to educate chemistry majors, and selected non-
science-majors and honors students, in the theory and use of this powerful
separation technique. Introductory courses are stressing qualitative separations
of simple mixtures using HPLC, while the more advanced courses are investigating
chromatographic theory, instrument optimization, and quantitative complex
separations. Incorporation of HPLC into the chemistry program is providing
students with the ability to recognize how and when to fully exploit
chromatographic separations in solving chemical problems.
