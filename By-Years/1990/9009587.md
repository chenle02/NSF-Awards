Inheritance networks are structures employed to represent common- sence
knowledge. Previous work has developed framework for specifying declarative
semantics of inheritance networks. This enables us to provide a model-theoretic
specification of the meaning that is conceptually simple and computationally
tractable. The current reasearch goal is to investigate implementation issues
concerning our inheritance theories and their extensions. This work will include
the design of efficient inheritance algorithms and analyses of their
computational complexity. The issue of interfacing inheritance networks with an
Expert System will also be considered. In particualr, this reserch will address
the question of the kinds of queries that are posed to a network, and will try
to develop special purpose algorithms for implementing them. Furthermore, there
seem to be equally well-motivated, yet significantly different interpretations
of certain network topologies. This is, in part, due to the fact that
inheritance networks are not sufficiently expressive. We will study this aspect
systematically, using the analysis to design a more expressive language that
will make explicit the available choices. A good understanding inheritance
reasoning will provide valuable insights to tackle challenging problems in the
reals of nonmonotonic reasoning.
