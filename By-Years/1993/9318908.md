9318908 Ramirez The physiological importance of progesterone and its metabolites
and their effect on the nervous system has been recognized for a long time.
However, the mechanism of action at the molecular level is not clear. Dr.
Ramirez will test the hypothesis that progesterone binds with the membrane of
nervous tissue and this leads to the control of release of another hormone known
as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. This work is important because it may
lead to a better understanding of the effect of steroid action upon mood and
behavior by paving the way for development of new pharmacological agents. ***
