SBR-9511420 Alberto Alesina, Harvard University The proposal seeks to support
ongoing NSF-supported research on the optimal size and composition of fiscal
jurisdictions. The main idea is that there is a tradeoff between large and small
governments: large governments can provide many public goods more efficiently,
but small government units can more closely mirror the preferences of their
citizens. Secessions and unions allow citizens to choose the size of their
political units. The questions raised have obvious bearing on such issues as:
the degree of fiscal and monetary coordination within the European Union, the
sudden disintegration of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the split-up of
Czechoslovakia, the re-unification of Germany, the growing separatist movements
in Canada, and the movement to transfer many fiscal programs-- from
environmental regulation to Medicare-- from the US federal government to the
states.
