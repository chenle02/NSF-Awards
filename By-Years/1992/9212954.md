Single species are often envisioned as relatively uniform entities that occupy a
single "niche." Recently, however, ecologists have discovered that single
species can consist of multiple specialists that occupy different niches.
Furthermore, ecological diversity within species can be heavily influenced by
other species in the community. The PIs will investigate this important subject
in pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), whose geographical range partially
overlaps with the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis machrochirus). Where they coexist,
bluegill are ecological generalists that often feed on zooplankton, while
pumpkinseed are ecological specialists that feed primarily on snails. In lakes
without bluegill, however, pumpkinseeds exist as two morphological forms, one of
which feeds on zooplankton. Thus, the ecological diversity that exists between
species in areas of sympatry is replaced by a comparable degree of ecological
diversity that exists within species in allopatry. From the standpoint of basic
science, the proposed research addresses fundamental questions involving
coevolution, adaptive radiations, phenotypic plasticity, and speciation. The
research will also have practical implications, especially by showing that
intraspecific variation cannot be ignored in studies of biodiversity.
