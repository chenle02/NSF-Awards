The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), in collaboration with the
National Park Service and other organizations, will organize a climate
adaptation science and education workshop that will focus on engaging diverse
public audiences in learning about climate adaptation. The outcomes of the
workshop will include: a strong regional network to continue and sustain the
initiative; a strategic plan for Sandy Hook that will result in model for using
parks as laboratories for climate adaptation education; and the identification
of existing climate adaptation education projects that can inform the strategic
plan and the model. These outcomes will have broad relevance for the many
environmental science and education projects funded by the Advancing Informal
STEM Learning Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop, centered on Gateway
National Recreation Area and surrounding New York/New Jersey communities, will
engage diverse stakeholders including community members, research scientists,
park staff, and others. Participants will assess and further develop research
findings that reveal the potential of place-based contexts, such as parks and
recreation areas, as settings for learning about global adaptation issues such
as sea level rise, impacts on fish habitat due to inundation and changes in
water quality, impacts on recreational fishery, and coastal resilience. Workshop
findings will be disseminated broadly through the NPCA national network,
national parks, and other organizations concerned with climate adaptation
education.
