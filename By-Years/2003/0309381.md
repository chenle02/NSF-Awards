Professors Robert Houk and Mark Gordon of Iowa State University are supported by
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to combine experiments and theory
to try to eliminate interferences in Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass
Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The idea is to study the origin of polyatomic ion signals
in order to eliminate them from the desired pure atomic ones. The approach is to
use calculations to tune conditions to minimize abundance of the undesirable
ions. Parameters include solvent load, the distance between the sampler and
skimmer and temperature of the sampler and skimmer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this instrument development project is to improve the precision and
accuracy of ICP-MS method, which is used widely in a broad range of applications
from materials science to geochemistry to biology for extremely sensitive atomic
analysis.
