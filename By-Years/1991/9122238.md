Before his 33rd birthday, Simon Kuznets introduced the logistic and Gompertz
curves to economic analysis, defined the key issues in the study of economic
growth, and laid the basis for the now standard seasonal adjustments for prices,
employment, and output. His next 15 years were devoted to the development of
national income accounts and their application to practical problems of
government. As chief statistician of the War Production Board, he demonstrated
the superiority of the national income approach in establishing wartime and
civilian production targets. During the balance on his career, Kuznets
concentrated on developing an empirically based theory of modern economic
growth, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Professor Robert Fogel and
Dean Enid Fogel are investigating the work of Simon S. Kuznets with the
objective not only of assessing his contributions to economics, but also of
showing how Kuznets' work helped to transform economics during the twentieth
century from a branch of moral philosophy to a discipline that provides an
important share of the individuals who make and implement economic policy in the
government and in business. They are examining both Kuznets' substantive
contribution to economic knowledge and his scientific methods. These methods, as
much as the substantive work, are a major factor in the transformation of
economics, yet they are now known only to a relatively limited circle of
empirical investigators.
