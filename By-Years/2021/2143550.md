In climate change research and outreach, much of the discussion is centered
around the amount of global warming the Earth is experiencing, i.e., by how much
the climate has warmed. Equally important and relevant is the rate at which this
warming occurs - how fast is the warming? The rate of warming fluctuates in
space and time. Acceleration in the rate of warming is of primary concern since
it might trigger climate change feedbacks. Furthermore, acceleration in the rate
of warming can leave less time for species to adapt in the future, threaten
biodiversity and ecosystem function, and impact communitiesâ€™ ability to adapt
and survive. The investigator will conduct statistical analysis of global
climate observations to identify coherent regions and periods with accelerated
rates of warming over the last two centuries. The investigator will then use
model simulations to identify the causes of the detected changes (human,
natural, or random) and to quantify future changes in the rate of warming
through the end of this century. Two graduate students will be part of the
research team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In concert with this research, the
investigator will develop freely available, accessible, and equitable resources
for students, educators, managers, policy makers, and the wider public. The
investigator will develop an open source, interactive, digital book, as a
resource for climate and environmental data science in the R programming
language and help fill the gap in data science training in environmental
sciences curricula, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. A user-
friendly dashboard will be developed with a team of undergraduate students to
visualize and monitor the pace of temperature change for different regions of
the world, including Indigenous ancestral lands. Through monitoring with the
dashboard, regions with accelerated rates of warming can be identified, which
will inform and extend the research as well as drive engagement with different
stakeholder groups. Monitoring the rate of climate change is crucial for timely
decisions by communities at risk, decision makers, and
stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
