9414361 Young The objective of this research is testing the project hypothesis
that ground penetrating radar (GPR) reflections are spatially correlated to
hydraulic conductivities and other soil properties. Such a non-invasive
geophysical method is needed to supplement direct sampling, to obtain nearly
continuous subsurface coverage efficiently, and to minimize operator exposure to
potentially dangerous materials. GPR data will be acquired in test areas for
which extensive subsurface material characterizations have already been
accomplished. Sites to be studied include saturated and unsaturated conditions,
with local sites in Michigan and also taking advantage of other field sites for
which a significant data base of hydraulic conductivity test results exists
(e.g. Mississippi, New Mexico, Cape Cod, and Canada). Statistical relationships
for spatial distributions will be sought between carefully obtained hydraulic
conductivity parameters and quantitative descriptors of radar reflections.
