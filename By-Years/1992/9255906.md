Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will initiate a four-week,
residential, Young Scholars project in manufacturing engineering for 30 students
entering 12th grade. This summer program places each participant in a series of
engineering research laboratories: manufacturing processes, computer aided
manufacturing, and robotics. Additional instruction is provided in statistics,
quality control, and automatic assembly and simulation. Field trips to
industrial engineering locations are provided. Project assignments will involve
the design and manufacture of an assembled component, and control and operation
of a workcell for automated assembly.
