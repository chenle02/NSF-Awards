The project entitled "School on Stochastic Analysis, Financial and Actuarial
Mathematics with Applications, in conjunction with the third International
Conference on Mathematics," will be held from April 22nd to May 3rd 2013 at the
University of Buea located in the city of Buea in the South West Region of
Cameroon. The school will take place from April 22nd to April 29th, while the
conference dovetails the school from April 30th to May 3rd. The goals for the
project are to bring together leading mathematicians and distinguished
professionals from the US and Europe whose specialties involve financial
mathematics, stochastic analysis and actuarial mathematics to give expository
lectures and present new advances that have real-life applications. They will
inform and educate students and faculty members, provide a medium for the
exchange of information and ideas among mathematical scientists, promote
research that can lead to new mathematical and computational methods and
techniques for science, industry, and society, and provide a medium for
mathematicians from the US and Europe to actively engage in the development of
mathematics and mathematical research with colleagues in Cameroon and Africa in
general. The school will provide individuals with interest in mathematical
finance and stochastic analysis a focused opportunity to learn new concepts,
discuss relevant questions, form mathematical and interdisciplinary networks,
initiate new problems and tackle collaboratively defined problems, and explore
the possibility of extending their collaboration beyond the school and
conference.

The broader significance and importance of the project are in the educational
training of a future generation of mathematicians for a global world, through
the expository lectures to be given; the equipping of students and educators in
sub-Saharan Africa with skill sets that can be useful in studying and
understanding the economic challenges of the growing economies in these regions;
the initiation of research collaborations between US and European mathematicians
and mathematicians from the Central and Sub-Saharan African region; the creation
of local and regional professional networks of mathematical scientists in
Africa; and the exposure of US students and faculty to an international
educational and cultural experience. The school/conference website is
http://bueaconference.com/buea-summer-school/ and it will serve as the initial
means of disseminating presentations and other materials as well as the source
point for post-school/conference networking.
