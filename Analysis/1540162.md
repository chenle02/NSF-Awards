This award supports travel for 12 US-based junior researchers to participate in
the International Workshop on Elliptic and Kinetic Differential Equations, held
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 6-17, 2015 at IMPA (Instituto Nacional de
Matematica Pura e Aplicada). The workshop is an important part of the thematic
program "Current Trends in Analysis and Partial Differential Equations" taking
place at IMPA from July through September, 2015.

The workshop brings together leading experts in analysis and partial
differential equations to deliver 10 introductory mini-courses (each with 3
lectures) over a period of two weeks, presenting a perspective on the current
trends on selected research topics and promoting interaction among researchers
with different areas of expertise. In addition to the mini-courses, the PI will
deliver a series of lectures on "Obstacle-Type Free Boundary Problems." The main
focus of the workshop is on the development of graduate students, postdoctoral
associates, and other junior researchers with diverse backgrounds, particularly
those from under-represented groups. More information of the workshop can be
found at http://www.impa.br/opencms/en/eventos/store/evento_1505
