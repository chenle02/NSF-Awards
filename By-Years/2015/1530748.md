This project develops new statistical techniques for extracting real-time
economic information from the prices of derivatives securities. The basic idea
is that option prices include information about market conditions, the general
pricing of risk, and the specific risk of a crash. The new method will be
valuable to a wide audience, ranging from researchers to policy makers and
regulators interested in the real time assessment of market and economic
conditions, including the probability and pricing of 'tail' events. The work
advances science in these fields and also promotes the national prosperity by
providing new techniques for gathering information useful to businesses and
policymakers from existing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team develops new
inference techniques to ensure satisfactory performance based on a parametric
model for option prices with minimal restrictions on the dynamics driving the
underlying asset prices. The estimated system embeds valuable information about
market conditions, the pricing of risk in general and crash risk in particular.
The team will apply these methods to predicting future equity returns,
extracting spot volatility, pricing volatility risk and volatility derivatives,
and documenting global linkages in market 'fears'. Formal inference and
specification testing for option pricing is difficult. Complications arise from
latent and persistent state variables, no-arbitrage constraints, nonlinear
pricing, unbalanced panels, sizeable measurement errors and time-varying risk
premiums. The PIs develop procedures inspired by methods for nonparametric
volatility estimation from high-frequency time series data. The extension to a
parametric cross-sectional setting provides the tools for model evaluation, and
they will obtain joint asymptotic distributional results for high frequency and
option implied volatility estimators.
