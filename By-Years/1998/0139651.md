North Dakota State University (NDSU) is organizing what it refers to as "The
First Virtual Conference on Genomics and Bioinformatics" to be held on October
15-16, 2001. NDSU will be using technology jointly funded, originally, by ANIR
and EPSCoR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the conference are to "1)
transcend geographical and economical factors limiting researchers around the
world, 2) increase the exchange of ideas and establish new ways of collaborating
with others and 3) establish new ways to excite the K-20 community about today's
multidisciplinary science." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some speakers will participate
from the NDSU campus while others will "telecommute" via the Access Grid.
Individuals will be able to participate from Access Grid Node sites around the
world and via real-time video-streaming technology from their computer desktops.
