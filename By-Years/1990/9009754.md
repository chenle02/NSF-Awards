The goal of this research is to explore the microstructural details and
macroscopic consequences of polymer grafted colloidal particles in aqueous
media. Novel grafting techniques utilizing biochemical linking agents will be
used to graft poly(ethylene oxide) or other polymers onto functionalized
polystyrene or silica particles. The efficacy of the analytical techniques,
including UV absorbance, NMR spectroscopy, static and dynamic light scattering,
and dielectric spectroscopy. Rheological measurements, including capillary
viscometry, steady shear and constant stress viscometry, oscillation, and stress
relaxation, yield insights regarding polymer-mediated interparticle forces and
the suspension microstructure. The dielectric spectroscopy technique will be
extended to concentrated suspensions containing grafted polymer. These
measurements will be combined with extended theoretical models of polymer layer
structure, interparticle forces, and suspension rheology in order to rationalize
the observed equilibrium properties and dynamic behavior.
