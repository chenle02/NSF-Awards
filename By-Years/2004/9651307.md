This project involves the purchase of equipment to convert an existing studio
classroom to a large, efficient facility that will enable the implementation of
the pioneering Rensselaer studio classroom method to several upper-level
undergraduate courses. This nationally recognized, innovative mode of
instruction combines lectures, laboratory, recitation, and computer simulations
in a single room, maximizing efficient application of concepts and interactive
learning.
