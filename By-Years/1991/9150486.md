Because of the multidisciplinary nature of biotechnology, its incorporation into
existing undergraduate introductory science courses, such as biology and
chemistry, can contribute to the enrichment of these courses, as well begin to
demonstrate lateral and horizontal connections between sciences which have been
traditionally perceived as distinctly independent scientific disciplines. This
proposal outlines a strategy for the development of high quality, creative
curriculum models which will place emphasis on transferring basic core
technology (theory, research and experimental procedures) utilized in
biotechnology and adapt them to fit within the structure of the educational
setting. The primary focus of these curriculum models will to be incorporate
core technology, through theory and "hands-on" experiments, within a context
that directly correlates and demonstrates relationships to recent developments
and applications of biotechnology in such areas as medicine, agriculture,
forensics and industrial procedures and processes. The faculty participants will
develop curriculum modules which will be implemented and field tested at their
respective colleges. Based upon field test evaluations, the curriculum modules
will be refined, modified and re- implemented, and will provide the basis for
the development of a biotechnology Curriculum and Resource Manual for widespread
dissemination to undergraduate faculty. The project's overall strategy strives
to help promote scientific literacy to aid students in making important future
decision which will affect their personal lives, as well as stimulate and
influence some students to continue in scientific studies.
