As part of a series of research projects aimed at marrying machine learning
technology to economically important problems, this project in concerned with
the task of finding errors in databases. Because many database situations do not
afford the luxury of a surplus programmer, machine learning methods are used to
construct prescriptive data models. These models predict appropriate values for
data attributes, and if actual values differ, an alarm is raised. Two basic
research issues in database consistency checking are studied. First, fundamental
limitation of a common class of learning methods is identified, then a new
learning formulation is proposed. Second, this research reiterates the need to
incorporate expert knowledge into the learning process, and a space of possible
approaches. Understanding of the resulting new methods will lead to advances in
the quality and applicability of database consistency systems, and as a
consequence, to improved performance in the wide variety of systems that rely on
high quality data.
