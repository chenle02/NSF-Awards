9452296 Creasy An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer
(ICP), a shatter box for grinding samples, and a microwave digester for sample
dissolution are allowing for the quantitative chemical analyses of waters,
soils, and rocks in an undergraduate curriculum. The ICP is uniquely adapted to
the multi-element analytical needs of our project-oriented curriculum. Students
in geology are studying a wide range of geochemical processes through field and
laboratory research at all levels in the curriculum. The addition of the ICP is
allowing: (1) introduction of a new geochemistry course; (2) development of new
field- and laboratory-based analytical projects in existing courses (aqueous
geochemistry, petrology, and hydrogeology) and in two current field courses and;
(3) expanded opportunities for independent student research. The ICP permits
students to obtain whole-rock chemical analyses and thus adds a dimension to
their interpretation of petrologic processes. Students at Bates College address
problems in environmental geochemistry through courses and research
opportunities offered by faculty in geology and chemistry. The ICP reinforces
existing interdepartmental connections and the interdisciplinary nature of
research.
