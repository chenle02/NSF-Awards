This project, jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Division of Biological
Instrumentation and Resources, addresses two hypotheses. First, that a highly
orientationally ordered, functional protein film can be self-organized by
adsorption at a highly ordered liquid/solid interface and that the orientational
order of this film can be controlled by changing the nature of this interface,
and second, that biochemical function in a protein film is dependent on
macroscopic orientational order. The objective of this study is to provide a
more detailed understanding of protein films for applications in biosensing and
bioseparations devices. During the tenure of this thirty-four month continuing
grant, Professor Saavedra, a chemist, and Dr. Li, an optical scientist, will
cooperatively apply polarized reflection spectroscopies, namely planar
integrated optical waveguide-attenuated total reflection (IOW-ATR) and total
internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), to the in situ characterization of the
structure and function of cytochrome c and myoglobin films at the solid-liquid
interface. This research addresses both the preparation of ordered, functional
protein films and the development of analytical techniques appropriate to
characterize these films. The successful development of a general methodology to
self-organize proteins into oriented two-dimensional arrays would be highly
useful for biotechnological applications. Also, this research should give rise
to a clearer understanding of relationships between the structure of hydrated
protein films and their macroscopic properties which should aid in protein film
design and applications.
