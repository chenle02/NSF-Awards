This research is primarily devoted to the study of the geometric analysis
associated to heat kernel and Wiener measures on path and loop spaces of
Riemannian manifolds. The P.I. will continue his study of finite dimensional
approximations to path integral formulas on path and loop spaces over compact
Riemannian manifolds. It is hoped that these approximations will lead to: 1) a
rigorous interpretation of the heuristic path integral proofs of the Atiyah--
Singer index theorem, 2) construction of Brownian motions on path and loop
spaces, 3) construction of non-trivial harmonic differential forms on loop
groups, and 4) construction of Dirac operators on loop spaces. These goals are
consistent with the principal investigators ongoing project to understand index
theorems and the Hodge -- de Rham theorem for loop spaces. It is also proposed
to try to generalize a result (related to the Segal Bargmann transform) of L.
Gross and the P.I. from complex finite dimensional groups to complex loop
groups.

Spaces of loops naturally arise in the mathematical study of surfaces and of
higher dimensional manifolds. For example, if there is a loop on a surface that
can not be deformed to a point without tearing the loop apart, then the surface
must contain a "hole." (Think of the surface of a doughnut versus the surface of
a sphere.) The physicists' string theory description of the fundamental
particles of nature also use loops or "strings." The quantum mechanical
treatment of string theory leads to problems similar to those proposed for study
by the P.I. This proposal is devoted to answering basic mathematical questions
about the (Feynman) path integral formulation of quantum mechanics on both
finite dimensional curved surfaces and on the loops on such surfaces. As a by-
product of this research, the P.I. hopes to make rigorous the very beautiful
physics argument for the so-called Atiyah-Singer Index theorem. This index
theorem is arguably one of the most striking mathematical developments of this
century and it has had far reaching implications in both mathematics and in
physics.
