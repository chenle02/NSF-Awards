An understanding of transient intermediates, such as radicals, ion radicals, and
carbenes, is vital for a thorough understanding of reactions and reaction
mechanisms in physical, organic, and biochemistry. The ability to study these
short-lived intermediate by laser transient absorption spectroscopy allows for a
greater understanding of these important species. This project provides a solid
state Nd:YAG-pumped OPO laser system and the necessary equipment to set up a
transient absorption system. The equipment can be used in the undergraduate
advanced organic and physical chemistry laboratories to familiarize the students
with modern laser technology and to generate, characterize, and study transient
species. In addition to transient absorption measurements, the laser system can
be used to generate steady-state populations of transient species for study by
EPR spectroscopy. *
