The Co-PI, Samuel Shearer, under the supervision of the PI, Charles Piot, will
explore how urban planning projects are managed, debated, and implemented in
contexts undergoing rapid socioeconomic transformation. The research focuses on
Kigali City Master Plan - a fifty-year urban planning project that the Rwandan
government and its planning partners call a model of sustainable urban growth,
environmental design, and economic development. Financed by international
investors and outsourced to architecture firms in Singapore, and Boulder,
Colorado, the Kigali City Master Plan is emblematic of flexible forms of urban
planning that activate global networks of capital and expertise. The Master Plan
also promises to demolish much of the city's current built environment to
produce something entirely new: a holistic urban project, a vector of capital
flow, and an entr√©e into the world economy. In the process hundreds of thousands
of Kigali's residents will lose dwelling and work places. Yet surprisingly,
those residents who are most vulnerable to losing their homes also dream along
with urban planners and government officials of the better future the plan
promises. Through informal interviews, participant observation, and critical
analysis of the Master Plan and related media, this research will investigate
this paradox and will examine the relationship between urban growth practices
and the ideals that provide the vital energy for large-scale planning
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to anthropology, this research
engages debates in urban studies, architecture and African studies. The research
will examine how built spaces, are produced by social, political, and economic
processes. This study will use the theoretical and methodological toolkit
available in anthropology, geography, and political economy to engage debates
over the planning process and its implementation and asks how the inhabitants of
Kigali will share the social costs of producing their new city. In doing so, it
aims to produce knowledge on a crucial question: how humans will inhabit a world
that is increasingly becoming urban. The research also contributes to the
training of a graduate student in anthropology.
