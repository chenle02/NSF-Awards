This award provides funds for an REU Site focusing on social and environmental
issues association with globalization in Latin America. This intensive eight-
week summer program will be based in Merida, Mexico and housed at the
Universidad Auntonoma de Yucatan. The intellectual focus of the project is
economic geography, and the primary objective is to provide a diverse group of
undergraduate students from a variety of academic disciplines with the
opportunity to work collaboratively on inter-disciplinary research in an
international setting. Based on their backgrounds and academic interests,
students will carry out research on social and environmental topics under the
close supervision of WMU and local faculty. Specifically, undergraduates will
learn how to design, conduct, and report applied field-based research.
Furthermore, in carrying out their research, students will gain first-hand
appreciation of the social and environmental problems associated with
globalization in Latin America. REU students will be challenged to understand
how local outcomes are related to global processes and, in doing so, will be
encouraged to use a variety of viewpoints and methods to carry out their
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's
continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
active undergraduate research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;
