This EAGER grant explores early concepts of a new approach to computer
programming. The semantic gap between what the programmer intends and what the
code actually means significantly impedes efforts to improve programmer
productivity, software reliability, and execution efficiency. To address the
semantic gap, the project radically rethinks how to develop software. A new
programming model, methodology, and system for ?gradual programming? will
support the development of programs and programming language semantics in
parallel. The vision advocates developing programs in a family of languages with
varying semantics. Then, part of the development process involves nailing down
the precise semantics of the program. A key issue involves the tradeoffs between
expressiveness of a programming language and the ability to build tools capable
of statically checking for programming errors. Such a vision is not without
significant challenges and possible pitfalls, such as maintaining performance,
and entrusting issues of programming language design to programmers. The project
will study the sources of the semantic gap in the Java programming language to
understand the problem better and articulate the approach more fully.
