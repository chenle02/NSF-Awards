The School of Electrical Engineering at Cornell University will purchase
Scanning Tunneling Microscope equipment and software which will be dedicated to
support research in engineering. The equipment will be used for several research
projects, including in particular: the NSF sponsored project "Microdynamics and
Nanodynamics: Materials Structure and Devices: the Semiconductor Research
Corporation project, "Massively Parallel Electron Beam Architecture for Electron
Beam Lithography; and a DARPA sponsored project (with Raytheon) on RF Vacuum
Microelectronics. All these projects use 20 nm diameter silicon tips or arrays
of silicon tips to produce tunneling microscope devices or to produce field
emitter arrays for electron beam instrumentation, or vacuum microelectronic
devices. We have designed a unique nanoelectromechanical instrument: a high-
speed (5 MHz) scanning tunneling device to be used to make unique sensors to
detect sound, radiation, mass, pressure, and acceleration. The Scanning
Tunneling Microscope (STM) equipment and software requested in this proposal
will be used to drive our nanoelectromechanical tunneling devices and to
characterize the tip formation processed for both silicon field and tunneling
tip structures.
