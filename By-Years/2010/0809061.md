An award is made to the Entomological Society of America to support
participation by US entomologists in the XXIII International Congress of
Entomology in Durban, South Africa, in July, 2008. The International
Entomological Congress presents an exceptional opportunity for entomologists
from around the world to exchange ideas and build collaborative relationships.
The Entomological Society of America will use National Science Foundation
support to assist 15-18 students and junior faculty from the United States in
attending the Congress to present their research and communicate with
entomologists from around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first
International Congress on the African continent. As such it presents a unique
opportunity to foster international collaboration with African scientists. In
addition to international collaboration, the Entomological Society of America is
particularly interested in supporting participants whose research is relevant to
international entomological concerns such as invasive species and discovery and
documentation of biological diversity. The NSF Office of International Science
and Engineering recognizes the opportunities for international collaboration and
is contributing to fund this award.&lt;br/&gt;
