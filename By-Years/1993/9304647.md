The consumption of oceanic plates beneath continental plates at subduction zones
is a fundamental component of seafloor spreading. The subduction of active
spreading ridges at these zones is thought to produce profound changes to the
overriding plate in terms of magmatism, mineral deposits, structural deveopment,
as well as sedimentation and development of the accretionary wedge that builds
up at the edge of the subduction zone. This later phenomena is poorly understood
but important because accretionary wedges contain some of the world's largest
oil and gas deposits. This project will collect new field structural data and
use theoretical analysis to construct 3-D models of the accretionary wedge.
These new data will provide the sort of database needed to test recent
evolutionary models.
