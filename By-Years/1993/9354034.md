9354034 Hillman The Temple University's Colleges of Arts & Sciences, Education,
and Engineering & Architecture, the Community College of Philadelphia, the
School District of Philadelphia and PATHS/PRISM-the Education Partnership have
joined to develop a new model for the education of prospective K-12 teachers
which integrates new teaching methodologies with math and science core content
courses. Since Temple University, in conjunction with Community College, is the
major teacher preparation institution for the Philadelphia School District, this
will have a systemic impact on the 200,000 students in the Philadelphia School
District and serve as a national urban model. The Collaborative will revise
selected basic college math and sciences courses to reflect closely the
pedagogies and content that the students will need as teachers. These revisions
will include: enhanced faculty/student interaction, appropriate instructional
materials, inquiry- intensive methodologies as well as new technologies. Several
courses will be developed and modified, including, for example, a team-taught
cross-disciplinary science course and a cognitive psychology course. Prospective
teachers will participate in practica early in their pre-service training at
specially selected Professional Development schools. Practicum supervisors will
join intending teachers in seminars to reinforce content and pedagogy. The model
will include expansion of Temple's 5-year teacher education program in which
students who major in Arts & Sciences and minor in education are certified after
completing their 5th year. University and Community College faculty will
participate in intensive staff development and cross-class visitations with
School District teachers. After careful evaluation, the model will be widely
disseminated through a national conference and a variety of presentations.
