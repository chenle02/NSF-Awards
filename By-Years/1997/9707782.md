The Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University will purchase computer
equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects in
mathematics, including in particular: Stochastic spatial models in the
biological sciences Computational analysis of dynamical systems Computational
research in coding theory Computational Algebraic Geometry Computation of
Eigenvalues and Applications
