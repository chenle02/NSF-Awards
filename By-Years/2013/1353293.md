Testing Technologies in the Behavioral Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the
supervision of John Carson, Ph.D. student Katerina Mishuris will document the
science behind and technologies developed for mental health and intelligence
testing. With a focus on gifted children, and gender differences, the co-PI will
contribute to the history of the behavioral sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
identification and nurturing of gifted children, is important to contemporary
democracies, where intellectual and artistic capital is essential to the
advancement of national prosperity. This study promises to help behavioral
scientists, who are exploring questions of talent, to better comprehend
conflicting theories of child giftedness and the methods for its investigation,
and hence allow them to become more sensitive and alert researchers and
diagnosticians.
