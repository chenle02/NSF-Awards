This North Carolina State University project: Research Scholars Program in
Mathematics is a continuation of their existing and effective four year S-STEM
grant. The current project intends to provide scholarships to six undergraduates
and eight graduate students in mathematics. The focus of the program will be on
junior and senior undergraduates and graduate students in their first two years
of study with special attention being paid to members of underrepresented
groups. Particularly noteworthy is that all scholars, both undergraduate and
graduate, will have the opportunity to be involved in either research or an
internship. Additionally, scholars will attend weekly Professional Development
Modules (where they will learn skills such as LaTex, Matlab, PowerPoint, etc.)
and monthly seminars and will be mentored individually by a faculty member. The
Research Scholars Program infrastructure can be adapted to other disciplines and
will benefit not only students at NCSU, but can also impact the discipline of
mathematics itself.
