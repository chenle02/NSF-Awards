Michael Sponsler, Department of Chemistry, Syracuse University, is supported by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for studies of
"metathesis-doped polyacetylene". He is incorporating metathesis-active
ruthenium compounds into films of polyacetylene to determine the electronic
properties of conjugated organometallic structures. By capping polyacetylene
oligomers with ruthenium compounds, long-chain ruthenapolyenes and
diruthenapolyenes can be prepared in viscous solution and thin films, where they
should be stable. The conductivity of these films will be measured and
correlated with various structural parameters. In a related component of this
research, modified ruthenium complexes will be used to make connections between
nanoscale and macroscale electronic components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports high risk/high impact research in
molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This interdisciplinary project will
also provide graduate and undergraduate students with training in these
important areas.
