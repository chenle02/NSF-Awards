Previous work of Dr. Shapirio has reinforced the view of bacterial colonies as
highly organized, differentiated structures with specific developmental
histories. Work with E. coli strains carrying various lac fusion elements has
raised detailed questions about the cellular and molecular events involved in
pattern formation during colony development. Some of these questions pertaining
to patterns of cellular differentiation can be answered by a more detailed
microscopic analysis of colony structure using histochemical, immunological and
in situ hybridization technologies. Identification of the components of
multicellular control systems will be initiated by standard molecular genetic
methods (transposon mutagenesis, cloning and testing of known regulatory
mutations). Further material for identifying currently unpredictable changes in
morphogenetic regulatory systems has become available through the appearance of
sectors containing bacteria that display novel hereditary patterns of gene
expression, colony development and cell division. The novel phenotypes expressed
by these bacteria can be characterized by the same methods that will be applied
to normal colonies, and the nature of the hereditary changes in them can be
examined by DNA transfer and cloning procedures. Once all these studies have
begun to provide a more precise picture of colony structure and its underlying
genetic control, it will be possible to begin investigating what happens when
many bacterial cells in a multicellular inoculum organize themselves to undergo
a regular developmental sequence. %%% Dr. Shapiro has provided some evidence
that colony development in bacteria shows some distinct temporal changes in
morphology. He proposes that this can be used as a model to obtain information
about how multicellular organisms develop and differentiate. His work is unique
in this area and could lead to the development of powerful models for the study
of differentiation.
