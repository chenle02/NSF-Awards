This grant is in the areas of engineering and analytical chemistry and in the
subarea of chromatography. Professor Lochmuller will study the design and
application of a continuous, open-channel, isoelectric focusing system that will
separate ampholytes of broad size scale using thermally produced pH gradients.
This research will aim to develop both batch and continuous isoelectric focusing
systems whose separating capabilities will arise from thermally produced pH
gradients. The long- term impact of this research will be in the development of
simple, preparative isoelectric focusing instruments, as opposed to existing
analytical instruments, that are capable of resolving and efficiently separating
both large proteins and whole cells.
