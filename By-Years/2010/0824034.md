The objective of this research is the discovery, investigation, and application
of low loss, high dielectric constant artificial electromagnetic materials at
high frequencies. Of particular interest are materials that can be printed with
low temperature methods enabling their direct integration into a wide range of
electromagnetic devices. The approach is based on a comprehensive plan of
theory, simulation, fabrication and measurement of these materials to prove
their properties.

Intellectual Merit: The main focus of this research is on multi-scale artificial
dielectric materials. Potentially transformative properties of this new class of
materials for RF/microwave circuits are obtained through simultaneous
incorporation of multiple dielectric enhancement effects on different length
scales resulting in a very large effective dielectric constant with small loss
tangent. The key attributes of these multi-scale artificial dielectrics that
distinguish them from others are low loss and printability. Using these
properties and their spatial tailorability, the new artificial materials will be
applied to (1) planar antenna miniaturization and gain enhancement, and (2)
microwave filter performance enhancement and miniaturization.

Broader Impacts: It is anticipated that this new technology will have broad
engineering application with special benefit to society. Wide utilization of
this technology is foreseen in industrial and academic labs that can benefit
from such artificial materials but have been prevented by complexities in
designing, manufacturing, and integrating these materials into their devices and
subsystems. The research will include both graduate and undergraduate student
participation. The research findings will be integrated into two graduate
courses and parts disseminated via the internet.
