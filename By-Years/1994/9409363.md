9409363 Yarmush This American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering
(AIMBE) conference will examine the need for a more quantitative and integrated
approach in future developments of biotechnology and the role of engineering in
meeting this challenge. Outstanding investigators and prominent policy-makers
will present their views on technical and policy issues impacting on the
engineering and science base for biotechnology. This overall theme is to be
developed over a two-day meeting that is expected to attract 300-500
participants. Leaders in the bioengineering and medical communities are to
become aware of: (1) the diversity of contributions that engineers have made in
advancing the field of biotechnology; and (2) important areas that require
engineering insight and know-how for future developments.
