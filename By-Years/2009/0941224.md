The goal of the project, which builds on prior NSF support, is to develop
haptics-augmented software activities and Internet-based tutorials and to
integrat these tools into undergraduate statics and dynamics engineering
courses. Specifically the investigators are (1) developing a full suite of
haptics-augmented statics and dynamics activities to complement standard
textbooks; (2) evaluating these products in two large engineering schools; (3)
developing curricula that integrates these products into statics and dynamics
courses; (4) applying educational pedagogy research for experiential inquiry-
based learning and implementing a learner-based hypothesis generation and
testing procedure to encourage learners to translate tactile responses to their
real world causes; and (5) using a design research approach in the evaluation
process to make it an integral part of the development process. They are working
to commercialize a unique CD-based set of software activities and tutorials that
will enable students to change parameters, predict answers, interact with
animations, and feel the results through the haptic device. The evaluation
effort, under the direction of an experienced, independent evaluator, is
examining student work captured on video along with student surveys and focus
groups to monitor student learning. The broader impacts will include the
dissemination of their products and results, particularly through
commercialization and linking the material to successful textbooks.
