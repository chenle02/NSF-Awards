The Research Experience for Undergraduates in Industrial Mathematics and
Statistics at WPI provides a unique educational experience for students of
mathematics by introducing them to research in an industrial environment. The
students work in teams on problems provided by local business and industry. They
work closely with a company representative to define the problem and develop
solutions of immediate value to the company. They work closely with a faculty
advisor to maintain a clear focus on the mathematics and statistics at the core
of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve undergraduates will participate
each summer. A team of three-four students will work on each of the industrial
projects. Students are assigned to a project according to their interest and
course background, but in most cases the work requires knowledge and tools from
several areas of mathematics and statistics. Each team makes weekly progress
reports to the full group and all students participate in these presentations.
At the end of the program, each team provides a final written report as well as
a final public oral presentation summarizing the results of their research. This
project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
(OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
