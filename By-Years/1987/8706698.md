A Wind Engineering Symposium on High Winds and Building Codes will take place in
Kansas City Missouri, November 2-4, 1987. The U.S. Wind Engineering Research
Council (WERC) will sponsor this meeting that will deal specifically with the
information generated by recent research that has been, can be, or should be
incorporated into building codes and standards. The symposium will facilitate
the transfer of this information as well as revealing new areas of wind
engineering research of greater importance to the safety of buildings. The
meeting will include sessions on: the ANSI standards and model codes such as
BOCA, UBC and Southern; important regional, state and city codes; and comparison
and analysis of diverse codes and standards. A few state-of-the-art foreign
oodes, e.g., from Canada and Australia, will be discussed as well. The papers
presented and the panel discussions will be published in the form of
proceedings. The P.I. is a well recognized specialist in wind engineering and
quite capable to carry out this work and to produce a quality product. He will
furnish NSF with twenty volumes of the resulting proceedings. An award is
recommended.
