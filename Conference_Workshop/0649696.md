The Fields Institute will mount an intensive program on Operator Algebras and
Applications during the period July through December 2007. A large number of
researchers and postdoctoral fellows will be in residence at the Institute
during this period, and more will visit during the program's three workshops. A
significant number of postdoctoral fellows will visit the Firelds Institute for
the entire program. The Fields Institute will fund the program and support it
logistically. This application uses funding from the NSF to bring US
mathematicians to this program and support them while they are there. The funds
are used principally to support mathematicians, especially junior
mathematicians, who do not have other sources of support.
