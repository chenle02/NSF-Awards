AST-0352989/Potter, U. Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support the
development of a photometer/polarimeter that will achieve photometric accuracies
as good as one part in 100,000. This is approximately a 50 times improvement
over accuracies presently available with existing panoramic solid-state detector
arrays (like charge coupled devices). The instrument will allow 2 meter class
telescopes to achieve sufficient photometric sensitivity to detect circumstellar
debris disks around the nearest stars at a level of only ten times that of our
present day solar system, and to detect intensity variations caused by the
changing phases of reflected light from orbiting planets. This instrument may
influence future instrument designs to make the next generation of large
telescopes several orders of magnitude more sensitive and efficient photon
collectors.&lt;br/&gt;
