This research is concerned with the design and development of numerical methods
for modeling fluid interfaces and the application of these methods to the study
of fundamental problems in fluid mechanics. An important goal of this work is to
develop accurate and efficient algorithms for modeling three dimensional
problems. The interface tracking algorithms considered are generally of the
volume-of-fluid type. Some generalizations of this type of algorithm, based on
conservative shock tracking ideas, are also considered. These algorithms will be
used, in conjunction with adaptive mesh refinement and high order numerical
methods for approximating solutions of the compressible Euler equations, to
study shock wave refraction and the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. In addition,
they will also be used with a second order projection method to study the
Rayleigh- Taylor instability in incompressible flow. Studies of fluid dynamics
have a long and honorable history, with many applications in engineering, earth
and ocean sciences, among others.
