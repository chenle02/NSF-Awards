A one-year research program is proposed to develop new optical sources such as
widely tunable optical parametric oscillators and ultra-violet femtosecond laser
sources based on the new nonlinear optical crystal barium metaborate (BBO). The
investigators of this proposal have recently succeeded in growing large crystals
of BBO for the first time in this country. However, much work remains to perfect
the growth technology and to characterize completely this new crystal. They
propose to concentrate on the following tasks: (1) perfect the growth technology
of large BBO crystals; (2) complete characterization of BBO crystals; (3)
develop femtosecond uv laser sources using intra-cavity doubling in BBO.
