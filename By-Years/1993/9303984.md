The proposer intends to devote most of his research effort on problems in the
analytic theory of minimal submanifolds. In particular, questions about the
nature of singularities will be addressed. Under consideration, will be the
question of what types of singularities can occur, and whether singularities can
be perturbed away, by perturbing the data (that is, the boundary, or the
background metric), especially in codimension one. Similar problems in the
theory of harmonic maps, and complete metrics of constant scalar curvature will
be studied.
