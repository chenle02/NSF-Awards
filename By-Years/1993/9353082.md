9353082 Allen This conference proposal brings a total of 75 teachers from across
the country to the Supercomputing '93 conference held in Portland, OR, for
special educators' workshops and presentations. The two- days of sessions
include hands-on workshops, presentations and demonstrations including some
given by representatives of currently successful high school supercomputing
programs. Teachers will also have a chance to visit the exhibits, poster
session, and special presentations at the conference. Cost sharing is providing
hardware for the workshops, cables and connections, busses for Sunday and
Monday, other supplies, printing, postage and advertising costs. This is
estimated at 41% of the project.
