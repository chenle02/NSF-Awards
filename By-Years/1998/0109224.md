This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Statistical
tools for analyzing gene expression data." The goal of this research is to
develop statistical tools for analyzing gene expression data derived from DNA
microarray experiments and to generate an analytical framework for relating
distributions of gene expression profiles to variation in phenotypic traits.
Particular emphasis is being paid to developing methodologies that incorporate a
priori biological knowledge and that facilitate the development and testing of
biological hypotheses.
