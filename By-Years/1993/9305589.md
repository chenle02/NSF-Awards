In April 1992, a team consisting of David Applegate of AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories, Robert Bixby of Rice University, Vasek Chvatal of Rutgers
University, and William Cook of Bellcore established a new world record by
solving ten previously unsolved problems, with sizes ranging from 1,060 to 3,038
cities, from a standard library of test data called TSPLib. (In particular, the
3,038-city problem is the largest TSPLib instance ever solved.) The task of
writing up an exposition of the new algorithm is overwhelming: the program,
developed by four people in the course of four years has some 50 thousand lines
not counting the part that implements the simplex method. The award is so that
Chvatal can buy himself out of his teaching duties at Rutgers for the Spring
term of 1993 in order to dedicate himself full-time to writing in constant
consultations with his colleagues at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in Murray Hills, NJ and
Bellcore in Morristown, NJ.
