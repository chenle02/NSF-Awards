This work proposes to undertake a systematic study of the hydrogen and oxygen
isotopic composition of the waters of the Black Sea. These data will establish
the origin of the various water units, their mixing patterns and rates. As there
are several sources of freshwater input in the Black Sea, simple salinity
measurements cannot reveal this information. These data in conjunction with
noble gas, 14C, tritium and other radioactive tracer work proposed for the
forthcoming Black Sea cruises will enable a more clear understanding of the
circulation mechanisms and patterns of the Black Sea. A secondary objective of
this proposal is to determine what influence, if any, the decomposition of
organic material and hydrocarbons have upon the &amp;D of the water.
