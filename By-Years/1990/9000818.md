The REU activity would allow students to work closely with faculty to combine
advanced computing tools and techniques with fundamental applications in the
structural and materials areas of civil engineering. Since seven other
universities are presently working on these projects, NCSU has an excellent
opportunity to attract from these schools qualified applicants who are already
familiar with these programs. In addition, applicants from NCSU's Engineering
Scholars Program would be sought to participate in the REU site program. The 10
REU program students will participate in a ten-week summer research program. All
participants will live on campus, enjoy full NCSU student privileges, and be
able to interact easily with other undergraduates and with graduate students and
faculty. Students will attend weekly discussion sessions on their research
projects and also on such topics as proposals, publishing, and presentations.
Additionally, they will be required to write and present a paper on their
research. The REU site offers valuable and enriched opportunity to each
participant with its excellent research facilities, highly qualified and
experienced faculty, and past success with the REU program.
