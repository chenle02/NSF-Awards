Kenneth Jordan of the University of Pittsburgh is supported by an award from the
Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry
Division to develop theoretical methods for describing the interaction of excess
electrons with molecules and molecular clusters. Processes involving electron
capture and transfer are involved in photosynthesis, the operation of batteries,
in radiation damage, and in the operation of some laser systems. The research of
the Jordan group is relevant to understanding how these processes occur at a
molecular level. Professor Jordan is actively engaged in organizing scientific
workshops that bring together researchers from different disciplines as well as
summer schools where students learn about state-of-the-art methods in computer
simulation of molecular systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Jordan is
developing methods for modeling non-valence correlation-bound and temporary
anion states. Both classes of anions are particularly challenging to describe
theoretically. These studies address how non-valence correlation-bound anions
evolve into image potential states with increasing system size. The research of
the Jordan group also elucidates the role of charge-transfer polarizability in
describing the net polarizability of molecules and molecular
clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
