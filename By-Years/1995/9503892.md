Analysis, interpretation and publication of oceanographic observations in the
Gulf Stream and its deep western boundary current off North Carolina will be
completed to understand conductivity effects on motionally induced electric
fields and to determine how the deep flow on the Blake-Bahamas Ridge is
structured and maintained and how future monitoring of this undercurrent could
be used as an indicator of climate change.
