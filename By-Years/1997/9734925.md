DMI-9734925 Smith In many manufacturing operations, particularly in the
aerospace industry, large amounts of material must be removed from workpieces by
milling. Frequently the onset of chatter is a limiting factor in the
productivity of such operations. Previous attempts to improve the metal removal
rate have assumed that the dynamic characteristics of the tool are fixed, and
the cutting parameters are manipulated to account for them. In this project, the
spindle performance characteristics are considered as fixed, and the dynamic
characteristics of the tool are manipulated so that both the tool and the
spindle perform best at a speed. The results of this effort will be a set of
cutting tools for machining operations with adjustable dynamic characteristics
and a procedure for quickly and easily making the adjustment or selection. At
least four methods for adjusting the dynamic parameters of the tool will be
explored: 1) Tool length adjustment, 2) Adjustment of the axial position of an
internal mass or external mass, 3) Material removal from the interior of the
tool, and 4) Material removal from the exterior of the tool. Successful
completion of this project will lead to a way to produce a set of optimally
tuned tools for machines. The ability to tune a set of tools to perform well in
a narrow spindle speed range will greatly simplify future high-speed spindle
development because the spindle will only need to operate in that narrow speed
range.
