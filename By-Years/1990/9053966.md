This project, Women in Engineering, Science and Technology (WEST), established
at New Jersey Institute of Technology, will facilitate the transfer of women,
upon completion of their community college curricula, from 19 New Jersey
community colleges to engineering, science and technology programs at four year
colleges and universities. During the first year, the WEST office will work with
some of the 14 community colleges with which articulation agreements already
exist. Special efforts will be made with urban-based colleges enrolling a high
percentage of minority women After the first year, WEST will expand its efforts
to other community colleges in the state. One goal is to recruit at least 200
women per year to the project through career days and seminars. Evaluation and
assessment of project outcomes will be determined by: - the percent increase of
women enrolled in engineering, science &amp; technology programs at community
colleges who transfer to 4-year colleges at the end of Spring 1992 semester. -
the percent increase of community college women with undeclared majors who
choose engineering, science and technology majors at the end of the Fall 1991
and Spring 1992 semesters. - pre and post surveys to measure attitudes toward
engineering, science and technology.
