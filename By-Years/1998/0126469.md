Biological Sciences (61) This project develops a new discovery-based laboratory
course, "Laboratory in Genetics", adapted from a course at Santa Clara
University. Targeted to upper-class undergraduates, the course permits students
to experimentally explore concepts of classical and modern genetics, including
genomics. Two inquiry-based research projects are initiated and carried out by
the students; both projects generate novel data. This approach offers students
the opportunity to explore a unique genetic problem, acquiring related concepts
and information in the context of that exploration. The course makes use of the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, taking advantage of the ease and practicability
with which relatively sophisticated genetics experiments can be carried out with
this organism. For example, the second project incorporates a new experimental
technology that enables genomic sequence information to be transferred to a
functional assay in this organism. A pilot offering of the course demonstrated
the feasibility of the course plan and enabled the sharpening of course goals.
The pilot helped identify specific equipment needs that are necessary to meet
the course objectives. Project outcomes are: (1) to refine the syllabus and
course materials to increase student capacity and make the course exportable,
(2) to provide the means for students to explore a wider array of genotypes and
phenotypes, and (3) to give each student the opportunity to become proficient at
utilizing the available literature and post-genomics databases and tools. In
this way, the larger goals of improving acquisition of scientific knowledge and
skills, including analytical, technical and communication skills, can be
achieved.
