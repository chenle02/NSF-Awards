9403802 Martin Vega This project is a research effort in technology management.
The objective is to apply a case study approach to assess the impact of three
industry/university collaborative research and development projects carried out
in a semiconductor manufacturing environment. The projects cover a broad range
of manufacturing systems issues and are typical of the human machine information
interaction scenario faced by most research and development efforts in this
area. The results of this research will ultimately lead to a new methodology for
the evaluation and management of technology based projects. This will have
significant application in industry research and development.
