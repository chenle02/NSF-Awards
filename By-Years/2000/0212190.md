The fungus Neurospora crassa serves as a model system for studying the genetics
and molecular biology of biological clocks. In this fungus the clock is
expressed as areas of asexual spore formation (conidiation) alternating with
areas of hyphal extension that show no conidiation. There is evidence that this
clock has two oscillator loops. The products of the frq/wc loci are components
of the first oscillator loop, but no components of the second have yet been
described. The objectives of this project are to isolate new mutations affecting
the clock and to classify the existing clock mutants according to their site of
action. Both objectives are steps toward identifying components of the second
oscillator. The study of the second oscillator can now be advanced by employing
a new culture technique developed by the investigator. It allows the expression
of the second oscillator in the absence of the first. The clock "null" strains
(frq10, wc-1, wc-2) lack the first oscillator. When these strains are provided
low (10-5M) concentrations of farnesol or geraniol (compounds related to
intermediates in the steroid pathway), a clear, reproducible, and synchronous
conidiation rhythm can be seen on Petri plates or growth tubes (normal length).
New mutants in the clock system will be sought by screening for mutations that
alter or abolish the rhythmicity of frq10 mutants grown on farnesol.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these experiments will reveal new genes that affect
the biological clock of this micro-organism. The insights gained from these
genes and their products should lead to significant advances in our
understanding of the functioning of biological clocks. The investigator is very
active in training undergraduates, both through teaching their courses and
mentoring their research projects in his laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
