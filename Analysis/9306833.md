Work on this project will address several questions concerning subelliptic
partial differential equations, especially aspects of analytic hypoellipticity.
Related work on the representations of nilpotent Lie groups and harmonic
analysis will also be carried out. A differential operator is said to be
hypoelliptic if the smoothness of a solution of the corresponding inhomogeneous
equation is related to that of the inhomgeneous term (often referred to simply
as the right-hand-side of the equation). By analytic, one means that analytic
solutions are guaranteed when the inhomogeneous term is analytic. A few cases
where analytic hypoellipticity for elliptic operators occurs are known and a few
where it fails are also known. The vast middle ground is untouched and
represents the main theme of this research. Additionally, in those cases where
hypoellipticity fails, it remains to determine exactly what order of smoothness
one can expect to possess and to relate it to underlying geometric invariants of
the domain on which the operator is defined. The work begins in three-
dimensional Euclidean space, but has natural extensions to similar question on
nilpotent groups like the Heisenberg group, as well as to compact manifolds with
boundary. This research has many deep connections with the foundations of
partial differential equations. On the surface it appears highly abstract and
distant from the physical world. In practice, the fundamental results derive
from the study of specific examples which occur in various applications. To
give, a priori, information about the solution of a complex partial differential
equation can be of immense value to any user of mathematics.
