This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of 17 US
participants, especially young researchers and graduate students who do not have
other grant support, to attend and participate in the satellite conference to
the International Congress of Mathematicians. The conference is to be held at
Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea, from August 13-21,
2014, and called "Complex Dynamics in One and Several Variables".

The lecturers are leading researchers in this vibrant field of dynamical
systems and have been chosen for their record in mentoring and nurturing young
talent. They also include senior lecturers who will be at the larger conference
in Korea already, so will not need much extra funding. There will be at least 6
talks by young researchers as well as participation by many Korean
mathematicians already in the field or new to the field of one and several
variable complex dynamics. This will lead to a valuable international exchange
in an important area of mathematics.
