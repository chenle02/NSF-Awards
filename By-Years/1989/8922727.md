The main objective of the proposed work is to develop a new approach to
detection of incipient faults in rotating machines by using artificial neural
networks. Medium size induction motors are used as prototypes for rotating
machines in this project due to their wide application and also for economic
reasons. The concept can be easily generalized from induction motors to other
rotating machines. The design of an artificial neural network to detect
incipient faults of induction motors is based on the steady-state performance of
the motor. However, the detection scheme will be applied in real time when the
motor experience occasional disturbances, and in this case, the motor will not
always be in steady-state. Inappropriate inputs to the fault detector will yield
false alarms at the fault dector. An artificial neural network will be developed
to filter out the transient measurements but retain the steady-state
measurements and thus feed the correct measurement to the fault detector. The
expected significance of the proposed work will be development of an on-line
incipient fault detector for rotating machines. The detector is composed of two
parts: (1) a measurement disturbance filter artificial neural network, and (2)
an incipient fault detection artificial neural network. The detector will be
able to detect the common incipient faults of the motor, such as turn-to-turn
insulation failure and bearing wear, and will be robust to disturbances in the
motor as well as to measurement noise. Theory will be developed to ensure the
performance of the networks, including training (learning) and recalling schemes
under different motor operating conditions. The performance of the disturbance
and noise filtering neural network will be compared to the conventional noise
filtering schemes
