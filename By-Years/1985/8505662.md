Three-dimensional positions of the visible surfaces in stereo images can be
determined by simple trigonometric transformation once the stereo matching
problem is solved. Most existing stereo matching methods involve matching low-
level image features such as edges. This research describes an improved stereo
matching procedure based on matching high-level image features. New techniques
for extracting high-level image features will be explored with the aim of
extracting a rich symbolic representation of the gray intensity changes in an
image. Methods will be developed for determining correspondences between the
extracted image features in the stereo images. The goal is to develop algorithms
for generating full disparity maps for stereo images.
