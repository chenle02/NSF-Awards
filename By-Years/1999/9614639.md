9614639 Lees This research involves the deployment of broadband portable
seismometers from PASSCAL on the Kamchatka Peninsula to study the effect of
upper mantle flow around the sharp transform-to- convergent transition in the
Pacific/North-American plate boundary at the intersection of Kamchatka and the
Aleutian Islands. The geology of the Kamchatka region has unusual features which
may be related to asthenospheric flow around the slab edge, such as
exceptionally high rates of arc magmatism involving both slab and mantle melts,
and recent rifting and spreading of the Komandorskaya Basin. Using portable and
nearby permanent stations, scientists from Yale University and the Russian
Institute of Volcanology will investigate lateral variations in seismic
velocity, anisotropy and Q using shear-wave splitting, surface-wave scattering,
body wave reverberation, attenuation and diffraction observations, and regional
seismicity. They will address whether trench-parallel flow exists below the
Pacific plate, and whether Kamchatka volcanism is underlain by a low-velocity,
low-Q upper-mantle wedge associated with mantle material pulled around and above
the descending slab. Data from stations north of the Aleutian intersection,
where island-arc volcanism has only recently ceased, will be used to determine
whether a stalled, buoyant slab from the subduction of the young Komandorskaya
Basin exists, or whether low-velocity upper mantle suggests the presence of a
"slab window." Earthquakes in Japan and the Kurile arc have ideal geometry for
measuring crustal dispersion, and hence crustal thickness variations, along the
Kamchatka Peninsula. ***
