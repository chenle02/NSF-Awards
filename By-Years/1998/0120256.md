EIA-0120256&lt;br/&gt;Herbert Schorr&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern
California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Digital Government: Fedstats Secure
Collaborative Environment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support
preliminary explorations of the needs of statistical researchers and Federal
statistical agencies to collaborate at a distance, using the Internet, over
potentially confidential information. Issues such as security, privacy and
authenticated data arise, particularly when some of the collaborators are
connected from behind Federal agency firewalls Data analysis, visualization,
Internet-based teleconferencing and other collaboration tools will be explored,
as will the applicability of new Internet protocols.&lt;br/&gt;
