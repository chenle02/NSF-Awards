A program of basic research is undertaken to explore the use of different coding
options on non-uniform channels found in modern digital communication systems.
Disturbances such as fading due to multipath transmission or interference cause
errors that are received in bursts, resulting in non-uniform statistics for the
channel. In this research the performance of codes, both block and
convolutional, on non-uniform channels will be investigated. Reasonable channel
models will be developed and the performance of different codes for these
channel models will be evaluated. Interleaving has long been used in conjunction
with coding as a means of achieving reliable communication on burst-error
channels. In this research, the performance of interleaving vis a vis burst
error correcting codes will be examined. Other important tasks include the
investigation of the performance of concatenated coding systems as measured by
their effective channel cutoff rate, channel capacity, and undetected error
probability.
