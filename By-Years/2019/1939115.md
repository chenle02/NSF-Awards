This award assists the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation Division
at NSF in achieving NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science" by
improving the capacity of the peer review process to recognize and appropriately
evaluate proposals that advance discovery. The goals of this project are to
evaluate methods based on rigorous social science research that (1) ameliorate
bias and mitigate its effects in evaluating non-traditional scholars and
scholarship by addressing cultural norms, group dynamics, and the efficacy of
awareness training; and (2) contribute to a more robust agenda for rewarding
innovation in engineering research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists
of two phases. Phase One (Key Concepts Phase) will address how cognitive bias,
group thing, cultural norms, panel dynamics and leadership, the dynamics of
conflict and conflict resolution, and academic psyches and peer evaluation
pressures of academia impact merit review processes. Phase Two (Experiential
Phase) will apply the Phase One learning outcomes to a mock panel review
experience. The study will identify leading indicators of impact to inform
future development of the peer review process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
