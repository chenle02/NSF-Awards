This award supports the research of Professor E. Schulte to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate abstract regular polytopes. In
particular he intends to completely classify the regular polytopes which are
globally or locally of toroidal type as well as connections between regular
polytopes and buildings. The research is in the general area of combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely important to
modern communications, for example the design of large networks as in telephone
systems and the design of algorithms in computer science.
