This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to investigate
a novel technology concept, time-resolved, integrated laser-induced
fluorescence, for the detection of airborne microbes. Some present detectors
function poorly in the presence of diesel fumes or other pollutants, limiting
their utility in urban areas. This novel detection device will not be
susceptible to pollutant interference and would be simpler and less expensive
than present detectors. Proof of concept requires measurement of fluorescence
parameters for urban pollutants that are presently unknown so that the chosen
parameters for biological aerosols can be shown to be distinctive.

The commercial applications of this project include detection of pathogens in
homes, hotels, offices, and in the food distribution system.
