This residential program is designed to introduce community college faculty to
molecular biology and its applications. The program will draw upon the faculty
and facilities of UC Davis, a leader in the field of experimental biology.
Lectures, labs, and discussions will emphasize basic principles underlying
recombinant DNA methodologies and issues. A unique aspect of this program are
follow-up sessions held onsite at participating community college campuses
during the academic year. Participants also have the opportunity to conduct
research through an internship with a member faculty at the University of
California, Davis. Summer 1993
