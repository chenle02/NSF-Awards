The goal of this project is to create a sustainable Network of engineering
faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities to focus on the
development, implementation, and expansion of an experiment-centric
instructional pedagogy, based on the Mobile Studio. The project is implementing
this pedagogy in 39 different courses across the 13 HBCUs participating in the
network and studying the effect of the implementation on motivation and
retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expanding the use of the hands-
on pedagogy across the electrical engineering curriculum at 13 HBCUs. The
approach is designed to give the student the ability to apply what they have
learned anytime anywhere as well as to tinker and ask "what if" questions. One
of the goals of this program is to test whether this approach increases student
interest in STEM and increases retention of students at minority-serving
institutions.
