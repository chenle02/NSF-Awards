9531161 Schick This project is concerned with various aspects of self-
assembling systems, such as block copolymers and lipids. Microphase separation
will be considered in systems of potential technological importance, such as
diblock, triblock and dendritic copolymers. There will also be a study of the
ternary mixtures of diblock and homopolymers, an examination of the swollen
lamellar phases and the effect of fluctuations on them. The interfacial profiles
and their energy of the interfaces between different microphases will be
calculated. Finally there will be analysis of the self- assembly effects in
biological membranes during electroporation and rupture. %%% A better
understanding of self-assembly in polymers is the objective in this grant. The
self-assembly involves phase separation in a binary and ternary mixtures and the
properties of the interfaces. There are special phases and configurations that
are studied for their properties. The technological applications of the systems
studied here are in the vast range between detergent and drug transport through
the membranes and cells.
