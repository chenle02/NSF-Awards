This research will study (identify and enumerate) diatoms in the Sirius
Formation and age- equivalent and related sediments collected on various parts
of Antarctica with the following objectives in mind: 1. A relatively high
resolution stratigraphy will place age constraints upon each sample. These data
will allow such topics as the timing of late Neogene deglaciation and
reglaciation of Antarctica, glacial overriding events and the deposition of non-
ice related sediments. 2. The diatoms found in the tills and other Neogene
sediment from the Antarctic continent impose some constraints on our
paleoenvironmental interpretation of this region and the surrounding Southern
Ocean. Because many of the species found in these sediments are extant, diatoms
can be used to characterize the paleotemperature and paleoclimate regime around
the continent, particularly for the middle to late Pliocene. Since this time
interval covers the prelude to, and inception of, northern hemisphere
glaciation, these data will draw Antarctica into the discussion of events
leading up to the Quaternary climatic deterioration.
