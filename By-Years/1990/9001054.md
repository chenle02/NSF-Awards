This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) has at its aim to explore the
effect of electric fields on immiscible mixtures of polymers. Preliminary work
has shown that phases can be distorted and aligned by this method. The planned
research will investigate the mechanism by which different morphologies can be
obtained, and the anisotropies in such properties as conductivity or dielectric
constant in films subjected to electric fields.
