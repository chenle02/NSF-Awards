The Department of Bioengineering at Syracuse University has introduced a
Biomechanics Track option for majors. This track is unique, no other
undergraduate program offers an 'in depth' three course sequence focussed on
skeletomuscular Biomechanics. We are using a 'layered' approach, combining
theory with laboratory applications to real problems. The Track begins with an
Introductory Course and ends with a required Senior Thesis. To support our
educational goals, we will purchase 'student- friendly', durable equipment
modules for mechanical testing of biomaterials, measurement of strain and muscle
activity (EMG), for whole body and joint motion analysis, to measure static and
dynamic body forces (force plate) and to support Finite Element Method analysis
of skeletal elements and prosthetic designs. These modules will replace existing
fragile research equipment which forces faculty to demonstrate rather than lets
students experiment. The modules can be 'mixed and matched' to give great
flexibility for advanced student projects. We see this as a model for such
Programs.
