Alspach will investigate the preduals of the space of absolutely summable
sequences and their relation to the spaces of continuous functions. In
particular, questions such as which of these preduals are quotients of a space
of continuous functions with separable dual are to be considered. Schutt will
continue his investigation of the floating body of a convex body and extend the
investigations to random polytopes and their relation to polyhedral
approximation and the hyperplane problem. Banach space theory is that part of
mathematics that attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the
structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space. The axioms for the
distance function in a Banach space are more relaxed than those for Euclidean
distance (For example, the "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as
a result, the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic. Much of the
research in this area concerns studying the structure theory of Banach spaces.
