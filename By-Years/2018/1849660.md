This travel award supports student participation at the 4th International
Workshop on Software Analytics (SWAN 2018) happening in Florida, USA on November
5, 2018. The funds seek to encourage US-based students to attend, with priority
given to underrepresented groups, US citizens/residents, and those otherwise
unable to attend without financial support. The area of software analytics as
the basis for empirical research in software engineering leads to a scientific
understanding of phenomena surrounding software and its development. The area is
emerging and will be boosted by increasing student participation in this start-
up workshop series. The workshop is a forum for presentation of work in this
field, and as such, it will help expand research and strengthen US participation
in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical scope of the workshop covers
data-driven approaches for data exploration and analysis; predictive analytics
for software; web analytics, development analytics; business intelligence tools;
large-scale data mining, analysis and analytics for software projects; software
analytics for various stakeholders (e.g., managers vs. developers); empirical
studies on how software analytics are used in practice and their
effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
