Certain fish are known as "weakly electric fish" because they have electric
organs that generate a small repetitive discharge that creates an electric field
in the surrounding water. The fish has electrosensory receptors in the skin
which are able to detect the timing and the spatial distribution of the
electrical field, and can use this information for sensing objects in the
environment, and for communication. The first stage of central processing of the
electrosensory information is a part of the brain called the electrosensory
lateral-line lobe (ELL); this lobe has a cortical structure with a cellular
organization similar to that found in the cerebellum. Other systems also project
to the ELL, including sensory input from other systems such as mechanoreceptors
of the lateral-line organ, signals descending from higher levels of the
electrosensory system, and a particular set of signals called "corollary
discharge" which occurs every time the electric orgal discharge occurs, and is
believed to provide a reference signal useful to interpreting how the
electrosensory input from the environment may be changed from the "expected"
input. This project uses electrophysiological cellular recording and anatomical
methods to complete a study of the cell types found in the ELL; to establish the
major cell classes of the next higher central station called the pre-eminential
nucleus, and how they project to the ELL; and to see whether the non-
electrosensory inputs to the ELL can change depending on prior association with
electrosensory input. Results from this work will be important for insights into
the possible functions of central inputs that modulate incoming sensory signals,
and in clarifying fundamental principles of functional circuitry in structures
like the cerebellum.
