This research explores the feasibility of using wavelet analysis to assess
spatial variability in the distribution of arctic pack ice. Wavelets have been
used in recent years to analyze a variety of geophysical processes, but they
have not yet been used to study pack ice. They provide an exact decomposition of
the sample variance, for a spatial series, in terms of coefficients that are
indexed according to both location and scale. This information can be used in
turn to statistically assess spatial variability in the variance. Because they
provide this information, they are a potentially useful tool for use in
characterizing and studying multi-scale, nonstationary features such as pack
ice. This work seeks to demonstrate, through application of wavelet analysis to
a large existing database derived from submarine-based observations, that
wavelets can be a powerful tool for determining which spatial scales make the
greatest contributions to overall variance in arctic pack ice thickness.
Knowledge of these statistical properties is essential for assessing whether
observed variations reflect climate change or are due merely to sampling
uncertainty. The anticipated successful completion of this demonstration will
provide the impetus for a broader research effort that will address pack ice
response to climate variability. This work will also help to publicize the
potential uses of wavelets in studying other geophysical processes and will, in
so doing, facilitate their integration into university courses on data
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
