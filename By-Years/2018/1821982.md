This award will support student activities at the 2018 World Biosensors Congress
and the associated one-day Summer School providing tutorials focused on paper-
based nanobiosensor technology. These events will be held June 12-15 in Miami,
Florida. The 2018 World Congress celebrates the 28th anniversary of this
international conference series, considered the premiere meeting in the field of
biosensors and bioelectronics. The Congress has been held every two years since
1990 and rotates around the globe, attracting more than 1000 delegates. Every
six years, the World Biosensor Congress meets in North America, but this is the
first time in the US since 2000. With the conference location in Miami, there is
a special opportunity to reach US participants this year. While the US is always
in the top three countries for level of participation, the ratio of US authors
already submitting abstracts is higher than usual. This congenial atmosphere is
deemed to be essential to incorporate young investigators into the community as
well as to encouraged interactions between more established investigators. These
initiatives include an entrepreneurs' exhibit space with special activities and
outreach programs for local high school students and minority undergraduates to
encourage careers in STEM.

The aims of the proposed project are a) to recognize excellence by students
presenting posters at the conference and b) to present 10 NSF travel awards to
students from US institutions competitively offered the opportunity to present
posters or talks. The acceptance letter to authors of abstracts from US
institutions will specifically offer student presenters the opportunity to
compete for the NSF travel awards.
