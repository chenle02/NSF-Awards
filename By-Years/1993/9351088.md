The objective of this project is to provide experimental apparatus (a wind
tunnel and a water tunnel) for undergraduate engineering students in the
Fluids/Thermal Laboratory (junior level; 1 credit hour, required course for a
B.S. in Mechanical Engineering) and the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory
(senior level; 3 credit hours; required course for a B.S. in Mechanical
Engineering) that would permit them to investigate important problems in fluid
mechanics and heat transfer, which they cannot currently investigate. The wind
and water tunnels (with basic instrumentation system, and model and calibration
sets) would be used for "new" investigations concerning the foundations of
viscous and pressure drags, aerodynamics, and convective heat transfer. The
addition of these "new" investigations to the Fluids/Thermal Laboratory would
substantially improve laboratory experiences of undergraduate Mechanical
Engineering students (particularly since the majority work full- or part-time
during the day). Furthermore, the acquisition of a wind tunnel and a water
tunnel (with the associated instrumentation systems) would permit, and
encourage, undergraduate engineering students to pursue "self initiated"
investigations, "independent study" courses, and "undergraduate research" in
general areas of fluid mechanics, convective heat transfer, aerodynamics,
hydrodynamics, and biofluiddynamics. Importantly, in most of the envisioned
"self initiated" investigations, the students would only need to construct
"models and/or systems" to be tested in the wind tunnel and/or in the water
tunnel; this would be a major improvement when compared to the current
situation, where the students are also required to construct the associated
experimental\test apparatus.
