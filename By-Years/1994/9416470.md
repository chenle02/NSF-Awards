9416470 Bourque This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. This award provides funds for the timely
analysis of perishable data collected from a representative sample of Los
Angeles and Ventura County residents following the earthquake. Analyses will
contribute information relevant to behavior during and immediately after the
earthquake, use and value of electronic media as a source of information, loss
of utilities, prevalence and extent of damage, prevalence and extent of
evacuation, changes in patterns of transportation, and pre-and post- earthquake
preparedness. ***
