The goal of the project is to use the iPod Touch to transform an introductory
material science and engineering (MSE) course from a deductive practice to an
inductive teaching and learning environment. The investigators are developing
six multi-part MSE education applications for the iPod Touch that are designed
to facilitate and support six new collaborative and innovative active learning
modules that target specific student learning objectives which are known to be
challenging for many students in MSE courses. They hypothesize that using these
active modules in collaborative groups with data, visuals, audio, and
information from the iPod Touch, will lead to improvements in student learning,
engagement and retention, especially for women and other underrepresented groups
in engineering technology programs. MSE education applications for this project
are being freely disseminated through the Apple Applications store and are
available to all others on the web as a Wiki. The evaluation effort, under the
direction of an outside evaluator, is using pre- and post-course concept
evaluations, grades on exams and research papers, and primary trait analyses on
these student products. Broader impacts include a significant dissemination
effort and the focus on underrepresented groups.
