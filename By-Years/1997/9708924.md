This proposal requests funds to evaluate available distributions of a variety
of natural and anthropogenic trace substances (transient and steady-state) in
terms of their potential to delineate pathways and mean residence times of the
Arctic Ocean water masses and its sea ice cover. This information is fundamental
for our understanding of the role of the Arctic Ocean and its sea ice cover in
regional and global climate, as well as in the redistribution of contaminants in
the marine system, and their export from the Arctic Ocean through the water and
ice phase. The general approach is to integrate existing tracer and contaminant
data sets and to combine results from the synthesis of these integrated data
sets with model simulations. Specifically, the investigators plan to check the
information derived from several passive tracers (e.g. tritium, oxygen and
Helium isotopes) for consistency with hydrographic data and direct current
measurements, as well as with tracer distributions simulated by dynamical
models. In a second step, the investigators plan to compare this information
with measured contaminant distributions to (i) use conservative contaminants as
additional tracers of water and sea ice circulation, and (ii) study sources and
sinks of non-conservative contaminants through comparison with passive tracers.
