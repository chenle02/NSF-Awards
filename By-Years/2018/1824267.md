The ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the
identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full
participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy,
practice, culture, and organizational climate. The ADVANCE Institutional
Transformation (ADVANCE-IT) track supports the development of innovative
organizational change strategies within an institution of higher education to
enhance gender equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
academic workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Florida Agricultural and Mechanical
University (FAMU) is one of the nation's Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) and is committed to transforming its institutional climate
and culture in support of gender equity and advancement of women faculty in
STEM. The FAMU ADVANCE-IT project will promote gender equity by working to
increase awareness of the role of cultural humility in decision-making and by
implementing various ADVANCE initiatives including policy review and changes and
support programs focused on the persistence and retention of women faculty in
STEM such as professional development, career coaching, and mentoring. This
project is important to understand how to increase the diversity of STEM faculty
at HBCUs, the faculty at HBCUS does not always reflect the student population
diversity at HBCUs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will expand the limited
research on barriers to and strategies for advancement of women STEM faculty at
HBCUs by infusing the concept of cultural humility in the ADVANCE interventions
and in the proposed research. In the context of this proposal, cultural humility
is the awareness that no gender/discipline/race/religion is the norm and that
everyone belongs in FAMU's academic setting. The examination of Black women and
other women of color in STEM at a large HBCU will extend the research of
intersectionality by examining this phenomenon in a context where Black women
students are the majority, but where Black women STEM faculty are the minority.
Additionally, studying within-group differences of women of color will offer a
deeper intersectional understanding of the complexities of gender issues at
HBCUs, while also advancing more nuanced framing of challenges and factors for
success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
