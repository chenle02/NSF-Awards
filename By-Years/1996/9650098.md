This project will develop a computerized mapping facility for use by
undergraduate students. For geology students to be competitive in the job market
or in applications to graduate school, they must be computer literate. Formal
coursework in computer basics is not sufficient. Students must be exposed to
extensive practical, hands-on, experience to increase their expertise and to
facilitate their transition from a student to a professional setting. The use of
computers and Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping in the context of geology
field camp provides an ideal opportunity for students to apply their computer
knowledge in an environment that closely approximates that of the job market.
This project applies computer and GPS technology to stratigraphic analysis (the
preparation of columnar sections and cross sections), structural geology
problems (rose diagrams, stereo nets, cross sections), map problems (location of
data points and the transfer of information from field observations to finished
maps), plotting, and report writing. The equipment used in this project can also
be used in other departmental courses. The basic thrust of this enhancement is
the shift from hand drawn to computer graphics and acquisition of GPS mapping
techniques.
