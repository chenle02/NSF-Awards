Hannah&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0106874&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magma source for
Proterozoic massif-type anorthosite complexes and the origin of massive sulfide
bodies found in some of those complexes remain unresolved problems. We propose
that rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) concentrations and Os isotope ratios for oxides,
sulfides, and silicates from two well-studied anorthosite suites will shed light
on these issues. Most models based on geochemical data suggest that anorthosite
complexes are derived from mantle melts that pond and fractionate at the base of
the crust, and are then variably contaminated by crustal materials during
ascent. Considerations from phase equilibria, however, suggest that parental
magmas are derived by partial melting of a gabbroic source, presumably in the
lower crust. Os isotope ratios, which are particularly sensitive indicators of
crustal melting or assimilation, should help discriminate between competing
models. High the initial 187Os/188Os ratios in sulfides from Proterozoic
anorthosite complexes suggest dominance of crustal Os. It is unclear, however,
whether the crustal Os was acquired by selective volatilization and
incorporation of crustal sulfide, wholesale assimilation of bulk crust, or
derivation of parental melts by partial melting of a crustal gabbroic source. We
will compare Os isotopic data from two systems - the apparently sulfide-free
Laramie Anorthosite Complex in Wyoming, and the sulfide-bearing Hakefjorden
Complex in SW Sweden - to estimate the most likely source for the sulfides and
their contained metals. The results could offer an exploration tool for
distinguishing sulfide-poor and sulfide-rich systems. &lt;br/&gt;
