This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, provides seed
funding for initial exploration of a national virtual laboratory (NVL) in
robotics research. The Laboratory will take advantage of the emerging National
Information Infrastructure by connecting research facilities across the country
to design joint experiments in robotics. These will be geographically
distributed experiments, using different agents at separate sites, such that
perception/action modules will interact physically with their local
environments, but will communicate over the network to coordinate their
accomplishment of a common task. Initially the NVL will develop an
infrastructure for sharing resources among geographically distributed university
and industry research laboratories. This infrastructure will consist of
communication capabilities for video, voice and data links offering high-quality
real-time excange and remote operation capabilities. This will enable the
researchers to share and test all their software and hardware resources under
diverse environmental conditions.
