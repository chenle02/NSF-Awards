AST-0421504/Kortenkamp, Planetary Science Institute

The award supports the acquisition of (1) components for a high-performance
computer cluster for serial and parallel applications of existing codes; (2)
hardware and software to support image processing and analysis of planetary
remote sensing data; and (3) field and laboratory equipment for collection and
analysis of terrestrial geologic data. The equipment will be used for a range of
investigations including the origin and evolution of planetary systems,
planetary geosciences, and the nature and consequences of planetary impacts.
Through collaborations with various schools and museums, the work will support
visualization and dissemination of planetary research to the public.
