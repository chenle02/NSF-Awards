This proposal requests support for Professor Vladimir Braginsky and his group
at the Moscow State University (MSU) in Moscow, Russia. Braginsky and his group
are members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and they propose to
continue research on topics of great interest to the LIGO project to which the
group has made outstanding contributions over the years. While most of the
research will be carried out at MSU, Braginsky and his colleagues will be in
frequent close contact with LIGO Laboratory and LSC members as the collaboration
works to develop new tools and techniques that will be used in Advanced LIGO
detectors. The MSU group will focus their research on the identification and
measurement of excess noise in the suspensions and coatings of LIGO's mirror and
on searches for new, as yet unknown, nonlinear noise sources with the goal of
reducing the noise level that limits the sensitivity of LIGO in its quest to
detect gravitational waves. In addition, they will explore theoretical ideas and
perform experiments related to breaking through the quantum limit on measurement
precision that is expected to be reached by Advanced LIGO. This limit was
pointed out by Braginsky a number of years ago, and interest in trying to avoid
this limit is now being pursued in a number of laboratories. Schemes for
accomplishing this (called "Quantum-Non-Demolition" - a term invented by
Braginsky) will be studied by the MSU group, the acknowledged world leaders in
this topic.
