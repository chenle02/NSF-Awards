This award provides partial support to the International, Mind, Brain, and
Education Society (IMBES) conference, scheduled to be held at University of
Texas at Arlington in November 2014. The conference emphasizes translating what
is known from educational neuroscience research to educational practice, in
effect taking the latest brain-based research and using it to improve education.
The award supports presentations related to the neural basis of STEM (science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning, including participation
costs for researchers, educators, and students. This project helps the REAL
(Research on Education and Learning) program, within DRL (Division of Research
on Learning), fulfill its goal of supporting the STEM education research
community as it pursues innovative research methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics
covered at the conference include affective aspects of learning, physical
components of early cognitive development, neuroscience education, special
education, memory, implications of embodied cognition for early STEM education,
brain-based teaching techniques, and informal science education. The conference
includes keynote speeches, symposia, workshops, general paper sessions, and
poster sessions.
