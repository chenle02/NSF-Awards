This grant will support experimental research into several aspects of nuclear
structure. The spins and electromagnetic transition rates of low-lying non-yrast
excitations will be measured and compared with predictions of the Interaction
Boson Model. Magnetic moments of very short- lived excitations will be measured
using the transient field technique, to probe mechanisms responsible for and the
effects of particle core coupling. These investigations will provide important
information concerning the excitations and structure of odd-mass nuclei.
