This award will help to support student attendance at the 54th IEEE Annual
Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in Berkeley, CA on
October 27 through October 29, 2013, as well as to support attendance by some
qualified postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources of travel funding.
FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-
based conferences on the Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of strongly
encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves as a
valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and
for the opportunities for networking that it provides. In recent years, the
annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred students who
have comprised more than a third of all attendees. This award will provide
partial support to twenty or more students, covering shared hotel rooms and
travel. (Student registration will be supported by other means.)
