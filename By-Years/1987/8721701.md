This research focuses on extensions to classical logic which are both -
flexible enough to represent aspects of the real world such as approximate
knowledge and change in knowledge over time which escape traditional logic -
theoretically sound and capable of being built into effective computer systems.
A particular emphasis is on sound principles which enable a reasoning system to
successfully ignore irrelevant parts of its knowledge in arriving at
conclusions. The importance of this work is in bridging the gap between pure
theory about the consistency and effectiveness of various new logics and real
world applications in computer reasoning systems and robots.
