Coleman 9502854 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
addresses the problem of integrating high efficiency conventional power sources
with renewable power sources in support of operations at remote cold regions
research bases and communities. Specific research focus is on the rigid
operating requirements and environmental constraints at the Amundsen-Scott South
Pole Station of the United States Antarctic Program for which a major
infrastructure redevelopment is being planned. The overall objective of the
project is to provide a plan for renewable energy integration at the South Pole
Station that serves as a model for other applications. The project will address
and document in a comprehensive manner integration issues such as intelligent
power systems management and dispersed hybrid power system layout. Wind power
will be the subject renewable power source but system design will accommodate
other sources such as photovoltaic arrays. The work will include data gathering,
hardware qualification, engineering , and planning activities.
