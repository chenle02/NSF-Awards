With this award the principal investigators will continue their mathematical
analysis of models of reactive thermal explosions. In particular, they will
analyze the solutions of initial-boundary value problems that describe the
evolution of diffusive and nondiffusive thermal explosions in confined domains,
in order to determine where and when explosions will take place. With regard to
these latter questions the principal investigators will describe precisely how
the blowup singularities evolve in space and time as the blowup time is reached.
Natural phenomena involving burning and explosions offer important scientific
and technological areas of investigation. As with many physical processes there
are generally two avenues for study: the theoretical and the experimental. This
award represents the theoretical approach to combustion. In it the principal
investigators will use mathematical analysis to determine where and when
explosions occur in models of thermally reactive systems in containers and the
locations of hotspots.
