The clause-linking theorem proving method was recently developed and tested on a
wide variety of problems, including problems in set theory and temporal logic,
and logic puzzles. This prover converts a first- order problem to the
propositional calculus and then applies a propositional decision procedure
similar to the Davis and Putnam method. This project will extend this theorem
proving method to problems involving equality and term rewriting. This involves
a combination of representations like Brand's modification method, with
traditional term-rewriting techniques. A procedure to solve inequalities
involving the lexicographic path ordering will be used to approximate
specialized unification algorithms. This work will also incorporate meaningful
semantics to guide the search; the semantics will be presented as a collection
of procedures for computing the meanings of function and predicate symbols in a
structure, as well as a procedure for deciding the satisfaction of existential
sentences in the structure. Methods for generating plausible lemmas and using
them to guide the search for a proof, will be developed. The prover will be
applied to non-trivial mathematical theorems.
