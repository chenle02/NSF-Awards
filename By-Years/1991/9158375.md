The chemistry, bonding, structure and dynamics of single molecules and molecular
complexes on surfaces will be investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy.
A special low temperature ultra-high vacuum apparatus in a vibration free room
will be used for these studies. This equipment will be especially appropriate
for a study of vibrational spectra and microscopic diffusion rates. The
investigation will also study insulating materials by exploiting their microwave
frequency dielectric properties. %%% This five year continuing grant to
Pennsylvania State University for support of Professor Weiss as a Presidential
Young Investigator is designed to promote his rapid and effective growth as an
independent researcher in the area of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. The
research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on
evaluating the potential applications and developing new applications for
scanning tunneling microscopy by using a novel ultra-high vacuum apparatus.
Important developments in the understanding of surface chemistry and its
application to materials science can be anticipated.
