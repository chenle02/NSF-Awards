This project has enhanced the teaching of undergraduate biochemistry by
improving the diversity and scope of lab exercises and independent study class
experiments performed. Specifically, new equipment allows the replacement of
commercial samples with biomolecules extracted by students from biological
samples. Also, students are able to store unstable samples between lab periods,
and from one year to the next. Classical biochemistry experiments are still
being conducted, but new laboratory exercises now include the isolation,
purification, analysis, and quantitation of biological samples and biomolecules
of interest to undergraduates. The implementation of this project directly
affects 45 students per year in biochemistry laboratory, other science majors,
and 5 to 10 undergraduates each year through specific independent study research
projects.
