The Association for Research on the Gulf of Maine (ARGO-Maine) is a consortium
of five institutions: Maine Maritime Academy, Bigalow Laboritory for Ocean
Sciences, University of Maine, Maine Geological Survey, and Maine Department of
Marine Resources. This project will mobilize and deliver a research vessel, the
R/V CAYUSE, from Moss Landing, California to the Gulf of Maine, for operation in
support of ocean science research by the Maine Maritime Academy on behalf of
ARGO-Maine. The 80 foot, CAYUSE has been replaced at the Moss Landing Marine
Laboritories by the larger, 125 foot R/V POINT SUR (formally R/V CAPE FLORIDA).
Under the conditions set forth by NSF in its announcement of the availability of
the R/V CAYUSE, title will be transfered from NSF to the Maine Maritime Academy.
