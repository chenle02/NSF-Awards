This project examines superplastic forming of structural ceramics (cerium and
yttria stabilized zirconia), alumina-zirconea, and silicon carbide-zirconea. The
intent is to explore the range of superplasticity and to evaluate the pressure
and shear contributions to the stability of deformatio and to the elimination of
voids, in both monolithic and composite ceramics.
