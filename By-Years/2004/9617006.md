Frogel, Jay 96-17006 Dr. Frogel will analyze the galaxy images obtained in the
Ohio State University Galaxy Survey. The survey obtained six optical and near-IR
images of each of 105 spiral galaxies so far. It will be expanded to 230
spirals, chosen as those with blue magnitude brighter than 12. The objective of
the project is to study galaxy morphology, dust content, stellar populations and
dynamics. The final calibrated images will be made available to the astronomical
community.
