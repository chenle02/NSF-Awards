From the mid 60's, Stability Theory, the study of stable (first-order) theories,
has been a major subject of Model Theory. The PI recently extended the scope of
Stability Theory to Simplicity Theory, the study of simple theories. This
project will focus on the generalization of true facts in stable theories to
simple theories.
