The science department at this small, rural Community College is introducing
environmental science-related computer-interfaced instrumentation into relevant
science course offerings in its Associate degree programs. The project serves
primarily minority and underprivileged college students from the Upper Coastal
Plain Region of northeastern North Carolina, providing these individuals with an
unprecedented science exposure. Computer-interfaced environmental science
experimentation provides opportunities to make precise measurements of chemical
and physical processes relevant to environmental changes (e.g., climate, air and
water quality, water and soil pH, optimal plant growing conditions, etc.). This
project also provides capabilities for monitoring simultaneous experiments,
storage and detailed analysis of data, experimental simulations, and student
design of experiments. Finally, the revisions to the curriculum this project is
making possible provide students with an exposure to science and to computer
applications in science, enhancing their long-term ability to perform
effectively in an advanced technological society. The grantee institution is
matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
