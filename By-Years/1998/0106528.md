Gwanmesia &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0106528 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is to
make precise measurement of the acoustic wave velocities at simultaneous high-
pressures and temperatures (P-Vp-Vs-T measurements) and the equation of state
(P-V-T relations) for Mg3Al2Si3O12-pyrope garnet. The experiments will be
conducted in a cubic anvil DIA-type high pressure apparatus, SAM-85, which is
installed on the super conducting wiggler beam line (X17B1) at the National
Synchrotron Light Source of the Brookhaven National laboratory. The high
pressure and high temperature elasticity data, as well as the equation of state
data, will be compared with data for Mg3Al2Si3O12-pyrope garnet obtained by
other elasticity techniques using single-crystal or polycrystalline specimens.
The study will utilize existing polycrystalline specimens of Mg3Al2Si3O12-pyrope
garnet and other new specimens hot-pressed in a 2000-ton uniaxial split-sphere
apparatus (USSA-2000) at conditions up to 5 GPa, and 1350C. Samples will be
characterized by x-ray diffraction, optical, scanning and transmission electron
microscopy and by bench top ultrasonic techniques, to ensure that the specimens
are singled-phase, fine-grained and pore- and crack-free. &lt;br/&gt;
