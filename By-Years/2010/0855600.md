This proposal is centered on problems concerning quantitative equidistribution
properties of elliptic Hecke eigenforms and its generalization to higher
dimensional arithmetic quotients of Hermitian symmetric spaces, as well as the
analytic aspects of automorphic forms and their L-functions related to
nonvanishing and subconvexity of the L-values, with the aim to gain deeper
understanding of them from analytic perspective. The problems proposed lie at
the heart of recent research and development in analytic number theory. This
proposal emphasizes different approaches to study these problems, and points
interesting connections with other subjects.

Automorphic L-function is fundamental object in mathematics. The
equidistribution problems proposed to study have origin from quantum mechanics,
and is closely related to the theory of automorphic L-function. They are at the
interface of number theory, analysis, and geometry. Our approach employs
advanced tools from harmonic analysis and number theory, in combination with the
new progress from the theory of automorphic representation. It is the rich
interplay and interaction of ideas across different fields that we want to
pursue in the current proposal.
