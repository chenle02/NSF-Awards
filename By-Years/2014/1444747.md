The Blue Waters system, the largest and most powerful NSF system, provides
computational science and engineering teams with an effective, scalable,
sustained-petascale computing platform at unmatched levels. NCSA has established
a comprehensive support and outreach program by working closely with the teams
that are using Blue Waters and with the larger computational science and
engineering community, to enable them to take full advantage of the
extraordinary capabilities of Blue Waters as well as those provided by similar
systems such as Kraken, Stampede, Keeneland, Titan, and future petascale
computing systems. &lt;br/&gt;This program, named NCSA/Illinois Enhanced
Intellectual Services for Petascale Performance (NEIS-P2), includes a
significant community outreach component aimed at enabling the general NSF
computational science and engineering community to make effective use of
petascale systems. The Community Engagement component includes activities to
help prepare the next generation of petascale computational experts through a
coordinated set of courses, workshops, fellowships and
internships.&lt;br/&gt;The newly launched Blue Waters Graduate Fellows component
of NEIS-P2 Community Engagement Program received more outstanding applications
than can be funded with the budget available for this activity. This RAPID
proposal is a request to support an additional four fellows during the 2014-2015
academic. The net result will be ten fellows supported during the first year of
the Blue Waters Graduate Fellowship Program.
