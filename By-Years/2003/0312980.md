This project will develop an application-driven runtime scheduling substrate for
adaptive and irregular computations on high-performance computing platforms
which combine hardware multithreading, cache-coherent symmetric multiprocessing,
and message-passing. Unstructured mesh generation and refinement will be used as
a working example of an adaptive and irregular application with variable and
unpredictable computation and communication patterns. Also, parallel adaptive
mesh generation is an important building block for many large-scale scientific
and engineering simulations like crack propagation, an end-to-end adaptive
application we will use to evaluate our approach. The proposed substrate will
allow the programmer to use message passing plus a single address space to
achieve communication between application-specific decompositions and leverage
compiler and runtime support to exploit multilevel and irregular parallelism
within SMP nodes. In order to achieve this goal, the re-structuring of both the
application and the runtime support system is proposed. A compiler-driven
runtime scheduling engine for fine-grain parallelism exploitation and tighter
integration of message-passing with hardware multithreading and cache-coherence
will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
