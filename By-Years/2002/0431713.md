The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO coordinates and
facilitates ocean research among governments. A total of 129 countries comprise
the membership; the United States is a key participant and strong supporter of
IOC activities. The IOC develops and promotes international research to improve
global understanding of ocean processes and their relationship to the
sustainable development and stewardship of ocean resources. This project
constitutes the NSF portion of support to the Ocean Science Section of the IOC,
including development of a new program on Multidisciplinary Science and Natural
Resources and an international initiative to examine critical issues of land-
atmosphere-ocean biogeochemistry.
