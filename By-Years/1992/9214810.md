This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program, a U.S. Global
Change Program. The research project will implement a regional model of the
arctic land-atmosphere system, to use this model to simulate the land-atmosphere
interactions that control the hydrological cycle of a key arctic region, and to
project changes in the climate and hydrology of the arctic region. Plot-size and
mesoscale topography and vegetation data will be incorporated into the regional
model at 40 km resolution to provide a working model of the regional
hydrological cycle and a framework for the scaling up of plot size measurements
of surface variables and processes in northern ecosystems. This research project
is a collaborative component of a larger interdisciplinary program known as the
ARCSS FLUX Program.
