9411543 Arnowitt Research in theoretical particle physics will focus on the
applications of supersymmetry in describing basic interactions among
constituents of matter. Supersymmetry relates the two broad classes of fields in
the universe, those which constitute the basic building blocks of matter, and
those which describe the forces among them. The work will concentrate on
consequences of this symmetry in processes which can be observed in the
laboratory, such as rare decays of heavy quarks, and on those which have
cosmological significance. The results of the study will be important in
furthering our understanding of the fundamental forces in nature. ***
