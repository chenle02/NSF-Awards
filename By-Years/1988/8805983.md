> The root systems of forest trees will be studied in sites where the
aboveground portions of the trees have been damaged. Central questions of the
research are: 1) Are "root gaps" formed at the same time as "canopy gaps" are
formed?; and 2) What processes are involved in "root gap" formation and closure?
A lodgepole pine (>Pinus> >contorta>) forest in the Medicine Bow Mountains of
Wyoming will serve as the study site. Disturbance patches of various sizes will
be created in the forest by cutting down and removing aboveground plant parts.
The activity of fine roots and ectomycorrhiza will be measured using two
different techniques . the screen intercept method and the sequential coring
method. Root graphs and mycorrhizal links will be studied through careful field
excavation for the former and laboratory dissection of soil cores for the
latter. Finally changes in nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in the gaps
will be studied by lysimetry and buried bag incubations. This research will
expand our understanding of the biotic responses of forest systems to
disturbance. Research on belowground components of forest ecosystems is rare and
research on belowground components of disturbed forests even rarer. Yet we know
that this research is needed for the development of predictive models that
consider the effects of various kinds of disturbance on forest ecosystem
function, including the forest's ability to act as a "filters" in watersheds
that supply drinking water. Dr. Knight and his colleagues at the University of
Wyoming are experts on production and nutrient cycling in the forests of the
Rocky Mountain area. The institutional support available to them is very good.
