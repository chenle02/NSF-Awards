9405577 Hole This research is to support continuation of the development of 3- D
forward and inverse analysis procedures for seismic data. An existing software
program will be extended and improved to allow the computation of reflection
travel times in detailed 3-D media. Algorithms will be developed to invert both
refraction and reflection travel times to determine both velocity and reflecting
interface structures. The use of amplitudes in the analysis will lead to the
inversion for 3-D attenuation structure (Q). The emphasis will be on the
development of practical analysis tools that can be widely applied by all
scientists to 3-D seismic surveys. ***
