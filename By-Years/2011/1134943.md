This Ethics Education in Science and Engineering project will integrate multi-
institutional, cross-disciplinary education and research efforts to create a
novel pedagogy of sustainability ethics for science &amp; engineering graduate
students. It will create a collaborative classroom setting that draws on science
&amp; engineering students? predilection for experimental learning and teamwork
to explore different ethical approaches to problems in sustainability using a
game-based, deliberative and participatory setting. Ultimately, this project
will link science &amp; engineering graduate students on several campuses, using
information-communication technology tools to create an intellectually diverse
learning community studying in parallel. This project will pilot novel game
modules in unique, integrative graduate education programs at the host
Universities, create an Instructor workshop for the purpose of training
additional faculty in the new teaching methods, and ultimately engage several
Universities with sustainability programs rooted in different science,
technology and engineering disciplines. Lastly, this project will enhance the
problem-solving skills of scientists &amp; engineers who will ultimately join a
technical workforce that is better prepared to meet the challenge of
sustainability
