Abstract: SciTeKS (Science Technology: Knowledge and Skills) is an
interdisciplinary (biology, chemistry, earth science), modular, technology
education curriculum for students in grades 11 and 12. The goal of the
curriculum is to introduce high school students to standards-based science
technology in an industrial, problem-based format. Each ofthe 14, 5-week modules
is designed to create a "virtual workplace" for students, through laboratory
experiences, computer-based multimedia, and video. While working through each
module, students apply science knowledge, and practice problem-solving and
laboratory skills in an industrial, "real world" context. Student proficiency in
skills and knowledge is assessed throughout the program with a variety of
methods: performance assessment using multimedia industry-related simulations,
labs, and presentations; journal analysis; self-assessment of progress; and
teacher-generated assessments. Modules are developed by a writing team who work
in close collaboration with technology education teachers and industry members.
Module components (video, computer-based multimedia, and print) are reviewed at
key points in their development, by project advisors, members of industry,
teachers, and students. After review and revision, modules are field tested with
teachers in a variety of high school settings (tech prep programs, general
technology education programs, and traditional science classes) across the
country. Results from the field test are used to revise modules in preparation
for dissemination by a commercial publisher.
