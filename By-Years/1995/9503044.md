Ripon College This CAREER award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in
support of the research and teaching activities of Dr. Colleen Byron. The
research plan involves the characterization of the electron transfer properties
of the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCD) by electrochemical, spectroscopic
and synthetic organic techniques. The research will focus on the role of
substrate and/or product complexation on the electron transfer properties of
GCD, and the effect of alterations of the GCD aminoacid sequence, particularly
near the active site, on the electron transfer properties of GCD. Dr. Byron's
teaching plan will focus on development of the analytical, organic and
biochemistry courses. She will update these courses to include topics and
laboratory experiments of societal and environmental relevance and emphasize
interdisciplinary science. She will also coordinate a chemistry seminar series
and continue activities in undergraduate advising and mentoring. Apart from the
inherent advancement of our understanding of electron transfer in enzymatic
systems, this research will address specific issues relevant to the metabolism
of certain aminoacids by GCD at a molecular level and the role of mutations in
GCD deficiency. The involvement of undergraduate students in the implementation
of the research will have a significant educational value.
