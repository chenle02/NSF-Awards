ABSTRACT EEC-9528527 Mathur The use of a model of a virtual Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) as a tool to develop, operate, and manage a
Center can dramatically impact the way all parties to a Center interact with it.
The initial model of the I/UCRC for Software Engineering (SERC) called VSERC is
presently accessible on the world wide-web through NETSCAPE. This award provides
funding for a project to improve the robustness of VSERC to site configuration
errors; improve access control; develop a parameterized version of VSERC
(capable of modification to suit other NSF Centers); and test the implementation
of VSERC for another NSF Center. Researcher from four universities (Purdue
University, University of Florida, University of West Florida, and University of
Oregon) will perform this research.
