An Optics and Photonics Laboratory is being developed to be used in two physics
department courses, a new course, Principles of Optics and Photonics, and an
existing course, Lasers and Applications, which is being upgraded to include a
laboratory section. The course Principles of Optics and Photonics is a
prerequisite for electrical engineering courses in photonics and fiber optics
and for a physics course in Lasers and Applications. The equipment consists of
the apparatus necessary to demonstrate a broad range of optical principles and
to introduce students to the important fundamental properties of sources and
detectors used in modern photonics technology. The major equipment includes:
Projects in Optics Kits; Laser Picowatt Digital Power Meters; Germanium Infrared
Detectors; Spatial Filters; and Multispec Monochromator/Spectrographs and
Accessories.
