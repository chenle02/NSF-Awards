CTS-9414714 D. Frey University of Maryland Baltimore County The purification of
proteins using the analytical scale technique of chromaofocusing and its process
scale analog of "buffer focusing" will be studied. These techniques employ
internally produced pH and ionic strength gradients to simultaneously
concentrate and purify proteins without denaturation or precipitation. The
behavior of retained pH gradients obtained using multivalent buffering ions and
the effect of the change in protein charge due to adsorption will be
investigated. Previous local equilibrium theories will be modified to include
several buffering species will be used with strong and weak base ion-exchange
adsorbents to generate retained and gradual pH gradients, respectively. An
improved understanding of buffer focusing as a novel method for bioseparations
will be achieved. It may lead to a less expensive and more efficient process for
protein separations on a large scale.
