This research is concerned with the geometric properties of decompositions of
the flag variety induced by generalized Bruhat- Birkhoff type decompositions
constructed using root data. The principal investigator will study the
connections between certain generalized Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, the
representation theory of the associated Kac-Moody Lie algebra and the geometry
of these varieties. This research is in the general area of Lie algebras. The
principal investigator is concerned with the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials which
are combinatorially defined objects having deep connections with structures in
geometry and representation theory. This work is important both in mathematics
and physics.
