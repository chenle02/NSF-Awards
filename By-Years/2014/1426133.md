The Minority Affairs Committee (MAC) of the American Society for Biochemistry
and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) will offer a workshop in 2014 to mentor early
career scientists who are trained in areas supported by the NSF in the fields of
biology, biophysics, biochemistry and molecular biology. The workshop will
provide grant writing skills and other mentoring for ~30 new investigators and
postdoctoral scholars who are under-represented minorities in STEM or work at
minority-serving institution. The workshop will provide training and mentorship
from successful scientists who are themselves minorities, work at minority
serving institutions, or have an established record of broadening participation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to broaden participation in STEM related NSF-
funded high-quality, outcome-oriented research. Completion of the 2014 workshop
will enable Assistant Professors and postdoctoral scientists, particularly those
from populations that are underrepresented in the sciences to obtain critical
feedback in the development of more competitive NSF proposals. Successfully
securing extramural funding is critical to sustaining a career in academia. When
coupled with the disparate number of underrepresented minority faculty who are
extra-murally funded, this workshop will have a profound impact on fostering the
diversification of the scientific workforce. Success will be assessed by
tracking the submissions and funding outcomes of proposals to the NSF by the
mentees. The assessment process will identify best practices to seed the
development of a multi-year grant writing and mentoring workshop series. A web-
based platform will enable dissemination of these best practices to the larger
scientific community.
