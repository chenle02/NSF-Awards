The goal of this research program is to develop a realistic understanding of the
complex dynamic behavior of piles and pile groups. The aim is to develop a
comprehensive database to (1) measure quantitatively the influence of realistic
soil behaviors, practical soil profiles, pile configurations, static foundation
preloads, and dynamic excitation levels, and (2) to validate and evaluate the
accuracy and limitations of current analytical models and computational methods
for analyzing soil-foundation interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these
goals, a series of experiments are being conducted on physical models of single
and group piles embedded in the ground. The results from these experiments will
be used to calibrate and improve the predictive capability of the state-of-the-
art analytical models (both simplified and complex) for soil dynamics
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
