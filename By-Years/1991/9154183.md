Two five-day summer workshops concerned with the development and use of computer
software in the instruction of core mathematics courses will be conducted for 50
undergraduate mathematics faculty. The first workshop will provide opportunities
for undergraduate faculty to explore key concepts from group theory including
transformation groups, composition of transformations, commutativity and
noncommutativity, and group extension. The second workshop will focus on
discrete algorithmic mathematics. Both workshops will combine classroom lectures
and discussion with extensive hands-on computer work by the participants.
