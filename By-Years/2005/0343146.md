This collaborative award involves the systematic study and assessment of the
importance of hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide production in the
interaction of sunlight with aerosols that are found in the marine boundary
layer. It is recognized that the breakdown of nitrate ions and organic
compounds, commonly found in these particles, by solar radiation leads to the
production of oxidized compounds, but this recognition is not accompanied by
quantitative understanding. This study will deploy an apparatus to make fresh
marine aerosols that will be carefully characterized and exposed to sunlight.
Controlling variables such as acidity, temperature, and aerosol amount will be
changed systematically to help quantify and test possible mechanisms of the
production of these secondary oxidized species. Then similar experiments will be
performed with ambient aerosols, which will be somewhat more complicated because
they will likely have undergone some transformations during their time in the
atmosphere. The results of this study will be incorporated into a model designed
to quantify aerosols and gas phase chemical processes in the troposphere in
order to assess the importance of these processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During
the course of this research a post-doctoral fellow as well as graduate and
undergraduate students will participate. This work contributes to the goals and
activities of a number of national and international programs including the
Surface Ocean - Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS), International Global Atmospheric
Chemistry (IGAC) and National Aerosol-Climate Interactions Program (NACIP).
