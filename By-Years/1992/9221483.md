This award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics Research by a group
at Cornell University in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported
scientists. The group will continue studying very high energy antiproton- proton
scattering at the Fermilab Tevatron Accelerator. The proposal includes the
construction of a new small angle particle detector using the emerging
scintillating fiber technology.
