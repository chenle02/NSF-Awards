9528490 Mendoza This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
explores a new concept for fabrication of passive and active integrated optic
devices in glasses. The approach is direct photolithographic writing of
integrated optic devices onto photoactive sol-gel glasses. Phase II will develop
and characterize simple integrated optic structures such as 1x2 and 2x2
splitters and directional couplers for use in passive optical telecommunication
networks. Both single-mode and multimode couplers will be fabricated with a wide
range of splitting and coupling ratios and losses on the order of 0.1 dB/cm. In
addition, methods will be developed for automated coupling of input/output (IO)
chips to signal-carrying optical fibers using laser fusion. IO chips connected
to optical fibers will be encapsulated in polymer resin packages to protect the
devices from mechanical and environmental damage. Finally, Alpha-test prototypes
will be distributed to industrial laboratories for feedback and guidance in
Phase III commercializtion. Potential commercial applications of the sol-gel
process are expected in passive optic telecommunication networks, telephony,
cable television, video distribution loops, high-bandwidth digital
communication, analog signal transmission, sensors, environmental monitoring,
and medical dianosis.
