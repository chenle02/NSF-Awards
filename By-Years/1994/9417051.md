9417051 Siddharthan The objective of this study is to develop and validate
seismic design guidelines for mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) walls based on
their behavior in geotechnical centrifuge tests. There are currently no
realistic guidelines available to predict the behavior of mechanically
stabilized earth walls under seismic loading conditions. The main goals of the
study are: (1) to conduct centrifuge tests on at least five model configurations
with sinusoidal and earthquake-like base excitations to gain insight into the
characteristic behavior of MSE walls, (2) to develop a simpler rigid-plastic
analytical model to predict permanent seismic displacement of MSE walls, (3) to
validate the proposed numerical model using existing and new centrifuge model
tests and finite element studies, and (4) to develop simple seismic design
guidelines for MSE walls. The centrifuge tests are conducted on the large
geotechnical centrifuge at the University of California - Davis. ***
