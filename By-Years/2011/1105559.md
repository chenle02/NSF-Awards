This work focuses on the detection, manipulation, and use of cold gases of atoms
trapped within a high-quality optical resonator. In such a system, the internal
state of the atoms -- their quantum spin -- interacts strongly with light
injected into the cavity. This well controlled interaction allows us to explore
the quantum limits of how well the spin state of the atomic gas can be measured,
to direct light-mediated interactions between the atomic spins, and to examine
the behavior of a complex quantum system under constant measurement. Specific
aims of the effort are to demonstrate a new range of dynamical phenomena
predicted to occur due to feedback between the cavity field and the spin
ensemble, and to employ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study dynamical
phenomena with the highest spatial resolution. Our scientific findings will
clarify how complex non-equilibrium phenomena result from the hybridization of
several simple quantum elements, and will shed light on magnetic and transport
phenomena in solid-state materials. The work also provides excellent laboratory
skills and scientific training to future scientific leaders.
