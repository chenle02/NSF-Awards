The project will investigate the dynamical processes that generate intraseasonal
variability in the equatorial components of the atmospheric angular momentum.
These components of the 3D angular momentum vector are orthogonal to its axial
component, which has been intensely studied in the past because of its
association with variations in the zonal-mean zonal wind. The equatorial
components, on the other hand, are related to planetary-scale atmospheric wave
variability (including, potentially, the Madden-Julian oscillation), and are
consequential for polar motion. Dr. Feldstein will conduct a dynamically
oriented diagnosis of the mechanisms generating intraseasonal variability in
equatorial angular momentum. He will analyze long-term integrations of
atmospheric general circulation model (albeit with an idealized lower boundary
condition) and a record of reanalyzed atmospheric observations (produced by the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction) to shed light on the evolution of
this variability. The project will advance the understanding of atmospheric
angular momentum variability, and contribute to improvements in prediction skill
of the medium and longer-range weather forecasts.
