Princeton University operates a multidisciplinary Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) site affiliated with the Princeton Materials Institute
(PMI). Fifteen undergraduate students are recruited nationwide every year for a
nine-week summer research experience under the supervision of science and
engineering faculty associated with PMI. Students also attend short courses and
seminars on materials science and engineering topics, and participate in visits
to local companies involved in materials processing and engineering. Through a
series of presentations and organized discussion groups, students are challenged
to examine the role of science and engineering research against a broader
societal context.
