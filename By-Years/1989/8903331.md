Zero crossings (and local energies) of a set of wavelet transforms encode
discontinuities and structure of an image at multiple scales. Wavelet theory
permits analysis of these representations, including such directional and
temporal filters as are found in biological vision systems. This grant is for
further study of wavelet transforms for image compression, texture
discrimination, and stereo matching.
