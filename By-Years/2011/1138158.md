This proposal seeks funding to support the travel of advanced doctoral students
so that they can participate in the 15th International Conference in Artificial
Intelligence in Education and in the Young Researchers Track (YRT) that is part
of that conference. The Young Researchers Track provides a forum for Ph.D.
students to present and discuss their work with mentors from outside of their
home institutions and to meet peers with similar interests. Mentoring happens in
two ways -- as part of the Young Researchers Track, where they will be
encouraged and offered feedback by three mentors, and through an individual
mentoring program where each doctoral student will be matched with a mentor with
expertise in the student's research area. Mentors will be senior AI and ED
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Young Researchers Track
are members of the next generation of cyberlearning researchers. Participation
in the proposed program will supplement their education at their home
institutions and help prepare them to be leaders in transforming education
through the use of learning technologies.
