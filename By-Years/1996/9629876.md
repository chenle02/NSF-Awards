9629876 Holyoak How spatial structure affects populations dynamics, and how
habitat fragmentation affects biodiversity are two of the most important
questions in modern ecology. In metapopulations of single species, or sets of
species that do not interact, subdivision of a habitat is expected to cause
collapse to global ("metapopulation") extinction, such that species with the
lowest dispersal rates will go extinct soonest. In contrast, metapopulation
models of interacting species predict that an intermediate degree of subdivision
can promote coexistence of otherwise unstably interacting species. The present
study offers a unique opportunity to investigate how habitat subdivision
influences the structure and persistence of species assemblages. This work will
be conducted in aquatic microcosms containing an assemblage of protozoans in
which the pair-wise and multispecies interactions are known. Two alternative
hypotheses will be tested: (1) Increased subdivision always decreases the
persistence of all species, with the poorest dispersers becoming extinct
soonest, and (2) Subdivision promotes the persistence of some or all species, at
least up to some intermediate degree of subdivision; this would imply that
interactions between species are important. These hypotheses will be tested by
measuring the persistence of a variety of species combinations in microcosms
with different degrees of subdivision. Dispersal rates will also be measured, so
that the sequence in which species go extinct can be recorded. The experiments
will show whether the response of assemblages to habitat subdivision can be
predicted from the dynamics of the particular species involved, versus the type
and details of between-species interactions. This study will demonstrate whether
habitat fragmentation (subdivision) promotes biodiversity. In particular, the
experiments will test the parts of ecological theory that are most directly
relevant to predicting the response of endangered species living in patchy
habitats to varying degrees of fragmentation.
