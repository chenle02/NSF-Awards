The project aims to create a personalized student learning environment by
blending emerging Internet technology, software, computer interfacing, cutting
edge graphical user interface, effective pedagogical designs, and assessment and
evaluation schemes. The developed environment will have five major features: a)
live faculty presentation for a laboratory session; b) provision of integration
with a range of STEM courses; c) video, audio, text messaging capability; d)
provision of collaboration with frequent student feedback; and e)
faculty/facilitator monitoring of student progress and activities. The remote
laboratory entails physical (real) laboratory equipment being controlled
remotely. The developed environment will be validated by using it in an
undergraduate level laboratory course (control systems
laboratory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this project will be
instrumental in bringing a transformation from a production-line style
laboratory delivery system, where every student goes through the same treatment
irrespective of their level of knowledge, learning style, and pace of learning,
to a personalized and individualized approach with a level of collaboration.
This will help students with diverse background to progress toward their
learning goals and thus increase retention and graduation rates. The approach
will also be widely applicable to other areas such as distance learning, skill
development, and corporate and workforce training.
