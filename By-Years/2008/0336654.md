In collaboration with its four Montana Consortium partners, Fort Peck Community
College is conducting an internship program to increase the number of
minorities, women and American Indians majoring in STEM (science, technology,
engineering and mathematics) areas. The collaborating institutions are Little
Big Horn College, Fort Belknap College, Stone Child College, and Rocky Mountain
College. They are providing more students with an opportunity to participate in
community based research projects as a means to attract and retain students.
These experiences are structured to teach students how to conduct research while
participating in a research experience. Teaching of research skills is being
achieved by offering a "Research for Undergraduates" credit course via "a blend
of Internet and ITV (Internet television)." STEM instructors and research site
coordinators have received mentorship training that is helping them to provide
academic, career, and personal development guidance to students. &lt;br/&gt;The
project is working to: achieve a 20 percent increase in the number of students
receiving STEM certifications or degrees (two and four year); provide research
experiences for a least 14 students annually; and increase the retention rate of
STEM students by 25 percent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
