The funding will support the Southern Regional Number Theory Conferences to be
held in the Gulf Coast region in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The first one is planned
for March 21-22, 2020 at the Louisiana State University. The conference series
will focus on communication between researchers in the Gulf region. The main
purposes include:&lt;br/&gt;1. Bringing together the researchers from the
various branches of number theory in the region and expose the local students
and younger researchers to related problems in the field.&lt;br/&gt;2. To
broaden the interaction and communication among number theorists in the
region.&lt;br/&gt;3. To build a platform so that local graduate students will
have more exposure to various topics in number theory and opportunities to
present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In number theory, people study the properties of
numbers. The seemingly simple concept of counting leads to remarkably difficult
unsolved problems in mathematics whose solutions would significantly impact many
areas of math; it would also affect other fields such as biology, chemistry,
computer science, information theory, music, and physics. For the conference
series, we will accommodate different groups in number theory in the Gulf
region. In addition to featuring local speakers, we plan to invite outside
speakers to expose our junior participants to a range of scientific topics and
professional development opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about
the conference series can be found at

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
