Astronomers want to observe the Cosmic Dawn, when the first stars and galaxies
formed. These observations would resolve many open questions about how galaxies
came to be, but owing to the extreme distance, the time period has yet to be
observed. Principal Investigator (PI) Jacobs and his team are working on
instruments to observe the redshifted 21 cm radio signal emitted from hydrogen
gas during the Cosmic Dawn. The low frequency radio signals are very faint as
not only are the galaxies far away, but they are obscured by foreground galaxies
in the nearby universe. PI Jacobs and his team will develop advanced instrument
calibration tools and techniques for two 21cm cosmology instruments currently
under construction, the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the
Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA). To broaden participation the PI
will continue to mentor and provide stipends for students in both the Research
Experience for Non-Traditional Undergraduates (RENTU) program and for his
graduate students who are leading contributions to the Completely Hackable
Amateur Radio Telescope (CHART) program. The graduate students provide kits and
expert guidance to high school students and teachers so that they can build a
radio telescope and observe hydrogen gas in the Milky
Way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The systematic noise floor improvements will be
addressed with drones, internal calibration sources, and laboratory measurements
combined with advanced data analysis pipelines. The HERA power spectrum
measurements will rule out exotic models and provide new constraints on
canonical models of the first stars and galaxies. The PI will lead an OVRO-LWA
cosmology program which aims to determine hydrogen 21 cm limits at redshifts 18
through 25 while also demonstrating techniques applicable on other
instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
