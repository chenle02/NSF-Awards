9520501 Anderson Research will be conducted to develop critical enabling
technologies and systems for precise, minimally invasive delivery of localized
treatment for tumors and other soft tissue lesions. The goal to register 3-D
rendered CT images with real-time fluoroscopy to identify and locate tumors in
the liver and to use this information to direct a remote center-of-motion
robotic manipulator for fast and accurate targeting of the lesion and to deliver
a preplanned pattern of localized therapy using percutaneous approaches. Success
with this research would replace more costly surgery or provide a therapeutic
alternative to individuals in whom surgery would be contraindicated. This
technology has a significant potential to reduce health care costs and to
improve the quality of life for a very large number of patients. 3D image-guided
surgery and therapy is a challenging and important new field of medicine that
holds enormous promise to benefit the patient while simultaneously reducing the
cost of doing the procedure. ***
