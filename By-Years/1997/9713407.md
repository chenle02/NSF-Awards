This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project involves use of newly
developed instrumentation to measure the flux of dimethylsulfide (DMS) from
seawater to the atmosphere. Preliminary work off a pier are the first for DMS
using the atmospheric profile in the lower boundary layer of the marine
atmosphere. An at-sea test in July 1997 represents a unique and short-term
opportunity to conduct measurements of gas flux on a cruise dedicated to that
task. This project will allow the PI to transfer his technique for measuring DMS
profiles to a remotely-operated catamaran, allowing him to relate DMS flux with
concomitant investigations of surface chemistry and physics by other
investigators on the cruise. The direct comparison of these independent methods
of estimating flux represents a test of thin layer transfer models and may
provide insight into more general questions of gas exchange.
