Chief Dull Knife College, in collaboration with the University of Montana,
Montana State University and Northern Cheyenne Reservation high schools, will
implement a five-year TCUP project to develop a seamless pathway for students
between reservation high schools, Chief Dull Knife College and the two partner
universities. The project will enable team members from these institutions to
work together and to establish long-term positive relationships and
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project team members, including new faculty
positions established through program funding, will work together to develop and
revise high school and college math and science curricula; provide teacher
training; develop capstone research and mentoring experiences; and implement a
2-week STEM workshop for high school students. &lt;br/&gt;
