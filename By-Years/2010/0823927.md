The objective of this research is to develop the critical analytical framework
for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication in complex channels.
Existing MIMO capacity calculation software will be enhanced by including
complex channel models for vehicles, lossy biological channels, and highly noisy
channels. We will also integrate detector models with the electromagnetic and
communication MIMO models, and verify the models via measurement.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Today's MIMO
models do not include an accurate representation of non-Gaussian, ultra-
reflective, depolarizing, and highly lossy channels seen in many personal
communication channels, body-worn or implanted medical communication channels,
highly reflective and lossy ('Hyper-Raleigh') channels typical of intra-
vehicular communication for sensor networks inside aircraft, cars, buses,
trains, ships, etc., most wireless ad-hoc network environments, or the human
body scattering channel for medical imaging. This research program will provide
more advanced channel models for MIMO. This will enable specialized MIMO design
for each application, providing a far greater probability of initial success for
the deployed systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses unmet communication demand for future
wireless devices. In addition to the significant societal, medical, and
financial aspects of that potential advancement, the research will be directly
integrated into coursework at the University of Utah.
