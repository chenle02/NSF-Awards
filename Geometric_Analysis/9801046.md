Gursky Proposal DMS-9801046



The research proposed is concerned with the study of fourth order problems
which arise in spectral theory, and involve: existence and regularity questions
for non-linear partial differential equations, asymptotics of an elliptic
equation which arises in conformal geometry, and its relation to the
determination of the best constant in a Sobolev imbedding.

The need for the study of partial differential equations is due to their
central importance in every manner of "real world" problems: from CAT scan
machines to the spread of diseases, from jet engine design to computer
visualization. The work supported by this grant is concerned with some basic
questions about "fourth order" equations, a field that has a lot of open and
very interesting questions, and the relation of these equations to other fields
of mathematics, especially geometry.
