This project seeks to exploit some of the developing ideas in harmonic analysis
which relate to important ideas in self-similarity. Self-similarity is a subject
of intense interest today because of its relationship with fractal geometry and
wavelet analysis. However, these relationships can be traced to work in the
early 30's by Wiener and Wintner on Fourier transforms of Cantor measures. Work
to be done includes the computation of dimensions of classes of self-similar
measures. There are two directions in which the concept will be expanded. The
first involves replacing strictly contractive transformations in their
definition and replacing this with average contractivity. One can no longer
guarantee compact support in this case. The growth rate of such measures and the
smoothness of their Fourier transform are subjects for investigation. The second
direction replaces the convex combinations with variable weights. Here one is
interested in existence and uniqueness of the measures as well as their Lp and
pointwise dimensions. Work will also be done in analyzing the Radon transform of
self-similar measures. The two natural questions to be considered are whether or
not the Radon transform is invertible and whether one can characterize the range
of the transform. The transform is known to preserve the class of distributions
if and only if the transform of the measure is not slowly decreasing. For self-
similar measures this is not the case, leaving open the question of what the
proper spaces ought to be. Harmonic analysis combines those elements of
mathematics best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis. One seeks to decompose
complex problems into fundamental components. These components are then analyzed
for their basic characteristics. Finally, the solution is reconstructed through
a recombination of the components. The Fourier series and Fourier transform are
examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other representing a
continuous decomposition. More recently the wavelet theory added new dimensions
to some of the more classical approaches to harmonic analysis.
