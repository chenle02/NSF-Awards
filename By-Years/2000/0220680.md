0220680 Qiu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the Kuroshio Extension
System Study (KESS) is to identify and quantify the dynamic and thermodynamic
processes governing the variability of and the interaction between the Kuroshio
Extension and the recirculation gyre. Investigators from three US institutions
will deploy a state-of-the-art array consisting of moored-profiler and current-
meter moorings and inverted echo sounders equipped with near-bottom pressure and
current sensors. Profiling floats will monitor the temperature and salinity
structure in the recirculation gyre south of the Kuroshio Extension. The KESS
array is designed to use these tools synergistically to observe the Kuroshio
Extension in a more complete way than any one of them could do alone. In
particular, the Inverted Echo Sounders will map features of the jet as they
evolve and, in combination with the Moored Profilers, will quantify the cross-
frontal fluxes, while the profiling floats will monitor the upper ocean
structure around the Kuroshio Extension and its recirculation gyres. KESS will
use these combined observations to identify and quantify the dynamic and
thermodynamic processes governing the variability of, and the interaction
between, the Kuroshio Extension and the recirculation gyre. The proposed
approach makes extensive use of satellite data (surface temperature and sea-
surface height). The investigators will also collaborate closely with Japanese
scientists studying the overall Kuroshio system. The measurements from the KESS
array will guide future planning for a long term observational program as part
of CLIVAR.&lt;br/&gt;
