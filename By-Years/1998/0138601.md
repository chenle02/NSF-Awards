The purpose of this satellite meeting of the Society for Neuroscience is to
bring together an international group of students and researchers representing
diverse fields related to the ontogeny of motor behavior in vertebrates to
assess the current status of the field, to discuss strategies for future
research, and to establish a foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration. In
order to accomplish these objectives, researchers using diverse animal species
as well as diverse methodologies ranging from the molecular to behavioral will
be invited. This symposium will provide a rare opportunity for scientists from
different disciplines and perspectives to develop new collaborations and new
approaches to understanding the ontogeny of motor behavior. Announcements and
other publicity for the symposium will encourage attendance by women and
underrepresented minorities. The summary of the meeting will be published in
Neuron as a Meeting Review.
