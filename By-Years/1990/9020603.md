Ecological Cognition in Visualization This effort contributes to the theory of a
user model and a measurement methodology designed, in part, to permit
quantitative assessment of visualization interfaces. Ecological theory states
that the state of affairs in the world can be represented directly through
cognitive "states of affairs" (corresponding to ecological processing aspects).
This work is to test the hypothesis that ecological processing includes cycles
of "envisioning" and "inspection" information processing operations. The
difficulty of cognitive tasks can then be characterized by the allocation of
processing resources (e.g., the allocation of attention) between the
(relatively) memory-independent ecological operations and controlled, memory
intensive symbolic processing. Thus, this approach allows consideration of the
task context as well as viewing logical cognitive operations. It makes possible
testable predications about both abstract and concrete tasks. It can be folded
into existing GOMS models for quantitative assessment of interface metaphors
allowing subsequent evaluation and minimization of the difficulty of interacting
with direct manipulation and visualization interfaces.
