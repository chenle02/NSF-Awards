9409775 Dean This project is concerned with a solution of the Jacobian
Conjecture. The principal investigator describes a new approach for verying the
conjecture in dimension two. The ideas eminate from work on the relationship
between the Jacobian Conjecture and the Kirillov-Dixmier Conjecture for the
first Weyl algebra. An extension of this approach to higher dimensions is also
discussed. It is well known that an invertible polynomial map on a complex
affine space has a jacobian which is a nonzero constant. The Jacobian Conjecture
asserts the converse: a polynomial map with a jacobian which is a nonzero
constant is invertible. In spite of the vast amount of attention which it has
attracted over the last fifty years, the Jacobian Conjecture remains open in
every dimension greater than one. This award supports work on a novel approach
to this problem.
