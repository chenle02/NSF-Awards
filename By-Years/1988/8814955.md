The proposed research is on the plasma kinetic processes in the earth's
geomagnetic tail. The approach to be used is a combination of analytical an
numerical methods. The research topics to be studied are new theories of slow
shock in the distant tail region. Additional theoretical work includes study of
broadband electrostatic noise (BEN) associated with slow shocks and
electromagnetic instabilities in the plasma sheet.
