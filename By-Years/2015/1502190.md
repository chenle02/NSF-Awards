Algebraic geometry is the study of the qualitative properties of forms described
by polynomial equations. The questions it addresses arise in many areas of
science and mathematics, from statistical sampling to robotics and mathematical
physics. This research project concerns the study of aspects of algebraic
geometry related to syzygy theory, a sort of microscope that allows one to see
details of polynomial equations that are not apparent from the equations
themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will work on problems in
commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and computational methods for these
fields. He will focus on four areas: 1) Cohen-Macaulay and Ulrich complexity of
hypersurfaces: A central problem is to describe the minimal size of a non-free
maximal Cohen-Macaulay module over a hypersurface, in particular over the
permanent hypersurfaces. 2) The structure of high syzygies over complete
intersections: Central problems are to give criteria for a module over a
complete intersection to be a "high syzygy" in the sense of Eisenbud and Peeva;
and to understand the relations between the even and odd parts of the infinite
minimal free resolutions of modules over a complete intersection. 3) Duality for
residual intersections: The central remaining open problem is to prove and
extend a conjecture of van Straten and Warmt on the socle of a particular
representation of the canonical module of a 0-dimensional residual intersection.
4) Tate resolutions for complexes of sheaves on a toric variety: The central
problem is to define and compute a good analogue for toric varieties of the Tate
resolution of a sheaf or a complex of sheaves on a projective space.
