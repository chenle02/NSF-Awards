This workshop on "Artificial Intelligence in Real-Time" is aimed at examining
how AI systems can both be supported and can help to support real-time operating
systems. This area is of critical importance as AI systems need to function in
the support of such critical applications as nuclear power plant control,
aircraft operation, hospital life support systems, and military command and
control, among others. The workshop, to be held at the University of Maryland in
the Fall of 1992, brings together members of both AI and real-time communities
to explore issues of mutual interest. A report, produced by this workshop, will
aid in the planning activities of the KMCS, RMI, and ITO Programs. according to
NSF Manual 10,122.1.3 (b), such proposals are exempt from peer review.
