This statistics research project uses hierarchical and empirical Bayes methods
to choose between two nested regression models for estimating the response
function. The estimators serve as a weighted average of the least squares
estimators based on the full and the reduced models with weights being dependent
on the data. These estimators lean more toward the least squares estimators
based on the full models if the observed ratio suggests a full model, and
towards the least squares estimators based on the reduced model if the opposite
is true. This project is in the general area of statistics and probability and
applies hierarchical and empirical Bayes methods in areas of survey sampling,
linear models, and quality assurance. In sample surveys, the research focuses on
small area estimation. In such cases, typically a few examples are available
from an individual area, and estimates of parameters of interest for a certain
area or simultaneously for several areas can be improved by incorporating
information from similar neighboring areas.
