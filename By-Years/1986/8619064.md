Newer materials for separating environmentally-undesirable ions from waste
waters and nuclear wastes are needed to meet the stringent waste-treatment
requirements. Such materials are also important in the recovery of valuable
metals and minerals from solutions. This program is designed to evaluate the
basic chemical properties and characteristics of a new class of ion- exchange
materials developed by the principal investigators at the Materials Research
Laboratory of the Pennsylvania State University. The new ion exchangers promise
to have larger capacity than the currently-available ones and have the potential
to be of use in a large number of separation processes.
