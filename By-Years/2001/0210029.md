This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Stephen G. Boxer of Stanford University to
continue studies on the development of spectroscopic methods that probe
interactions between molecular fragments separated by relatively long spacer
groups. Stark effect spectroscopy is used to provide quantitative information on
the magnitude and direction of charge displacement associated with a
spectroscopic transition. The effect of an applied electric field on an
electronic or vibrational transition is used to generate a deeper understanding
of bonding, especially in coordination complexes, and the concept that the
vibrational frequency shifts can be a quantitative probe for electrostatic
effects in complex systems such as proteins. Initial results indicate that
vibrational Stark spectroscopy can be a powerful and minimally invasive approach
for obtaining information on how protein electrostatic fields change in modified
proteins and during catalysis. This work begins to outline how electric fields
can be used to manipulate the rates of electron and proton transfer as
biochemical reactions create, consume or displace electric dipoles. Unusual and
characteristic non-classical Stark effects are expected to occur in mixed-
valence complexes that exhibit multiple states whose energy difference is
affected by the applied field. Analyses of the resulting unusual line shapes
will give quantitative information on the energetics, electronic coupling and
charge displacement in these molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new form of
spectroscopy will be used to study how electric fields affect electron, proton
and dipole movements in chemical, photochemical and biochemical
processes.&lt;br/&gt;
