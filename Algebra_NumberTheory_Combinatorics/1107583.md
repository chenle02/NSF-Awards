The World Wide Web has become part of our everyday life, and information
retrieval and data mining on the Web are now of enormous practical interest. The
algorithms supporting these activities combine the view of the Web as a text
repository and as a graph, induced in various ways by links among pages, hosts
and users.

The aim of the 8th Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web Graph (WAW
2011) is to further the understanding of graphs that arise from the Web and
various user activities on the Web, and stimulate the development of high-
performance algorithms and applications that exploit these graphs. The workshop
will also welcome the researchers who are working on graph-theoretic and
algorithmic aspects of related complex networks, including citation networks,
social networks, biological networks, molecular networks, and other networks
arising from the Internet.
