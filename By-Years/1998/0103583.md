EIA-0103583&lt;br/&gt;Anand Sivasubramaniam&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS: Powerful Software for Power Constrained
Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to develop new
monitoring and simulation tools for resource monitoring at runtime, and compiler
assisted optimization to enable execution under energy evaluation and
optimization conditions. The proposal will implement these methods into an
integrated framework to evaluate optimizations at the application, compiler and
operating system levels. This project will specifically focus on a spatial
database application called PocketGIS, an important mobile application, to
explore these issues.&lt;br/&gt;
