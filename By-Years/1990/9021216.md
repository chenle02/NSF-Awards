A remarkable property of many visual systems is the capacity to abstract the
direction, velocity and position of a moving target. Detection occurs over a
wide range of velocities, stimulus configurations and lighting conditions.
Although the neuronal apparatus of visual motion detection has been studied
intensively for over 30 years, the mechanism is still unknown. A major
impediment to our current understanding is an absence of both measurements and
realistic theoretical constructs regarding the synaptic processes by which a
network of visual interneurons can compute the direction and velocity of a
moving target. In this respect, arthropods, particularly large crustaceans like
crayfish, provide a favorable model for a combined experimental and theoretical
approach to the problem. Our studies indicate that a mechanism can be resolved
into interactions among four classes of identified neurons.
