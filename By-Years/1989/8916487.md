This award provides one-half the funding required to upgrade an old but
functional electron microprobe operated by the Department of Geological Sciences
at the University of Maine. The University is committed to providing the
remaining funds required for the upgrade. The electron microprobe is a standard
instrument of choice for in-situ quantitative analysis of the elemental
composition of solids with a spatial resolution equal to several microns or
better. The University of Maine operates the only such instrument in the state.
The current instrument is old but worthy of repairs and improvements. This
upgrade will add an energy dispersive X- ray spectrometer system and will
modernize the power supply and other key electronic components at much less cost
than a new instrument. The upgraded microprobe will continue to service faculty
and student research projects at the University of Maine and to be available to
outside researchers as well.
