This is an award to support research on the feasibility of using an electron
beam to remove hydrocarbon pollutants from exhaust gases emerging from
combustion processes to reduce or eliminate their potential for polluting air
into which they are discharged. The experiments will be conducted using an
existing, pulsed induction accelerator to irradiate controlled gas mixtures
containing aromatic and chlorinated aromatic organic compounds such as benzene
and chlorobenzene. The work plan includes analyses to identify the byproducts
produced during radiation, their concentrations and the dose of radiation
required to reduce their concentration to environmentally acceptable levels..
Results of this project are expected to provide the basis for engineering design
of an optimal, all-solid-state induction accelerator system for the reduction to
acceptable levels of the concentration of hydrocarbons in exhaust gases from
combustion processes that are subjected to electron beam radiation. The proposal
leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 92-30, Small Business
Innovation Research under Topic No. 25d, Environmental Systems.
