This project completes development of a Rayleigh-Doppler lidar system at the
Millstone Hill Observatory, and operates in part of an existing instrument
cluster. The instrument cluster includes the lidar system, an incoherent scatter
radar, a Fabry-Perot interferometer, a meteor wind radar, and an optical
tomographic imaging instrument. The data improves understanding of sources of
tidal variability in the altitude of transition between the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere. The lidar instrument uses the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Firepond 1.2
meter diameter, fully-steerable telescope, as the telescope's steerability
allows full vector wind measurements up to 86 km at night, with a potential for
daytime observations to lower altitudes. The instrument cluster measures
density, temperature, and winds with high resolution over roughly the entire
altitude range from about 30 to 130 km, thus greatly extending current
observations into the source region and into the important tidal propagation
path, where the tidal amplitudes are modulated. Simultaneous Doppler wind and
temperature data collected for both day and night clarifies the role that
gravity wave (GW) dissipation has in contributing to the variability of tidal
structure. These measurements are also examined for the expected correlation
between the developing mesosphere temperature inversion layer and the forcing of
the lower mesosphere zonal wind jet that may both be caused by gravity wave
dissipation processes.
