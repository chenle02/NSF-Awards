This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Saint Michael's College for the
renovation and repair of Cheray Science Hall which houses research and research
training activities in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and in
the interdisciplinary majors in Biochemistry and Environmental Science. This
building was constructed in 1949 and has not been renovated since that time. The
ARFMP grant of $375,000 and $1,046,511 provided by the grantee as cost sharing
will be used to modernize these research and research training facilities. This
project will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by
reconfiguring the space and upgrading the electrical power and heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. These modifications will
permit an increase in the continuity and quality, quantity, and diversity of the
scientific research conducted as well as insure that current health and safety
standards are met. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by
providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the
training of undergraduate students in an institution where a large percentage of
science majors go on to pursue graduate study.
