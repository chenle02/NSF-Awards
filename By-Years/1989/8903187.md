This award provides one-half of the funding for the purchase of a
hydrogen/deuterium detector that will be added to a mass spectrometer in the
Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College. The remaining funds will be
provided by Dartmouth. Research projects requiring the detector involve: (1)
examining ore deposits, (2) studying chlorite and clay mineral diagenesis, (3)
determining the source region of New England granites, and (4) studying the role
of fluids in metamorphic belts.
