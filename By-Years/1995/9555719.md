Soloway 9555719 This effort aims to provide a compelling demonstration that a
population of high school students, representative of the rich diversity served
by public education, can-and indeed, will-engage, in the context of good
authentic science problems, in the full-range of science inquiry activities, as
advocated by the AAAS and the NRC, when they area supported by a comprehensive
and scaffold computer and communications environment; and, in so doing, the
students will develop a genuine understanding of science content and process. In
this four year project, we will construct, classroom deploy, and evaluate the
Investigators' Workshop (IWSHop), a computationally enhanced learning
environment that houses and integrates the many tools needed to support the
full-range of inquiry activities, e.g., data and information gathering, planning
&amp; Managing, modeling and visualizing, community debating. The IWShop will
also serve as meeting place, available on the Internet through the University of
Michigan's Digital Library. Learner-Centered Design will be used in the
development of the IWShop; where appropriate, 3D photo-realistic interfaces will
be used. The IWShop will be used on a routing, daily basis by students in two
high schools in Ann Arbor and two in Omaha in addressing curriculum projects
that cover a 10th grade year of integrated science. A multi-pronged, thorough
evaluation will be carried out to assess the impact of the IWShop on students'
understanding of and motivation toward science. ***
