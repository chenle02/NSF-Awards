The principal investigator (PI) proposes to study the algebraic topological
structure of the state transition lattice (diagram) of models used for
representing protocols of communication and computation systems. He will
emphasize queueing and Petri network protocol models. The research program will
involve a study of lattice topological structure, product and non-product form
networks, protocol synthesis, protocol resource contention, and the relation
between lattice structure and network traffic processes. Potential applications
include the performance evaluation of communication, computation, and management
systems.
