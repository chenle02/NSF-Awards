0107079 Wiltschko 0107064 Sharp Banded fibrous veins are common features in
deformed rocks, and are classically interpreted to indicate operation of a
crack-seal mechanism in which a crack event is immediately followed by a cement-
precipitation event due to local pressure drop. However, recent results of mass-
balance considerations have cast doubt on this being a valad mechanism. This
project will examine the question of the formation of banded veins from a new
perspective model that includes two simplifying processes - pressure exerted by
growing crystals and geochemical self-organization whereby a nearly constant
fluid composition at the vein-host walls leads to oscillations in precipitated
species. A series of tests will be applied to veins sets using both
geochemical/microthermometric data and textural information to understand
chemical and mechanical processes responsible for these types of veins. Results
will help improve understanding of vein formation and therefore their use in
understanding the tectonic setting in which they formed.
