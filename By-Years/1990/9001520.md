This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports the research to assess
the feasibility of recovering ancient microorganisms entrapped in deep glacial
ice cores. A major goal will be to establish the reliability of obtaining
ancient organisms for comparative studies with contemporary ogranisms. The
reseach will establish valid techniques for the recovery of microorganisms from
ice cores stored at the Ice Core Storage Facility in Buffalo, N.Y., and then
attempt in recover viable, ancient organisms from ice cores drilled in Greenland
and Antarctica. By studying successively older strata in ice cores, the
longevity of different taxa entrapped in ice can be estimated. Organisms that
are successfully recovered can also be used as model organisms for research on
rates of biological evolution, mechanisms of dormancy, their ecological
relevance and processes of natural preservation.
