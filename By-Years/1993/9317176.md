9317176 Phipps Morgan The PI will develop simple model descriptions of large-
scale lateral viscosity variation near the top of the mantle, and develop simple
and computationally efficient theories to treat mantle rheologies where the
mantle viscosity is radially dependent except for significant lateral variation
near the top. Since this is likely to be the largest lateral viscosity variation
in the mantle, by exploring these effects, one can better understand the
coupling between lateral viscosity variations, mantle flow and the geoid. These
models will make it possible to assess the dynamical effects of the distribution
of (strong) continental cratons and (weaker) sub-oceanic asthenosphere on mantle
flow. In addition, these models will provide useful benchmarks to guide us in
the development of a 3-D spherical, variable viscosity convection code. ****
