To investigate computational discourse and psycholinguistic aspects of the
centering theory developed by the Principal Investigator, and her students and
colleagues. The centering model addresses the relation between the form of
linguistic expression and the local discourse coherence. There are four issues
investigated in this research effort. The first deals with the integration of
the centering theory with other linguistic processes in the interpretation of
pronouns. The second involves the use application of centering to additional
context-dependent linguistic forms such as ellipsis and accentuation. The third
consists of the interaction between centering and discourse segmentation.
Finally, the fourth aspect considers the formulation of computationally
tractable rules constraining centering transitions.
