This condensed matter physics project addresses the behavior of water and its
interaction with solid surfaces at the micro and nanoscale. The properties of
water in confined geometries are relevant in areas ranging from tribology to
biology and atmospheric science. There are controversial results on the fluidity
of nano-confined water and the role of surface chemistry and topography is still
unclear. The goal of this project is to use state-of-the-art atomic force
microscopes to investigate the structure of nano-confined water and its
interaction with surfaces at the nanoscale. Students involved in this activity
will learn how to use technological relevant instrumentation in an
interdisciplinary area. Preparation of courses for graduate and undergraduate
students is an integral part of the project.

Water is the most ubiquitous liquid found in nature. However, it is a much more
complicated material than its everyday familiarity might suggest. The goal of
this project is to understand the behavior of water and its interaction with
solid surfaces at the micro and nano-scale. A better understanding of the
behavior of water nano-confined between sliding surfaces can enable improvements
in the design and operation of MEMS and hard disks. Furthermore, the structure
of water is believed to hold the key to understand protein folding. Students
involved in this interdisciplinary project will learn how to use instrumentation
relevant in nanotechnology, biology and geophysics. Preparation of courses for
graduate and undergraduate students is an integral part of the project.
