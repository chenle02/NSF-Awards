This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has as its
objective the development of interactive multimedia science and mathematics
courseware for grades K-3 using storytelling, sing-alongs, and nonaggressive
games. An important focus of these methods of instruction is on introducing
science and mathematics in an encouraging way to primary-level female students.
By providing an early intervention to counteract the trend among female
students, who begin to lose interest at this age, the proposal addresses a major
problem in US education today: alienation of females from the math/science
enterprise.
