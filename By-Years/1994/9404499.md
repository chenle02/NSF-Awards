The objective of the proposed research is to theoretically investigate the
interaction of oxygen with diamond surfaces in order to (1) identify the
principal elementary chemical reactions of O atoms, OH radicals and O2 molecules
with diamond surface sites and establish their kinetic and thermodynamic
parameters, and (2) use the results to minimize the oxygen poisoning effect in
CVD diamond. The PI will make use of his recently developed technique of
simulating gas-surface interactions and surface processes using molecular
dynamics (MD) modeling of the atoms, molecules and extended structures involved.
The method uses a semi-empirical quantum-mechanical potential (SEQMP) to
describe the region of the surface where reactions occur and an empirical
potential (EP) to describe the rest of the surface.
