This project addresses the acquisition of equipment for project-oriented open-
schedule laboratories and learning support facilities for interdisciplinary
science courses. The institution now offers three interdisciplinary science
courses for education majors and an interdisciplinary core science sequence of
two courses that is being developed under a current National Science Foundation
grant. The new equipment is being used in conjunction with these five courses.
Experience gained in these laboratories can ultimately be used as a basis for
the development of laboratories and learning support facilities that will be
used by all education majors and by all students taking core science courses.
This project deals with a number of common problems in undergraduate laboratory
science, including the efficient use of space, equipment, and personnel; the
difficulties of applying active learning techniques under the constraints
imposed by large class sizes; and the need to improve science literacy and
process skills to national levels.
