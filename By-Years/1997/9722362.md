Research in quantum gravity, a branch of theoretical physics, will focus on the
evaporation of black holes, the microscopic structure of space and time, and the
big bang. The importance of quantum gravity research, in which one tries to
construct a theory of the force of gravity which is compatible both with
relativity and with quantum mechanics, is that it opens a window to the most
fundamental levels of physical reality. If there is ever to be a revolution
comparable to the discoveries of relativity and quantum mechanics, the area of
quantum gravity is where it may well happen. Work in physics education will
concern introductory mechanics and Einstein's relativity. Dorm room experiments
for mechanics will be designed using high quality but unintimidating equipment
such as Mattel's `micro Hot Wheels' toy cars. This informal and interactive
approach is essential to students' becoming comfortable with physics and
building physics intuition. Regarding relativity, a course for non-physicists
will be introduced. Because Einstein's `theory of relativity' is actually a well
established experimental fact, it is important that any student have the
opportunity to share this new understanding of space and time.
