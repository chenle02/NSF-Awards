This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Michigan Ann
Arbor for the renovation and repair of the C. C. Little Building which houses
the x-ray mineralogical, paleomagnetic and rock magnetic, mineral separation,
and seismological/geodynamics research and research training activities of the
Department of Geological Sciences. This building was constructed in 1920 and
last renovated in 1970. The ARFMP grant of $350,000 and $353,570 provided by the
grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research
training facilities. This project will address the need to improve the current
research infrastructure by reconfiguring it so that it is more efficient and by
providing adequate power and fume exhaust systems and environmental controls and
computer network connectivity necessary for safe and reliable research
operations. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and
engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and
for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students. Also the
laboratories to be modernized in this project serve as a focus for postdoctoral
programs and collaborative and cooperative research with university and industry
throughout the nation and as an informal regional and national center for many
types of instrument-intensive research in geology.
