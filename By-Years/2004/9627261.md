This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, explores the interfacial chemistry of polymers on solid surfaces using
surface Raman spectroscopy as the primary tool. The work focusses on the
interaction of polyimides deposited on copper and chromium surfaces, and on
their oxides. A molecular understanding of the bonding interaction is the goal
of these studies, which will help to explain properties of these polymer metal
systems such as adhesion. Additionally, an important goal of this project is the
elucidation of the chemical mechanism of the surface enhanced Raman process.
Connections will be made between the electronic structure of surface adsorbed
species as probed by high resolution electron loss spectroscopy and the Raman
enhanced spectra of a series of molecules adsorbed on silver, copper, and gold
surfaces. The study of the interfacial chemistry of polymers adsorbed on metal
and metal oxide surfaces is the focus of this project supported in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry program. The polyimide on copper system, an
important one in electronic materials processing applications, is the primary
interface investigated. Raman spectroscopy will be used to probe this interface,
and an additional focus of the work is the development of a detailed
understanding of the chemical mechanism of surface Raman enhancement.
