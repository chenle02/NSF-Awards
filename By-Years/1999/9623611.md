9623611 Estle This project is an investigation of the dynamic properties of
muonium defect centers in semiconductors. Muonium is formed when an implanted
positive muon captures an electron, and mimics the behavior of isolated hydrogen
impurities which are difficult to study directly. Data on muonium in Si has
revealed three charge states and two structural configurations, along with
numerous transitions among these states. A model of the muonium transition
dynamics and state stabilities in Si is being generalized, and parameters
obtained for Ge, GaAs, and other III-V materials. Muon spin resonance and level-
crossing resonance spectra provide state identifications and give structural
details, while the magnetic-field and temperature dependences of depolarization
rates yield information on diffusion and transition dynamics. Very similar
dynamic properties of the analogous hydrogen centers are crucial to the
efficiency of hydrogen passivation of shallow dopants and its effect on the
device- related electrical and optical properties of a semiconductor material.
%%% This research exploits the similarities between hydrogen and muonium (an
atom consisting of an electron bound to a positive muon, an unstable particle)
in order to obtain information about the behavior of hydrogen in semiconductors
which cannot be obtained from direct studies. Of all of the common impurities in
semiconductors such as silicon or gallium arsenide, hydrogen has the most
unusual properties. Rather than forming the donors or acceptors which make
semiconductor-based electronics possible, hydrogen moves to existing donors or
acceptors and neutralizes them. Consequently hydrogen can very substantially
influence device characteristics. Direct investigation of hydrogen impurities
has severe limitations; however, muonium studies supply similar information and
have been most informative about those questions which are hardest to attack
directly. The current project extends successful muonium studies to obtain an
understanding of processes active in devices containing hydrogen. ***
