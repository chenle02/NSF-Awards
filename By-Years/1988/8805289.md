This award provides one-half of the funds required to purchase a micro-Fourier
Transform infrared spectrometer system. The equipment will be housed and
operated in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. The University will provide the remaining 50% match for the
purchase and will also provide laboratory space and the technical support to
maintain the machine. The infrared spectrometer research at Wisconsin will focus
on developing applications to determine the composition of microscopic fluids
trapped in rocks and minerals and their use in interpreting deep crustal
processes.
