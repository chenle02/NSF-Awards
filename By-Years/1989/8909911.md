A Chapman Conference is being held to bring together subspecialties involving
long-term sea level changes (1-100 m.y.) so that approaches, implementation of
techniques, and results can be discussed and compared. This conference will
consider accurate determinations of past sea levels, the mechanisms responsible
for each major change in sea level, and the consequences of sea level change due
to its interaction with geologic systems, ocean chemistry, temperature, etc.,
and climate. It will be possible to integrate the measurements, mechanisms, and
consequences of sea level change, so that a more complete picture will emerge of
sea level in the framework of the planetary geologic systems. Participation of
foreign scientists and U.S. students is critical to the success of the
conference. Funds in the amount of $10,000 from NSF will provide support for
several U.S. students and a few foreign scientists (about 1/3 of the total to be
funded).
