9618654 Tabib-Azar Silicon carbide offers many advantages in high power, and
high temperature device applications. Extended defects in epitaxial GaN are the
main factor limiting its lifetime and its laser application. Experimental
studies of carrier diffusion lengths, surface recombination velocities, and
extended defects in silicon carbide (4H, 6H, and 3C phases) and GaN will be
carried out using electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements as a
function of temperature. In 6H-SiC, micropipes will be extensively studied (in
terms of an effective carrier lifetime and mobility in their vicinity) and they
will be mapped in p and n-type epitaxial materials. Electrical passivation of
these defects by oxidation (and by A1N in the case of GaN) will also be studied.
We expect to resolve micropipes and other defects with 0.5 (m dimensions. Wafers
with appropriate epitaxial layers will be purchased from Cree Corporation and
using in-house fabrication facilities, supplemented with NASA Lewis Research
Center's capabilities, both p-n junction and Schottky diode structures will be
fabricated. PI's characterization facility is well equipped with high- and low-
frequency capacitance meters, device parameter analyzer, deep-level transient
spectrometer, and other relevant equipment. In addition to the above facilities
we will use the EBIC apparatus at NASA Lewis Research Center. ***
