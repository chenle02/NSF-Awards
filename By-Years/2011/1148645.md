William Miller of the University of California, Berkeley is supported by an
award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to
explore new semiclassical initial value representation approaches for treating
electronically non-adiabatic processes, i.e., those involving molecular dynamics
on several potential energy surfaces (electronic states). The Meyer-Miller-
Stock-Thoss representation of the vibronic Hamiltonian provides one well-
established way for doing this, and more efficient ways of carrying out
calculations within this framework are pursued. A more ambitious but less well
established approach, that shows great promise, introduces the classical
description of the electronic degrees of freedom at a more fundamental level,
that of the creation/annihilation operators of the individual fermionic states.
This formulation is being pursued to see if the initial very promising
performance it has demonstrated is maintained more generally.

Electronically non-adiabatic processes underlie a number of applications that
are crucial for many technologies of current importance. These include photo-
voltaic processes relevant to solar-to-electric energy conversion, in both
inorganic nano-materials and in photosynthetic systems, and the field of
"molecular electronics", e.g., the transmission of electrons through various
molecular structures that are junctions between electrodes. Development of
theoretical descriptions that allow one to treat non-adiabatic processes within
the framework of classical molecular dynamics simulation methodology will make
it feasible to carry out such calculations for much more realistic molecular
models and thus interact more fruitfully with experimental work in these areas.
