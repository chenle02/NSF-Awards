9711885 Smith This research makes methodological and substantive contributions
to dynamic game theory and learning theory. It seeks to attain unmet goals of
explaining observed features of bargaining - offers are concessions, timing of
offers is unrestricted, the process itself is a war of attrition - in a perfect
information framework. It achieves a characterization of the "recursive"
sequential equilibrium payoff set, and later a folk theorem for games with
hidden actions and no summary public statistic. It pushes as far as possible the
methodology introduced by Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti of reducing a dynamic
game to a one-shot "auxiliary game." It explores a new conjecture about optimal
experimentation - that information demand is quasiconcave in the posterior
beliefs. The model offers a simple framework for exploring the stochastic
evolution of research expenditures on a given project. It is conceptually
similar to both game theory projects in the attempt to understand intertemporal
dynamics by carefully analyzing the cross-section of possible continuation
"games." Understanding the dynamics of private information is one of the single
most important outstanding problems facing game theory and, to a lesser extent,
contract theory. This research will open up a very large class of models that
economists currently simply cannot solve. It also offers a simple and
substantive new pure theory of dynamic R&amp;D founded on dynamic
experimentation.
