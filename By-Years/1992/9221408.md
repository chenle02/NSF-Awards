9221408 Albright The objectives of this study are to understand and improve the
process of alkylating isobutane with light olefins using sulfuric acid as a
catalyst. The reaction mixture is an emulsion consisting of sulfuric acid and a
liquid hydrocarbon mixture of isobutane, olefins, and alkylate product (a
mixture of isoparaffins with 5-12 carbon atoms). Nature and rates of chemical
and physical transformations in the emulsion or across the interface are
determined. Interfacial area will be measured by a novel method. Kinetic models
incorporating interfacial area are developed. Approaches to increasing the
interfacial area are examined, including increased agitation, higher
acid/hydrocarbon ratios, and the use of surfactants or other additives. Clean
fuel considerations are increasing demand for alkylates as fuel enhancers at the
same time that environmental protection considerations are forcing a phase-out
of the most common catalyst for producing them: hydrogen fluoride. This study is
a new look at an earlier generation of catalyst to see if improvements in the
process can make it competitive. This is an industry-university cooperative
project with Stratco, Inc. of Leawood KS.
