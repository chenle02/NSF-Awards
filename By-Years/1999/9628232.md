9628232 Green This grant provides $93,300 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring a new X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) to be used for rapid, high
precision analysis of the major element chemistry of geological materials in the
University of Alabama's Central Analytical Facility (CAF) in the Bevill
Material, Mineral, and Energy Research Building.. Specific research projects to
be conducted utilizing the XRF will include studies on the petrogenesis of ore
deposits, granitic magmas, basaltic magmas and arc-derived calc- alkaline magmas
as well as studies of thin films by faculty in the materials sciences. A new XRF
will complement the portfolio of analytical geochemical instrumentation already
housed in this laboratory (ICP-MS; ICP-AES, EMP, XRD, AAS etc.) This instrument,
as part of the CAF, will serve not only a diverse group of departmental and
institutional users, but also a number or regional academic, government and
industry researchers. ***
