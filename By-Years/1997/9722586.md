This research program utilizes multiple highly correlated photons to study
features of quantum interference and entanglement. The photons are generated in
precisely timed parametric down converters. The availability of quantum sources
that have a classical timing signal makes possible experiments that exhibit new
effects that can be ascribed to a single excitation of a quantum field. A number
of different projects are targeted, including measuring the wave function of a
single photon and testing conclusions of local hidden variable theories.
