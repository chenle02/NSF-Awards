With the widespread deployment of wireless devices ranging from mobile phones to
unmanned vehicles and the explosive growth of the Internet-of-Things, location
information is becoming key to a variety of safety- and security-critical such
as navigation services, emergency support, asset management, and modern
communication networks. Existing wireless positioning systems provide limited
security guarantees and are vulnerable to signal spoofing, jamming, and re(p)lay
attacks with severe implications: an adversary can enter a restricted area, make
fraudulent payments, deviate vehicles from their intended paths, and halt
operations in transportation hubs. There is an urgent need to design and develop
wide-area positioning and navigation systems that are resilient to modern-day
cyber-physical attacks. The project is designing and developing wide-area
positioning technologies creating an ecosystem that delivers secure, privacy-
preserving, trustworthy location information to thousands of devices and
services simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to understand
the tension that exists in satisfying the key performance metrics of accuracy,
scalability, and wide coverage area while achieving strong security and privacy
guarantees. The project is developing new tractable threats to secure and
private positioning, given the widespread availability of low-cost software-
defined radio platforms. The results of the threat analysis help understand the
fundamental limitations of existing positioning systems and characterize the
effect of strong adversaries. The project primarily targets designing
positioning primitives for next-generation wireless networks (5G and beyond).
The positioning systems being designed in this project makes trustworthy and
secure location information widely available; thus, creating opportunities for
new applications and services. The project intertwines an education plan with
its research aspects and is specifically opening the gateway to Computer Science
education for underrepresented minorities. The results of the project directly
influence next-generation wireless standards and significantly impact their
implementation and deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
