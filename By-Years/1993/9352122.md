An interdisciplinary computational and visualization laboratory/classroom (CVLC
equipped with SGI Indigo workstations will be established in the Department of
Mathematics. The CVLC will be utilized: (1) as a classroom and research
laboratory for a new interdisciplinary Computational Science (CS) seminar, and
(2) for enhancement of upper-division courses in Math, Physics, Biology,
Chemistry, Geology, CS, and Finance. Students and faculty from the above-
mentioned departments will interact with each other in the context of the CS
seminar. The proposed state-of-the-art computers will permit student
computational projects which explore current topics in research areas of
interest to the participating faculty. Proposed topics range from parallel
methods for eigenvalue problems to modeling particle dispersion by Monte Carlo
methods to stock option pricing. Graphical display methods will be stressed
which take advantage of the excellent visualization capabilities of the Indigos.
Multimedia features will promote dissemination through student presentations.
The CVLC facility will allow computational topics to be effectively incorporated
into existing classes. "Real examples" of results from applicable theory allow
students to study complex systems which are typically inaccessible to
undergraduates.
