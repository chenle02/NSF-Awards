The proposed research addresses the problem of designing computer systems and
networks that must simultaneously and dependably satisfy a set of critical
system requirements, e.g., involving protection of human lives and other
valuable resources. It seeks to establish generalized notion of trust and
trustworthiness for the entire set of visible system properties (namely
requirements such as human safety, reliability, and security) and other internal
properties, to pursue design structures that explicitly reflect the generalized
trustworthiness, to formulate specific properties at the various design layers,
and to derive dependencies among these properties--including the behavior of the
constituent computer systems, the environment, and relevant people in the loop.
Thus, the proposed work will attempt to extend recent work in formal modeling
and formal analysis of security and fault tolerance, encompassing intuitive,
semiformal, and formal representations of the relevant properties, as
appropriate.
