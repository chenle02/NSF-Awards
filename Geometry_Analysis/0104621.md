Abstract for DMS - 0104621

The algebraic-geometric theory of soliton equations developed in the middle
seventies has become one of the most powerful tools in the theory of integrable
models, and has had enormous influence on many branches of mathematics and
theoretical physics. The main objective of the present project is a further
development of this approach to integration of non-linear equations, models of
solid state physics, and models of quantum field theories. An immediate goal is
to construct integrable models corresponding to various supersymmetric gauge
Seiber-Witten models, which can be instrumental in investigating key physical
issues such as duality, the renormalization group, or instanton corrections.
Another goal of the project is a classification of commuting difference
operators. Particular attention will be paid to connection of this theory with
the Hitchin system which is central in modern theory of the moduli space of
vector bundles over algebraic curve.

Recent progress in understanding non-perturbative structures in supersymmetric
gauge theories has shed new insight upon the role of integrable structures in
modern theoretical physics. The nineteenth century saw many aspects of geometry
and analysis, particularly the development of Abelian functions, drawn together
in the study of integrable systems. The works of Jacobi, Abel, Riemann and
Weierstrass enabled a number of important integrable problems of mechanics and
physics to be solved. The modern discovery of soliton theory has led to a
renewed interest to the theory of integrable systems. Nonlinear phenomena could
now be treated, and the ever-growing interest in this theory is connected with
the fact that it is applicable to equations which possess a remarkable
universality property. They arise in the description of the most diverse
phenomena in plasma physics, the theory of elementary particles, the theory of
superconductivity and in nonlinear optics. Geometry and algebraic geometry,
functional equations and special functions, Lie algebras and groups all come
together in their study. This ubiquity of integrable systems together with the
beautiful structures that underly them has been confirmed recently by discovery
of unexpected relations between the Whitham perturbation theory of soliton
equations developed in earlier works of the author and the Riemann mapping
theorem. It seems urgent to develop methods which can identify various Whitham
hierarchies with conformal maps for more general types of domains. A range of
possible applications include flows in porous media, fundamental theory of
pattern formation.
