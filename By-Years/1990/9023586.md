This project continues theoretical studies incorporating relativistic effects
in nucleon physics. The two main programs are relativistic nuclear hamiltonian
dynamics (Keister) and the quark structure of hadrons. Specific topics to be
studied include nucleon Compton scattering and a light-cone model for inclusive
nuclear reactions.
