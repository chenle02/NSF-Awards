9506166 Rankin Insects have been widely used as model systems to study basic
mechanisms of hormone production and action. Moreover, study of the regulation
of hormone production in insects by key regulatory proteins holds promise in the
development of biorational pesticides. The general objective of Dr. Rankin's
proposal is to understand the hormonal bases of insect mating, egg development
and subsequent maternal behavior that lead to reproductive success in an insect.
This investigation will utilize the ring-legged earwig, Euborellia annulipes.
This insect has proven to be an excellent, inexpensive model system for
investigating the hormonal regulation of egg development and reproductive
behavior because it exhibits precisely timed cycles of egg development followed
by maternal behavior which are correlated with specific hormone production. The
specific goals are to investigate: 1) regulation of juvenile hormone production
by alterations of levels two insect hormones (juvenile hormone and ecdysone),
diet and mating status and by surgical removal of ovaries; 2) whether proteins
that inhibit reproduction (allatostatins), similar to those in cockroaches,
occur in the earwig by using existing antibody probes for determination of
amounts and sources of such proteins; and 3) whether the cockroach allatostatins
can inhibit cockroach hormone synthesis. Each of these manipulations will be
assessed for their effects on (or correlations with) two fundamental
reproductive behaviors: mating and maternal care. The results are expected to
increase understanding of the physiological regulation of key reproductive
hormones, egg development, and behaviors that contribute to the reproductive
process in an insect. ***
