This award supports a Doctoral Consortium at the 2009 ACM GROUP Conference to be
held May 10-13, 2009. The ACM GROUP conference brings together researchers from
the fields of organizational behavior, information systems, social informatics,
information sciences, and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). As such
the conference is a critical link between the research communities supported by
CISE/IIS and the broader social, behavioral, and management sciences. The focus
of the GROUP Doctoral Consortium is the intellectual content of the students'
doctoral dissertations. These dissertations represent state-of-the-art research
in the study and development of organizational systems, information systems,
social informatics, and computer supported cooperative work. The Doctoral
Consortium creates a social network among the next generation of researchers and
several senior researchers. Students and faculty are anticipated to be a diverse
group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, gender,
institutional affiliation, under-represented minority status), therefore
participation in the consortium will broaden the students' intellectual and
social perspectives at a critical stage in their professional development.
