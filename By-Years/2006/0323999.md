The objectives of this project are (1) to provide scholarships for 30
academically talented but financially needy undergraduates each year, (2) to
provide the support necessary for such students to complete their undergraduate
degrees in their chosen major, and (3) to encourage the selected students to
pursue graduate education in computer science, mathematics, or engineering.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on students who have at least
sophomore standing and who are majoring in computer science, engineering, or
mathematics. To be eligible for the scholarships, students must also have
demonstrated financial need and a minimum grade point average of 2.7.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applicants are recruited via letters to eligible students.
Decisions about scholarship awards are based on academic and leadership
achievements and future potential, the intent to pursue enrichment
opportunities, and the projected impact of the scholarship on the student's
educational plan and future career. The project management team seeks a diverse
set of scholarship recipients.
