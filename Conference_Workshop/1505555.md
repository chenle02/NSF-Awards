The XVIII International Congress of Mathematical Physics (ICMP2015) will be held
in Santiago, Chile, July 27 through August 1, 2015. This award provides support
for fifteen U.S.-based junior researchers in mathematical physics to attend the
ICMP2015 as well as the Young Researchers Symposium to be held in Santiago,
Chile, July 24-25, 2015. The International Congress of Mathematical Physics is
one of the most important conferences on Mathematical Physics throughout the
world. The International Association of Mathematical Physics (IAMP) hosts the
conference, which has been held every three years since 1976. The congress
provides a wonderful opportunity for junior investigators at U.S. institutions
to engage with internationally renowned researchers in mathematical physics.

Mathematical physics is a field with a long tradition in mathematics. Broadly
defined, it focuses on the application of mathematics to problems in physics, as
well as the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications
and for the formulation of physical theories. It has connections to practically
every field of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis,
differential geometry, partial differential equations, and stochastic analysis.
