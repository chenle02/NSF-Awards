The full set of equations governing ocean dynamics are often simplified to a
set called the quasi-geostrophic equations to retain a large element of the
physics, but providing a tractable set of equations which contain principal
elements of the large scale flow. This proposal will consider a two-layer
version of these equations, and will combine both analytical and numerical
experiments using them. Questions about the invariant properties, their
stability, and their relevance to high-gradient frontal like areas will be
addressed.
