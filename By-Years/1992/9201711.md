An ideal species to use for examination of the evolution of cooperation among
unrelated individuals has recently been found - a social insect that occurs in
discrete populations, one of which contains cooperative and the other non-
cooperative, aggressive individuals. The Principal Investigator plans to exploit
the existence of these two social morphs to perform the first experiments
directly testing many of the fundamental precepts of a group-selection
hypothesis of the evolution od cooperation. The behavioral experiments outlined
in this proposal also provide the first empirical investigation of whether
"group level punishment" of cheaters exist. In addition, the P.I. will attempt a
molecular genetic analysis of cooperative and non-cooperative morphs to examine
whether one morph is "invading the other. Given the crucial role social insects
have played in the development of kin selection theory and its eventual transfer
to studies of primate and other social systems, insights generated from this
study testing group selection in the evolution of social insect behavior can be
expected to be transferable to other social systems.
