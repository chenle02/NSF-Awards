Title: U.S.-New Zealand Cooperative Research: Diversity and Evolution of Grass
Mycosymbionts This award supports a long-term visit by Dr. Christopher L.
Schardl of the University of Kentucky to the laboratories of Professor David
Berry Scott at Massey University and Dr. G. C. M. Latch at the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) both located in Palmerston North, New
Zealand. The objectives of the research visit are to elucidate the processes of
endophyte evolution as related to host species and geographical locale, and to
determine whether the sequence-based phylogeny relates to biological
characteristics such as morphology, host range and alkaloid profiles of the
endophytes. The study will make use of the collections of grass-endophyte
association at Palmerston North. The host collaborators have extensive research
experience with endophytes (Latch) and molecular plant-microbe interactions
(Scott). Dr. Schardl will explore coevolutionary relationships among fungi and
grasses using the tools of molecular systematics. The mycosymbionts are stably
maintained for many host generations through seed dissemination. The ecological
and agricultural importance of these mycosymbionts stem from the benefits they
confer to their hosts, including herbivore resistance and drought tolerance.
