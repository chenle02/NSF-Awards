Supporting historical references is an important problem in several areas of
computer science and engineering. The significance of the database versioning
problem (i.e., keeping and accessing old versions) has been particularly
mentioned in recent advances in the database community. In the rapidly growing
area of object oriented programming, historical references enable programmers to
create new objects based on previous object versions. Traditional approaches to
supporting historical references require either large space or long
reconstruction times, making the extensive use of such references prohibitive.
This project provides efficient support of historical references, i.e., fast
reconstruction to any past state without sacrificing a large amount of storage
space. New, optimal ways are investigated to compress temporal data, while still
providing practically random access to any past reference on these data.
Moreover, the problems of distributing the history, keeping the history of a
system that evolves like a graph, keeping histories in limited space and other
general historical queries (not indexed by time but instead using historical
correlation) are analyzed. The results of this project will greatly impact the
use of the recorded past history for different programmers or database users.
Other applications of these results to be considered, include network management
tools, animation storing and archiving the UNIX directory system.
