9414756 Cooper This research will explore the mechanical and thermomechanical
behavior of thick-film oxide - thin film synthetic fluoromica laminates at
elevated temperatures. The research directly addresses questions of
thermodynamic stability of reinforced engineering ceramics, direct evaluation of
fiber-matrix interfacial functionality as functions of temperature and strain
rate and capabilities of fabrication. While the proposed research involves
fundamentals emphasizing mechanical analysis of engineered laminates and solid
state reaction studies, these issues also directly address the performance and
processing of continuous fiber-ceramic composites that employ trioctahedral
fluoromicas as the functional interphase separating fiber and matrix. The
results of this research will be directly applied to improve properties of
present engineering ceramics and to development work on alumina fiber reinforced
glass ceramics. ***
