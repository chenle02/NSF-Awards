The MIT group will build a novel atom interferometer with which to measure the
fine structure constant at the ppb level. This will be used to measure h/m,
which will be combined with the group's recent atomic mass measurements to
determine the molar Planck constant. This can be combined with other recent
measurements to yield a measurement of the fine structure constant. The new
interferometer uses Bose-Einstein condensates in a contrast interferometer - one
in which the contrast of the fringes rather than their position oscillates when
the phase being measured increases. This interferometer, a prototype of which
was recently demonstrated, contains the following three major advances, any one
of which would have substantially improved previous h/m experiments. Since the
atoms are all in the same state, first-order AC Stark shifts are eliminated, the
interferometer is insensitive to vibration, and an accurate phase measurement
can be made in a single "shot" of the interferometer. The interferometer has the
additional feature that the phase increases quadratically with the order of the
beamsplitters. This will be exploited to make measurements to 1ppb in a single
shot. The "next generation interferometer" will feature magnetic shielding and
high optical quality viewports to reduce other systematic errors such as
inhomogeneous magnetic fields and optical wavefront distortions.
