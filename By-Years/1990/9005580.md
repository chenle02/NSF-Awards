Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX) consists of 13 subunits: three encoded in
mitochondrial DNA and 10 in nuclear DNA. Long- term goals are to understand the
regulation of this critically important enzyme complex through analysis of the
genetic regulatory sequences controlling expression of COX nuclear genes. Short
term goals include defining the cis-regulatory sequence elements (cis- elements)
in the promoters of two COX genes: human COX5B (for a ubiquitous subunit VB),
and bovine COX8H (for subunit VIII-heart). They will: (1) identify by DNA
sequencing those cis-elements in the promoter of the COX5B gene known to be
important for transcriptional control of other genes; (2) identify unique cis-
elements important for transcriptional control of respiratory genes by
functional analysis of the COX5B promoter through a) analysis of DNAseI
hypersensitive sites, b) gene fusion experiments, and C) transient expression
studies; (3) clone and sequence the promoter of the bovine COX8H gene to
identify unique cis-elements important for tissue-specific expression. These
studies on the cis- regulatory sequence elements controlling expression of
nuclear genes for this unique enzyme complex will contribute to our
understanding of the genetic regulatory signals involved in mitochondrial
biogenesis and in tissue=specific expression of this important enzyme
complex.*** //
