Large-Scale Knowledge Base and Reasoning Systems are critical elements in
several research programs including those of NSF and DARPA. Such systems will
require intelligent processing over very large amounts of data organized under
various knowledge representation schemes. Current Artificial Intelligence (AI)
technology provides 'intelligent' processing over relatively small amounts of
data stored under small but rich knowledge representation schemes; Database (DB)
technology supports efficient storage and retrieval of large data volumes stored
under large but simpler database schemes; evolving hardware technologies impact
both areas. These technologies must be integrated to meet the requirements of
Large Scale Knowledge Base Systems. Funds are provided to organize and run a
three-day, limited attendance workshop. The goal of the workshop is to identify
key technical requirements, problems, approaches, and solutions to Large Scale
Knowledge Base and Reasoning Systems. The second goal is to increase the
technology transfer between the AI and DB communities needed to solve the
identified open problems.
