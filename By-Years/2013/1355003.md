Social organisms, including humans, organize themselves in social networks that
dramatically affect disease transmission, access to resources and information,
and ultimately biological fitness. Whether properties of social networks are
determined by individual characteristics alone, or are emergent features of
interacting groups is not clear. The answer to this question informs one of the
most contentious issues in biology, does selection act on individuals or on
groups and how does the response drive the evolution of social behavior? The
proposed work uses remote video sensing technology to monitor multiple
populations of forked fungus beetles under natural conditions and combines these
behavioral data with molecular genetic analyses of relatedness and pedigree
reconstruction. Together, these data will be used to determine whether and at
what level genetic variation exists for social network properties. The results
of the proposed work have the potential to redirect the focus of behavioral
ecologists from individuals to interacting groups, or alternatively to show that
what seem to be emergent phenotypes are simply explained through individual
differences. The behavioral data archive will be cross-referenced with genotypes
and pedigrees, representing a significant infrastructure contribution for future
studies of behavior genetics, remote sensing methodologies, and image analysis
development. Fieldwork will be conducted at the Mountain Lake Biological Station
and allows collaboration with the highly successful MLBS-REU program to provide
training opportunities for new scientists from diverse backgrounds. The work
also provides training and mentorship opportunities for technicians, graduate
students, and additional undergraduates from both PIs institutions. Data from
the research phase will be used as the core scaffold for newly developed courses
at a RUI institution, and outreach activities will connect the field station
community and the Science for Kids program in urban Philadelphia each year.
