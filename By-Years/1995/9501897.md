9501897 Yasbin The 39th annual meeting of the Wind River Conference on
Procaryotic Genetics, is being held at the Wind River Ranch, Estes, Park,
Colorado, June 7-11, 1995. This conference is primarily concerned with the
biology of genetic exchange systems and the genetics of a variety of procaryotic
and eukaryotic systems: it is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to
this subject area. One significant feature of these meetings is their
accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel
funds frequently are limited. Funds are being provided for travel and support
scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral
students working in various areas that comprise prokaryotic genetics. %%% This
is the major meeting held annually in the United States where the genetics of a
wide variety of bacteria are discussed. ***
