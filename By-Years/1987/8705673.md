The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms by which a protein
folds spontaneously to a unique 3-dimensional conformation. Presumably, all the
information required for folding is contained in the primary amino acid
sequence. Thus, changes at key positions in the sequence could have profound
effects on folding, which can be identified and used to elucidate the nature of
the folding process. Dihydrofolate reductase from E.coli is the model protein
chosen for study. Its gene has been cloned and its 3-dimensional structure is
known. Mutants will be generated by mutagenesis directed at sites believed to be
important in the folding reactions. Equilibrium and kinetic studies will be
carried out on the folding/unfolding transition in wild type and mutant proteins
using ultraviolet, fluorescence, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. The
results will be fit to simple models, and conclusions drawn regarding the
structural features that are critical to folding. From such studies the rules
that govern folding may eventually emerge, so that it will become possible to
make predictions on the function of a protein based on its primary structure.
