Physiological stress is frequently implicated as a cause of forest tree
susceptibility to herbivores, and has been hypothesized as a casual factor in
outbreaks of the gypsy moth. Despite much speculation, there have been few
comprehensive studies seeking to identify a casual relationship. This research
program is designed to do so, using the gypsy moth, two important hostplants,
and a baculovirus. Oak leaf traits influence gypsy moth growth, reproduction,
and resistance to a virus. This project will determine the influence of drought
and nutrient stresses on these leaf traits in controlled experiments, and the
consequences for aspects of gypsy moth performance likely to influence its
population dynamics. This project integrates research by a specialist in oak
physiology with that of chemical ecologist already working on this system. This
3-trophic-level study offers promise of understanding causes of pest irruptions,
insight into the basis of plant-herbivore interactions, and improved pest
control via developing more effective microbial insecticides, population trend
predictions, and stand manipulation.
