This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a
unique method of producing hybrid metal ceramic composite friction
materials.Friction materials are the replacement elements in braking,clutch and
transmission systems.In this effort,Thor Technologies,Inc.will team with Los
Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)and an aircraft braking systems company to
integrate two novel technologies into an innovative method of producing hybrid
ceramic composite brakes.Preliminary studies with the Polymer
Infiltration/Microwave Pyrolysis (PIMP)processing method indicate that it is
capable of producing fiber-reinforced ceramic brakes with integral metal
features.Such ceramic brakes will offer substantial competitive advantages over
traditional friction materials,and should integrate seamlessly with existing
systems.Thor Technologies will use the LANL Gyrotron Facility to produce hybrid
ceramic composite frcition materials through the PIMP process.These will be
evaluated through dynamometer tests conducted at the braking systems
company.These tests will validate hybrid ceramic composites for friction
applications,and will justify full-scale development of the PIMP manufacturing
process.Thor Technologies,Inc.and the Principal Investigator are uniquely well
positioned to meet the technical challenges of producing ceramic friction
products and transitioning them to the market.
