The proposed projects examine the geometry and dynamical properties of the outer
automorphism group of a free group, Out(F), and its ompanion, the Culler-
Vogtmann Outer space CV. The first project furthers Behrstock, Bestvina and
Clay's investigation of the asymptotics of intersection numbers for free groups
and its implications to the dynamics of Out(F) on certain simplicial complexes
analogous to the curve complex. The second project further develops Clay and
Pettet's new construction of fully irreducible automorphisms. This has
applications for the third project where Clay and Pettet will begin to explore
the thin part of the Outer space with the asymmetric metric. The fourth project
aims to show that nonvirtually abelian subgroups of Out(F) satisfy "uniform-
uniform'' exponential growth. The final project proposes to involve
undergraduates in examining the structure of subcomplexes of the curve complex
for a surface. Together with undergraduates, Clay will create a computer program
for studying free groups that assembles several classical and established
algorithms.

A graph is a collection of points connected by edges. Graphs with the same
number of "holes" can be considered themselves as points in a space, called
Outer space. The shape of this space is well-known, but its geometry is not. One
surprising geometric feature that is known is that the space is asymmetric,
meaning traveling between two points may take longer in one direction than the
other. This notion is very natural to anyone who has hiked up a mountain. This
project involves an analysis of the asymmetries of Outer space.
