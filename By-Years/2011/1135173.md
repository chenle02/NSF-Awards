The purpose of the iPuzzle project is to develop a model for supporting student
engagement in learning mathematics using innovative technologies. Researchers
will develop this model by creating and examining an interactive puzzle
environment that could be used locally in a single networked classroom or
created for the web so that it could be used at multiple schools using different
computing devices and platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mixed-methods will be
employed in this research and development project to examine the impact of the
proposed learning environment on student engagement and learning. The puzzles
will be tested with students in formal and informal settings and revision will
be undertaken according to the testing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term
vision of developing puzzle-based comprehensive curriculum is innovative and
potentially transformative. This project will contribute to this long-term
vision. This project has the potential to change the culture of the learning
environment - instead of expecting that learning is done only because one must,
their long-term vision is to build a culture in which learning is something one
(mostly) enjoys doing and expects others to enjoy as well. With a clear vision,
a coherent set of proposed activities, and a great team, this project has the
potential to truly Transforming STEM Learning.
