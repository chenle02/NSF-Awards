This project involves further development of methods for analyzing nanomole-
sized quantities of silicate N by carrier-gas methods, through combination of a
high-vacuum extraction line fabricated at Lehigh University and a commercially
available continuous-flow, gas chromatography interface. The small-sample
capability of the new methods will allow analyses of microgram-sized samples of
mineral separates (e.g., micas, ammonium-rich K-feldspars), thus affording
higher spatial resolution in some studies and opening up many new avenues of
investigation previously impeded by the absence of sufficiently N-rich
materials. The research will partly involve incorporation of laser heating in
the extractions, production of silicate N-isotope standards for wider
distribution to the community, and an attempt to experimentally determine mica-
fluid N-isotope fractionations over a temperature range appropriate for study of
crustal processes. A common theme in the applications of the new methods over
the next five to ten years is the further advancement of N isotope investigation
aimed at tracing organic signatures into the crust and mantle.
