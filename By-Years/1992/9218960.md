9218960 Elmore The research is to test mechanisms of remagnetization, with the
particular focus on the role of orogenic-basinal fluids. Chemical
remagnetizations are common in sedimentary rocks and diagenetic processes
triggered by orogenic fluids. Comparison of paleomagnetic and rock magnetic
results with geochemical characteristics, deformation patterns, and burial
histories will allow for tests of chemical (both basinal fluids and in situ
processes), strain-related, and thermoviscous mechanisms. ***
