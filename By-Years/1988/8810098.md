This research program is designed to localize two specific proteins within
internal membrane systems of both the cell body and the nerve axon. Localization
of these proteins will elucidate the involvement of the nerve cells' internal
membrane systems in the packaging of proteins destined for different target
areas of the surface membrane or extracellular space. The two target proteins to
be studied are : 1) the Na+ - K+ ATPase; and 2) acetylcholinesterase (AChE).
These proteins will be localized with the aid of specific antibody probes
visualized by light and electron microscopy. These two proteins are important in
regulating the electrical and chemical activities associated with communication
between nerve cells. The membrane systems under study are both those of the cell
body and of the axon. In the cell body, the membrane systems to be studied are
involved in the biosynthesis and packaging of membrane proteins or secretion
products. In the axon, there are at least three distinct membrane systems whose
functions or relationship are not known at this time. Investigations into the
biosynthesis and transport of these proteins are permitted by the recent
production and characterization of specific antibodies to each that may be used
as probes to label each using a combination of light and electron microscopic
techniques. Ultimately, the activities of this research program will provide a
map of the subcellular pathways along which differing molecular forms of two
macromolecules, crucially involved in nerve impulse and synaptic transmission,
are transported to their respective destinations and finally combined and
inserted into their functional positions. This investigation, using specific
probes for the distribution of each protein, will define the functional
relationship between morphologically differing membrane systems of the axon. As
a result of these studies we will gain a greater understanding of the cellular
mechanisms which regulate the life cycle of these important macromolecules.***
