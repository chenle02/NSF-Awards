9732160&lt;br/&gt;Chutjian&lt;br/&gt;Using two new, unique experimental
techniques developed at JPL/Caltech, low-energy and ultra-low energy electron
attachment will be studied in several atomic and molecular systems. The aim of
this project is to explore the threshold behavior of dissociative attachment and
to examine resonance structure very close to vibrational thresholds. &lt;br/&gt;
