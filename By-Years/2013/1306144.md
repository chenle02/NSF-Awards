PRFB Fellowship: Molecular evolution of the somatosensory system in mammalian
hibernators

Organisms display a wide spectrum of tolerance toward cold. Hibernators can
survive harsh winter conditions by entering a reversible state called torpor,
during which they display hypothermia (0-5Â°C), hypometabolism and unusual
resistance to cold. Several orders of mammals have examples of hibernators,
including the Rodentia order (ground squirrels, hamsters, marmots). It is
unknown what are the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptive
behavior in mammals and whether they are evolutionarily conserved. The goal of
this project is to determine if hibernators from the same Rodentia order (ground
squirrels and Syrian hamsters) use the same molecular platform, or whether they
evolved unique temperature adaptation mechanisms independently. An integrative
approach that includes: histological, morphological, functional and
transcriptomics analyses will be used to identify and characterize molecules
that support cold tolerance and tuning of thermosensation. The multiple
approaches described in this proposal will identify novel molecules and will
shed light on a largely unexplored physiological process. In addition to
contributing to scientific knowledge about the evolution of the molecular
mechanism that governs hibernation, this proposal will provide training
opportunities to undergraduate students and post-graduate trainees. Trainees
will perform a range of duties including animal care and sample preparations,
which will provide them with a full research experience. Progress reports, oral
presentations and journal clubs will complement their training. It will promote
their participation in summer internships and in career fairs. High school
students in the community will benefit from presentations about hibernation,
neuroscience and pursuing a career in science.
