9416871 McCann Fundamental processing research related to the chemistry and
physics aspects of fabrication of novel IV-VI semiconductor laser structures
composed of Pb(1-x)EuxSe(l-y)Tey and Pb(1-x)SnxSe(l-y)Tey layers lattice matched
with BaF2 diode lasers will be carried out. Procedures will be studied which
involve removing an epitaxially-grown narrow bandgap IV-VI semiconductor laser
structure from the substrate and then sandwiching the laser structure between
two thermally conductive heat sinks. IV-VI semiconductor laser structures will
be grown using both molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and liquid phase epitaxy (LPE).
%%% The primary goal of this program is to develop a fundamental understanding
of advanced processing of IV-VI semiconductor laser materials. An important
feature of the program is the training of students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area of materials research. This research will
contribute to improving the general performance of advanced photonic devices
used in monitoring atmospheric constituents. ***
