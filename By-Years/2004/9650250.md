The project involves acquisition of a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-
MS) to provide all students hands-on experience with a central instrument used
in industrial and graduate school research laboratories. It also involves
development of instruction and courseware to engage students in problem solving
and methods development. The project is allowing students to investigate
familiar materials, such as perfumes, and be exposed to some of the strategies
of analysis and mass spectral interpretation. Upper-level students are also
solving problems and developing new methods of analysis. For example, in the
Instrumental Analysis course, students are handling real-world samples in
complex matrices as they develop methods for analysis of mycotoxins in rice and
corn. In biology courses, students are characterizing small protein molecules
that have been implicated in mechanisms of resistance of plants to pathogens.
The project is preparing undergraduates to enter the modern-day instrumental
laboratory competently and confidently and heightening student enthusiasm and
interest in chemistry.
