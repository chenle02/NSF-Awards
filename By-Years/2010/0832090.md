Historical static spectrum allocation has led to an artificial spectrum
scarcity, leaving no usable spectrum for future wireless networks. Dynamic
spectrum access is the ideal solution to break such scarcity and make spectrum
available to new wireless networks. However, without providing proper
reliability guarantees, dynamic spectrum access is unacceptable to many networks
and services. Thus, instead of focusing solely on improving spectrum
utilization, dynamic spectrum access should provide reliable spectrum usage that
meets network's individual needs. This research develops SAFIRE, a robust
architecture for dynamic spectrum access that provides reliable and efficient
spectrum usage to large wireless networks. This research holds great practical
values for wireless network designers and service providers who rely on
available and reliable spectrum access to deploy and advance their networks.

Recognizing the fundamental tradeoffs between spectrum utilization and
reliability, this research focuses on efficient algorithms to meet individual
networks? reliability requirements while improving spectrum utilization. The
investigators will develop statistical mechanisms to proactively regulate
spectrum demands based on their reliability requirements, and apply distributed
coordination and cross-layer design to quickly adapt spectrum allocations and
application patterns to network and spectrum dynamics. To support large-scale
dynamic networks, this research focuses on computational-efficient mechanisms
with minimum management overhead. These advancements will help attract large
commercial interests into dynamic spectrum systems, facilitating their wide
adoption. Finally, the investigators will use this research as a basis to
develop interdisciplinary computer science training across both software and
hardware layers.
