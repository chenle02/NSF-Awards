This project will conduct an aeromagnetic investigation along the Central
Indian Ridge to clarify the kinematics and tectonic implications of the zone of
distributed deformation in the equatorial Indian Ocean lithosphere. The new data
set will comprise about 100 magnetic profiles spaced 15 to 25 km apart covering
an area of about 900,000 km2. This new data will permit the determination of the
intersection of the India- Australia boundary with the Central Indian Ridge and
will show whether the boundary is spatially sharp of diffuse. The data will also
improve estimates of the motion between India and Australia and will revel the
evolution over the last 20 million years of the zone of deforming lithosphere
between India and Australia.
