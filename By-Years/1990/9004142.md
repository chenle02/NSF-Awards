The coast of South Carolina received a direct hit from hurricane Hugo in late
September of 1989. In addition to major economic loss, the native plants were
severely damaged from wind, salinity and flooding. The next year or two
represent a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a hurricane on coastal
plants to determine if or how quickly they recover and to asses their role in
stabilizing the coast. Dr. Young will investigate changes in an ecologically
important coastal shrub, wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), based on photosynthetic
responses to the storm and the post-hurricane environment. The research is
designed to take advantage of existing data and to support other proposed
studies of hurricane damage. At two month intervals over the next year,
photosynthesis of wax myrtle leaves and bark will be measured at three sites
differing in the extent of hurricane damage at north Inlet of South Carolina. In
addition, a greenhouse experiment with potted plants will separate the effects
of salt damage and water-logged soils on wax myrtle photosynthesis using
environmental conditions measured after the storm. These experiments will
determine how quickly wax myrtle recovers after a hurricane and will provide
insight into the value of wax myrtle for reducing coastal erosion from storms.
