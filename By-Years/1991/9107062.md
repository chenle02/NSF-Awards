In drawing statistical inferences when there are several variables present,
often only some of these are of direct interest. However these are not always
independent of the remainder. Therefore, inferences are usually drawn
conditional upon the estimated values for the parameters which govern this
remainder. Depending upon the nature of the dependencies and the particular
estimates used, the primary statistical inferences may or may not be very
stable. This research considers methods for constructing approximate ancillary
statistics or close-to-ideal estimates for conditional inference in the presence
of a multidimensional nuisance parameter.
