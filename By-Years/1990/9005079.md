The dynein ATPases are complex, multisubunit enzymes that generate the forces
for a variety of microtubule-based movements. The function of the different
dynein subunits in the generation of motility is largely unknown, but the study
of mutants with defective flagellar motility in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has
identified several genes that alter the structure and function of the outer
dynein arm. One of these genes, the sup-pf-1 locus, is the structural gene for
the B subunit of the outer arm complex. The mechanisms by which the B chain
contributes to dynein activity and flagellar motility will be studied by the
analysis of wild-type and mutant alleles of the sup-pf-1 locus. The specific
aims are: 1) To characterize the microtubule binding and translocation
properties of wild-type and mutant B subunits by in vitro assays. 2) To
determine the physical locations of the microtubule binding site (s) and the
sup-pf-1 regulatory regions by photolytic and proteolytic cleavage techniques.
3) To identify the position of specific functional domains within the DNA
sequence of the B chain gene, and to characterize the DNA sequences in both
mutant and wild-type alleles. This combined genetic, biochemical, and molecular
approach will provide new insights into the basic mechanisms of dynein-based
motility.
