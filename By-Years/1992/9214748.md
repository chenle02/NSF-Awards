This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, involves studies of structure-reactivity relationships in
heterogeneous electron transfer reactions of transition metal complexes with
particular emphasis on complexes that undergo large inner sphere structural
changes concommitant with the electron transfer. The primary objective of the
work is to provide quantitative tests of current theories of structural and
environmental effects on hetereogeneous electron transfer rates. This will
involve the measurement of accurate rates of heterogeneous electron transfer
rates and the use of computational methods (molecular mechanics and both
semiempirical and ab initio quantum mechanistic) to model the inner sphere
barrier to the electron transfer. A secondary objective is to develop methods
that provide accurate heterogeneous rate constants. %%% Electron transfer is one
of the most fundamental of chemical processes about which much is known but
where many issues are unresolved. This project, which is a collaborative effort
between an experimental electrochemist and a theoretical physical chemist, is
designed to improve our understanding of how changes in the structures of
certain metal complexes that accompany an electron transfer affect the rate of
the overall process.
