This renewal project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focusses on the synthesis and characterization of metal containing
polymers that exhibit novel electron transfer and electrocatalytic properties.
Professor Elliott and his students at Colorado State University will pursue work
in four areas. The development of electrochemical methods to directly measure
the flux of ions in conducting polymers, the use of impedance measurements to
evaluate a polypyrrole system as a sensor for chlorocarbons, preparation of
fixed redox gradients in polymers and of low-work-function conduction properties
in polymer films for practical applications as light emitting diodes, and the
preparation of metal complexes in polymers that will exhibit enhanced catalytic
activity compared with conventional coordination complexes will be pursued. The
synthesis of electroactive polymers that have properties permitting their use in
diverse practical areas such as chemical sensors, light emitting diodes, and
superior metal centered catalysis will be pursued. Professor Elliott and his
students at Colorado State University will employ a wide range of techniques in
both the synthetic aspects of this work and in the characterization of the newly
prepared polymers. There are exciting prospects for these new materials having
real value in numerous areas of analysis and synthesis. New electrochemical
methods will be developed and a variety of established electrochemical methods
will be used in this work.
