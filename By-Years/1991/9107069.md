A number of Chlorophyte algae have lost the ability to photosynthesize, and live
as obligate heterotrophs identified by their lack of chlorophyll. Among these
are the species called Polytoma which are very similar to the genus
Chlamydomonas except for the lack of chlorophyll. Nonphotosynthetic mutants of
facultative heterotrophic Chlamydomonadaceae are easily obtained, and Polytoma
species presumably descended from one or more such mutants. Polytoma retains a
plastid with DNA and functional ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. We have undertaken a
long-range study to determine the molecular phylogenetic relationships of
Polytoma species to green algae, determine how frequently obligate heterotroph
species arise, and estimate how long heterotrophic clades survive and how often
they produce new clades. Our nuclear and a plastid rRNA gene sequences from P.
uvella show that this species lies within one branch of Chlamydomonas, closely
related to C. humicola. Now we propose to sequence the small nuclear and large
plastid rRNA genes from the strains of Polytoma now in culture, determine the
phylogenetic relationships of these stocks to the species of Chlamydomonadaceae
for which rRNA genes are being sequenced in other laboratories, and begin
collecting new stocks of Polytoma from nature for future studies.
