The project is taking a four pronged approach to helping Indiana University of
Pennsylvania achieve Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education at
the undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Faculty Development through
faculty workshops conducted by Center of Academic Excellence in Information
Assurance Education James Madison University in which faculty develop and
deliver computer security modules that can be readily included in core courses
in Computer Science, Management Information Systems, Criminology, Educational
Technology and IT as well as forming part of an Interdisciplinary Security
minor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Curriculum Development to increase the security
content in computing and criminology courses via addition of security modules in
core courses, as well as through an interdisciplinary minor in Information
Assurance and an upper level security track for computer science students who
wish to specialize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Strengthening Research and
Internship opportunities in Information Assurance through creation of the Center
for Applied Security involving a strategic partnership with the Science
Applications International Corporation (SAIC), which has as its goal to develop
and deliver information protection/assurance (IPA)&lt;br/&gt;services in our
region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Providing the Technology for research in
Information Assurance through a state of the art lab used for hands on labs, and
for experimentation with new threats and vulnerabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
