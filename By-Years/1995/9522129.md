9522129 Gangopadhyay The proposal by Prof. Gangopadhyay involves novel
approaches for the deposition, characterization and device studies in Carbon
Nitride. The experimental work focuses on the development of two deposition
systems, namely, a remote plasma enhanced chemical vapor system (RPECVD) and a
capacitive discharge chamber (CDC) for the growth of 'superhard' carbon nitride.
The carbon films grown by these methods is expected to be amorphous or
crystalline depending upon the parameters, substrate temperature and bias
voltages employed in the process. An application of these films is in the area
of antifuzes for field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's). Previous studies of
this material were unsuccessful due to the stability of the plasma; however, the
acquisition of a remote plasma system should enable the PI to achieve control
over the C-H and N-H products in the chamber. ***
