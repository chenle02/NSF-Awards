This proposal requests funds to examine a series of disjoint biradicals by
chemical and spectroscopic methods. Molecular orbital calculations have
predicted that disjoint biradicals will possess a singlet ground state. Previous
work from this laboratory has resulted in finding a triplet ground state
disjoint biradical. This contradiction of theory will be pursued further with
new examples which have rigidly defined structures for comparison to theoretical
calculations. Non-alternant biradicals will be explored, which contain in some
fashion, cyclopentadiene rings. The interplay between structure and multiplicity
of these biradicals will be explored, where lower membered systems are expected
to be singlets and higher membered systems triplets. This grant from the Organic
Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Professor Paul Dowd at the
University of Pittsburgh. The chemical and spectroscopic properties of a novel
series of reactive intermediates known as biradicals will be examined.
Biradicals are molecules where there are an odd number of electron at two sites.
For example, in a hydrocarbon biradical, two carbon atoms will each be bonded to
three other carbon atoms and have one unbonded electron. The two odd electrons
may have spins paired (a singlet) or unpaired (a triplet). The lowest energy
states (singlet or triplet) of the biradicals will be determined experimentally
as a function of structure. These results will be compared to theoretical
calculations.
