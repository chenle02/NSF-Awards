The conference "Homological Methods and Tilting Theory of Finite Dimensional
Algebras" will be held at The University of Iowa on August 16-19, 2019. The
meeting will be a main event for researchers in the field of representation
theory of finite dimensional algebras, with special focus on homological
methods. Homological and categorical methods, including tilting theory, have had
a great impact on representation theory of finite dimensional algebras and many
of the main conjectures of the field have a homological flavor. The conference
will include both talks by experts on recent progress and new approaches to open
questions, and talks by early-career researchers about their research.

The meeting will bring together experts in representation theory and related
fields, as well as early-career mathematicians, especially postdocs and graduate
students. One goal of the meeting is to introduce participants to the latest
directions in tilting theory and categorical methods, as well as new ideas and
progress on homological conjectures, via expository talks by senior
mathematicians that will be accessible to graduate students. The conference will
provide a dynamic atmosphere encouraging interactions between leaders in the
field and early-career mathematicians and PhD students, and the schedule will
provide ample time for discussions and forging new collaborations. Details of
the conference are available at the website
