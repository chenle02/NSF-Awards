The Electrodeposition Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is relatively new,
started in&lt;br/&gt;1996. It grew out of the Read Conference, one of the
primary scientific forums for the&lt;br/&gt;electrodeposition community since
the early 50's. The understanding of electrodeposition at the atomic scale has
increased dramatically in recent years as new analytical methods, like scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM), have been developed. This has resulted in improved
control over processes, and the ability to use electrodeposition in areas where
control over the nanometer scale is required. &lt;br/&gt;Electrodeposition is
becoming accepted as a standard thin film synthesis methodology in&lt;br/&gt;new
areas. A clear example is the adoption of electrodeposition by the
electronics&lt;br/&gt;industries to form copper interconnects in VLSI.
Production VLSI circuits use 135 nm wide copper wires, with research and
development teams currently working on 90 nm and smaller copper interconnects.
In addition, electrodeposition has a central role in nearly all micro-
technologies. New areas where it is playing an increasing roll
include&lt;br/&gt;nanofabrication and the formation of compound semiconductor
thin films. The 2002&lt;br/&gt;conference has a special highlight on the role of
electrodeposition in nano- and&lt;br/&gt;micro-fabrication. This proposal will
allow the organizers to continue developing the Electrodeposition GRC into the
premier electrochemical materials conference.&lt;br/&gt;
