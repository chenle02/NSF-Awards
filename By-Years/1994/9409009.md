9409009 Eichenbaum This project describes a research agenda in applied business
cycle analysis. The topics to be analyzed fall into five broad categories. The
first category concerns work aimed at empirically characterizing the effects of
monetary policy shocks on aggregate economic activity and the borrowing and
lending activities of different sectors in the US economy. The second category
involves building structural models of the monetary transmission mechanism which
have the potential to account for the features of the data documented in the
first stage of the project. The third category of research topics concerns the
role of time varying capital utilization rates and other forms of factor hording
as propagation mechanisms in the business cycle. The fourth category of research
concerns the development of econometric methods for estimating and assessing the
empirical plausibility of structural business cycle models. The focus here will
be on analyzing the small sample properties of Generalized Method of Moments
procedures. Finally, the fifth category of research investigates the operating
characteristics and welfare properties of different monetary policy rules using
the class of structural monetary models developed in previous phases of the
research program. Particular attention will be paid to rules which smooth
nominal interest rates.
