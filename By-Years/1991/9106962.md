This award supports a delegation of chemists from U.S. universities to Hungary
to get acquainted with the research activities in chemistry in Hungarian
universities. The purpose of the visit is to pinpoint areas and topics for
enhanced interaction between U.S. chemists and their Hungarian colleagues for
the mutual benefit of chemistry in both countries. This is a research planning
grant which involves a report to the Foundation shortly after completion of the
trip. The report will be widely circulated to other government agencies as a
means to expedite interactions between the U.S. and Hungary chemists.
