Norman 9626804 The investigator and his colleagues pursue interdisciplinary
research and training in an environment supporting modern scientific computation
and advanced computer graphics. The areas of investigation involve partial
differential equations, integrable systems, and variational problems in geometry
and topology. Particular topics include: spin structures on surfaces with
applications to the geometry of immersions, particularly to rigidity and period
problems; surfaces that minimize bending energy subject to natural constraints;
the moduli spaces of constant mean curvature embeddings and immersions, using
mechanics, symplectic geometry and integrable systems; construction of embedded
minimal surfaces by desingularizing immersed minimal surfaces; elastic curves
and their higher order soliton analogues; electrostatic energies associated with
knots and links, and the behavior of their gradient flows; curve and surface
interfaces between distinct thermodynamic phases in disequilibrium; and
statistical equilibrium solutions to the Euler equations for incompressible
fluid flow. The Center for Geometry, Analysis, Numerics & Graphics (GANG)
pursues interdisciplinary research and training in an environment supporting
modern scientific computation and advanced computer graphics. The mathematical
work at GANG is motivated by - and can shed light upon - many interesting
natural systems that arise in both "applied" and "basic" research. For example,
the folding and entanglement of long molecules, like proteins, DNA or synthetic
polymers, can be dynamically modeled using elastic and electrostatic curve
energies that were originally developed at GANG to study the geometry and
topology of knots and links; such models may be useful in predicting the
strength of polymer materials or the biochemical effect of pharmaceuticals. And
a quite unexpected and fundamental new phenomenon - the "conformal diffusion" of
tiny phospholipid vesicles, reported by French physicists in the Augu st 1995
issue of Science - was stimulated by work at GANG on the bending energy of
surfaces. The computation and visualization facilities at the GANG laboratory
serve an important and interrelated triple duty by permitting the pioneering
mathematical experiments to be carried out in the first place, providing a
fertile environment for the education and training of students, and aiding
communication with the general public (to paraphrase the late physicist, Eugene
Wigner) on the remarkable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural world.
