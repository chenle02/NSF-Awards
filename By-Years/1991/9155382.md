This two year project, sponsored by the University of Lowell, will provide
science teachers, grades 4-12, the expertise to carryout alternative testing
techniques to assess student learning in the sciences. The new assessment
methods will enable teachers to discover what students know and thus to reshape
student learning toward better comprehension of science concepts, more
appreciation of the field of science and enhanced skills in scientific inquiry.
In the first year of the project 15 teachers will attend a series of workshops
devoted to the concepts and practice of appropriate assessment techniques. In
the second year of the project the teachers will implement these techniques in
the classroom. They will also work with selected peer teachers in workshops
managed by project staff to disseminate the techniques to a wider group of
teachers. At the conclusion of the project there will be 45 teachers using high
quality alternative assessments in their own classrooms and assisting peers to
do the same. The NSF funds are being matched by the University and participating
schools by an amount equivalent to 80% of the NSF grant.
