This research project is focused on the study of recombinant cell kinetics and
protein production in both free and immobilized cell bioreactor systems.
Building on previous work on lac gene expression, a Bacillus subtilis strain has
been chosen with a plasmid for constitutive expression of a- amylase. The
plasmid, pBD214, contains both the structural gene and the promoter and signal
sequences for enzyme secretion. Experimental design and data gathering
procedures are integrated with mathematical modeling aspects to uncover a
unified picture of gene expression in recombinant cells in prototypical
bioreactors. Development of products from the new biotechnology will require
efficient bioreactors and an understanding of the kinetics in these reactors.
The kinetics of cell growth, plasmid replication and shedding and gene
expression are complex and highly coupled processes. Given the state-of- the-
art, it is necessary to examine recombinant cell kinetics in different
bioreactor systems to decide optimization of cell growth and product formation
in a given process. Accurate, unified models would guide and accelerate process
development in numerous cases but such models are currently lacking in the
field. This work addresses such limitations.
