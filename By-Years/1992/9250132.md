This project establishes an undergraduate digital signal processing (DSP)
laboratory supporting two new courses, a junior filter design course and a
senior DSP course, and a year-long senior electrical design sequence. The
laboratory consists of eight 486 PC workstations equipped with high resolution
video boards. Hardware and software for color image capture and display as well
as audio segment capture and replay are being installed in the lab. A digital
filter design package and a Motorola 56000 development system are also used in
the lab.This project represents an example which other small engineering schools
could follow in developing a cost conscious DSP program. The feasibility of
using a 486 (or 386) PC for such a laboratory has been established by prior
work.
