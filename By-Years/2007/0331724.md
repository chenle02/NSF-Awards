Abstract:

This award provides funding for approximately 30 new researchers (advanced
graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients) to participate in the Twenty-
Third Southeast-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations. This
conference, which has been held yearly since 1981 at various institutions
throughout the Southeast-Atlantic region, is being held this year at Kennesaw
State University on October 17-18, 2003. The conference will feature four
internationally recognized plenary speakers as well as several sessions of
contributed talks to be delivered by both new and established researchers in
differential equations. Specific topics to be addressed at the conference
include ordinary and partial differential equations, integral and functional
equations, dynamical systems, control and inverse problems, numerical methods,
and applications of differential equations in science and engineering. This
conference will provide the opportunity for the personal interaction among
researchers that is necessary both for the ongoing maintenance of established
research collaborations in differential equations and for the expansion of these
collaborations to include new researchers.
