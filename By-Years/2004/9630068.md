Proposal Number: ECS-9630068 Principal Investigator: Joseph Haus Title: Pulse
Propagation in Periodic Dielectric Materials Analysis: In this research,
electromagnetic wave propagation in photonic band gap (PBG) structures,
containing new materials with both strong nonlinear absorption and nonlinear
refraction, will be theoretically and experimentally investigated. In a photonic
band gap structure, a periodic array introduces optically forbidden bands in
analogy with electronic band gaps in solid state crystals. With the introduction
of materials with a strong nonlinear refraction into a PBG system, it is
expected that additional PBG effects will be introduced, which can also be
controlled. Introduction of materials with a strong nonlinear reverse saturable
absorption, into channels should result in a structure in which the optical
response is limited in intensity by the material and by the diffraction and
scattering properties of the photonic crystal. There are many applications for
such structures in any situation in which intense light is a problem. The PBG
structures in this investigation will be broad band to provide wavelength agile
protection and will be capable of operating with a wide field of view. A strong
direct experimental collaboration with researchers at the Naval Research
Laboratory (NRL) has been established. The NRL component of the research will be
funded by the Army Research Office (ARO), through NSF, via subcontract with
Renssalear Polytechnic Institute. A copy of the ARO Augmentation Award Statement
of Work defining the NRL research contribution, and the ARO reviews, are
attached. The theoretical investigation at RPI is directly coupled to the
experimental realization at NRL.
