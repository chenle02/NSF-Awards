In modeling the natural world, scientists often must rely on approximations that
result in incomplete information about a system under study. Such is the case in
elementary particle physics, statistical mechanics, and gravitation. A
fundamental question is then how to extract from limited data as much
information as possible, with the possible highest level of accuracy and
confidence. This project will draw on several areas of mathematics to analyze
this issue in mathematics and physics. Additionally, the investigator aims to
further develop the mathematics of laser-matter interaction. The project offers
training research opportunities for graduate students. A central topic addressed
in the project is the interaction of matter and radiation. For the time-
dependent laser-induced photoelectric effect, the investigator will apply a
constructive mathematical technique to the photoionization models and the two-
frequency models used in experiments, to fine-tune the photoelectric output and,
in interdisciplinary work with experimentalists, to predict and optimize the
processes. A second aim of the project is to determine the behavior of physical
and mathematical models outside the range of perturbation theory, with the
highest possible level of accuracy and confidence, when only a limited number of
terms of a perturbation expansion can be calculated. The investigator aims to
develop methods that exceed the precision previously achieved and that are
optimal under specific mathematical conditions. The methods will be applied also
to mathematical problems in which exact solutions are available, but their
numerical utilization is computationally demanding.
