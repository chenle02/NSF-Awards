The Laser Electro-Optics Technology Department at Springfield Technical
Community College (STCC) is enhancing its curriculum by acquiring an Optical
Test &amp; Measurement Lab with assistance from the National Science Foundation.
The major instrument is the Zygo Mark IVxp Phase Measuring Interferometer.
Interferometers have long been used for both macro and micro surface
characterization in the fabrication and assembly of precision optical components
and systems. The Zygo Mark IVxp Interferometer System represents the state-of-
the-art in optical surface evaluation and is being used increasingly in a
variety of measurement purposes in manufacturing and quality assurance. Access
to such equipment by students is enriching the already diverse laser electro-
optics offerings at STCC, one of but a handful of colleges in the country with a
laser major.With the opportunity to engage in hands-on applications employing
"real world" hardware in a laboratory setting, STCC students are being
significantly better prepared to continue their studies at the university level
and/or to pursue their technical careers in the private or government sectors.
