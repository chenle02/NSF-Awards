This Research Opportunies for Women Career Advancement Award is in the area of
analytical and surface chemistry. Dr. Janet G. Osteryoung of the Chemistry
Department of the State University of New York at Buffalo will use pulse
voltammetry to investigate corrosion of copper in hydrochloric acid solution.
Study of this basic system will allow testing of the technique and comparison of
findings to those of other methods, and lay the foundation for extended study of
ferrous steels. The award will also permit Dr. Osteryoung to visit a number of
laboratories which have significant programs in corrosion studies, thus becoming
more familiar with the field and obtaining critiques of her plans. This award
will open a new area of investigation to Dr. Osteryoung, whose previous work has
been in solving analytical chemistry problems using electroanalytical chemistry
techniques.
