The research supported by this grant lies at the crossroads of mathematics and
physics. It aims to apply ideas originating in quantum field theory to problems
in representation theory. A main theme is the study of Fourier-type symmetries
not evident from traditional viewpoints. Another theme is the description of
complicated homotopical constructions in intuitive combinatorial terms. The
primary tools developed and applied belong to microlocal geometry, a subject
with a rich history going back to classical mechanics. A broad goal is the
education of students in the new frontiers of this rapidly developing direction.
There will also be ample opportunities for outreach to other fields and for
increased public engagement with mathematics.

Specific projects include an elliptic theory of character sheaves for loop
groups, a categorical Verlinde formula along with marked genus zero
calculations, and a combinatorial model of microlocal sheaves. The methods
involve the traditional microlocal geometry of differential equations and
constructible sheaves, as well as the new homotopical microlocal geometry of
coherent sheaves found within derived algebraic geometry. Applications include
new geometric Langlands correspondences in genus zero and genus one, and
calculations with combinatorial models of microlocal sheaves.
