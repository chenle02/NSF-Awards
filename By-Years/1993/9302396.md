9302396 Aye This is an SBIR Phase II awards that builds on the proof-of- concept
of a real time 3-D display, based on a stationary holographic diffuser screen
using volume-multiplexed holographic optical elements and a simple, conventional
projection system. The diffused holographic screen focuses the stereoscopic 3-D
pattern from two projectors into an observer's eyes without the necessity of
polarizing glasses and focusing lenses. The viewing area resembles an ordinary
TV projection screen creating the impression of a natural 3-D image with this
approach. For example, a robot photographing images with two cameras - placed in
the locations corresponding to each robot "eye" - and having them transmitted
for viewing by human observers, would yield 3-D replicas of the scene form the
human perspective corresponding to the (left, right) eyes of the viewing of
different distinct volumes with resulting impression of stereoscopic depth. ***
