The project is developing a series of short videos for self-paced, pre-class
viewing in large introductory geoscience courses and testing their impact on
student learning and metacognitive judgments, including the assessment of
patterns of use and video characteristics that best promote learning. The
videos, which focus upon geoscience-literacy concepts, are also being tested as
a component of a "flipped-classroom" approach, in which some content delivery is
shifted to video format, and class meetings involve greater participation in
active-learning strategies. Videos and related resources to support use and
assessment are being shared with the broader geoscience community by posting to
the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) website and to YouTube. The
intellectual merit of this project lies in its comprehensive and timely
approach, well-grounded in the literature, to developing and assessing both
video resources and their use in flipped classrooms. Broader impacts include the
wide availability of the videos themselves, as well as the potential for
associated insights from the educational research to shift pedagogical practices
in introductory geoscience courses.
