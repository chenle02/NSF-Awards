9313860 Weiner The research supported here involves the dynamics of an ultra-
cold ensemble of colliding atoms. At low enough temperatures (or relative
kinetic energies), many new effects become dominant. The quantum mechanical
wavelength becomes greater than the range of the chemical forces, and
spontaneous emission lifetimes become short compared to collision times. A
theoretical and experimental program will be continued to study the behavior of
inelastic and bond-forming collision processes in magneto-optical traps and in
atomic beams. *** u wq= u w , u , u v v v v v v v F V F = u : v - ! ! F - - 3
