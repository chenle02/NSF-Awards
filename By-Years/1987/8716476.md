The goal of this research is a quantitative understanding of the function of
proteins in terms of their static and dynamic structure. Initially, the project
was entirely an experimental and descriptive one but now the investigations are
connected to fundamental physicochemical theories. Some specific goals include:
1) a continuation and expansion of the study of the properties and the
classification of protein motions; 2) an expansion from simple proteins to more
complex ones to understand protein function; and 3) a collaboration with
theoretical chemists and physicists. The last is important not only for
understanding protein dynamics and function but also for developing a deeper
understanding of chemicl reactions and the physics of amorphous solids and
gasses. Improved theories of chemical reactions in the condensed phase,
molecular tunneling and protein motions and structure will be developed.
