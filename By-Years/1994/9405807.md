9405807 Person This award provides 43% of the funds required to acquire a
cluster of computer workstations to be installed and used for research and
teaching in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of
Minnesota. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed
for the acquisition. Much of the research and graduate training within the
Department of Geology and Geophysics is focused on quantitative studies of fluid
circulation and fluid-rock interactions within the Earth's crust as well as
theoretical investigations in mantle dynamics. The acquisition of a cluster of
networked computer workstations will permit research and training on topics as
diverse as mantle convection, mantle rheology and melt migration, river
dynamics, sedimentation, subsurface brine migration, sedimentary basin
hydrodynamics, and paleolimnology. ***
