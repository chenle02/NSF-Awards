This project aims to develop a formal and implementable theory of the
communicative interactions that can occur within a man- machine dialog. It will
develop a plan-based model of the interaction - explicity representing the
differing beliefs of the system and the user, as well as their mutually shared
beliefs arising from the dialog, and representing the sentences in the dialog
explicitly as actions - both as speech acts reflecting immediate intentions, and
as discourse acts, signalling the structure of the dialog. The goal is to
develop a domain- independent model of dialog interaction, focusing on those
aspects that allow the system and user to monitor how well the dialog is
understood. In particular, the intent is to account for the prevalent
acknowledgement behavior in dialog, and to provide a general account of
clarifications and correction subdialogs. The work also will examine how the
planning model affects the actual interpretation of the sentences in the dialog,
concentrating on the effects the model has on speech act interpretation, and the
interpretation of tense and aspect, and the generic/specific distinction. As a
result, the plan-based approach to language will be brought into much closer
correspondence to the actual linguistic behavior apparent in natural dialogs.
