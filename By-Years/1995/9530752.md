95-30752 Hunten Dr. Hunten and two Co-Principal Investigators, Drs. Stephen W.
Bougher and Ann L. Sprague, will carry out comparative studies of planetary
atmospheres. This project is a continuation of earlier NSF-supported
investigations. It also runs in parallel and complements, but does not
duplicate, NASA-funded work in planetary aeronomy. The focus of this
investigation will be the tenuous atmospheres of the Moon and Mercury, the
atmospheres of Jupiter, Venus, Mars, and Pluto, and micro-meteoroid entries at
Earth. Four topics will be addressed in particular: (1) The circulation and
energy balance of planetary thermospheres, using a three- dimensional computer
code developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. (2) The
interaction of atoms of the Moon's and Mercury's tenuous atmospheres with those
bodies' surfaces. (3) Completion of the analysis and interpretation of infrared
spectra obtained with the Kuiper Airborne Observatory during the impact of Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter in 1994. (4) Completion of a study of the
preservation of micrometeoroids entering the Earth's atmosphere. ***
