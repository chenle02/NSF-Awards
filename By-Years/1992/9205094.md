Geomorphic processes, climate, soils, and biota work on a large scale to create
the observed physical landscape. At a microscale, weathering contributes as part
of the geomorphic system, and an important objective of weathering research is
the development of models that explain and predict rates of chemical reactions
at the earth's surface. Quartz is among the most common of terrestrial minerals,
and it is regarded as one of the most resistant to chemical weathering. The
processes of quartz weathering is not as well understood as those associated
with other, more weatherable materials. This project seeks to understand how
quartz decrystallization, a micro-weathering phenomenon, is influenced by
climate, biota, geochemistry, and time. It will also determine a chemical
signature for quartz decrystallization that may be useful for paleo-
environmental research. The project will sample quartz from a constant
geomorphic environment and time, but with varying climate and vegetation. Field
analysis combined with laboratory microanalytical techniques will be used to
quantify the physical and chemical characteristics of quartz decrystallization.
These characteristics will be compared with time, temperature, moisture,
geochemical environment, biochemical environment, geomorphology, and scale by
means of statistical tests. This research will define the elements of quartz
decrystallization, and it will contribute to a greater understanding of
weathering processes as a whole. This is important because weathering processes
are closely connected to geomorphic processes, soil development, and
sedimentology. The findings should also amplify the importance of quartz in
geochronology, paleo-environmental research, and archaeology.
