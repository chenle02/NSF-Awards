The goal of this project is to detect calcium induced changes in contact regions
of biological membranes just prior to fusion. This aim, as well as the
methodology employed, is based on physical-chemical studies of calcium binding
between phospholipid lamellae that contain phosphatidylserine. Low-light level
microscopy will be used to detect a fluorescence signal from the calcium induced
rigid phase, simultaneous by with a phase contrast image, in order to identify
the cell biological event that accompanies fluorescence. An increase in
cytoplasmic calcium concentration can affect exocytosis, cell movement, cell
division, metabolism and other processes. This proposal examines one aspect of
exocytosis model and real biological membranes in the binding of calcium between
bilayer membranes and the resulting lipid and protein rearrangements. The
synthesis of fluorescent phospholipids and the development of low-light level
microscope systems make possible a search for the small signal from calcium
induced membrane contact regions in fusing biological membranes.
