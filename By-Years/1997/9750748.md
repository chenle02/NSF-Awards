The objective of this project is to improve the laboratory curriculum in lower-
level biology and chemistry courses by introducing computer-assisted
spectrophotometers into the laboratories. The courses affected by this project
serve mainly non-science-majors, many of whom eventually major in education. The
ease of use and speed of the computer-assisted spectrophotometers allow their
introduction into the larger, lower-level classes, while the number of variables
that can be investigated with this equipment opens up the possibility of doing
more complex laboratory experiments. Exposure of non-science-majors, especially
those entering the teaching workforce, to computer-assisted technology can make
them feel more comfortable with the science and the technology of this field.
This can only improve their attitude toward science and the impression they give
to their future students.
