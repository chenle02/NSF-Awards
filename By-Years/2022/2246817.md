This project lies at the intersection of the mathematical areas of probability,
analysis and differential geometry. It primarily aims to investigate the
geometric influence of the underlying space on the behavior of stochastic
processes, particularly in non-smooth geometric settings, including sub-
Riemannian geometry. It integrates novel and traditional techniques from
probability and analysis. Some problems addressed in this project have relevance
to control systems and data science. This project offers collaboration
opportunities, as well as mentorship and training for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project primarily focuses on three
topics. The first topic involves the exploration of geometrically meaningful
stochastic functionals on Grassmannian manifolds and flag manifolds.
Additionally, this topic aims to establish connections between these functionals
and the degenerate diffusion processes associated with the Berard-Bergery
fibration. The second research direction centers around novel aspects of
rigidity theorems within sub-Riemannian geometry. In particular, the project
aims to investigate a fresh analytical characterization of sub-Riemannian model
spaces using heat kernels. Both compact and non-compact cases will be explored
in this investigation. The third topic includes both probabilistic and analytic
investigation of isoperimetric type problems for domains in metric measure
spaces, considering the interplay between the spectrum of a domain and the exit
time of a diffusion process from that domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
