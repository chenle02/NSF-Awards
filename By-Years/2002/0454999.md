The investigators will conduct a five-year research program to develop a lidar
sensor for the Arctic using state-of-the-art devices and a novel Internet-based
data transport system to enable advancements in arctic atmospheric science. In
particular, the lidar development will involve sensitive photon-counting
detectors including a new infrared photon detector, a unique dual-polarized
laser transmitter, and novel timing schemes to make Rayleigh-Mie-Raman (RMR)
measurements from 5 to 90 km in altitude. Analysis of the RMR lidar measurements
will provide unique vertical profiles of temperature and aerosol backscatter
strength, extinction, shape and size from the arctic troposphere through the
mesosphere with a vertical resolution of tens of meters and a temporal
resolution of tens of minutes. These observations will be applicable to studies
of polar stratospheric clouds, aerosols, and the vertical thermal structure of
the winter arctic stratosphere. Remote operations will allow more event-driven
operations, such as during stratospheric warming events, and, in general, more
observing opportunities. The ultimate objective of the data transport system
will be to make the lidar system accessible from remote locations and pave the
way for the development of fully autonomous lidar systems. This capability would
provide greater opportunity for lidar deployments in remote arctic locations
with limited infrastructure. The observations will contribute to a distributed
network of temperatures and aerosol measurements to support the Network for
Detection of Stratospheric Change. The project will involve a graduate student,
who will be trained in lidar technologies and stratospheric dynamics, and the
data acquired will be rapidly and broadly disseminated for use by other
researchers. Not only will the measurements and scientific results contribute to
community-wide issues, but they will also be useful for calibration and
validation of current and future spacecraft missions designed to observe middle
atmosphere temperatures and aerosols.
