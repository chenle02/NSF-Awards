Today's cognitive radio is characterized by its capability to perceive the
existence of spectrum holes through spectrum sensing, and then transmitting on
these unutilized frequencies. While each individual cognitive radio is very
capable and can make independent decisions, lack of user coordination and
network control raises serious issues in efficiency, security and resource waste
in wireless environments. These problems call for fundamental changes in
cognitive communication network design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research,
we introduce and develop the concept of cognitive network, which is defined as
an intelligent wireless system that can collect and analyze the current network
conditions, and then make real-time corresponding changes in network operating
parameters, such as modulation scheme, transmission power, carrier frequencies,
data frame structure, coding schemes, resource allocation and security
management. We provide a comprehensive framework for the development of
cognitive networks from a network-centric perspective. More specifically, we
plan to: (i) Introduce a novel architecture for cognitive network; (ii) Design
efficient and secure resource management protocols; (iii) Develop highly
efficient and resilient anti-interference/interception systems through multi-
layer diversity; (iv) Develop cryptographic algorithms and protocols for
anonymous routing and network integrity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research on cognitive networks introduces innovative methodologies on
architecture development, system design, secure and efficient network
management. It will significantly improve spectral efficiency, security and
interoperability of communications between versatile wireless devices, and
therefore provides an ideal human-technology platform for e-commerce, national
security, environmental protection, health monitoring, as well as many future
applications that can benefit from fast and reliable information exchange.
