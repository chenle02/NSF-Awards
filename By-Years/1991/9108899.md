This research aims to better understand the relationships between the existence
of one-way functions and the polynomial isomorphisms of complete sets for
complexity classes using the idea of polynomial creativity. In particular, the
goal is to explore a reasonable condition on one-way functions that implies non-
isomorphisms. Early approaches to this problem, under the assumption that
certain strong one-way functions exist, either turn out a trivial proof or
require that the definition of one-way functions be dependent on a particular
complete set. The approach in this project uses recent results and methods of
polynomial creativity.
