The purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of various social
insurance programs on the behavior of individuals and firms. The programs to be
studied include Unemployment Insurance (UI), Worker's Compensation (WC), and Aid
to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The study of the UI program will
provide a better understanding about how the level of benefits effects the
chance of an individual of filing and the length of time the person receives
assistance. The WC program will be analyzed to determine the extent to which the
reporting of nonwork injuries are effected by the level of benefits and other
features of state workers' compensation systems. The AFDC study includes an
examination of the duration of claims using administrative data. In addition,
welfare migration among states will also be examined. Part of this project will
also include assembling, documenting, and disseminating some new and potentially
extremely useful data sets pertaining to participation in these various social
insurance programs.
