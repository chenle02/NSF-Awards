9809815 Karniadakis A new class of projection methods, the Discontinuous
Galerkin Methods (DGM), has been developed recently and has found its use very
quickly in such diverse applications as aeroacoustics, semi-conductor device
simulation, turbomachinery, turbulent flows, materials processing, MHD and
plasma simulations, and image processing. While there has been a lot of interest
from mathematicians, physicists and engineers in DGM, only scattered information
is available and there has been no prior effort in organizing and publishing the
existing volume of knowledge on this subject. The authors of this proposal plan
to organize the first international symposium on DGM with equal emphasis on the
theory, numerical implementation, and applications. They plan to publish a book
to serve as the first reference on this subject with both review articles and
state-of-the-art contributions presented at the symposium. The Symposium will
include both invited papers as well as other contributions in order to encourage
wider participation especially from young scientists and under-represented
minorities.
