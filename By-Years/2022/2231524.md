The Transforming Educational Technology Through Convergence Conference will
convene researchers, funders, developers, and practitioners online to discuss
the future of educational technology. In order to maximize impact, the
conference will focus on three tracks chosen for both their importance to
overall student success and their promise as targets of research and
development. These tracks are: course-embedded assessment, middle school math,
and data science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learning sciences have
advanced considerably, producing significant insights around, for example,
spaced learning, social and emotional learning, active learning, and the value
of formative feedback. However, learning tools rarely fully integrate these
insights. Nor do developers typically build tools in a robust research
environment that encourages experimentation, rigorous evaluation, and
consistent, iterative improvement. Convergence research and collaboration can
help better integrate research into the&lt;br/&gt;development process while
leveraging technological development in, for example, learning analytics and
natural language processing. This conference seeks to enable the creation of a
Convergence Accelerator track that facilitates the convergence research and
collaboration that is required to transform educational
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
