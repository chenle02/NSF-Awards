This research will focus on the development of an ambient aerosol sampling
system based on Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) technology. The advantage of this new
technology is the size of the sampling system, low cost, and the ability to
provide in situ analysis of certain chemical characteristics using a
colorimetric detector. The analytical detector will be housed in a single
microchip, along with the microfluid component that actually captures and
transports the aerosol particles to the detector. The entire chip unit is placed
in an aerosol collection system (impactor).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
this research is to produce an integrated unit that can be used for in situ
analysis of ambient aerosol samples. While the technology of microfluidics has
been demonstrated over the past several years, as well as that for the detector,
an integrated system has not been attempted yet. This high risk research project
is potentially transformative to the atmospheric sciences community in that its
success may ultimately lead to the development of a new generation of lab-on-a-
chip systems that will be extremely small, lightweight, portable, inexpensive,
and have fast, in situ analysis response times.&lt;br/&gt;
