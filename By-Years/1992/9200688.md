This research is concerned with the investigation of a new class of oxygen ion
conductors having intrinsic oxygen ion vacancies. The materials consist of
structures based on the Aurivillius phases that have their perovskitic region
substituted with brownmillerite- like structures containing intrinsic oxygen
vacancies. The materials will be characterized by complex impedance
spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and differential thermal analysis. The proposed
work will bead to the preparation of a new class of oxygen ion conductors, and
will result in a better understanding of factors affecting the activation energy
and the magnitude of the oxygen ion conductivity. These materials can become
components of fuel cells or be utilized in air separation technologies.
