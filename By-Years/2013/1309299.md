This proposal seeks funding to support travel of American mathematicians to
attend a conference and short courses at the Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM)
in Barcelona and a workshop at Univ. de Granada. The workshop on minimal
surfaces will be held at Mathematics Institute of Univ. de Granada, June 17-27,
2013. The conference in conformal geometry will take place July 1-5, 2013 at
CRM. The workshop seeks to review the recent advances in conformal geometry and
minimal surfaces in order to encourage interactions of researchers in related
areas. In between the two conferences will be the short courses for graduate
students and postdocs on conformal geometry and minimal surfaces June 25 to June
28 at CRM. To promote the interests of young mathematicians in these topics,
more than half of the funding from this proposal will go to support the travel
of graduate students and young postdocs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed
workshops and short courses are intended to stimulate advances and
collaborations in the reseach topics of conformal geometry and minimal surfaces.
Conformal geometry studies the structure of spaces in which there is a well
defined notion of lengths, but the emphasis is on related measurements of length
where the notion of angles is preserved. Similarly minimal surface theory
studies the placement of surfaces in an ambient space in which there is a well
defined notion of length and hence notion of area. Common to both disciplines is
the use of differential equations to study related geometric invariants. In
recent years there is extensive developments in analytic techniques in
differential equations that have direct applications in both conformal geometry
and minimal surfaces. These possible applications will in turn generated new
advances the the theory of differential equations. The following urls give more
