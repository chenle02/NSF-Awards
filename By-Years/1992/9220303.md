The ultimate goal of this proposal is to identify the molecular basis
underlying preparation for and induction of hibernation in mammals. This initial
approach involves identification of hypothalamic genes whose expression is
changed in hamsters before vs during a bout of hibernation. This approach is
based on the hypothesis that induction of hibernation in mammals results from
altered neural/neurosecretory signaling to central and/or peripheral
regulators/effectors of thermogenesis and/or heat loss AND that these
alterations in signalling reflect altered gene expression. While this hypothesis
is reasonable considering the regulatory role played by the hypothalamus and the
changes in thermogenic tissues such as brown fat that considerable difficulty in
detecting the hibernation process.
