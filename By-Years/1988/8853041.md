This award to Ohio State University's Department of Geology and Mineralogy is
made in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire the computer hardware and software necessary
for an instructional computer graphics system. The University is committed to
matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The equipment will be used to
introduce computer-enhanced instruction into Ohio State's undergraduate geology
curriculum. Computer graphic images will facilitate the development of student
abilities to visualize three-dimensional problems and to conceptualize dynamic
geological processes.
