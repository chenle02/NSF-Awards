Otto 9629502 This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project will
develop a novel, low-cost process for manufacturing the robust superconducting
wires required for commercially viable magnet components capable of operating at
temperatures that are accessible by inexpensive refrigeration technologies. Most
of the potentially large-scale commercial applications of high temperature
superconducting (HTS) wires in magnet components require high sustained current
densities at temperatures above 50 K in magnetic fields up to 5 T. The proposed
process is an innovative combination of the metallic precursor process pioneered
by the proposer for the economical production of robust HTS wires, and film
processes that produce the highest demonstrated critical current densities above
50 K in fields above 5 T. The inherent formability of metallic precursor alloys
presents a unique opportunity for manufacturing complex, geometrically precise,
chemically homogeneous precursors similar locally to those used in film
processes. A readily scaleable metallic precursor wire manufacturing process
will be developed and demonstrated that will employ reaction texturing
mechanisms akin to substrate catalyzed reaction texturing mechanisms utilized in
thin film processes. The transport property targets match the requirements for
large scale HTS magnet applications operating above 50 K. The key target is a
whole wire current density of 10 kA/cm2 at or above 50 K that is sustained in a
5 T field oriented at any direction relative to the wire. The main products
enabled by this wire will be lighter and more efficient motor and generator
coils, current limiter coils, SMES magnets, and efficient electronic circuit
inductors all operating above 50 K where they can be cooled by inexpensive
mechanical refrigeration.
