This award, endorsed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the
United States National Commission on Mathematical Instruction, the Mathematical
Association of America, the American Mathematical Society and the American
Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges, is supporting the participation
of 50 U.S. elementary, middle, and high school mathematics teachers or
supervisors, graduate students, community college/university mathematics
teachers, mathematicians and teacher educators or researchers to attend the
Twelfth International Congress for Mathematical Education (ICME-12) to be held
in Seoul Korea from June 8 to July 15, 2012. The work and conversations of
mathematics educators across the world will contribute to understanding of
curricular frameworks, research on teaching and learning, the use of technology,
strategies for reaching all students, educating immigrant children, and teacher
education and professional development. The award will help inform and enlighten
mathematics education in this country through international conversations with
others confronting the same issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a special feature
of the ICME program, the United States has been invited to host a U.S. National
Presentation, which will include two featured sessions and a special exhibit to
be open throughout the Congress for sharing artifacts of mathematics education
in the United States with the international community. The award includes
support for featured speakers and organizing the US National Presentation. It
also includes support for the preparation and update of the State of Mathematics
Education in the United States, under the leadership of John Dossey, which will
be disseminated at the Congress and through NCTM. &lt;br/&gt;
