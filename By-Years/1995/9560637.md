9560637 Langlois This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
describes remote sensing of the physical properties of earth's surface and
subsurface with radar systems. It is of generic interest to the geophysical
science community and is important to a wide range of military and commercial
applications. Recently, an experimental radar was used by researchers from the
University of Kansas to map the thickness of the Jacobshavn glacier in
Greenland. This radar produced high range resolution measurements of ice
thickness but suffered from very coarse cross-track resolution. This proposal
describes a novel nadir-looking imaging radar system that can provide three-
dimension volume images of the structure and depth of glaciers and icebergs to
depths of several km. by utilizing a conformal array of many antenna elements
mounted on the underside of an aircraft wing, we can employ digital beamforming
techniques to generate up to 40 beams in the cross-track direction, each with a
narrow 1.4 to 3 degree beamwidth. Along track resolution will be achieved by
unfocused SAR processing. The resultant volume images generated by this radar
will have spatial resolution on the order of 30m x 30m x 30m at ranges of 1 to 2
km, sampled from the top surface down to ground level several km below the
surface. Potential commercial applications include surveying ice in polar
regions, as well as subsurface imaging of metallic objects, hazardous waste,
tunnels, and detection of hard targets through foliage.
