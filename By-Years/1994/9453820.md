9453820 Prados This project will support workshops as a mechanism for reaching
consensus among the principal stakeholders on two key issues in engineering
education: 1)The need for and form of revised accreditation criteria that will
maintain a strong focus on quality professional preparation while offering
flexibility for major innovations in curricular structure and delivery methods,
and 2) The need for and form of a simplified, non-adversarial accreditation
process grounded in the philosophy of continuous improvement. Two carefully
structured workshops jointly sponsored by the Foundation and ABET would provide
the forum for the needed discussions and constitute a significant step toward
resolving the central issues. Attendance would be limited and would include
leaders of the key stakeholder groups for engineering accreditation. ***
