Using interviews and participant-observation, this field-based research project
will examine the influences of technologies that change medical knowledge on
human relationships and on the emerging moral responsibilities of bioengineers.
In consultation with an engineer, an historian, and a scholar of law and science
policy, the principal investigator, who is a philosopher, will study
contemporary developments and effects associated with three technologies:
diagnostic X-ray, ultrasound, and computer-aided simulation of orthopedic
procedures. The project will try to identify how changes occur in moral
standards for responsible work in bioengineering, in order to expand the
abilities of engineering students, engineers, and professional societies to
identify and establish new and better standards. The historian and the lawyer
will prepare papers on the development of professional standards for licensure
and on aspects of the law associated with these technologies. In consultation
with the engineer, the principal investigator will prepare talks and articles on
responsibility in bioengineering design and the use of innovative technologies.
She will also prepare case studies on the three technologies. The cases will
describe the evolution of the technologies and their influences on human
relationships and bioengineering responsibilities. In addition, she will discuss
the implications of the study for engineering education with relevant
engineering faculty at MIT and in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences
and Technology. If appropriate, an additional paper on this topic will be
prepared. The PI will also incorporate results from this study in a book she is
writing on biomedical technologies, knowledge and responsibility. This project
will make a unique contribution to professional and scholarly understanding of
the moral implications of technologies that change what we know. It can also
contribute to the development of new approaches to teaching engineering ethics,
and to better standards for professional practice and for policies affecting
that practice. The principal investigator is very well qualified to undertake
the research; she has assembled a fine team with which to work. The research
design is appropriate and feasible; it incorporates opportunities for
discussion, review and adjustment as the project progresses. Costs are
reasonable; results are likely to be widely distributed and useful. Support in
the amount of $119,018 is recommended, with $70,000 to be awarded now and the
remainder at later date.
