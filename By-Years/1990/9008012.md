This research is aimed at studying various aspects of resource- bounded
defeasible reasoning and the applicability of the formalism. The scope of this
investigation includes 1. defeasible reasoning about resource-bounded decisions;
2. control of resource-bounded argument; 3. case-based defeasible reasoning in
law and projection from small samples; 4. applications of existing statistical
defeasible reasoning, specifically, to existing HyperText and Diabetes projects;
and 5. mathematics and philosophy of defeasible reasoning. The research is also
expected to have an impact on such related work as non-monotonic reasoning and
logic programming.
