This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a new
technology to utilize ubiquitous personal glucose meters (PGMs) for inexpensive
and convenient at-home tests of the drug theophylline. Theophylline has been
widely used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. It has a
narrow effective range and adverse side effects when overdosed, thus frequent
test of plasma theophylline are recommended for patients using this drug. The
technology in this project converts plasma theophylline into glucose
quantitatively by a theophylline-triggered enzymatic reaction, so theophylline
is monitored through glucose detection by inexpensive and convenient
PGMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader commercial impacts of this research are
more convenience and lower costs for therapeutic drug monitoring. In the era of
personalized medicine, the dosage of a drug is as important as the drug itself.
Many other drugs are similar to theophylline in terms of narrow effective ranges
and adverse side effects when overdosed. Currently, testing levels for these
types of drugs requires hospital visits and blood draws, which are inconvenient,
time consuming and costly. The proposed innovation here can also be translated
to measure other drugs' concentrations more simply, quickly and cheaply. The
innovation proposed here can be used for drug monitoring in general which will
have great impact on the quality and affordability of healthcare worldwide.
