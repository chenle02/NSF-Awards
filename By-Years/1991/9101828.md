This project will consider existence, regularity, local and global behavior,
and symmetry of solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations and variational
inequalities. Particular emphasis will be placed on semilinear elliptic
equations in the open space, scalar curvature equations, and variational
inequalities. These problems come from questions in pure and applied
mathematics. The results are of interests to fields ranging from diffential
geometry to lubrication.
