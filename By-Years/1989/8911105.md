This research focuses on a subset of large-scale organizations using highly
technical systems known as "high reliability organizations" (HROs) -- those
whose operating failures could be extremely harmful to large segments of the
population. Among the questions addressed are these: what patterns of formal
organization and formal rules develop in response to the pressures for highly
reliable performance; what are the corresponding decision making and vertical
versus horizontal communication patterns, and the components of 'organizational
culture' of high reliability? How is the introduction of new technologies
accomplished in such organizations? This project has undertaken a comparative
study of three organizations whose performances often surpasses expectations for
very reliable performance: the FAA's Air Traffic Control System, the Electric
Operations department of a Pacific utility company and two nuclear aircraft
carriers. This grant will facilitate observational visits, questionnaires,
interviews and the collection of performance data in the first two sites, since
data collection on the third site has largely been completed.
