The PI has established a connection between the classification of stable vector
bundles on an algebraic surface and the compactification of the moduli space of
deformations of the surface. The PI will study this correspondence in detail for
surfaces of general type, in particular, its relation to the Donaldson theory of
instanton invariants of smooth 4-manifolds. Jointly with Mark Gross and Sean
Keel, the PI has described an explicit construction of the mirror partner to a
non-compact Calabi--Yau manifold of complex dimension 2. The PI will pursue two
related projects: an algebraic description of the symplectic cohomology ring of
a non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold, and the construction of a canonical basis of
global sections of an ample line bundle on a K3 surface, analogous to theta
functions for polarized abelian varieties.

The PI will study the classification of certain 4-dimensional geometric spaces
and the ways in which such a space can be continuously deformed or undergo a
"degeneration" given by a subset of the space collapsing to a point. In prior
work the PI related such degenerations to the classification of bundles of
linear spaces over the given geometric space. He will study this correspondence
in detail, in particular its connection with work of Donaldson motivated by
theoretical physics. Mirror symmetry is a mysterious correspondence between
pairs of geometric spaces called Calabi-Yau manifolds arising in string theory.
The PI will pursue two projects inspired by mirror symmetry. The first is a
description in explicit terms of an algebraic structure built from counts of
area-minimizing surfaces inside a Calabi-Yau manifold. The second is the
construction of natural functions on Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the simplest case
of a torus (the surface of a donut) these functions were known classically and
are important in many areas of mathematics.
