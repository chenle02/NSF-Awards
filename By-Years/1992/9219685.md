The CONCERT Network (Communications for North Carolina Education, Research, and
Technology) is a mid-level network that serves the State of North Carolina.
CONCERT is connected directly to the NSFNET Backbone Network. It is the
intention of CONCERT to offer NSFNET connections to all higher education
institutions in North Carolina. This proposal requests support to establish six
new connections with a special emphasis on community colleges in the state for:
Cape Fear CC, Carteret CC, Central Piedmont CC, Forsyth Technical CC, Guilford
Technical CC, and Wake Technical CC. A primary goal of CONCERT is to facilitate
collaborative projects and sharing of resources between institution, including
those outside the state. CONCERT will provide operations management and
information services as well as provide appropriate dedicated connections to the
six institutions. The universities need greater functionality and network speed
to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along
with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty
research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the
schools to explore innovative educational resources.
