In this CAREER project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and
Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Donghui Zhang of the Louisiana
State University (LSU) will carry out research to develop new polymerization
methods for N-substituted-N-carboxyl anhydrides. Zhang will study the kinetics
and mechanism of the ring-opening polymerization of N-substituted-N-carboxyl
anhydrides mediated by nucleophilic N-heterocyclic carbenes. Various cyclic and
linear block copolymers will be prepared and the types of aggregates that they
form in solution will be studied. The educational plan focuses on incorporating
concepts from the research project into courses at LSU and on improving LSU K-12
outreach programs, including ChemDemo and "You Be the Chemist." This work will
broaden the array of biologically related polymers that scientists can use to
develop new polymers and materials. Besides developing new methodologies, the
proposed research will enable researchers to create biomimetic polymers that
could find application in bioimaging and biomedical technologies.
