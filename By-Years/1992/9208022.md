This project will study the nucleotide sequence data from one nuclear and three
mitochondrial genes to test the monophyly of the Hystricognathi. Africa and
South American rodents that share a common masticatory morphology expressed in
characters of the zygomasseteric complex, the lower jaw and chewing musculature.
This study, which will apply molecular analyses to the problem for the first
time, bears directly on rodent evolution and relationships, on critical
historical biogeographic issues such as the origin, and pattern, mechanism and
timing of dispersal of the South American Paeogene mammals, and on
paleontological issues such as the origin and homologies of characters preserved
in the earliest known groups of fossil rodents from the Paleocene and Eocene.
