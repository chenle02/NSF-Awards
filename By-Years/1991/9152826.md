A laboratory for image processing and analysis is being established to train
undergraduates in electrical engineering, computer science and the natural
sciences in the analysis of natural images and scientific data. The lab consists
of three networked computer workstations with specialized equipment and software
for the acquisition and processing of digital images from photographs and video
sources. This enables students to gain practical programming experience with
scientific imaging topics like photometrics, two-dimensional signal processing,
statistical pattern recognition, machine vision and parallel algorithms for
multidimensional data processing and storage; these topics prepare students to
apply and write software for increasingly important computer applications like
biomedical imaging, remote sensing, robotics, and scientific visualization. To
support the specialized hardware faculty are preparing a workbook of graded
exercises based on a set of high-quality public domain image processing packages
and data sets; this software and workbook can be freely disseminated, and run on
a single inexpensive personal computer.NSF grant funds are being matched with
funds from non-federal sources.
