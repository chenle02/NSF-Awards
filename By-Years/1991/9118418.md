The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. James Beard of the
Virginia Museum of Natural History, will investigate the melting of metamorphic
rocks that contain the minerals biotite and hornblende. Their experiments, to be
conducted over a wide range of pressure, will provide geologists with important
information regarding the generation of magmas within the earth's crust.
