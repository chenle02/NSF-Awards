0207495&lt;br/&gt;Hearn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support
to upgrade the computational facilities for the solid-earth geophysics program
at New Mexico State University. This upgrade enables the geophysics program to
stay abreast of technological advances in computing, networking, security, and
archiving. Purchasing a 16-node Beowulf cluster is central to our efforts. It
will provide high-speed computational power for relatively low-cost. There are
two major projects, mantle dynamics and microstructural evolution of rocks,
which require three-dimensional parallel simulations. Most of these simulations
are currently being done at off-campus sites using the TERRA mantle convection
code developed at Los Alamos and a Monte Carlo code developed at Sandia National
Laboratories. They will be implemented on the Beowulf. Support will also be used
to replace our current system of older Sun workstations with more modern
workstations. New storage with a RAID array and large-volume tape backup are
needed for today's larger data volumes. These computer systems will support data
storage and analysis from field seismology projects located in China, the
southwest U.S., and Mexico, and to support projects in seismic tomography and
geodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
