Using support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Siska
is using crossed molecular beam techniques to investigate the interactions of
metastable excited rare gas atoms with various atomic and molecular targets. The
results yield information on the precise nature of the intermolecular forces
acting during collisions. Measurements are being made of the angular
distributions for elastic, inelastic, and ionizing collisions. For ionized
targets, a new facility is being used to extract the energy spectrum of the
emitted electrons as a function of the initial collision energy. Regiospecific
data on the intermolecular forces will be obtained from the orbital- and state-
specific electron energy distributions.
