This project involves laboratory studies of processes related to acid and salt
dissolution in atmospherically relevant aqueous systems, namely cloud droplets,
hydrated aerosols, and ice crystals. The activities include detailed studies of
the solvation of acids and salts, qualifying the influence of acids on the
partitioning of halides between the condensed and gas phases, and examination of
ion-induced nucleation. All of these activities have significant current
relevance as there is need for increased fundamental understanding of aerosol-
gas interactions and the possible role of halogens in tropospheric chemistry. In
addition, speculations on the possible importance of ion-induced nucleation have
been published, but the basic thermochemical data needed to assess it
quantitatively are lacking. This study seeks to address current gaps in our
understanding in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this
project include providing high quality training of graduate students in these
important and topical research areas. In addition, the results of this work are
likely to significantly impact understanding of basic aerosol-related processes,
thus leading to improved numerical models, and likely better ability to predict
changes in related atmospheric processes due to global changes.
