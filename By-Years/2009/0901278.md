Abramovich will continue studying problems in moduli theory, including several
aspects of Gromov--Witten theory, in particular (1) generalized moduli of
relative stable maps; (2) comparison of virtual fundamental classes on moduli of
relative and orbifold stable maps; and (3) further study of moduli of very
twisted curves and their maps. Abramovich will continue studying problems in
birational geometry, in particular (1) Campana constellations, their maps and
arithmetic properties; (2) Birational geometry of and moduli of higher
dimensional orbifolds, and their application in the compactification of moduli
of higher dimensional varieties.

The area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the branch of
mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic varieties, defined by
polynomial equations. While algebraic geometry has contributed applications in
coding, industrial control, and computation, the topics of this project are more
closely related to applications in theoretical physics, where physicists
consider algebraic varieties as components of the fine structure of our
universe. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli theory. This
theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic
varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety, called a
moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of
thinking about a community of "organisms" as itself being an "organism" is not a
just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. Sometimes a collection of
algebraic varieties manifests itself as a slightly more general object, called a
stack, rather than a variety. Such stacks are a central object of study of this
project. The other topic studied in this project is birational geometry, which
is devoted to a certain abstract relationship, called birational equivalence,
among algebraic varieties, which lies at the foundation of algebraic geometry.
