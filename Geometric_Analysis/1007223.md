The central theme of this project is to understand the relation between various
geometric quantities of Riemannian manifolds, e.g. volume, area, curvature, etc.
To describe these relations, one seeks for optimal geometric inequalities on
manifolds. Part of this proposal builds on the joint work of the PI and Guan who
have proven the Aleksandrov-Fenchel quermassintegral inequalities for a class of
non-convex domains. The research along this direction will provide an innovative
method to study the classical isoperimetric inequalities from differential
geometry and the Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequalities from convex geometry. Further
study will include these fundamental geometric inequalities in various geometric
spaces. The second part of this project studies the prescribing curvature
measure problems in general Riemannian manifolds which is an extension of the
joint work of the PI with Pengfei Guan and Yanyan Li on prescribing curvature
measure problem in Euclidean space. These research topics are generalizations to
the Christofel-Minkowski problem, and Aleksandrov problem from classical
differential geometry. The third part of this proposal is based on the study of
entropy functionals and differential Harnack inequality for Ricci flow. Ricci
soliton equations, monotonicity formulas of various entropy functionals along
Ricci flow, and their relations with local differential Harnack inequality
consist important parts of the study of Ricci flow in higher dimension
Riemannian manifolds.

This project aims at studying problems arising from differential geometry via
fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations on submanifolds and general
Riemannian manifolds. For example, hypersurface flow equations, prescribing
curvature measure equations, Ricci flow equations, and etc. The interested
questions are at the cross roads of differential geometry and the theory of
partial differential equations. The goal is to better understand relations
between geometric quantities and properties of these important geometric PDEs.
