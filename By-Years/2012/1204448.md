This conference project features two gatherings of scientists, science
educators, and other experts, as well as the development of a web site, list-
serv, and related activities. During the gatherings, participants will explore
how to build state-based programs that can engage people who are incarcerated in
sustainability science programming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work builds off
of the success of the Sustainable Prisons Project, which has connected people
who are incarcerated in Washington State with science through direct involvement
in conservation research, and responds to calls from scientists and corrections
staff interested in implementing similar programming in other states. The
project will help advance the informal science education (ISE) field by
potentially leading to high impact activities for a truly underserved
population; building capacity among ISE professionals; and building knowledge
and a replicable model of supporting non-traditional collaborations that serve
the needs of people underrepresented in STEM.
