The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project views an IoT firearms detection system in the
lens of the military due to their immediate need of such a device and associated
data. In addition, a foothold in the military will allow for and influence the
adoption in downstream markets such as private security and law enforcement who
have already expressed interest in piloting and adopting this technology once
fully developed. However, the broader goal and impact of this system more
importantly grants the potential to save lives. Whether this system will be used
in the military, law enforcement, or private citizens in cases of home and self
defense, successful implementation and commercialization of the first firearms
detection system will grant the capabilities to objectively monitor and leverage
firearm usage data.

The proposed project aims to research, develop, and commercialize an integrated
IoT system dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm discharges.
The challenge in achieving the goals of this project is two-fold: one to create
an IoT system that satisfies the stringent and high standards of the customer
and two, to create value within the data collected by these IoT sensors. The
proposed research and development covers the creation of a prototype device as
well as generating a roadmap based on product and user feedback towards
effective use of the data to ensure commercial success.
