9304195 Smith The goals of this research are: 1) to use the hormone-induced
differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes to examine the role of
different phospholipid head-groups in receptor structure and function 2) to use
altered Phospholipid composition to study regulation of phospholipid metabolism
in animal cells and 3) to continue to develop the use of the ciliate protozoan
Tetrahymena thermophila as a model system for the study of eukaryotic
phospholipid metabolism and the role of different phospholipids in membrane
structure and function. The research will involve undergraduates in laboratory
experience useful for a scientific career. %%% The goals of this research are to
examine the effect of synthetic analogs of membrane components on the function
of receptor proteins which exist embedded within the cell membrane, and to use
these compounds to study the phospholipid composition of cellular membranes and
its regulation in animal cells. Also, the investigator will continue to develop
the use of the ciliated protozoan as a model system for the study of eukaryotic
phospholipid metabolism and the role of different phospholipids in membrane
structure and function. The research will involve undergraduates in laboratory
experience useful for a scientific career ***
