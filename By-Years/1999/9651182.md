The Chemistry and Biology Departments have jointly collaborated on the
implementation of a new major in biochemistry. Included in the degree plan is a
course in molecular biology taught in the Biology Department and two courses in
biochemistry taught in the Chemistry Department, each with a 3-hour lab. This
project addresses the need to outfit the newly designed biochemistry laboratory
components and enhance the existing molecular biology course through the
acquisition of a capillary electrophoresis (CE) unit, used in conjunction with
an existing high-performance liquid chromatograph. Already a common analytical
tool in several science disciplines, CE has the advantages of possessing an
efficiency similar to that of capillary gas chromatography, requiring only
minute sample amounts, and the applicability to a wide range of analytes from
small ions to large biomolecules. The unit is also easily automated for precise
quantitative analysis and ease of use. Experiments involving analysis of
oligonucleotide size, molecular weight determination, and tryptic protein
fragment separation have been developed for these labs. Students also have
access to this instrument for undergraduate research projects.
