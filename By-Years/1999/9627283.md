9627283 Rothman This grant is to partially support travel of U.S. Scientists to
the 21st International Conference on Mathematical Geophysics to be held on June
16-21, 1996, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The conference meets every two years in
different countries and is sponsored by the Committee on Mathematical Geophysics
of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. The conference themes will
be 1) Fundamental problems in geophysical fluid dynamics, 2) Imaging and
modeling complexity in the Earth's deep interior, 3) Natural Hazards: theory and
phenomenology, and 4) dynamical structure of complexity in the earth sciences.
