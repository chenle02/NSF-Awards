In early development in the frog Xenopus laevis depends entirely on materials
stored in the full grown oocyte. Embryonic gap junctions channels, or connexins,
are oligomers of one or more of the oocyte connexin proteins. Dr. Gimlich
proposes to specifically eliminate each connexin by ablating its mRNA in the
oocyte to determine its functional contribution to embryonic channels. The
consequences of connexin deficiency will be assessed by electrophysiological
methods, with a major goal being to eliminate gap junction channels between
embryonic cells. Several treatments, including improper expression of certain
growth factors and proto-oncogene products, result in development of enhanced or
duplicated dorsal, axial structures. These perturbations also lead to region
specific increase in the number of functional gap junctions. The meaning of this
correlation will be tested by experimental manipulation of the number of gap
junction channels. The experiments will yield information on the physiological
role of junctional channels during blastula stages of development, when the
pattern of cell fates is laid out in the embryo through a series of cellular
interactions involving signals that may be transduced by gap junction permeable
second messengers.
