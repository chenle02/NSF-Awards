Funding is provided to support the development and calibration of a method for
reconstructing rainwater delta Oxygen-18 from cellulose extracted from the
annual rings of trees that grow throughout Thailand. The researchers will
measure delta Oxygen-18 tree cellulose from Khasi pine and Merkus pine trees as
a means to reconstruct annual to subannual records of atmospheric precipitation
at sites across Southeast (SE) Asia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers
hypothesize that the increased moisture from the Indian Ocean is a response to
the expansion of the continental monsoon trough eastward over SE Asia. To test
this hypothesis, the researchers will extend the data base of Pine delta
Oxygen-18 to sites across SE Asia in order to map the spatial pattern of
precipitation delta Oxygen-18 variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
offers the promise of helping opening tropical tree-rings to climate analysis.
This is important because, at present, tropical tree cannot be used as a
reliable paleoclimate archive because they do not lay down visible seasonal tree
rings as do higher latitude specimens. Developing an isotopic technique for
tropical trees would be a transformative breakthrough in climate analysis.
