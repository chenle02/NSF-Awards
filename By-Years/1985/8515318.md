There are many existing buildings of unreinforced masonry throughout the country
which are in need of repair or strengthening to extend their lives in an
economical and cost-effective manner. An important factor in the strength
evaluation process is the existing resistance of the bed joints of the masonry
units which are being subjected to the forces of the weight above the bed joint
in conjunction with the sliding resistance of the mortar layer. This research
project will investigate the fundamental strength and deformation
characteristics of unreinforced masonry bed joints. The study will include
considerations of the influence of perpendicular loads in conjunction with the
sliding deformations and degradation of shear strength of the mortar between
units when subjected to dynamci cyclic loadings simulating wind or earthquake
motions.
