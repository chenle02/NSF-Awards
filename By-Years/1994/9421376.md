The post-doctoral fellow supported by this award will work on the general
problem of assessing the impact of data collected in the upper ocean to climate
model predictions. Hindcasts predictions from numerical ocean models (both
research and operational models) will be compared with the upper ocean
observational data sets collected in the Pacific under TOGA and WOCE. This
effort will concentrate on the observed thermal structure of the upper tropical
Pacific. This work will provide the needed guidance and justification for
transferring the TOGA observing system in the Pacific from a research to an
operational mode.
