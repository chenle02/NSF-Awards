Hobbie 9419078 The goals of this project is to begin intellectual synthesis in
our understanding of how estuarine systems function. Synthesis in estuarine
research can take many forms. One type of estuarine synthesis has the long-term
goal of achieving an understanding of estuarine processes and estuarine ecology
sufficient to predict the responses of these coastal systems to a wide variety
of human impacts including climate change and of human management options. This
US Scientific Committee on Problems in the Environment (SCOPE) workshop will
help chart the course for achieving synthesis by: * Illustrating by case
histories how synthesis has actually been carried out in various ecological
systems, especially in estuaries * Gaining community agreement on the questions
that must be answered to achieve a synthetic view of estuarine responses to
human impacts * Identifying the methods, data, and models needed to accomplish
this synthesis. This U.S. effort will then feed into the international SCOPE
activities related to estaurine environments.
