9420961 Celik-Bulter The purpose of the proposed work is to develop a low-cost,
simple room temperature infrared detection technology using YBa2Cu3O6 thin films
in a bolometer structure that can be directly integrated to the silicon signal
processing circuitry. The material to be investigated is YBa2Cu3Ox, well known
for its superconductive properties at cryogenic temperatures (x=7).
YBa2Cu3O6(x=6) is a low conductivity semiconductor at 300K. YBa2Cu3Ox is a
ferroelectric (Er=105-106) and has intrinsically low noise when compared to
competing materials like HgCdTe and amorphous silicon. The oxygen content of the
YBa2Cu3)6 thin film can be precisely adjusted to obtain the desired conductivity
and dielectric constant. The proposed investigation is the first ever attempt,
to exploit the nonsuperconducting phase of YBa2Cu3O6. We believe YBa2Cu3O6 is
going to surpass all existing uncooled IR technologies if a full investigation
is done. ***
