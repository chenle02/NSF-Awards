NSF support will be used to renovate the non-metallic materials laboratory
facilities in Rogers Hall at Polytechnic University. Constructed in 1923, the
space was last renovated in the mid 1950s, and the laboratories are ill-suited
to the multi-million dollar research and research training program in polymeric
materials, non-polymer materials and materials characterization. The materials
research program involves faculty from the School of Chemical and Material
Science (including the departments of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Materials
Science and Engineering and the Herman F. Mark Polymer Research Institute) and
the Physics department. The multi-disciplinary nature of the research activity
requires a well-designed physical layout of the laboratories. The funded
renovation effort will reconfigure the laboratory space into an efficient
arrangement and will allow for the consolidation of major research
instrumentation and facilities. Material Characterization will be greatly
improved by the consolidation and centralization of the X-ray laboratory, SEM,
STEM, laser facilities, scanning tunneling microscope, light scattering
facilities and spectroscopy facilities. In addition, all space will be
substantially improved with the installation of a new HVAC system, new windows,
and new fume hoods.
