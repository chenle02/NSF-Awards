Professor Edwin Vedejs in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Michigan is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
his development of methods to synthesize chiral molecules with high
enantioselectivities using chiral phosphabicyclooctane (PBO) catalysts. One of
the applications which will be studied is parallel kinetic resolution (PKR)
using a polymer-bound PBO catalyst with a lipase catalyst to give two quasi-
enantiomeric products, which can be converted into the two enantiomeric
compounds. The synthesis of PBO catalysts with improved stability and
selectivity will also be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many organic compounds
exist as mixtures of equal amounts of mirror images, related to each other in
much the same way a right hand is related to a left hand. These "right-handed"
and "left-handed" components are referred to as enantiomers. Many natural
products and pharmacologically active substances exist in one enantiomeric form.
With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Vedejs is developing new phosphorus-containing catalysts which are used to react
selectively with either the "right-handed" or "left-handed" enantiomer of
certain organic compounds. In a process called parallel kinetic resolution, one
catalyst reacts selectively with the "right-handed" component of a compound A to
convert it into a product B and another catalyst reacts selectively with the
"left-handed" enantiomer to produce a product C. Compounds B and C are then
separated and transformed back to A, thus leading to an efficient separation of
the two enantiomers of A. The ability to prepare enantiomerically pure versions
of drugs is important for the pharmaceutical industry and would represent a
potentially useful application of this methodology.
