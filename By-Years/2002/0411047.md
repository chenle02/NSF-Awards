ABSTRACT PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0411047 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Rubenstein, Dan
INSTITUTION: Columbia University PROPOSAL TITLE: Distributed, Self-Stabilizing
Tasking for Emerging Network Environments

This proposal explores distributed algorithms and protocols to perform tasking
in emerging networking environments. Tasking is easily described informally as
assigning to each network node a job, rsource, or configuration drawn from a
relatively small set of possibilities, where the same task may be assigned to
multiple ndes. Tasking examples include channel assignment for 802.11 ad-hoc
networks, distributing computations in GRID networks, and placing content
replicas in P2P networks.

This project contains a significant theoretical component that formalizes the
distributed algorithms and protocols, proves self-stability, and formally
quantifies bounds on the performance of the tasking result over general network
topologies. The distributed protocols are designed for practical implementation,
i.e., simplicity of design is preferred over additional optimality. We plan to
demonstrate this facet via simulation and prototyping the results from the
theoretical work within several emerging network environments including ad-hoc
networks and distributed gaming networks. We anticipate dissemination via
publication of results in leading conferences and journals, plus public release
of software prototypes and simulation packages.

Several short-term goals are tackled under this proposal, including the
reduction of messaging overhead, performance of the protocols in which
underlying nodes join and leave the network, and variants on optimal
configuration such as content popularity and nodes whose tasks are hard-wired.
The research is also investigating the application of tasking in two novel
environments: channel allocation in multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks to
minimize interference among neighboring nodes, and assignment of tasks to gaming
servers to minimize latency in distributed gaming infrastructures.
