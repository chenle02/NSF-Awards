This product will continue the operation and analysis of data from magnetic
pulsation sensors located at high geomagnetic latitude stations in the Arctic
and Antarctic. The stations are McMurdo and South Pole, Antarctica and Sondre
Stromfjord, Greenland. The frequency of pulsations measured are from a few
milliHertz to a few Hertz. These pulsations play an important role in attempting
to understand the mechanism by which energy is transferred from the solar wind
to the Earth's magnetosphere. The ground based measurements are used in
conjunction with similar data acquired from a number of satellites.
