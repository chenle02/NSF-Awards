Travel assistance is provided to attend the meeting of the European Federation
of Chemical Engineers Working Party on Distillation, Absorption, and Extraction
in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on June 6 and 7, 1985. The principal
investigator's paper, 'The Rate Approach to Separation Process Simulation,' has
been accepted for presentation at the meeting. This paper describes a new
approach to the design of distillation and other separation processes based on
nonequilibrium models instead of the traditional equilibrium stage with stage
efficiencies. Attendance at the meeting will allow an exchange of information
with European colleagues who also work in the area of separation and
purification processes.
