9320849 Berry This research investigation develops and tests a model of state
welfare policy which stresses the interaction of three groups of participants:
(1) poor individuals who decide whether to participate in welfare; (2) state
policy makers who establish conditions for eligibility and set benefit levels
for programs like Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC); and, (3)
national policy makers who set general guidelines for state policies. The model
incorporates seven "submodels," each focusing on a major research question from
the welfare literature. In most cases, the submodels involve specifications that
reflect the core logic in support of the submodel more accurately than
specifications in the existing literature. More importantly, while extant
literature tends to investigate these models in isolation, this research
recognizes that this division of labor has impeded our ability to answer the
research questions of interest by basing conclusions on parameter estimates from
grossly underspecified models. In contrast, this research estimates a more
reasonable model reflecting combined causal linkages in all seven submodels. In
effect, their ability to obtain "good" estimates of coefficients in each
submodel is enhanced by statistical controls and identifying restrictions based
on the variables and causal linkages in the other submodels. ***
