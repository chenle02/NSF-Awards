In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Andrew C. Hillier of Iowa State University and
his graduate student researchers will be supported to develop new methods for
spectroscopic detection of analytes using periodic (diffractive) nanostructures.
The research will use metal-coated periodic nanostructures' plasmon properties
to enhance the detection of molecular adsorbates. The Hillier group will also
work on developing, theoretical models to better understand the spectroscopic
enhancements seen with these nanostructures.

Surface plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy is analytical method that provides
improved sensitivity over other detection methods. The work of Professor Hillier
and his student colleagues is aimed at providing scientists with improved
detectors for chemical species. This research is important in that it may lead
to methods that can detect chemical species at lower concentration, which could
be important in diverse technological areas including semiconductor processing,
chemical agent detection, etc. Besides the broader scientific impact of this
research, the students participating in this project will be exposed to cutting-
edge research in analytical chemistry..
