Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will deal with the symmetry
breaking which gives rise to elementary particle masses, and especially with the
possibility that this symmetry breaking is a result of the physics known as
"Technicolor". This work will be part of a program which seeks to overcome the
technical problems of technicolor and to determine its experimental
consequences. The research, to be done by one of the new Presidential Young
Investigators for 1990, is an exploration of an important alternative to the
somewhat more straightforward models of mass-generating symmetry breaking.
