This project is a "small grant for exploratory research" project that is part
of a larger project studying parental behavior among the Hadza of Tanzania.
Recently analyzed data suggest that mothers aged 30-45 seem to bear more
children than mothers aged 20-30. If so, this would be a surprising fact and
counter to much anthropological-demographic theory. This project involves a few
months fieldwork so that the investigator can interview women on this past
year's births and infant deaths, to insure higher quality information on this
subject. This research is important because studies of births and parenthood
among small-scale societies provide important comparative material on the human
capacity to bear and rear children, to allow us to evaluate the importance of
environmental as compared with biologically-caused behaviors.
