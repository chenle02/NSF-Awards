This SGER award supports an exploratory, high-risk, high- payoff project aimed
at determining the feasibility of using modern GPS receivers aboard a variety of
spacecraft, along with radio occultation science previously used to explore the
atmospheres of the planets, to measure high-resolution temperature and water
vapor profiles in the Earth's atmosphere. The research has important potential
application to global change research.
