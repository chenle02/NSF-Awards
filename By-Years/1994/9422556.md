This is a prototype Internet service for the General Social Survey employing
NCSA Mosaic. The project will develop a system to provide enhanced access to
survey data, using the General Social Survey for implementation of these
integrated services, which will subsequently be extended to a variety of other
survey data sets. These services will provide facilities for hypertext viewing
and searching of complete survey documentation, customized and documented
extracts from data sets, statistical analysis, and File Transfer Protocol
delivery of full or extracted data sets. The General Social Survey is an ideal
source of survey material to develop the system, because it is a highly diverse
large dataset of complex structure, extensively documented in terms of
publications based on each item, and has already been the basis of more than
three thousand scientific publications and dissertations. The system developed
on the General Social Survey will then become the standard not only for
providing survey data over Internet, but also for research design and data
collection in new surveys. %%% This project is part of the Digital Library
Initiative, adding questionnaire survey data to the kinds of information that
can be managed effectively over Internet and contributing to the national
information infrastructure. Not only is the General Social Survey widely used in
scientific research, but it has proven to be an excellent teaching tool at both
the graduate and undergraduate levels. Survey data are used extensively in
government and commerce, so an advanced system for managing and distributing
information of this kind will contribute to effective government and economic
growth.
