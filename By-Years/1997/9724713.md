Line broadening plays an important role in high- pressure, industrially
important lighting plasmas. In this GOALI project a joint
experimental/theoretical study of line broadening in sodium related plasmas will
be conducted between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and OSRAM
Sylvania Inc. These studies not only impact our understanding of commercially
important lighting sources but are also needed to model other plasma processes
where radiative transport is important. This project is jointly supported by the
Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and
Physical Sciences and the Division of Physics at the NSF.
