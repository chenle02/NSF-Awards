The project proposes to develop a meta-object model and integrate it into the
design of workflow systems. The meta-object model combines the affinity (desire-
to-know) and privilege/obligation (need-to-know) information into a unified
information model which facilitates efficient information access and secure
access control. The Adlets and Malleable objects in this meta model are active
objects that capture inter-dependency among object accesses. This information
model is to be used to develop a new methodology for flexible and dynamic
workflow system design. Traditional workflow systems are either process- or
product-based. Different from these existing systems, workflows in the proposed
information-based system models all workflows as activities of information
accesses. As a result, it allows for incomplete specification of the initial
workflow and dynamic construction of the workflow, i.e., exception and special
sub-workflows are generated as needed when information accesses are invoked.
There are two significant technical impacts in the research: the active meta-
object model supports both performance and security for information access in a
single uniform model, and the incorporation of it presents a new approach for
workflow design which is more flexible and dynamic.
