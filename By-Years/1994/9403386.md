9403386 SILVER Abstract Although a great deal of research has addressed how
people cope with traumatic life expreiences, little is known about the
interaction and development of cognitive, social, and emotional responses to
trauma over time. This research will document the variation in early response to
a traumatic event and identify the early predictors of long-term adjustment to
trauma. Victims of the Southern California firestorm in Laguna Beach and Malibu
were interviewed within 48 hours of their return to their homes post-evacuation.
Three follow-up assessments of the participants will be conducted, with the
final data to be collected 6 months post-trauma. This research will represent
the first attempt to recruit and follow disaster victims longitudinally. The
findings of this study will contribute to a current on-going debate about
patterns of coping with traumatic life events.
