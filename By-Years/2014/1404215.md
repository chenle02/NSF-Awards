The expected detection of the first gravitational waves through the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) will create a paradigm
shift in the way the Universe is viewed, as well as confirming an important
prediction of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. The activities in this
award will provide community college faculty and lower-division college students
with the tools to view the Universe in an entirely new and different way and
with insights into LIGO's daunting technological challenges, just in time to
appreciate the expected first detections of gravitational waves.

The award will enable the creation of new science and technology content for the
"LIGO College Faculty Resource Website." This content will be also be used in
the online course "Teaching Einstein's Universe to College Students" which will
be offered for academic or continuing education credits to community college
faculty nationwide.
