This project partially supports the Tenth Annual Southeastern-Atlantic
Conference on Differential Equations to be held at the Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University. The subject matter of the conference encompasses
diverse areas in differential equations: ordinary differential equations,
partial differential equations, integral and functional differential equations,
applications of differential equations, and related areas such as numerical
analysis and mathematical physics. Differential equations have wide applications
in all areas of science. This meeting provides a forum for the exchange of the
latest ideas and information. Also, the conference provides special support for
graduate students and young investigators to present their own work and to meet
and discuss their research with senior researchers.
