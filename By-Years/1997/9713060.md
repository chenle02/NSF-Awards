In 1995, a national task force was convened to determine if the user community
could arrive at a mutually acceptable way of describing system software and tool
requirements that should be supported in a consistent way across HPC platforms.
The result was a collection of Guidelines for Writing System Software and Tools
Requirements for Parallel and Clustered Computers, which included a
specification for a Baseline Development Environment (BDE). It was formally
endorsed by the National Coordination Office for HPCC in May of 1996. The
project will extend the work begun by the 1995 tack force, in two ways. First, a
national database will be established to make information available on how
individual agencies have applied BDE criteria in procurements of HPC systems.
Second, a new national task force will be convened to revise and update the BDE.
To ensure that the viewpoints of both users and vendors are represented, the
proposed work will be carried out under the auspices of the Parallel Tools
Consortium (Ptools).
