Arkady Berenstein investigates the area lying at the crossroads of the
Representation Theory of Lie Groups, Quantum Groups and Piecewise-Linear
Combinatorics. He studies canonical bases and crystal bases, the multiplicities
for the representations of reductive groups, and the totally positive varieties.
The main tools he uses for this study are the valuations of the corresponding
(quantum) algebras, the method of involutions, convex polyhedra, rational maps
and geometric crystals.

The subjects of Arkady Berenstein's research are combinatorial structures in the
area of Mathematics known as Representation Theory of Lie algebras. These
structures naturally emerge in classical enumeration problems that arise from
physics, chemistry and other basic sciences in addition to mathematics. Quite
surprisingly, these purely discrete structures have continuous counterparts.
Understanding the relationship between these enumerative combinatorial
structures and the geometric structure of their continuous counterparts is a
question of the greatest importance. This relationship proved to be a useful
tool in the study of Langlands Correspondence -- the most mysterious and
inspiring correspondence between Algebra and Geometry of the 20th century
Mathematics.
