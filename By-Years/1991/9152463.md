The Electronics and Computer Systems Technology programs at Parkland College are
developing new methods to teach the non- traditional student, and to integrate
the computer into the curriculum. An existing laboratory with 12 test benches is
being converted into a laboratory with computer integrated technology work/test
stations linked together with a local area network. The work/test stations put
the student in control of a multi-media learning environment that is being
matched to their learning styles. This allows the student to visualize concepts,
aid design, simulate system performance, and control equipment and analyze
designs. The Laboratory also is to be a resource for the Engineering Science and
Technology Department.
