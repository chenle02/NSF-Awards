This award continues the funding for the International Materials Institute at
the University of California at Santa Barbara, called the International Center
for Materials Research (ICMR), which was founded in 2004. During the next five
years, ICMR will continue to promote international research collaborations and
education in materials science and engineering with the goals to (1) enable
ground-breaking discoveries by facilitating multidisciplinary, international
collaborations, (2) provide opportunities for junior researchers to develop the
skill needed to excel in a global research environment and (3) integrate
materials research experiences with an awareness of environmental and developing
world issues into undergraduate curricula. The IMI covers thematic research
programs in a broad range of experimental and theoretical materials science
topics, such as, multifunctional materials and complex oxides, strongly
correlated materials, materials theory for experimental problems, multiscale
modeling of electrochemical systems for energy applications. Each research
program begins with an international workshop to define pressing issues in the
field, followed by a school to train graduate students and junior researchers,
and extended international exchange visits by students and faculty. Finally a
wrap-up conference on each research program allows progress to be summarized,
future directions to be defined, and facilitates initial evaluation of program
effectiveness. This IMI serves as an umbrella for existing and new world-wide
networks of collaborations at the individual researcher and institutional
levels. International research collaborations encompass many countries in Asia,
Europe, and Latin America while workshops and schools include participants from
across the globe. Furthermore, the IMI offers international research
fellowships, travel grants to pursue research in foreign laboratories,
undergraduate exchange program, student-led engineering design projects and
travel fellowships focused on materials research related issues in emerging
regions of the world, as well as student science reporter apprentice
opportunities. The IMI management team consists of UCSB faculty members,
administrative coordinators, and a local steering committee. A U.S.-wide
advisory board helps solicit and select ideas for new programs and an
international advisory board provides general guidance for IMI activities.
