9413162 Schlosser This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP). The PI
will collect water samples to be analyzed for Helium/Tritium concentration on IO
WHP lines I-4/5, 2, 3, 8S, and 9S. These lines constitute legs 1, 4, 5, and 9N
of the current ship schedule. Specific focus will be on understanding mid-depth
circulation and on the release of mantle-derived He-3 along the Antarctic
continent during deep water formation. Data will be used to constrain mid- depth
circulation of the models and to localize areas of extensive ocean/atmosphere
gas exchange (ventilation). ***
