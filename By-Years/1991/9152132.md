The establishment of an instructional facility for plant biotechnology supports
instructional modules, a plant cell and tissue culture course and undergraduate
research. The facility is equipped with laminar air flow benches to provide
sterile working space; illuminated incubators and incubator shakers for
maintaining strict control of light and temperature; an electroporation system
that allows insertion of genes by making protoplasts competent to take up DNA;
and a peristaltic pump to pump solutions past cells in student made bioreactors.
Instruction stresses the development of both technical and problem solving
skills.
