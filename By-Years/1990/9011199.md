The operation of the nervous system depends on nerve cells communicating with
each other through a fine network of cellular extensions known as axons and
dendrites. Axons are usually longer extensions and their initial growth
constitutes one of the crucial steps in determining the organization of the
nervous system. A growth associated protein, known as GAP-43, enriches axons of
nerve cells and is associated with axonal growth. While the relationship of this
protein to growth and the biochemistry of this protein have been well
established, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the levels of
GAP-43 in nerve cells. Previous work has indicated that the amounts of this
protein are determined by the levels of messenger RNA, the intermediary molecule
that links the activity of the gene with the synthesis of the protein. The
investigator plans to study how the expression of GAP-43 is regulated by
focusing on messenger RNA regulation. The levels of mRNA can be regulated at the
level of synthesis or at the level of degradation. Preliminary work from the
investigator's laboratory indicates that the key control point in the expression
of GAP-43 may not depend on the level of synthesis but on the regulation of the
stability of messenger RNA. The study will determine to what extent synthesis
and degradation mechanisms participate in the control of GAP-43 mRNA levels
during neuronal differentiation, in vivo and in cultures of isolated cells.
These studies will provide fundamental information on the mechanisms that govern
GAP-43 levels which will set the basis for future studies on the specific
molecular aspects of these regulatory events. The elucidation of the mechanisms
that regulate the expression of GAP-43 and other growth-related proteins will
not only bring new insights into the question of gene expression control during
neuronal differentiation, but will contribute to the understanding of the
molecular events that underlie the development of the nervous system.
