9412479 Hicks The first nucleon resonance will be studied in carbon via
photoproduction using linearly polarized gamma rays at the Laser Electron Gamma
Source at Brookhaven National Lab. Decay of the resonance into a pion and
nucleon will be observed. A related measurement will be carried out at the
TRIUMF lab in Canada using polarized protons to excite the resonance. The
objective is to study the effect of the nuclear medium on the fundamental
nucleon resonance. An experiment will be initiated at CEBAF to study
electroproduction of hyperons. The objective here is to constrain constituent-
quark models of these resonances ***
