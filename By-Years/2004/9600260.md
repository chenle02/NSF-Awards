9600260 Fowler The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. James E. Fowler to work with Professor Michel Barlaud at the University of
Nice - Sophia Antipolis. Their project is entitled, "Wavelet-Based Subband
Coding for Video Using Adaptive Vector Quantization." The use of digital
computers in multimedia applications demands efficient coding techniques for
storing and transmitting digital video. Dr. Fowler and Professor Barlaud plan to
develop a new algorithm for video coding, based on an integration of two image
coding techniques: adaptive vector quantification (AVQ) and wavelet based
subband coding. They believe that this algorithm is better suited for packet
based video than the established Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standards.
