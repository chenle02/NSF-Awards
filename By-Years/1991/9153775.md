The University of Michigan seeks funds for a three-year program to enhance 60
high school mathematics teachers by strengthening their understanding of
mathematical concepts and effective pedagogy and by applying this knowledge and
skill in a tutorial program for college-bound students in need of remediation in
mathematics. Both participants and the college-bound tutees will be selected
from among urban- based schools with large numbers of underrepresented and
underachieving students in mathematics. Each year, twenty teachers will
participate in a four-week summer workshop and academic year follow-up
activities. Topics to be addressed include statistics, computer usage, graphing,
interrelating mathematical concepts, cooperative learning, and motivating
students. The teachers will participate in videotape demonstrations of classroom
techniques which will become part of a multimedia documentation of the program
which can be used to replicate the enhancement model elsewhere. University of
Michigan and local schools' contribution accounts for 7% of the NSF budget. With
careful documentation of the project, we can be informed about successful
teacher enhancement for teachers in urban-based schools with large numbers of
underrepresented and underachieving students of mathematics.
