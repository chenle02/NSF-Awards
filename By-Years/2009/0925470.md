The objective of this research is to investigate phase-coherent, fiber optic
multiple access communications for efficient, flexible, and secure local access
networks. The proposed coherent diversity receiver cancels multiple access
interference and speckle noise that arise when interfering signals mix in an
optical detector. Such interference dominates multiple access performance, but
the fully coherent receiver minimizes the bit error rate. The approach is to
quantify, through modeling and experimentation, the loss of signal orthogonality
due to optical component impairments and to devise a detector to jointly
estimate each signal and interferer to minimize bit error rates and increase
system capacity.

With respect to intellectual merit, this research seeks to develop a
quantitative understanding of optical impairments that has the potential to lead
to new high-performance and low-cost designs for integrated optical devices.
Determining the minimum detectable signal permits increased network reach. Joint
detection maximizes network capacity, which is limited by multiple access
interference. Providing fully passive, coherent two-way network access without
phase locked loops, super-fast diodes, or optical sources in the user nodes
minimizes cost.

With respect to broader impacts, research outcomes have the potential to lead to
efficient, low-cost delivery of a broad array of information services, tailoring
resources to the needs of each subscriber. Diversity and outreach are supported
by offering several urban high school science students and teachers six summer
weeks of "hands-on" project experience. A laboratory course in digital fiber
optic Communications emerging from this work blends research and education.
