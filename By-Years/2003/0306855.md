This grant will focus on developing a formal model for describing data collected
in the field with multiple participants in multiple locations. Included will be
field workers with mobile devices, remote servers receiving, archiving, and
sending data to the field, and field base stations. To provide ground truth for
the model, a series of use cases will be analyzed to identify and formally
define classes of objects, attributes, and methods and the associations and
inheritances of the classes. This work is preparatory to the development of a
larger and more comprehensive proposal to be submitted to various grant
opportunities at NSF. The US Census Bureau will participate as a partner in this
research.&lt;br/&gt;
