1 9703669 Chang This project will focus on studies of the mechanisms of
buckytube and buckybundle nucleation and growth in a controlled direct current
arc discharge and a thermal evaporating system. Photo-induced-fluorescence
measurements and mass spectroscopy will be used to determine the time evolution
and spatial distribution of the carbon precursors responsible for buckytube and
nanowire formation. A model will be developed to explain the observed physical
phenomena of buckytube formation. %%% Several areas of application are being
explored for these materials. The emission of electrons due to high fields
applied to the buckytube tips are being studied for possible application to flat
panel displays. The electron transport properties of copper nanowires are being
studied for possible application as interconnects in integrated circuits. This
is a well integrated research and education project that has involved graduate
students, postdocs, undergraduates, college teachers and high school teachers.
