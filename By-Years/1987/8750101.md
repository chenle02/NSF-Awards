The Chemistry Department at Austin Peay State University has recently acquired a
microprocessor-interfaced Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer which
is being used to enhance undergraduate instruction by integrating FTIR
applications into several courses in the curriculum. Specifically, the system is
used in instrumental methods of analysis and organic chemistry courses for
compound identification and in physical chemistry to study the properties of
compounds.
