The Chemical Measurements and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry
supports Prof. Darryl Bornhop of Vanderbilt University to enhance understanding
and extend application of backscattering interferometry (BSI) to investigate
molecular interactions that are difficult to study by other methods. Dr.
Bornhop's group is further demonstrating that BSI can be used for quantifying
the influence of immobilization and structural modifications on molecular
interaction binding affinity, and for studying interactions and chemical
reactions in complex milieu. The research seeks to expand on defining the BSI
signal generation mechanism, aiming to quantify the roles of changes in
conformation and hydration resulting from a molecular interaction. The potential
to define interaction mechanism of action by incorporating BSI signal
directionality will also be investigated. Efforts on BSI performance
optimization are planned to aid in translation of the technology to the broader
scientific community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By enabling the study of molecular
interactions in solution at physiological or biochemically relevant
concentrations, and with nanoliter sample volumes, this work will allow
investigation of a wide array of biological and chemical problems previously
considered intractable. Broad societal impact may result, including enabling of
sub-micron scale synthesis, the study of binding in complex samples, expedited
drug discovery, and more efficient biomarker validation. Graduate, undergraduate
and high school students in the interdisciplinary Bornhop group will participate
in the research, results of which will be disseminated via the Vanderbilt
Student Volunteers for Science as well as by conventional means.
