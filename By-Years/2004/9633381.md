9633381 Saleeby This grant provides $149,829 as partial support of three years
of a technician's salary. The technician will be responsible for oversight,
operation and maintenance of the Caltech radiogenic and noble gas mass
spectrometery laboratories. This is a Phase I technician support proposal under
the EAR/IF technician support sub-program. Technical support at these
laboratories will allow continued and productive research by this strong and
well supported group including studies utilizing helium thermochronology as
applied to tectonic investigations of the Peninsular Ranges and the Sierra
Nevadas, Ar/Ar geochronologic studies of deformational events near the Gulf of
California, and Sm/Nd isotope systematics applied to dating of garnet bearing
metamorphic rocks from the western margin of the Cordillera. ***
