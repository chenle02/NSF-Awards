This project will consider problems in the theory of partial differential
equations related to quasiregular mappings in Euclidean space of dimension at
least 3, in an attempt to extend to higher dimensions some aspects of classical
function theory. The underlying potential theory in Euclidean space is nonlinear
and harmonic functions are replaced by solutions of certain quasilinear
equations which are invariant in a certain sense under quasiregular mappings.
Quasiconformal mappings are well suited to be studied with analytic methods via
these quasilinear elliptic equations. They are closed under composition, making
them very useful in Topology and Geometry. These studies are important in the
mathematical modelling of non-newtonian fluids and creep of metals. Further
connections to benefit applied science as well as pure mathematics will be
sought.
