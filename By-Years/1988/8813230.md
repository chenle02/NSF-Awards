This proposal is for NSF sponsorship of a workshop on the topic of
"Interconnection of High-Speed and High-Frequency Devices and Systems", to be
held on March 17-18, 1988, at Newport Beach, California. The object of this
workshop, which will follow a two day SPIE/OSA symposium on the topic, will be
to identify opportunities for research that will provide the scientific basis
for future interconnect technologies. Invited panelists will include
representatives from industry, both technical and managerial, from government
agencies, and from academic institutions. Particular emphasis will be given to
identifying lines of scientific inquiry that could lead to qualitatively new and
interesting concepts. The existing state-of-the-art will be assessed, and future
scenarios explored, with an attempt to reveal possible bridging technologies and
concepts that require further scientific investigation and to put in perspective
unresolved issues requiring further dialogue.
