Lay Abstract

The International Union for the Study of Social Insects is devoted to integrated
analyses of the biology of this important group of organisms. It holds an
international meeting once every four years that has emerged as the premier
forum for the dissemination of knowledge in this field. Funds are requested to
send a group of carefully selected graduate students to the meeting that will be
held in Sapporo, Japan in July-Aug, 2002. The opportunity to attend this
important meeting will have a significant impact on the development of the
careers of these students by allowing them to begin to meet leaders of the
field, develop contacts that can lead to productive collaborations, and get
feedback on their own work. Japan has a well established tradition of excellence
in social insect biology and offers an outstanding venue for this meeting.
