0216274 Ekinci Funding is requested for the development of a novel matrix
assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass
spectrometer. The goal of this development is to replace the conventional
microchannel plate (MCP) detectors in an existing MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer by
resonant nano-mechanical sensors to improve its mass spectrometric capabilities.

The proposed development will result in a room temperature MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometer with very high mass resolution and sensitivity and practically no
upper limit for detectable mass. This is a much-needed analytical tool for
chemical and biological sciences and offers prospects for studying many
different macromolecules. It also appears that this will be the first
application where nano-mechanical systems are being employed as ultra-fast
sensors.
