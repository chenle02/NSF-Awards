Abstract

Award: DMS-0504202 Principal Investigator: Wolfgang Ziller

The principal investigator will continue his work on manifolds with non-negative
and positive sectional curvature. In this subject, which has been studied
extensively in the early years of global Riemannian geometry, only few
obstructions are known, the major one being Gromov's Betti number theorem. On
the other hand there are also very few known examples, mainly arising by taking
quotients of left invariant metrics by a group of isometries. Recently
significant progress has been made by studying positively curved manifolds under
the presence of a large group of isometries, partly in the hope of finding good
candidates for new examples of this type. We recently obtained a partial
classification of positively curved cohomogeneity one manifolds, i.e. manifolds
where a group acts isometrically with one dimensional quotient. In this
classification one is left with a very interesting sequence of 7-manifolds which
are, surprisingly, connected to self dual Einstein metrics and 3-Sasakian
geometry. We plan to investigate whether these manifolds carry a metric with
positive curvature. For non-negatively curved cohomogeneity one manifolds there
are many examples, constructed by the author in previous grant proposals,
including some on exotic spheres. On the other hand the author also showed that
the exotic Kervaire spheres cannot carry such metrics. This makes a
classification of non-negatively curved manifolds a very interesting although
difficult question, which the authors plans to investigate in the future. We
also plan to study geometric and topological properties of the known examples of
manifolds with positive, or more generally non-negative sectional curvature. As
a next step, we plan to study positively curved manifolds with low
cohomogeneity.

Since the round sphere of constant positive curvature is the simplest and most
symmetric Riemannian manifold, it is natural to ask what manifolds carry metrics
with similar geometric properties, i.e. metrics with positive curvature. This
fits into the natural question of what global consequences one can derive under
local geometric assumptions, a major area of global Riemannian geometry. A basic
unsolved question is whether exotic spheres, i.e. manifolds that look like
spheres but on which ordinary calculus is quite different, can carry positively
curved metrics. Symmetries are an important aspect of many geometric questions
and the principal investigator plans to study manifolds with positive or more
generally non-negative curvature under the presence of a large symmetry group.
One of the goals of this investigation is the search for new examples.
