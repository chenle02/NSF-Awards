9450522 Greeno This project studies ways in which research can play a more
productive role in educational reform, particularly in mathematics at the Middle
School Mathematics Project (MMAP) with interviews and other communication with
researchers and developers who are engaged in efforts toward educational reform
in mathematics. The study is based on the assumption that practice can be guided
by knowledge of examples that is communicated as generalizable models.
Generality is facilitated by analyses that identify the factors that are needed
for models to succeed and that assist in applying models to local circumstances.
