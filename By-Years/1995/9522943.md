9522943 Xu Fast and objective determination of the basic properties of fibers
like: length, diameter, maturity, medullation, color and yield is a way to
improve the quality of finished textiles and as a way of providing feedback in
development of natural fibers. This project will use image processing technology
and newly proposed algorithms to solve this technical problem. Considering
preliminary research in this domain, new image processing methods of
segmentation are needed to measure fiber cross-sections. New quantitative
characterizations that are important to fibers need to be derived from the
enhanced image, such as crimp or the waviness of fibers, trash content and the
hollowness of natural fibers. Cluster analysis will be investigated for
classification into different fiber grades. The long term impact of this
research will be a measurement tool that can be used to improve fiber
development, textile grading, development of automated textile processing, and
ultimately world trade. ***
