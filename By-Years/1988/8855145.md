The University of Iowa proposes to enhance its established summer research
participation program in science and engineering for twelve high school students
to offset four identified needs: (1) the need to involve industry as part of the
learning component; (2) the desire to openly recruit more minority and
economically disadvantaged students; (3) the desire to expand the impact of the
program beyond the current eight week course; and (4) the need to underpin the
base of financial support for the entire program beyond the period of proposed
effort. The proposed target program seeks to augment the existing program
through (1) the active recruitment of minority and economically disadvantaged
students in Iowa and Chicago; (2) the inclusion of industry as an active partner
in career awareness development and program financial support; and (3)
structured follow-up activities which not only will impact on the target group
and the eighty regular participants, but will also influence the participants'
peers and their home community.
