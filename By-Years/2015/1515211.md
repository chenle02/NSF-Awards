Globular clusters are dense populations of hundreds of thousands to millions of
stars, and were expected to at one point also contain a population of around
1000 stellar-mass black holes. However, theory predicted that as the clusters
evolved, these black holes would be ejected from the cluster through
gravitationsal interactions with other black holes, leaving only ~1-2% of
globular clusters with a stellar-mass black holes. Recent research suggests
though, that stellar-mass black holes could be far more common in globular
clusters. This project aims to investigate the frequency of black holes in
globular clusters using radio observations of Milky Way globular clusters from
the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), and has the potential to increase
the number of known black holes in the Milky Way significantly. This work will
be done under the supervision of host researcher James Miller-Jones of Curtin
University, whose expertise in this subject and access to ATCA are critical to
the success of the project.

This project will focus the search for stellar-­mass black holes on cores of the
clusters where, through dynamical mass-segregation, these black holes are
expected to be. Radio observations are increasingly sensitive to low-­luminosity
accretion onto compact objects, which makes the deep ATCA observations ideal for
this search. Stellar-­mass black hole candidates will be identified by their
flat spectrum radio emission, and followed up with observations at different
wavelengths to confirm that candidates are not accreting neutron stars, white
dwarfs, or background galaxies. If stellar-­mass black holes are indeed common
in globular clusters, this would have significant implications, such as that
more accurate study of stellar-­mass black holes could be done, and there would
be increased chance of the formation of black hole-­black hole binaries, which
would be important sources of gravitational waves. This NSF EAPSI award is
funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.
