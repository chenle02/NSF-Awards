Award 0942797&lt;br/&gt;Funding to support US researchers travel to Chinese
American Network Symposium Conference 2009&lt;br/&gt;PI: Boyles,
Heather&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides travel support for up to
twelve US researchers to participate as speakers in the 2009 Chinese American
Network Symposium (CANS). The annual CANS meeting brings together academic
researchers involved in the design and use of high-performance research networks
from both the US and China to share information about their respective work;
explore areas for potential collaboration between US and Chinese researchers;
and present results from collaborations established in previous years. The
objectives of the CANS meetings are to promote understanding between the US and
China research networking communities, promote interoperability between the
research infrastructures established in each country and ultimately support ?
through this critical element of global cyberinfrastructure - international
science and research collaborations across a broad range of disciplines between
the US and China.&lt;br/&gt;
