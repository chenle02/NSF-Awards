9407279 Cohn This project is designed to better understand the mechanism and
ecological role of cell movement in a ubiquitous and ecologically important
group of algae known as diatoms. Diatoms are among the most abundant primary
food sources in many aquatic food chains, and their ability to move within the
sediment is believed to be important to their ecological success. These cells
can generate movement despite being confined within a hardened glass-like cell
wall that restricts any direct contact between the inner cell and the surface
over which it moves. This project is designed to help determine the ecological
functions of diatom movement and the factors which regulate this movement by: 1)
using a computer-assisted video microscope system to quantitatively analyze the
characteristics of diatom movement under a variety of environmental conditions;
2) performing comparative analysis of the movement of different diatom species
displaying a variety of cell wall features and shapes; and 3) performing
competition experiments to determine the relative abilities of different diatom
species in a mixed population to undergo vertical movements and compete for
limited resources (e.g., space, light or nutrients). These studies should help
to determine a number of diatom properties including: the environmental cues and
conditions which affect diatom movement; the ability of diatoms to survive or
become acclimated over time changes in environmental conditions; and the type of
movements undertaken by various species to try and compete for limited resources
such as light and nutrients. ***
