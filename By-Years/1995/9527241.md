9527241 Stegeman We will explore radical new opportunities for the application
of spatial solitons to information manipulation in networks. Our ultimate goal
will be to implement a hybrid, all-optical/electronic, reconfigurable NxN
routing switch. Using a totally new concept will optically write bright spatial
solitons which act as " guiding: channels between any two points on opposite
sides of a self-focusing nonlinear material. Either TDM or WDM signals can be
routed by these non-diffracting channels to interconnect abitary input and
output signal paths. Furthermore, by controlling electro-optically the input
soliton wavefront tilt, angular scanning of soliton channels ( and signal paths)
in space will be demonstrated for connecting different inputs to different
outputs on demand, i.e. a reconfigurable NxN interconnect. We will investigate
the spurious deflection of spatial solitons by collisions in planar waveguides
of A1GaAs and bis-paratoluene sulfonate (PTS). In fact, we have already
characterized the nonlinear properties of A1GaAs waveguides, demonstrated all-
optical switching devices and excited spatial solitons. Therefore these
waveguides provide an excellent testbed for the new concepts involved. In
parallel (with a student salary from a recent AASERT award from BMDO) we will
investigate the feasibility of exciting spatial solitons in PTS which we have
also recently characterized. PTS is important because it has the largest know
nonresonant nonlinearity and its implementation into waveguides will lead to
low-power spatial soliton generation, and ultimately interconnects. This work
will be done in collaboration with Wagner at the University of Colorado Boulder.
