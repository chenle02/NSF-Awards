Partial support of a conference on high temperature chemistry which will, for
the first time officially recognize the important role of solid state chemistry
in the conference title. The purpose is to provide a forum for the presentation
and discussion of scientific results emerging from rapidly developing fields
that include diamond and diamond-like materials, high-Tc superconductors,
complex unit cell materials, and band theory calculations. Sixty- four
presentations from individuals working in the top solid state chemistry
laboratories in the U.S. have registered for the meeting, and thirty-three of
the presenters will be graduate students and post-doctoral students.
