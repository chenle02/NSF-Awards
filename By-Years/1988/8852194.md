This project makes microcomputer technology a central part of the undergraduate
experience in psychology. It establishes an interactive classroom and two
computer laboratories. The interactive classroom is equipped with a
microcomputer, a video recorder, and a multi-sync video projection system for
effective in-class demonstrations of microcomputer applications. The statistics
laboratory enables the conduct of laboratory assignments requiring data analysis
and simulation, and the on line laboratory permits the on line control of
experiments. The classroom and laboratory microcomputers are networked in order
to provide the advantages of a mainframe system without the corresponding
limitations. Undergraduates are involved in all phases of the use of
microcomputer technology in research, data acquisition, on line experimental
control, data retrieval, data analysis, bibliographic work, report writing,
graph making, and simulation. Student proficiency in using microcomputers is a
means to deeper understanding of basic psychological principals as well as an
end in itself. The award will be matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
