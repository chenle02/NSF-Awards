The intrusion of magma into rocks representing various tectonic settings is a
common phenomena, however how the crust accommodates the volume of magma and the
mechanisms involved in emplacement of plutons are controversial. This project
will examine four plutons that represent different depths of intrusion to
determine the interactions between the internal structure of the plutons and
their wall rocks under varying conditions. The work will involve study of
magmatic fabrics using AMS analysis to determine the AMS signatures, the
magmatic and solid-state microstructures and will be combined with other data to
correlate the internal magmatic structures of the plutons to the solid state
processes acting an their margins. Results will provide the bases for analysis
of their emplacement mechanisms (which are controlled by a combination of pre-
existing host rock structures, syn-intrusive regional stresses and magmatic
pressures).
