This award is for paleomagnetic studies aimed at determining the timing and
rate of the motion of the Hawaiian and other hotspots relative to the
paleomagnetic axis, and the implications of such motion for true polar wander,
using methods recently developed to determine accurate paleomagnetic poles with
exceptionally narrow age resolution (e.e.+1 m.y.). The approach, based on the
analysis of the shapes of marine magnetic anomalies recording ancient seafloor
spreading, allows one to overcome the difficulties of determining paleomagnetic
poles in the presence of systematic errors like those that plagued pioneering
studies of magnetic anomaly data.
