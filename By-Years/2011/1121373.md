With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is supporting the
research of Professor Michael Harris of the RNA Center at Case Western Reserve
University to develop isotope-edited Raman spectroscopy as a new biophysical
tool for the study of metal ions associated with backbone phosphate oxygens of
RNA. Metal ion binding necessarily changes the chemical environment of
neighboring phosphoryl oxygens, resulting in changes in the Raman spectrum.
Signature signals in the Raman spectrum can in turn provide valuable information
on the nature and position of the metal association. With isotope editing, these
studies should allow for the experimental interrogation of specific metal-RNA
interactions in solution, at the level of individual phosphates. The
quantitative nature of the information gained makes it directly applicable to
computational models being developed to describe the structure and energetics of
RNA-metal ion binding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the project
will include the development of new tools for chemical biology based upon a
combination of isotope-labeling (bioorganic chemistry) and Raman spectroscopy
(biophysical chemistry). Success here may translate to broader applications of
the technique in biophysical chemistry. The PI will incorporate advanced
undergraduates into the research team, with a special emphasis on members of
traditionally underrepresented groups in science. Student will have hands-on
experience with state of the art instrumentation and participate in data
analysis facilitated through small group learning exercises. Thus, an important
component of the project is the integration of the research goals into
education, providing a training opportunity for the next generation of
scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is being
co-funded by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster within
the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) Division of the BIO Directorate at
NSF.
