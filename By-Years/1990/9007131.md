Several species of the nematode, an invertebrate widely used in genetics
research, are very sensitive to volatile anesthetics while some species have a
low sensitivity. The differential sensitivity in this animal is caused by
recessive mutations in the gene unc-1. This project entails studying the
mechanism of volatile anesthetics action in the nervous system of the nematode
by identifying the components of the site of action. Additional spontaneous
mutations in the unc-1 gene and fragments of the chromosomes which contain the
gene will be identified, leading to the cloning of the gene. The research will
make it possible to identify the proteins coded by the unc-1 gene and provide
necessary information about the molecular biology of animal responses to
anesthetics.
