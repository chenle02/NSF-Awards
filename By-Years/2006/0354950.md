This proposal requests support for an ongoing research program of experimental
High Energy Physics at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The research
activities of the group are concentrated on the D0 experiment at Fermilab and
the CMS experiment at CERN. During the period covered by this proposal, they
plan to (1) continue their activities in the D0 physics program working on top-
quark physics and Higgs searches, (2) work on the development and lead the
installation, shakedown, and commissioning of the D0 Level-1 Calorimeter Trigger
Upgrade in preparation for Run IIb, (3) maintain, operate, and improve the
Level-2 Calorimeter Trigger that they built, (4) monitor, simulate, and operate
the D0 Silicon Microstrip Tracker, (5) increase their effort in the CMS Silicon
Outer Tracker, and (6) establish a long-term physics program at CMS.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed activities are
multiple and diverse. The technological advances of high-energy physics frontier
experiments help all sciences and engineering. The challenges that must be
overcome for building and commissioning complicated trigger and silicon systems
enhance the disciplinary knowledge in the relevant engineering fields. The most
mature outreach activity of the UIC group, namely the QuarkNet program, fosters
collaboration between high school teachers and the UIC group members, thus
strengthening teaching and learning in Chicago area high schools. &lt;br/&gt;
