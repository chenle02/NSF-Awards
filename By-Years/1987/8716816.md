Dr. Prange has developed a comprehensive theory of the magnetism of itinerant
electron materials, and has made important contributions to theories of the
Quantum Hall Effect, Quantum Chaos, Electron gases with restricted
dimensionality, and Superconductivity in highly disordered systems, among
others. In particular, the connection he found among Anderson localization,
quantum chaos, and electronic states in incommensurate potentials continues to
elucidate all three fields. His work on magnetism is supported by new
experimental data and new calculations on spin polarized photoemission.
Degradation and enchancement of critical temperatures by disorder, in different
classes of superconducting materials will be explained as well as the
temperature and disorder dependence of the inelastic scattering time in thin
metal films. The work will be further elaborated with projects in high
temperature superconductivity, in transport properties of itinerant
ferromagnets, in Quantum Chaos, in the Quantum Hall Effect, and in the
properties of electronic interface states.
