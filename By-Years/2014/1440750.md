Scientific researchers on university campuses create, analyze, visualize, and
share large and diverse datasets from experimental devices like brain scanners,
particle colliders, and genome sequencers. However, these "big data"
applications place strain on traditional campus networks, due to rapidly
increasing volumes of data, the need for either predictably low latency (to
adapt experiments in real time) or high throughput (to transfer large data sets
between locations), and sophisticated access-control policies (to protect the
privacy of human subjects). To enable the next wave of scientific advances,
university campuses must find effective ways to meet these challenging demands,
at reasonable cost. The emerging technology of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
lowers the barrier to innovation in network management, and can substantially
reduce cost through (i) inexpensive commodity network switches, (ii) greater
automation of network configuration, and (iii) novel network-management
applications that optimize bandwidth usage. Yet, existing innovation in SDN
focuses primarily on the needs of commercial cloud providers, rather than the
unique requirements of university campuses and scientific researchers. Princeton
University is creating a software-defined campus network that can enable the
next generation of data-driven scientific research. The initiative brings
together big-data science researchers, computer scientists who are experts in
SDN, and the campus Office of Information Technology. Princeton is deploying an
open-source SDN platform for monitoring and configuring the network, conducting
trials of new ways to support big-data applications, and bridging with the
larger community, on and off campus, to support the sharing of scientific data,
SDN software, and operational experiences.
