A cooperative translation/publication project will be undertaken on the Report
on the Great Tangshan Earthquake. This chinese language report was prepared by
the Institute of Engineering Mechanics in Harbin, China which is the major
research institute on earthquake engineering in China. This magnitude 7.8
earthquake leveled the city of Tangshan and killed 243,000 people, and
industries and city lifelines suffered major disruption. The city was composed
mainly of structures that had not been designed for earthquake forces and
approximately 80% of the buildings collapsed entirely or in part. Similar
vulnerable cities exist in the U.S. and also in Central and South America,
Italy, Greece, Turkey, Pakistan, India, and Indonesia. When translated into
english, the report on the Tangshan earthquake would be valuable to U.S.
engineers, architects, and government officials in reducing seismic
vulnerability, and in addition would be valuable to many developing countries.
The relevance of the report remains high because the vulnerability of most
cities remains high. It is the purpose of the translation project to make
available to U.S. readers the information contained in the report and thus to
encourage hazard mitigation measures.
