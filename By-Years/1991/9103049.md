This project involves detailed field, geochemical and petrographic study of old
supracrustal rocks associated with the Ancient Gneiss Complex in Southern
Africa, in order to identify protoliths, to characterize the mantle sources of
mafic igneous rocks, and to determine the composition of sediment sources.
Investigation will involve lithologic analyses of mapped supracrustal
successions in Swaziland; petrographic studies; major and trace element analyses
of terrigenous metasediments and metavolcanics; and Nd isotopic studies of
metasediments. Results should be important in constraining the tectonic setting
of these rocks, as well as enhancing our understanding of the origin and
evolution of the early continental crust in southern Africa.
