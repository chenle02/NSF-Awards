This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award in the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Dr.
Patrick J. Walsh, Chemistry Department, San Diego State University, on the
mechanism of asymmetric induction by titanium catalysts. Several new chiral
titanium bis(sulfonamido) complexes will be prepared and tested for their
effectiveness in the catalytic asymmetric addition of alkyl groups to aldehydes.
They are expected to model the intermediates in this reaction and so to provide
guidance about important features of the active site and about design of more
effective catalysts. In addition to involving undergraduate students in this
research, Dr. Walsh will conduct an extensive outreach program to enrich
chemistry education in the San Diego-northern Mexico region. Selective synthesis
of compounds with a specific symmetry, that is, of either a right- or left-
handed form, is an important chemical goal. Methods of this type are critical to
the pharmaceutical industry and to many biological studies. In this research, a
more detailed knowledge of the way in which selective synthesis occurs will be
achieved. Undergraduates will be involved in this problem-directed research. In
addition, outreach programs in science in collaboration with the Instituto
Tecnologico de Tijuana for US and Mexican students will be undertaken.
