The project team plans to further develop a new enabling technology for
groundwater modeling - one that has the potential to substantially reduce the
costs of groundwater sustainability investigations and could change how
groundwater is managed, how data is collected, and even how people collaborate.
Under this initiative, the project team has developed a cloud-based groundwater
simulation system, that is delivered as a service, not as a product, and is
live-linked to a massive pre-processed spatial database, allowing one to zoom in
anywhere covered by the database to make a preliminary prediction of groundwater
flow and contaminant transport. Additionally, the software allows users to add
their own data to that provided by the service, refining model predictions and
allows aggregating user data, essentially turning users into co-
developers/collaborators and building value as a side-effect of their use of the
application.

As sustainability is among the greatest challenges in the 21st century and
recent IT and data revolution offers unprecedented opportunities for potential
breakthroughs in the ability to understand and manage complex systems,
interactions, and sustainability. These possibilities, however, are largely
unrealized, primarily because the technologies to produce big data are not
matched by technologies to analyze them. The project team recently partnered
with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to develop this integrated
computational infrastructure in groundwater science and engineering. The
collaboration takes advantage of existing programs - statewide database
development and data integration from a network of state, federal, and other
institutional storehouses on the part of the State and computational
advancements, specifically in hierarchical GIS-based modeling, stochastic
modeling, and real-time visual simulation and data analytics, on the part of the
project team - and exploits the synergies of integrating these efforts to
significantly improve our knowledge-creating infrastructure to understand,
characterize, model, and visualize complex groundwater systems.
