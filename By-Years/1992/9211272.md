Developing efficient storage management methods for objects of varying sizes and
lifetimes is the mission of this project. Means such as compile-time techniques
for objects with short lives, tunable generation scavenging for objects with
medium lifetimes, and methods for long-lived non-persistent objects will be
applied to garbage collection. In addition, some novel approaches for managing
persistent objects (those that remain between program executions) shall be
explored. It is hoped that these techniques will also apply to concurrent
processing. A prototype toolkit for language implementors will be developed.
