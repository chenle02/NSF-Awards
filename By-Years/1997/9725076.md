Abstract 9725076 Engebretson Earth's magnetic field undergoes variations on many
time scales. The low amplitude fluctuations which occur with periods of a few
tenths of a second to a few seconds, called micropulsations, are the result of
motion in the magnetosphere such as waves on surfaces like the magnetopause.
Since most of the magnetosphere is connected to the surface by magnetic field
lines which have their footprints at high geomagnetic latitude, the large scale
dynamics of the space environment can best be studied from the polar regions.
There is now an extensive Antarctic array of magnetometers to support research
in this area. In particular, this team has installed magnetometers in the
British Antarctic Survey Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO) and has
access to data from other similar instruments. This grant continues funding to
pursue research using the BAS AGO and other magnetometer data. This research
will provide additional insight into how solar activity effects Earth's
environment as well as humanity's technical systems. The magnetometers will also
provide data to the world-wide space data pool. ***
