Proposal: DMS-0244419&lt;br/&gt;PI: Charles Doering&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;Title: Fronts, Fluctuations, and
Growth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary
investigation brings together researchers from the University of Michigan's
Departments of Mathematics, Physics and Chemical Engineering to study questions
of front propagation and pattern formation arising in materials science and
chemistry. The central goal of the project is to elucidate, theoretically and
mathematically, the roles of fluctuations, noise and disorder on the dynamics of
interfaces in nonequilibrium systems such as chemical reactions and thin film
growth. This project combines theoretical condensed matter and statistical
physics, Kinetic Monte Carlo and numerical simulations, and mathematical
modeling and analysis to investigate the interplay of stochastic and nonlinear
effects in systems of scientific and technological
interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regard to the intellectual merit of this
activity, research results from this project will lead to the development of
effective mathematical descriptions and efficient computational schemes for
problems of increasing importance for small-scale physical and chemical
processes in materials science and nanotechnology. With regard to the broader
impacts of this activity, it also has a significant advanced training aspect: a
graduate student research assistant associated with this project will carry out
original PhD thesis research under the guidance of the principal
investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
