A simple but sophisticated laboratory equipped with good instruments is an
essential component of physical science education for students majoring in the
humanities and the social sciences. Bates College will add instruments to the
physics and astronomy laboratory for non-majors which will substantially improve
the laboratory experience. The instruments consist of telescopes which will
collect light for photometers and spectrometers through a fiber-optics system,
as well as equipment to measure the properties of photons and electrons. The
instruments will allow students to make a wide variety of measurements of the
quality of light radiated by laboratory and astronomical sources and to conduct
key experiments relevant to the particle-wave nature of light and matter.
