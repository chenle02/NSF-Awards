The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate interdisciplinary discussions of
the neural and social bases of movement and creative movement, that could
stimulate new research directions and catalyze creative collaborations
integrating the perspectives of scientists, engineers, and artists. The
motivating scientific interest for this project is a recognition that the
planning and control of movement recruit a broad array of sensory-motor circuits
in the brain required for synchronization, improvisation, and coordination, not
only within an individual, but also between ensembles of people. From a
scientific perspective, creative movement offers a unique experimental paradigm
within which a well-controlled set of actions can be examined to understand how
the brain accomplishes expressive movements, how it learns them in the first
place, how creative movements are coordinated with movements of others, and how
such movements are supported by the underlying substrates of sensory-motor
networks within the brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshopâ€™s broader goal is
to foster collaborations among scientists, engineers, and artists in the study
of creative movement in its many dimensions and contexts. It will advance a
fundamental understanding of how the brain produces purposeful actions that are
central to human well-being and quality of life. Broader impacts include the
exploration of creative motion to advance therapeutic and health related
goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
