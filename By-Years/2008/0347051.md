A person effortlessly identifies objects of interest in cluttered scenes, the
keys on a cluttered desktop or the stuffed elephant in a crowded toy chest. In a
cluttered scene, parts of one object may occlude another, so the edges that
belong to one object are obscured by the edges of occluding objects. How does a
person so effortlessly sort out such a complex array of overlapping objects?
With NSF support Dr. Preeti Verghese will explore the relevant process in
perception, processes that sort out complex arrays and identify the objects
therein. Broader impacts of Dr. Verghese's work will include a better
understanding of the problem of amblyopia. The capacity to correctly perceive
objects is impaired in amblyopia, which occurs as a result of abnormal visual
development. Amblyopes have great difficulty tracing the outline of an object,
for example, especially in a cluttered background. Basic research to understand
intact perception of cluttered scenes will shed light on the abnormalities
associated with amblyopia.
