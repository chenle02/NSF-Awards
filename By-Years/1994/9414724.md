The Conference will stress topics that are of great current interest and of
importance to both Particle and Nuclear Physics communities. It will concentrate
upon mutually beneficial cooperation between particle and nuclear physics in
Science , in Technology, and in the Facilities through which such endeavours are
being pursued. The Conference will highlight the importance and diversity of
particle and nuclear physics in the energy range 1 to 150 GeV and beyond.
Particular emphasis will be placed on reaching out beyond the present frontiers
of physics through high intensity and high precision experiments as distinct
from those efforts which intend to roll back the energy frontier. Funds be used
for advanced graduate students to attend the Conference. ***
