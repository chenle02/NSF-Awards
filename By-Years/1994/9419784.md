9419784 Reznikoff This research uses Escherichia coli sigma 70 RNA polymerase
and lactose (lac) operon promoter model system to study positive gene regulation
by catabolite activator protein CAP. CAP is thought to activate transcription by
direct interaction with RNA polymerase. One consequence of this interaction may
be to stimulate an interaction between RNA polymerase and specific upstream DNA
sequences. The role of candidate (-40 region) DNA sequences in the CAP
activation of the lac promoter will be investigated through chemical
interference and site-specific mutation studies. In addition, the possible
limiting effect of these upstream sequences on lacP expression in the absence of
CAP will be examined. %%% The first event in gene expression is the initiation
of RNA synthesis or transcription. This multistep process involves the
interaction of the enzyme RNA polymerase with specific DNA sequences called
promoters. The promoter DNA sequence determines the start site and frequency of
unregulated RNA synthesis. This research will investigate in detail how the
bacterial regulatory protein CAP facilitates the specific interaction of RNA
polymerase with the bacterial promoter lac to activate transcription of the lac
genes. This CAP-lac system is a general model for understanding transcriptional
activator proteins, which have been known to regulate gene expression for over
25 years. ***
