The Department of Computer and Information Sciences is developing a hands-on
laboratory, of 10 workstations, to enhance and facilitate computer science
majors' understanding of and experience in networking and data communication
applications. This equipment, which enables students to work in a supervised
laboratory environment, is used to implement practical exercises that are
coordinated with course lectures. Emphasis is on projects that allow students to
explore the first four layers, and the application layer, of the ISO/OSI model.
Using TCP/IP and network simulation, activities permit students to experiment
with, simulate and troubleshoot different network configurations,
internetworking, interconnectivity, protocols, and LAN topologies. Network
design problems, which reinforce the concepts of top-down design and modularity
learned in software engineering and systems analysis and design, are also
addressed. A network analyzer permits students to monitor network traffic. Guest
lectures by former students adds another layer of expertise to the curriculum.
Students are exposed to the networking tools and applications used by industry
and research. Evaluation will be attitudinal and the course will be disseminated
at an SIGSE panel discussion and in a laboratory manual for networking courses.
