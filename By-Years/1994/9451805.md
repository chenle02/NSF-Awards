9451805 Easwaran Faculty in the Department of Mathematics are establishing a
computer laboratory to teach linear algebra and numerical analysis. The computer
laboratory is designed to radically change the current mode of instruction and
the assessment of learning in these courses. The project is developing
innovative ways of using symbolic computational software in instruction and
significantly enhance student understanding of basic ideas. Under this project,
the software Derive is used extensively to teach linear algebra and numerical
analysis. The built-in utilities of Derive as well as those written by students
and teachers is used for all the work in these courses. Courses are project
oriented and require cooperative learning; student assessment is changed
radically to reflect the new emphases. The laboratory is being equipped with 20
networked Intel-486 based PCs and software to augment the 8 existing PCs in the
mathematics department's computer laboratory. Dissemination of newly developed
utilities, on-line instruction manuals, and student projects is through
anonymous ftp. Discussion over the internet is used to modify and improve the
project and the materials produced. An extensive evaluation also is used for
these purposes.
