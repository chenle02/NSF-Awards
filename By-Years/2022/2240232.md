Researchers and practitioners across disciplines have drawn on the theory of
contextual integrity to tackle privacy issues. The recent efforts include
operationalizing contextual integrity and what it means, discovering contextual
norms for privacy, capturing usersâ€™ privacy expectations in varied contexts, as
well to analyze regulations and using contextual integrity to establish research
ethics guidelines. Recognizing common interests and challenges, it is important
to bring this diverse community of researchers using contextual integrity
together to discuss what has been learned from the projects using this privacy
theory and how to move forward to leverage contextual integrity for enhancing
privacy preserving systems and policies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop
assembles computer scientists, engineers, legal scholars, social scientists and
ethicists to foster communication between the various communities of researchers
and practitioners using the theory of contextual integrity as a framework to
reason about privacy and use it as a common language for sharing of ideas. The
workshop develops new collaborative interdisciplinary research partnerships
around the theory of contextual integrity with existing communities in industry,
academia, and government, and establishes a body of significant literature for
future work on privacy enhancing systems. This workshop also facilitates
interdisciplinary connections amongst privacy researchers in social science,
law, computer science, ethics, and policy to produce more reliable and readily
adopted privacy-enhancing technologies. The workshop broadens participation in
computing by providing travel grant awards and in-person mentoring opportunities
to a diverse set of students primarily from under-represented and marginalized
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
