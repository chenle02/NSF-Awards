The Cajon Pass scientific drilling project is aimed at resolving a 20 year-old
controversy about he level of shear stress required to cause motion on major
plate-bounding faults. Phase II drilling activities ended at a depth of 3.5 km
at Cajon Pass in the spring of 1988. This award provides for 1) complete
analysis and interpretation of the nearly continuous profile of stress
orientation and relative magnitude as a function of depth that was obtained in
the Cajon Pass borehole, and 2) an attempt to obtain uncontaminated pore fluids
from a depth of 3.5 km at the bottom of the existing borehole and compute bulk
permeability and pore pressure. Funds are also provided to enable the principal
investigator to participate in hydraulic fracturing tests in the deep borehole
the Germans are drilling. This will be an important opportunity to document the
state of stress at appreciable depths in an intraplate environment and the
knowledge and experience gained by the principal investigator will be of direct
benefit to the U.S. Continental Scientific Drilling Program.
