This project enhances the current Information Assurance curriculum at the
Atlanta University Center, extending it from upper-level courses to be
systematically incorporated into the undergraduate syllabus. This project
incorporates Information Assurance pervasively throughout the undergraduate
Computer Science programs at the Center schools. Further, it enhances
specialized Electrical Engineering courses to include concepts of Information
Assurance, and builds a research component in Wireless Security. This research
will tie faculty efforts in curriculum development to current advances in the
field and provide early research experiences to undergraduate students. While
each individual school in the consortium does not currently have the resources
to develop full-fledged education and research in Information Assurance, as
collaborative institutions sharing resources, this can be substantially
accomplished. The overall objective of this capacity building is for students in
Computer Science and Electrical Engineering to be exposed in a very fundamental
fashion to the security ramifications of software and communications
technologies. The broader impacts of this effort will include the development of
curriculum material that provide a model of a concerted approach to integrating
IA concepts into the curriculum, and increasing the pipeline of students,
especially African Americans, who will pursue graduate studies in IA in
particular and STEM fields in general.
