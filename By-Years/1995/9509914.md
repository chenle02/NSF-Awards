Economic Issues for Electronic Commerce This research is to study issues of
electronic commerce, focusing on electronic data interchange, advertising, and
virtual stores. The main objective is to provide a general approach to manage
and analyze the potential economy consisting of users of the network services
and the service providers, leading to an implementable pricing tool for
communications networks. The first phase will enhance the existing simulation
models by developing additional mechanisms for providing better predictions of
waiting times. These additional mechanisms include: (1) approximating queuing
mechanisms for computing prices, (2) developing guidelines to set parameters
automatically, (3) adding functionality to simulation subroutines, (4)
automating some sampling subroutines, (5) performing testing, (6) developing
computing tools for the pricing scheme. The second phase will implement pricing
mechanism on LANs and building a simple user interface with the ability to
query, optimize costs, and present results in an appropriate format. At the
server level, software agents will be developed to respond to user queries and
perform estimation and pricing calculations. The third and final phase of the
project intends to develop the complete final priority pricing mechanism for the
Wide Area Network environments.
