This project will develop, analyze, and apply new models for solving three
fundamental problems in image processing: (1) edge-preserving noise removal; (2)
image decomposition into objects plus textures; (3) recovery of lost information
through image interpolation (or 'image inpainting'). The main feature of this
new class of models is their ability to isolate and detect in natural scenes
target objects that are obstructed by noise, textures, or other occluding
objects, without generating erroneous or misleading features in the process. The
identification and/or development of false object boundaries has long been a
challenge for edge-preserving image processing models; this project seeks to
find a universal approach for solving this problem. These new models are based
on variational methods and partial differential equations. The investigator will
establish their mathematical validity, determine properties of their solutions,
develop efficient and accurate numerical schemes for their implementation, and
directly apply these models to solve critical problems in the sciences and
engineering.

Through existing collaborations with researchers in medical imaging, materials
science, geology, pharmaceuticals, and optical character recognition, the
investigator and undergraduate students will use these new models to solve key
issues in science and technology. These problems include removing noise while
isolating key medical features in highly degraded magnetic resonance images,
identifying and analyzing the grain structure of nanoscale materials for
optimizing high technology metals, and identifying land cover regions that are
at high risk for hazards such as wildfires or flooding in remotely sensed images
where the boundaries of these regions are obstructed by textures such as roads
or topography. Currently, the only reliable methods for treating each of these
problems depend on hand-drawn object boundaries. This is prohibitively time
consuming on large data sets, so automating the boundary detection process will
greatly enhance the state of the art. False object detection can be devastating
in any one of these applications, so existing automated methods cannot be
directly applied. This project seeks to find theoretically sound approaches that
avoid this drawback while removing obstructions and accurately identifying
target objects.
