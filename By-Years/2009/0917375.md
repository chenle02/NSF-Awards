Many complex software-based systems must be certified in order&lt;br/&gt;to be
deployed in safety-critical environments. Modern
software&lt;br/&gt;certification processes require trustworthy evidence
supporting the&lt;br/&gt;verification claims. While verification tools have made
tremendous&lt;br/&gt;gains in power, they lack the ability to generate concise
and&lt;br/&gt;independently checkable evidence. The V Kernel project develops
a&lt;br/&gt;practical approach to reconciling trust and automation. The
claims&lt;br/&gt;generated by the fast but untrusted front-line verification
tools are&lt;br/&gt;certified offline by slower but verified back-end checkers.
The&lt;br/&gt;front-line analyzers can provide hints and certificates that
assist the&lt;br/&gt;back-end tools. The verification of the checkers can be
carried out by&lt;br/&gt;untrusted tools as long as the end result can be
independently&lt;br/&gt;certified. Our approach does not constrain front-line
tools by&lt;br/&gt;requiring them to produce proof objects. A wide variety of
verification&lt;br/&gt;tools including SAT solvers, decision procedures, model
checkers, static&lt;br/&gt;analyzers, and theorem provers can be validated using
this approach.
