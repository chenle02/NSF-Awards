Artificial intelligence and expert systems offer an alternative to conventional
methods of design of earthquake resistant structures. This application could
lead to an economical and technically broad design methodology. This research
project will consist of developing an expert system for earthquake-resistant
design of structures. The design of structures for earthquake loads requires
specialized knowledge in several interrelated disciplines, and is very difficult
to perform on a day-to-day basis by a designer. This expert system will help the
designer in the development of a safe (and economical) earthquake-resistant
design on a routine basis. The Phase I efforts will develop the basic framework
for the proposed expert system and detailed technical development of the
methodology will be performed in phase II. An award is recommended for this six
month Phase I, Small Business Innovation Research project. The principal
investigator is highly qualified to conduct the research and the institution
provides adequate facilities for support.
