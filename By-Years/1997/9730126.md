9730126 Heeger Semiconducting polymers offer important advantages as potential
laser materials, e.g., High photoluminescence efficiency (PL), low self-
absorption, emission wavelengths that span the visible spectrum, easily
processed into optical quality thin films, and electrically pumped in a diode
configuration. The high PL efficiency and large cross-section for stimulated
emission persist to high concentrations. In contrast to traditional laser dyes,
conjugated polymers function as high gain laser materials in the solid state,
neat and undiluted. To obtain lower thresholds and to generate coherent laser
light, it is necessary to incorporate the conjugated polymer into a resonant
structure. The goal of this research is to achieve low threshold optically
pumped polymer lasers through improvements in materials and materials processing
and through the creation of novel resonant structures. With sufficiently low
thresholds, lasing structures fabricated from semiconducting polymers can be
developed as cw lasers. For example they could be pumped with conventional light
sources, or with blue-emitting LEDs (e.g. using the InGaN technology), or with
solar radiation (solar powered lasers!). To accomplish this goal, significant
improvements in the polymer materials are required to enable the high-Q resonant
structures that are needed. These improvements and the related achievement of
high-Q resonant structures with conjugated polymers as the gain media are the
goals of the proposed research. The actual work will include: measurements of
gain and loss in photopumped semiconducting polymer films; materials development
including fabrication of high quality, low-loss optical thin film waveguides and
expansion into new conjugated systems (new PPV derivatives, polyfluorene
derivatives and spiro-conjugated materials); development of cladding materials;
and evaluation of these conjugated materials in microcavities, in distributed
feedback structures and in `whispe ring gallery mode' structures (micro-disks
and micro-rings). %%% This research will provide fundamental understanding and
potentially new and improved devices in the area of laser materials and
electrically active polymers. ***
