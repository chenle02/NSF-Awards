The principal investigator will study fluid infiltration patterns in rocks of
the Rio Mora uplift of New Mexico, utilizing field, petrologic and isotopic
techniques. Results will add significant- ly to understanding of the
permeabilities of metamorphic rocks, the mechanisms that generate such
permeability, the 3-dimensional geometry of fluid infiltration, and in general
to the ways in which fluids interact with rocks of the Earth's crust during
metamorphism.
