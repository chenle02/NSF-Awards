This award will support collaboration on the metallogenic evolution of tin
mines between Dr. Richard Hutchinson, Colorado School of Mines, and Han Fa,
Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. Work will involve study of some of the
largest tin deposits in the world, which are located in China. Most great tin-
producing districts contain morphologically different types of tin
mineralization, and it is important to distinguish among the types, both
geologically and in terms of genetic process. This study will improve the basic
understanding of the metallogeny of tin and of the processes that lead to its
enrichment to commercially minable levels. This in turn could lead to improved
exploration efficiency by indicating new and different approaches in exploration
for tin deposits. This study will involve continuing field study in China,
sample collection, and analytical work. The Chinese PI will visit Colorado to
continue analytical work, and several publications are expected.
