People hold consensual beliefs about the status value, that is, about the
competence and worthiness, of individuals. It is puzzling, however, that these
beliefs are often based largely upon the unordered or nominal categories, such
as gender and ethnicity, to which these individuals belong. This proposal
examines the interactive processes by which such consensual status values may be
acquired. A theory is proposed that argues that if a correlation occurs between
a given nominal characteristic and the distribution of economic resources, it
constrains face-to-face interaction within the population. In encounters between
people differing in both resources and the nominal characteristic, these
constraints lead to an association between that characteristic and status-type
beliefs. When individuals bring this status association to other encounters and
treat people according to it, the structural constraints on interaction allow it
to diffuse widely, and it becomes consensual. Specifically, two experiments will
be conducted to test this theory. The first experiment will show whether or not
an individual participant who works with a person who has a different pay level
and a different nominal characteristic will form expectations states which then
transfer to a later situation where that individual differs from the other
person only in nominal characteristics but not in pay level. A second experiment
examines a more "advanced" stage of the process, exploring situations in which
the nominal characteristic might acquire low status value even for people who
have obtained a high value of the resource. This project will contribute better
understanding of the linkage between social processes at the micro-level and the
distribution of resources reflecting social and economic arrangements at the
macro-level. It will also provide information for researchers and policy makers
who are concerned with issues of inequality and equity.
