This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This award will fund acquisition and installation of a new
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) instrument in the
GeoAnalytical Lab at Washington State University (WSU). It will replace a 12
year old instrument that is now obsolete. The ICPMS facility at WSU is employed
in a very broad range of Earth and enviromental science and chemistry research.
In-house projects that use data from the instrument include studies of super-
eruptions from volcanic calderas (Valles caldera, Jemez Mountains, NM) and large
igneous provinces (Columbia River flood basalts and Snake River Plain
rhyolites). In these cases, trace element data are essential to understanding
the generation, storage, and transport of magmas that feed the largest basaltic
and rhyolitic eruptions, which are known to have caused major environmental
disruption in the past. A very different in-house application is investigation
of the aqueous geochemistry, basic solution chemistry and separation science of
lanthanides and actinides with applications to radioactive waste transport and
storage and to the ultimate closing of the nuclear fuel cycle.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the broader U.S. scientific community, the WSU
analytical service supplies high-quality data at low cost to a wide range of
university- and institution-based scientists in North America (and some
overseas) who work with the trace element contents of rocks, sediments, soils
and waters and have come to rely on the service provided by the WSU laboratory.
The facility will also serve to train future analysts and geochemists who will
enter the geoscience/enviromental science workforce. About 12 graduate students
per year from WSU and elsewhere are trained in sample preparation, experiment
design, and use of the ICPMS equipment.&lt;br/&gt;
