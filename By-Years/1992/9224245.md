9224245 Glass This Americas Award will support collaborative research between
Drs. Jonathan Glass, Louisiana State Medical Center, and M. T. Nunez Gonzalez,
University of Chile, on the exploration of the cellular mechanism of iron
uptake. The focus of this research is on the biochemical analysis of the events
required for iron delivery from transferrin, with the ultimate aim of
elucidating the mechanism of iron transport. The laboratory on the Chilean side
will focus on utilizing rabbit reticulocytes to obtain detailed analyses of iron
mobilization via the regulation of vesicular pH by ionic fluxes, while the
laboratory of the principal investigator will determine mobilization rates as a
function of ionic composition and membrane potential. Results of the research
will contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental aspects of human
cellular metabolism. ***
