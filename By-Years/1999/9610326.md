9610326 Fayer Experimental and associated theoretical investigations of dynamics
in complex liquids, supercooled liquids, the glass transition, and glasses will
be carried out. The emphasis is on understanding the relationship among
molecular level dynamics, intermolecular interactions and structure.
Experimental approaches will include vibrational echo experiments, transient
grating optical Kerr effect, and ultrafast UV photon echo experiments. %%% The
emphasis in this study is on complex liquids that include liquid crystals,
polymer melts, and supercooled liquids, all systems of significant importance to
materials processing of, for example, optical flat panel display devices and
structural materials. ***
