This research is designed to integrate Bayesian statistical inference and
decision theory with modern computational and numerical methods. The core of the
research program is the adaptation of methods for parallel/distributed
processing of computation to problems in Bayesian statistics and decision
theory. The research will have three principle directions: 1) theoretical
development of the Bayesian methodology, 2) research into parallel/distributed
computing algorithms, and 3) applications of numerical techniques to Bayesian
problems. The methods, algorithms, and software to be developed for
parallel/distributed processing will be important in a wide variety of
theoretical and practical Bayesian problems. Areas of application will include
hierarchical Bayesian modeling, sensitivity and robustness, sequential analysis
with application in sequential process control, Bayesian methods for image
reconstruction, and Bayesian inference for neural networks.
