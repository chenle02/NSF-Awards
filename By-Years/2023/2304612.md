The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project regards the ability to achieve early detection
of cancers of the esophagus and throat. This project targets a multimillion-
dollar annual market and has the potential to positively impact rural and
underserved communities without access to specialty endoscopy clinics. The
project also has the potential to positively impact the African American
community, where the incidence of esophageal cancer is higher.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to assist
clinicians in detecting tumors of the esophagus and throat at an earlier stage,
which will have life-saving effects. This project will combine liquid lens
technology with artificial intelligence software and astronomical imaging
techniques, with the objective of generating three-dimensional images of early
stage esophageal and throat tumors. This particular study will focus on
acquiring quality three-dimensional images of a cadaverâ€™s esophagus and pharynx
to prepare for the next stage of testing and development.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
