The project is designed to develop a laboratory for students in General
Psychology courses. General Psychology meets a general education core
requirement; thus, students from very different academic disciplines enroll in
the course. Students learn a variety of psychophysiological measuring techniques
using the BioPac Student Laboratory program and serve as experimenters or
participant subjects employing ready-to-use MacLaboratory and Psychological
Disorders software programs. Although learned in the context of Psychology, the
laboratory and reasoning skills accquired are transferable to other scientific
discovery settings and to general problem-solving situations. The development
plan includes the recruitment of advanced Psychology majors and graduate
students to learn CAI techniques and to assist in laboratory instruction and
supervision.
