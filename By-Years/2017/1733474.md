Reflection, as a form of thinking, involves stepping out of a situation and
creating knowledge. In an educational context, reflection plays a critical role
in professional practice, learning from experience, and successful
implementation of teaching methods such as active learning. In supporting
student learning, educators can potentially improve and transform student
learning through reflection activities. Reflection activities can be modest in
terms of the amount of time required and thus can be added to existing
instructional efforts to help magnify the impact of many types of educational
activities and help individuals go beyond simply doing better. Reflection
activities may be a significant tool in efforts to critically improve
engineering education, address issues such as diversity and retention, and
support learning goals such as innovation and global competencies. Yet, within
engineering education, reflection and reflection activities are understudied.
The proposed work will establish and refine instruments that will help educators
and scholars better understand student engagement in reflection activities,
specifically their reactions to engaging in reflection activities and their
self-reported knowledge gains. These instruments will be critical for helping
engineering educators bring reflection activities into their teaching through
informed choices and creating opportunities for deeper and more nuanced
scholarship on reflection activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of this
study is to explore undergraduate engineering students' knowledge gains using a
common approach so that reflection activities can be compared more readily.
Another intent is to better understand student reactions to the reflection
activities in a way that may serve many purposes such as interpreting study
results and identifying ways to refine activities. A multi-week study with
undergraduate engineering students culminating in interviews will capture
students' perspectives when talking about reflection. These perspectives will be
used to refine the conceptual models related to knowledge from and reactions to
engaging in reflection activities. Usability studies of survey items and a
principal component analysis will also be used to systematically develop and
validate survey instruments. Finally, a study focusing on a selected reflection
activity (e.g. exam wrappers) will be used for further survey validation. The
proposed work features a systematic, rigorous process using best practices in
survey instrument development, and in supporting educators in operationalizing
learning goals through reflection activities. To this latter end, our proposed
work includes both scholarly and practical dissemination.
