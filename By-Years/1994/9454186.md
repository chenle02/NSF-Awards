9454186 Brett MCNC Presidential Awardees in Communication Using the Internet
This one year project would pilot a program to train Presidential Awardees. A
pilot group of 30 teachers receives training on the basics of connectivity and
accessing and sharing resources over the Internet. Through this pilot, the
project team learns the breadth and depth of training required, the type and
extent of ongoing technical supports needed, and the viability of using the
Presidential Awardees as experts for other educators who have access to the
Internet. The training is held for one week in North Carolina and draws 30
teachers from the pool of 1994 Presidential Awardees in mathematics and science,
elementary and secondary. In addition to the formal workshop, support materials
are developed and tested to help teachers use SLIP accounts and networked
services. Ongoing support is provided by MCNC and by teachers who participated
in the earlier Global Schoolhouse project. The project may extend to supporting
awardees who were not selected for the formal training if feasible. Cost sharing
is not specified but the project does incude contributions and expense sharing
provided by the individual participants and by company donations such as AT
&amp; T. MCNC is not responsible for any of these donations. ***
