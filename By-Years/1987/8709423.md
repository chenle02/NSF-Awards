Autonomous Lagrangian Circulation Explorers (ALACEs) are current-following
subsurface floats which periodically rise to the surface to be located by the
Argos satellite system and then return to depth to continue following currents.
They are intended to be used in mapping the oceanic general circulation and will
be of particular value in the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). It is
proposed to develop and demonstrate an operational capability to use these
presently developmental floats. Proposed engineering are (a) extending
operational depth improvements from 1500 m to 4000 m, (b) expansion of data
relay capacity to permit satellite relay of profile data on each ascent, and (c)
addition of RAFOS acoustic tracking. Proposed field operations include (a)
series of local tests of longevity, (b) demonstration of a capability to lauch
from commerical ships of opportunity, and (c) a deployment of 25 ALACEs in the
tropical Atlantic in which floats will be used to describe cross-equatorial flow
of Antarctic Intermediate Water. As a step toward WOCE operations, investigator
will be invited to suggest other programs to use the ALACE capability developed
at Scripps.
