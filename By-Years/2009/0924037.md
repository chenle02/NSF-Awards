This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) Phase II project proposes to create an in-home gait training device that
allows a post-stroke patient to undergo rehabilitation with little or no
assistance. Approximately 500,000 Americans survive a stroke each year.
Miraculously, most stroke survivors can relearn skills, such as walking, that
are lost when part of the brain is damaged. They can relearn walking most
effectively if they are aided in making the correct motions by a machine or a
physical therapist while attempting to walk. This training is expensive and
requires the patient to make regular visits to a stroke center or qualified
physical therapy center. Berkeley Bionics proposes to create a lightweight
robotic exoskeleton which cradles a patient?s lower extremities and torso, and
maneuvers their rehabilitating limbs for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of this research are immense. These devices could move most post-stroke
rehabilitation out of the clinical setting thereby reducing labor costs
dramatically. The gait training exoskeletons will be wearable, very unobtrusive,
and allow patients to maneuver in the real world. Patients would therefore be
able to wear such devices for most of the day, thus remaining mobile and gaining
the therapeutic effects of physical therapy over the course of a day, rather
than just a short session. Furthermore, creating such a device will also give
clinicians an alternative to the wheelchair to assist patients who are unable to
recover adequate mobility to function in their daily lives. This could
potentially reduce unhealthy effects of wheelchair use for
millions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
