This project demonstrates how the design activity, fully integrated with
economic principles, can be effectively utilized to teach the engineering
science component of the undergraduate curriculum. A course is developed and
taught that utilizes a design paradigm to teach engineering science principles
in thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics. Integrated in this subject
matter are economic principles concerned with costing, design for manufacture
and selection of design alternatives. Additionally, a new course dealing with
the economics of engineering design that bridges from the lower to the upper
division is developed. Professors from 4 different universities are involved in
preparing educational materials for this new course and for the economics
components of the modified engineering science core courses. Computer software
and computer-based teaching aids focusing on the means for estimating cost-to-
manufacture for various thermosystem components are developed. Case studies
focusing on economics principles in design are initiated. Course materials such
as computer modules of an intelligent tutoring system are developed.
