With this award form the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic Chemistry
Program, Ronald L. Musselman of Franklin and Marshall College will investigate
the electronic structures of metalloprotein model compounds and porphyrinic one-
dimensional electrical conductors. Polarized specular (mirror-like) reflectance
spectroscopy will be used in the study, which will probe metalloporphyrin
complexes and thereby provide information that may be useful in understanding
the mechanism of reactivity at the active sites in some non-heme binuclear
proteins and enzymes. Polarized specular reflectance spectroscopy of single
crystals is especially advantageous for study of visible and ultraviolet spectra
of charge transfer transitions in metal complexes be- cause of their normally
high intensities and high absorbancies. Two types of compouds to be studied are:
(1) model compounds which mimic the binuclear metalloenzymes of copper and iron,
such as hemocyanin and hemerythrin, and (2) partially oxidized metalloporphyrins
which stack in such a manner so as to conduct electricity through the metal
spine or through the pi-systems of the parallel macrocycles. The relative energy
levels of metal- and ligand-based orbitals subject to partial oxidation and
conductive band formation, as well as the electronic structure changes which
occur upon aggregation of the discrete molecules into chains, will be
determined. A special component of this research project will be heavy
involvement of undergraduates.
