This interdisciplinary award to Ya-Ping Sun at Clemson University is supported
by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the Solid-State
Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research. The focus of the
research is the design and synthesis of fullerene materials and polymers with
nonlinear optical properties. The photophysical and absorptive properties of
mono- and polyfunctionalized C60 derivatives, and polymers with pendant
fullerene groups will be investigated, directed towards developing
intramolecular triplet energy donor-acceptor dyads as strong nonlinear
absorbers. Specifically, dyads employing (60)-fullerene, porphyrins, and
metallophthalocyanines as the donors and beta-carotene, diphenylhexadecaoctaenes
and their derivatives as acceptors will be prepared and evaluated. Optical
limiting will be the primary application investigated for the polymeric
fullerene materials. This research will advance the development of materials for
optical, electro-optical, acousto-optical and optomechanical devices for
applications such as optical limiting, storage, and switching and will increase
our understanding of the chemistry and photophysics of fullerene materials and
polymers.
