The PI will investigate the growth rate of the magnetic field in a smooth steady
flow of an electrically conducting fluid in the limit of high magnetic Reynolds
number. The methods from Geometric Measure Theory and Dynamical Systems provide
an estimate from above and possibly an explicit formula for this quantity which
is a central problem of "Fast Dynamo" theory. He proposes to study the
completeness of a system of Floquet root vectors in time-periodic problems of
fluid dynamics. If such a system indeed exists, it would mean that the magnetic
field in a time-periodic flow of a conducting fluid cannot decay
superexponentially and the same fact is true for small oscillations in a viscous
fluid. He will continue the research on the "geometric instability theory" for
the Euler equation which would allow treatment of flows of an ideal fluid with
singularities. The Dynamo problem concerns the process of a magnetic field
generation by the motion of a highly conducting fluid. This process is
responsible for the existence of the magnetic field of the Earth, solar magnetic
field and magnetic fields in astrophysics. It also can be achieved in laboratory
although experimental difficulties are considerable. The suggested mathematical
study sheds light on the process of "fast" (most efficient) generation of the
magnetic field. This "fast" process takes place on a time scale many orders of
magnitude less than the time of Ohmic decay of the magnetic field. Another line
of research is the investigation of hydrodynamic instability using ideas from
dynamo theory. General conditions for instability of fluid flows are of
fundamental importance in the areas of fluid and aerodynamics.
