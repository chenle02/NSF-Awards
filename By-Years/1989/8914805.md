Scientists from developing countries will participate in a series of scientific
planning meetings and workshops during 1989 and 1990 under the sponsorship of
the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR). Their participation will
permit increased interaction between these scientists and colleagues from the
U.S. and other major countries sponsoring basic research. The meetings involved
will include those of various SCOR working groups, including those dealing with
photosynthetic pigments in seawater, wave modelling, experimental ecosystems,
phase transfer processes in cycling of trace metals in estuaries, polar deep-
sea environments, and hydrothermal emanations at plate boundaries, and meetings
of SCOR standing committees on climate change and global ocean fluxes as well.
This increased interaction will foster increased cooperation in joint research
projects in the areas identified and others.
