This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two years. The
project is entitled "Isolation and Identification of the Transposase Gene from
the Mutator Strain of Zea mays". The Research Fellowships in Plant Biology are
granted to applicants trained in traditional areas of plant biology who wish to
extend their training in new techniques and to those trained in molecular or
cellular techniques who wish to gain experience working with plants. These
fellowships are designed to increase the number of outstanding young scientists
in plant biology.
