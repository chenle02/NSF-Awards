Seismologists have predicted that a severe earthquake in the Istanbul region is
highly likely in the next 30 years. This forecast has drawn much attention in
the media and raises challenges as to how potential losses may be reduced by
protective measures. Decisions made by private individuals, by officials, and by
engineers and builders are all relevant to this question. The principles
underlying protective decision making need to be better understood, for the sake
of this and many other applications.

We investigate how people determine whether to purchase insurance and/or invest
in loss-reduction measures against risks from fire, theft, accidents or natural
disasters. We examine the effects of different ways in which risks can be
communicated and different frames in which information and choices can be
presented; we also examine how protective decisions are affected by
instructional modules that aid understanding of probability and that suggest
useful general strategies for framing decisions. To estimate these effects,
controlled laboratory experiments, field surveys and interviews will be
conducted both in the United States and in Turkey.
