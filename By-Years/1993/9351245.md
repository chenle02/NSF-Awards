The project will acquire a Fourier Transform NMR spectrometer to be used in
laboratory curriculum development. New experiments will be introduced across the
curriculum including an introductory experiment for the freshman majors' lab,
correlation spectroscopy at the sophomore level and unique investigations of the
spectra of methylated tellurium compounds and palladium-gold cluster compounds
in the advanced lab. The programs will prepare students for graduate work or
industrial employment in chemistry.
