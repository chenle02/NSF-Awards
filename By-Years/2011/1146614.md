The goal of this project is to identify factors that contribute to the evolution
of large brains. The idea that the evolution of large brains is the result of
selection pressures derived from living in complex social or physical
environments is tested in carnivore member species. Here, the social brain
hypothesis which proposes that the cognitive abilities resulting from social
living are related to the evolution of large brains including the expansion of
the frontal lobes is evaluated. In addition, other factors such as home range
size, tree dwelling and food seeking styles are assessed. A primary goal of this
project is to analyze carnivore skulls using computed tomography (CT) to create
endocasts (a virtual brain). The analysis will evaluate the relationship between
brain size including regional volumes and various measures of social, behavioral
and environmental complexity both across and within species in 4 carnivore
families. This data set is unique as most studies examine only a few species and
often report on a small sample size of each species. These studies will identify
the factors that contribute to the evolution of large brains in carnivores. By
understanding the evolution of the brain, we might better understand how the
human brain works and determine whether brains of particular non-human animals
might serve as useful models for studies of the human brain. &lt;br/&gt;This
project will also provide neuroscience training opportunities for undergraduate
and graduate students. The project will yield a unique brain data set including
both a range of rarely studied species and a large sample size of selected
species. Importantly, these data have significant potential to influence the
field as a resource for other researchers interested in utilizing this carnivore
brain data set in developing new ideas of brain evolution and function. The
brain volume data will ultimately be accessible through an arrangement with the
Comparative Mammalian Brain Collection Website (www.brainmuseum.org).
