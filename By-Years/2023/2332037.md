CREST HBCU-RISE: Center for AI/ML Research and Education

With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology
HBCU Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (CREST HBCU-RISE), this
project aims to increase Meharry Medical Collegeâ€™s (MMC) data science research
capacity by creating a Center for AI/ML Research and Education and a PhD program
in Data Science. This will significantly contribute to increasing the diversity
of individuals with a doctoral degree in data science and AI/ML prepared for
both industry and academics careers. The cutting-edge research conducted for
their doctoral degrees will advance our knowledge in key areas important to the
nation and society.

This project has four objectives: (1) enhance research infrastructure by
upgrading the MMC data center with high-performance computing and networking
capabilities; (2) establish a new Doctorate degree program in Data Science at
MMC; (3) recruit high caliber faculty and scientists with expertise in AI/ML and
data science research; and (4) increase the number of students from
underrepresented minorities and women who attain a Doctorate in data science.
The project will enroll twelve students into the new PhD program in data science
in two cohorts of six students each. The knowledge gained from this project will
be disseminated broadly to a community of scientists and engineers. The Centers
of Research Excellence in Science and Technology HBCU Research Infrastructure
for Science and Engineering (CREST HBCU-RISE) program supports the expansion of
institutional research capacity as well as the successful training of doctoral
students, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM at HBCUs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
