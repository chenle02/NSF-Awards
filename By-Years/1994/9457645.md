The use of adaptive and learing strategies in engineering systems is important
for several reasons including increased robustness against changes in operating
conditions and errors in data and modeling, reduced need for explicit
programming, and improved performance over time. However, although such
strategies have been widely used and studied, certain basic questions such as
"What are optimal strategies for adaptation?" and "How much data is required?"
remain largely unanswered. Therefore, the design of adaptive and learning
systems is generally done in an ad hoc manner with little experience gained from
on e application to the next. furthermore, very few performance guarantees can
be provided for the algorithms used. The goal of this research is to contribute
to the theoretical foundations of adaptive and learning systems. Some particular
topics to be pursued include the analysis of estimation and adaptive control
algorithms under arbitrary disturbances, the study of fundamental limitations in
system identification, and understanding the role of prior uncertainty and
feedback in determining system performance. The primary goal is to obtain
results on the fundamental capabilities and limitations of adaptive and learning
systems in order to allow more principled design and analysis of such systems.
