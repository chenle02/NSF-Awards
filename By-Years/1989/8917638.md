With this and a companion grant to the Yale Southern Observatory, Inc. Dr. Van
Altena will continue with the measurement and analysis of the photographic
plates obtained for the Southern Proper Motion (SPM) program at the Yale
Southern Observatory at El Leoncito, Argentina. The positions and absolute
proper motions of approximately 1000 stars per field will be measured with
respect to faint galaxies. A new Yale Zone Catalog of faint star coordinates
will be initiated which will provide a network of secondary standards down to
the 18th magnitude. The primary use of the SPM proper motions is for research on
galactic structure, while the Yale Zone Catalog will provide faint standards for
use in determining the coordinates of objects in the very small fields of large
reflector telescopes.
