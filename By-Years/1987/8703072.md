Work will be directed at problems arising in the theories of several complex
variables and harmonic analysis. The research represents a continuation of
earlier investigations following three themes: convolution equations,
interpolation problems and ideals generated by exponential polynomials. The
background for problems of convolution and interpolation can be traced to
fundamental questions of convolutions of a single function by a collection of
measures vanishing simultaneously, and whether the system can be analyzed
through the joint spectrum of the measures' Fourier transforms. Work on such
questions led to conditions which, while correct, are not easily verified. The
principal investigator will pursue several concrete-type criteria on which there
has already been partial success. One particular impediment leads to a number-
theoretic question which estimates the distance between roots of exponential
polynomials. Some progress has been made here which may lead to applications to
delay-type partial differential equations. A different type of convolution
problem which appears in other contexts is that of the Pompeiu problem. In its
rudimentary form, the problem concerns integrals of an unknown function taken
over some geometric shape as the shape (or shapes) are moved by rigid motions.
Whether or not one can recover the function from these calculations is a deep
question whose resolution is known only in cases involving considerable
symmetry. The principal investigator has expanded his work to the setting of
manifolds (symmetric spaces). He has shown that the question of failure of the
Pompeiu problem is directly related to a Neumann boundary value problem for an
elliptic partial differential equation. While there are many applications of the
result, a condition is imposed on the manifolds - they must be of rank 1. Work
will be done in easing this requirement. This research has close connections to
tomographic investigations.
