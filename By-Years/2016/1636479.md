This Innovation Corps Project focuses on a technology to reduce the impacts of
age-related macular degeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Degradation of the
photoreceptor cells of the retina is a symptom of various underlying conditions,
such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and
diabetic retinopathy (DR). As the American population ages, AMD is expected to
reduce the mobility and quality of life for large population of citizens. These
diseases impact nearly 15 million Americans and there are few options to slow
vision loss and no direct treatments. The proposed technology, the Molecular
Artificial Retina (MAR), is a potential treatment for these conditions and
offers great hope to people who have lost one of the most important senses for
mobility and independence. The technology acts to make cells in the retina more
sensitive to less light. Current treatment is limited to nutrition and
behavioral changes to slow progression. The anticipated mode of delivery is an
injectable; that is, injected into the photoreceptor-degenerate eye to embed in
the membrane of surviving retinal neurons, imparting light
sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the NSF I-Corps program, this I-Corps
team will identify and establish relationships with potential partners across
the medical field. The team's goal is to reach the final stage of
commercialization, involving manufacturing, clinician/patient marketing, and
distribution. The team anticipates generating revenues from three distinct
customer segments: 1) from patients who purchase the proposed treatment out-of-
pocket; 2) from doctors (in particular ophthalmologists) who use the proposed
treatment and seek reimbursement from private medical insurance; and 3) from
doctors who seek reimbursement from Medicare.
