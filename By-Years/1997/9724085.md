ABSTRACT The major events of the cell division cycle, DNA synthesis and
mitosis, are triggered by 'cyclin-dependent kinases' (CDK's): a family of
enzymes whose activity and specificity depend on their binding to various
cyclins. CDK activity is also regulated by phosphorylation and by binding to
inhibitory proteins. These regulatory proteins interact with each other in a
complex web of biochemical reactions and feedback signals, to generate an
orderly progression of the cell cycle. So far, characterization of this
regulatory system has been reductionistic: breaking the network into its
constituent pieces and determining which pieces interact. Rigorous mathematical
methods are being developed to assemble the pieces into a coherent model of the
intact regulatory system, so that predictions can be compared qualitatively with
experimental observations about the physiology and genetics of the organisms.
Using standard methods of dynamical systems theory, the investigators are
constructing comprehensive, accurate, and predictive. Mathematical models of the
cell cycle in yeast cells and frog embryos. The human genome project promises to
deliver a rich stream of information about the genes and proteins that govern
all our physiological affairs. Complementing extensive research on the
'informational' aspects of genome analysis (storage and retrieval, sequence
comparison, structural predictions) this project addresses a new level of
'dynamical' questions: how do molecules interact with one another in time and
space to produce the organized, functional behavior of living cells? Appropriate
mathematical and computational tools to answer this question are being developed
in the context of a specific physiological problem: cell growth and division. To
understand how cell proliferation is regulated would not be only a satisfying
achievement of basic science but also a breakthrough for clinical medicine. When
the signals that initiate or suppress cell division are understood, the means to
restrain the proliferation of cancer cells or to induce the regeneration of
nerve cells will become more apparent. This work is being funded by the
Computational Biology (BIO), Signal Transduction (BIO), and Mathematical Biology
(MPS) Programs.
