This project addresses an atmospheric chemical problem of great current
interest: To what extent is it possible to attribute locally observed pollutant
burdens to their remote origins, whether in terms of regional or source-type
origins? By associating day-to-day chemical data taken at the receptor sites
with concomitant meteorological variables, this new project will apply
statistical techniques in an effort to correlate concentrations of pollutant
species with their atmospheric transport patterns and remote origins. For
resolving the remote source contributions to locally deposited pollutants, the
project seeks to identify relative concentration patterns of pollutant elements
that can be shown to be characteristic of trace element emissions in different
types of regional sources. This approach is aided by existing knowledge of
certain "marker" elements associated with particular types of sources. The
statistical analysis is structured to reveal groupings of chemical and physical
elements characteristic of source types.
