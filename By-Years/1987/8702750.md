This project provides for the purchase of a large (200 liter) fermenter to
complement smaller fermenters already available at the University of Arizona, as
well as support for an initial exploratory study of oxygen transport. The
fermenter allows studies of scale effects in fermenter operation under various
conditions. In particular, research is underway to study the spatial
distribution of mixing and transport in fermenters leading to a sound foundation
for fermenter design. Several studies have shown that poor distribution of
oxygen and nutrient substrates can reduce cell growth rate and yield of desired
product, particularly proteins. In order to achieve optimum mixing rates which
do not rupture the cells, it is necessary to know how transport rates (ka),
mixing and shear are distributed in the vessel at various impeller rotation
rates and for various impeller designs. This will be achieved by measuring local
values of dissolved oxygen and oxygen content of gas bubbles at the same
locations to obtain a spatial distribution of each. Detailed determinations of
flow distributions of liquid and gas will then be used to compute local ka
distributions under various operating conditions and designs. As a result of
this research, scale-up will become more accurate, since distributions of ka
values and how they vary with scale will be available.
