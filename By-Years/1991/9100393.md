The aim of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the
metabolism and function of Vitamin D-3. The goal of the work outlined is to
whether vitamin-binding proteins of liver cytosol are unique in binding
properties, and stimulatory to metabolism of the vitamin by liver microsomes.
Isolation, purification, and identification of vitamin-binding proteins from
liver cytosol will be undertaken by conventional approaches, the purified
components will be assessed for metabolism-stimulation, and details of the
binding properties of the proteins will be determined. The distribution of
these, or similar proteins in a variety of tissues will be studied using
specific antibodies generated against the purified components.
