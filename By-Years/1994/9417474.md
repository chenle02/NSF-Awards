9417474 Thompson There are a number of important national programs and a variety
of industrial application today that require the use or monitoring of radiation
in the ultraviolet and even shorter wavelengths. The need for high accuracy
radiometry in this region of the spectrum is becoming increasingly urgent. In
response to this, a workshop with multiagency co-sponsorship will address
measurement, instrumentation, and standards necessary for absolute measurements
of irradiance and radiance. The goals of the workshop will be to identify the
needs of the UV measurement communities, to compile a list of specific
recommendations to improve the nations UV measurement capabilities, and to
determine agencies' role in supporting these efforts. In addition, the workshop
will showcase the measurement needs for biological UV-B effects and for long-
term solar UV-B monitoring. The proceeding of the workshop will be published as
a National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication. ***
