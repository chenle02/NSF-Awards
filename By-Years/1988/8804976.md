This proposal requests funds to support a collaborative effort by Memphis State
University (MSU) and Cornell University (CU) to exploit the success of the PANDA
digital (1) continue analysis of the flood of high quality digital data from the
ongoing San Juan, Argentina array experiment in the region of flat subduction,
and (2) relocate and operate the PANDA array across the edge of one of the
world's outstanding plateau uplifts, the central Andean Altiplano-Puna, located
above the more steeply dipping segment of the subducted Nazca Plate. The
enormous quantity of new, high quality data demands innovative methods of
analysis and promises new insights into crustal and lithospheric structure and
seismicity.
