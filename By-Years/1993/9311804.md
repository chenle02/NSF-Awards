Adelie penguin colonies have an internal structure consisting of a variety of
distinct subcolonies. These subcolonies increase or decrease in size relatively
independent from variations in the colony as a whole. The purpose of this
project is to investigate the dynamics of subcolony size at several large
breeding colonies of Adelie penguins in the Ross Sea, and evaluate the factors
that cause such variation. It is important to understand what causes these
sometimes-contradictory patterns in order to understand the dynamics of penguin
populations as a whole. Observations at the northern colony at Cape Bird
indicate that ice conditions and disturbance by visitors are significant factors
that affect subcolony size. These factors will be addressed specifically. In
addition, methods of digital image analysis will be used to ease the process of
counting penguins from aerial photos. This research will raise the
sophistication of our understanding of penguin population dynamics and also
introduce more automated methods for evaluating populations. Both these goals
are of considerable importance to current major interests in Antarctic biology.
