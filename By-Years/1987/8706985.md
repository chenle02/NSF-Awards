Although numerous theories for the origins of the Ichthyosauria have been
proposed, their relationship to other reptilian orders has never been
satisfactorily resolved. This study will improve on previous work by (1)
emphasizing features of Triassic species, which, surprisingly, were ignored by
most hypotheses of ichthyosaurian affinities, and (2) examining a wider range of
morphologic characters. An osteological study of Triassic ichthyosaurs will
document the distribution of derived and primitive characteristics among these
species. A comparative study with other early reptilian taxa will suggest
affinities for the ichthyosaurs based on a wide range of morphologic features.
Tooth form, general body shape, and the morphology of the axial skeleton and
limbs will provide evidence for the prey preference and swimming capabilities of
individual species. These data will be used to evaluate the range of predator
types among the Triassic ichthyosaurs. Finally, a phylogeny for the Triassic
ichthyosaurs will be proposed.
