This research will formulate and estimate a dynamic model of the engineering
labor market since 1950, based on a model of stock-flow adjustment of engineers
to changing market conditions. It will use annual Current Population Survey data
special tabulations (adjusted for age and other characteristics) to investigate
how expected career earnings prospects in engineering compared with other
occupations determine entry decisions. It will also investigate the effects of
changing demand conditions on entry, using such variables as research and
development spending and overall level of economic activity and national defense
expenditures. It will also examine the effect of changing cohort sizes for the
period 1950 to 1990.//
