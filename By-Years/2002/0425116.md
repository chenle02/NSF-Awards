ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Clarkson,
Gavin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF-0425116&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Patent
Informatics for Patent Thicket Detection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patent thickets
are dense webs of overlapping intellectual property rights. In order to
commercialize new technology, an organization must understand the components of
the thicket. Cumulative innovation in an industry can lead to blocking patents
that effectively stifle innovation. Patent pools, an organizational structure
where firms can aggregate patent rights into a package for licensing, can work
in these circumstances, but may face antitrust challenges. New antitrust
guidelines now permit these patent pools in certain circumstances where they are
seen as pro-competitive, but there is no methodology for objectively identifying
and measuring thickets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patent pools are hypothesized to
arise when patent thickets already exist. Analyzing pools might provide insight
into the identification and measurement of thickets. The research utilizes
network analysis and comparison of large networks in order to provide insight
into circumstances in which thickets can be the basis for pro-competitive patent
pools. The work is exploratory in that the patent networks are very large. The
preliminary effort has involved modifying standard network density equations to
correct for temporal constraints in patents, and a measure of patent network
density has been developed. It will be validated and expanded. The work will
contribute to the study of large networks and the resulting tool should be
useful in the process of technology search. A number of patent pools in
technology will provide the data for analysis and testing of candidate
techniques for network analysis. The targets include MPEG-4, MP3, DVD Player and
DVD Disc, as well as others. &lt;br/&gt;
