0200054&lt;br/&gt;Black&lt;br/&gt;This award to Bermuda Biological Station for
Research provides instrumentation to expand the oceanographic research
capabilities of the research vessel Weatherbird II, a ship operated by BBSR as
part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet. The acoustic current profiler and attitude determination unit will be a
shared-use capablity that will enable all researchers using the ship to measure
ocean currents in the upper few hundred meters of the water column while the
vessel is both underway and on station. Funds have previously been provided to
build a well in the vessel to house the current profiler, and it can be
installed without requiring drydocking. These improvements will be of
substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research
during 2002 and future years. They will provide an important new and routine set
of measurements of currents to augment the long time-series data on water and
atmospheric properties collected in the vicinity of
Bermuda.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
