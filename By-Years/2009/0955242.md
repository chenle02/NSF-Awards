In this CAREER project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and
Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Electronic and Photonic
Materials Program of the Division of Materials Research, John Grey of the
University of New Mexico will study the fundamental chemistry and materials
science of conducting polymers used in photovoltaic devices. A range of
microscopy and spectroscopic characterization methods will be used to study
conducting polymers in different environments ranging from single polymer chains
up to thin films. The aim is to understand how polymer conformations influence
aggregation properties in bulk materials that affects the device performance.
The educational plan focuses on improving programming skills at the
undergraduate chemistry course level, developing a graduate level nanoscience
course, and participating in outreach programs to local Native American groups.
This work will enhance our fundamental understanding of organic photovoltaic
materials and lead to more rational ways to process these materials during
device fabrication. Ultimately, this work could lead to less expensive and more
efficient solar energy collection devices.
