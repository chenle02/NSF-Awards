This EAGER project focuses on the development of tools for simplifying the
representation of complex atmospheric chemical reactions in air quality and
climate models. Several mathematical techniques will be used to develop and
assess reduced-complexity representations of atmospheric chemical mechanisms to
enhance the research communityâ€™s ability to study atmospheric chemistry and the
role it plays in causing air pollution and climate change. This effort is
expected to provide new tools and approaches to characterizing, utilizing, and
understanding complex chemical systems in the
atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two science objectives for this proposed
work are: (1) to quantify the structural and dynamical properties of atmospheric
chemical reaction mechanisms using novel graph theoretical techniques to enable
new scientific insights; and (2) to apply these graph theoretical techniques to
support the development and assessment of reduced-form models of atmospheric
chemistry, leveraging both traditional graph clustering methods and modern graph
machine learning. The first objective will use techniques including motif
analysis, path and cycle analysis, and network robustness metrics, while the
second objective will use Louvain clustering and graph machine learning
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal meets the EAGER criteria because
the application of methods derived from graph theory to atmospheric chemical
mechanisms development and evaluation is largely untested and has the potential
to transform our ability to understand complex and reduced-form chemical
mechanisms. The current process of developing and evaluating atmospheric
chemical mechanisms is complex, time consuming, and contains substantial
subjective decision making. By taking established methods from graph theory,
this work could provide new tools and new approaches to characterizing,
utilizing, and understanding complex chemical systems. This project is a high-
risk, high-reward project as the methods proposed have only been applied to
chemical mechanisms in preliminary work and so the success of the proposed work
is difficult to predict. This effort has the potential to provide transformative
tools that could further our understanding of existing and to-be-developed
atmospheric chemical mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
