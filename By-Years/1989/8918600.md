This award in the Organic Dynamics Program provides support for the continuing
research of Dr. William C. Agosta at The Rockefeller University. Dr. Agosta's
investigation will focus on the preparation of unique, highly strained organic
molecules called fenestranes and on the characterizaiton of high-energy species
that are generated by the irradiation of organic molecules with ultraviolet
light. Dr. Agosta will continue his efforts at the synthesis of new fenestranes,
which will provide a better understanding of chemical reactivity in molecules
with unusual bond lengths and angles. Work will also continue on the reactivity
of photochemically generated biradicals, and he will study the photochemistry of
nitrogen aromatics, placing particular emphasis on the characterization of the
different triplet states that are formed upon irradiation.
