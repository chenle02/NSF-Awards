DMI-9727809 Moon The goal of this project is to develop a low dimensional
mathematical model based on experimental observation and to use chaos control
techniques to quench the subcritical nature of the chatter. The research will
use experimental and mathematical methods to obtain nonlinear models for tool
vibration, including the effects of tool motion, velocity and thermal effects.
The unique feature of this research project is the use of concepts of chaos
theory and nonlinear dynamics in developing new tool chatter diagnostics as well
as chaos control techniques to quench chatter behavior in cutting dynamics.
Further evidence will be gathered for a theory in an earlier research which
indicates that chaotic dynamics is present in normal or non-chatter cutting of
metals. As part of the nonlinear modeling, methods will be developed to predict
and avoid subcritical chatter behavior. Basic mechanics of thermoplasticity and
fracture mechanics will be incorporated in the model development. Partnership
with both machine tool users and manufacturers will be sought. The research will
develop a new understanding about nonlinear cutting dynamics, which will likely
result in new tool design methods for industry. It may result in mathematical
tools which help manufacturers predict, avoid or control tool vibrations in
cutting of metals and nonmetals to improve surface quality.
