9418345 Messina This Metacenter Regional Alliance (MRA) will provide high speed
access to advanced HPCC resources, will further the metasupercomputing paradigm,
will stimulate the use of HPCC and NII technologies in industry and education,
and will investigate technologies and tools in support of NII services. The Los
Angeles Regional Gigabit Environment (LARGE) will concentrate on selected
academic and industrial partners who can benefit from immediate access to the
metacenter, and to he resources at Caltech. A major focus will be helping users,
especially industrial partners, access the computing and communications
facilities in the metacenter and Caltech. The industrial partners include both
users of high performance computing systems and independent software vendors who
develop software for such systems. LARGE will provide: - access to the advanced
facilities of the metacenter and Caltech, including the scalable I/O initiative
- gigabit speed access between Caltech, the San Diego Supercomputing Center, and
other MRA partners - expertise on the use of scalable parallel processors for
advanced simulation and modeling in science, engineering, and industry
Collaborative research projects will be carried out with the metacenter on
heterogeneous computing across high speed, wide area networks, on high
performance I/O systems, and on adapting software tools, e.g., visualization
tools, for use on the metacenter's advanced computers to support the
functionality of industrial partners. LARGE will contribute to the NII by
exploring technologies needed to support NII applications, such s high speed,
high capacity data storage systems, and tele-collaboration environments that
operate on low speed and high speed connections.
