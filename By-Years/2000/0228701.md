Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Defensive mimicry systems are typically categorized into two
types: Batesian, involving a defenseless mimic and a defended model, or
Mullerian, involving two or more defended co-models. More recent theoretical
treatments of mimicry predict that the nature of a single mimicry system may
vary over space and time. In this proposal, the work incorporates both the
phenology and the geography of three butterfly species to assess the dynamics of
two well-known mimicry systems: the viceroy/monarch system and the
viceroy/queen. While these systems were originally classified as Batesian
mimicry, accumulating evidence suggests that the viceroy is often unpalatable to
avian predators, while the models, the monarch and queen, can often be
palatable. Thus, the viceroy mimicry complex may span the continuum with roles
of model and mimic changing through space and time. This work will document the
chemistry responsible for unpalatability, spatial and temporal variation in
chemical defense of the three butterfly species, and variation in palatability
to vertebrate and invertebrate predators.
