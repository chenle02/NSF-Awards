Greene OCE-9530777 The PI proposes to purchase shipboard instrumentation in
support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V
POINT SUR, a 135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the
University. Instrumentation requested includes an uninterruptable power supply
(UPS), a themosalinograph, an altimer, upgrades for a CTD system, and a large
volume trace metal free rosette system. Most of the instrumentation requested is
required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the POINT SUR during 1996 and
will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future. The trace
metal free rosette system is requested as a replacement for one that was lost
during a JGOFS cruise in the Arabian Sea.
