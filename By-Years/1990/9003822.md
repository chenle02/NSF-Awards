This award is for support of the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of
Dr. Noam Elkies of Harvard University. Dr. Elkies proposes to continue his
studies of the arithmetic of supersingular curves over function fields with
finite constant field; by looking closely at these, he has already discovered
sphere packings in certain high-dimensional Euclidean spaces that are more dense
than any previously known. In addition, Dr. Elkies plans to investigate explicit
modular equations from a computational viewpoint and connect these with the
abstract theory of heights. This is research in the field of arithmetic
algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry
and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as
divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects, seemingly so
far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the earliest times, but in
the past quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The field
of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern
mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.
