1159466/ Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The overall objective
of the proposed project is to develop DNA-linked collagen hydrogels whose
remodeling by fibroblast cells will stimulate DNA release and efficient gene
delivery. Ultimately, these novel scaffolds will be used to trigger robust (and
low cost) in situ expression of growth factors (GFs) to enable healing of
chronic wounds and other damaged tissues. In the proposed approach, collagen
scaffolds will be modified with plasmid DNAs by newly linking DNA-binding
peptides (DBPs) and collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs) with previously established
capacities for gene transfer (DBPs) and collagen modification (CMPs). The
proposed work will test the following hypotheses: (1) native collagen remodeling
processes involving collagen degradation [by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)]
and collagen endocytosis [by alpha2 beta1 integrins and caveolin-1] will trigger
the release and endocytosis of collagen-linked DNA "polyplexes"; (2) collagen
linkage will initiate DNA trafficking through efficient gene delivery routes
involving caveolin-1. Completion of the proposed aims should provide
fundamentally new strategies to understand and direct gene delivery, and in the
long term, will foster new materials and therapeutic strategies in tissue
repair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Given the wealth of target GFs and
the widespread use of collagen-based materials, the proposed studies will
advance the use of collagen-mediated gene delivery not only in chronic wound
repair, but also in multiple other applications such as implant
functionalization and regenerative medicine. The proposed efforts are also
designed to provide new research and career development opportunities, including
industrial mentorship, for undergraduates, high school interns, and
underrepresented groups, by building on existing undergraduate research and
outreach infrastructure at UD, as well as on previous educational activities of
Kiick and Sullivan.
