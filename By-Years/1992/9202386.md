This proposal describes studies on cellular components that are involved in
harvesting the energy of sunlight and making that energy useful for the
production of sugars and carbohydrates in the cell. The organism being
investigated is in the group of algae known as diatoms and is named
Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Diatoms are very abundant in both marine and fresh
water environments. In fact, these organisms may be responsible for as much as
20% of the total CO2 fixation on the earth. We have been studying both the
structure of the light harvesting polypeptides of Phaeodactylum and the way in
which they are targeted from the cytoplasm of the cell to their final location
in the cell plastid, an extremely important organelle specialized to perform
photosynthesis. By understanding how proteins can be specifically placed into
different subcellular compartments like the plastid, we may be able to control
both the constituents and the levels of specific constituents that are located
in those compartments. This may prove very important in increasing the
photosynthetic capabilities of organisms and ultimately in culturing these
organisms in 'ocean field' (aquaculture) for the production of feed for
livestock.
