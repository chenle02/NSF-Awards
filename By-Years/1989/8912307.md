The Granite Mountain Reserve's (GMR) topographic relief and ecotonal location
in the eastern Mojave Desert account for an exceptionally diverse arid-zone
flora and fauna with elements from several biogeographic sources. The area has
long attracted field research, and GMR now supports 19 projects concentrated in
behavior, ecology, physiology, and evolution. Present research is constrained by
an almost complete lack of living and laboratory facilities. A growing demand
for pristine and protected sites in arid habitats of the southwest, due to
converging trends of population increase, habitat loss, and interest in
desertification, further indicates the value of establishing a stand-alone field
research station at GMR. This project,coupled with matching funds from the
University, will allow construction of: 1) a basic laboratory with equipment for
shared use, 2) housing for up to 6 researchers, 3) a campground for visiting
researchers, and 4) utilities for the above. These facilities will allow a
broader range of research activities, boost efficiency and productivity, and
establish GMR as a cost-effective site for a variety of modern field studies.
The Granite Mountains Reserve is among the most recently established of the 26
University of California Natural Reserves, whose goal is to facilitate education
and research of scientists from all disciplines and institutions.
