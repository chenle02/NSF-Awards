This project enhances computer and electrical engineering courses at this
institution. Modular microcomputer systems and associated development hardware
provide a high degree of configuration flexibility for use in both electrical
engineering and computer engineering. The support equipment for this project
includes personal computers that are utilized for digital logic design
capability using programmable logic devices, for digital simulation, for
software development and in-circuit-emulation. Using this lab, students
experience the complete (hardware and software) design cycle from conception
through design refinement and debugging, to the realization of a functional
stand-alone embedded computer system. This award is being matched by an equal
sum from the grantee.
