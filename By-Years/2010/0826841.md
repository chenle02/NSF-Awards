The research goal of this project is to uncover the underlying interaction
mechanisms between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and DNA molecules through an
integrated experimental and modeling approach. DNA-CNT complexes, benefiting
from both the unique electro-mechanical properties of CNTs and the specific
molecular recognition capabilities of the immobilized single-stranded DNA, hold
great promise for bio-molecular detection and gene delivery applications.
Despite considerable prior experimental efforts, the DNA-CNT interface is still
poorly understood, greatly limiting the reliability and the efficiency of such
novel applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will significantly
enhance our current knowledge of the DNA-CNT interface, and will pave the way
toward the realization of high-sensitivity miniaturized DNA-CNT based
biosensors. The complementary educational plan will greatly increase both the
general public's awareness of nanotechnology-based biomedical applications and
the participation of young investigators in the exciting field of
nanobiotechnology.
