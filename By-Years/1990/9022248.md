The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Stanford University supports
interactive and interdisciplinary materials research in three primary thrust
areas. Researchers in the polymers thrust are studying polymer structure and
dynamics using optical techniques; emphasis is being placed on increasingly
complex materials, and an expert in chemical synthesis has joined the group. The
thrust program on superconducting materials focuses on the preparation of high-
temperature superconducting materials in a variety of ways and on understanding
the behavior of these materials. Researchers in the surface structure and
reactivity group, in a collaborative effort with IBM Almaden, are investigating
the structure, mobility and reactivity of adsorbates on surfaces, using
spectroscopic techniques with a strong emphasis on synchrotron radiation. The
Stanford MRL places a strong emphasis on the development, operation and
maintenance of major central research facilities in materials preparation and
characterization. It also provides seed funding for exploratory research;
supports initiatives to broaden the participation of women and minorities in
materials research; and fosters research participation by undergraduates. The
program currently involves 26 faculty members and senior personnel from eight
academic departments, 3 postdoctoral research associates, 50 graduate students
and 13 undergraduates, and supporting scientific and clerical staff. The
Stanford MRL is directed by Professor Stig B. Hagstrom.
