This project is establishing a pulsed dye laser laboratory in the chemistry
undergraduate teaching laboratory building. One Nd-YAG pump laser is being
purchased to provide power sufficient for three student dye laser stations and
for optical mixing experiments. Several new experiments in
fluorescence/phosphorescence spectroscopy, kinetics, and nonlinear spectroscopy
are being developed for junior and senior level courses. Of special note, the
new system makes possible two-photon absorption processes and coherent Raman
studies of molecular vibrations and rotations. The stations utilize digital
oscilloscopes interfaced to PC's for data collection and analysis.
Undergraduates benefit from useful hands-on experience in modern chemical
applications of lasers and digital instrumentation.
