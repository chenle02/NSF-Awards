ABSTRACT --- CTS-9308664 Application of electric and magnetic fields to enhance
bulk mixing of reactants in diffusion controlled burning to improve combustion
is proposed. Numerical modeling will be developed to substantiate preliminary
experiments and additional experimentation is proposed. Alkali metal seeding
will be used to enhance the electrical conductivity of the flame and therefore,
the Lorentz body forces acting on the flame. A novel optical spectroscopic
technique for temperature measurement is also proposed making use of the seed
alkali metal.
