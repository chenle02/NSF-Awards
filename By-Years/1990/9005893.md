The PI's propose to continue the development of scanning x-ray microscopy and
Gabor holography using undulator radiation at the National Synchrotron Light
Source (NSLS). During the past three years, in collaboration with colleagues
from the NSLS, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, and IBM, the researchers have
developed, instrumented and commissioned the soft x-ray undulator beamline X-1A,
along with the apparatus for scanning transmission microscope (STXM) and Gabor
holography. The experimental program using these instruments has started. The
initial operating experience points up several areas where further development
will have a profound effect on the performance and usefulness of the facilities.
Some of these relate to improved resolution and increased capabilities of the
instruments, while others involve auxiliary studies to elucidate the range of
applications for biological research. In addition, the PIs plan to participate
in the user program, and more of their effort will be devoted to helping users
during their early experiments.
