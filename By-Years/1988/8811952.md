Hardware upgrades for LISP machines, and display equipment, will be provided
for researchers at the University of Maryland for research in the Department of
Computer Science. This equipment is provided under the Instrumentation Grants
for Research in Computer and Information Science and Engineering program. The
research for which the equipment is to be used will be in the areas of solid
modeling, feature-based modeling, and artificial intelligence reasoning for
process planning.
