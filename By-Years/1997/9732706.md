9732706 Walden This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
Massachusetts will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on
R/V Atlantis, R/V Knorr and R/V Oceanus, the three research vessels operated by
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National
Oceanographic laboratory System research fleet. Specific instruments to acquired
include a CTD (conductivity- temperature-depth) system plus a suite of sensors
for use with it (altimeters, transmissometer, spare temperature and conductivity
sensors, PAR sensors and personal computer for data acquisition), a laptop
computer plus CD-ROM burners for data transfer for scientists, tube holders for
a multi- corer sampling system, a non-metal metering block for uncontaminated
water sampling, a portable van for use on board ship as a cold laboratory, and
three pumps for sampling uncontaminated seawater. The shared-use instrumentation
supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies from the WHOI
vessels throughout the world ocean in 1998 and in future years.
