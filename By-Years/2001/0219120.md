The project will investigate the impact of mesoscale motions on climate through
careful analysis of extended integrations of a state-of-the-art model having
very high horizontal and vertical resolution. Key issues in tropospheric-
stratospheric dynamics, including interaction of very disparate scales of
motion, will be addressed. Interest in more accurate modeling of the
stratospheric circulation has recently been rekindled by observational analysis
that suggests that a primary mode of tropospheric variability in the high
latitudes is influenced by the downward migration of annular anomalies from the
stratosphere. Dr. Hamilton will conduct a dynamically oriented diagnostic
analysis of the high-resolution general circulation model (GCM) integrations
completed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, Princeton. The
objective will be to understand the role of small-scale processes, including
gravity waves generated in the troposphere by deep convection, in the evolution
and maintenance of the stratospheric general circulation. This research will
lead to improved parameterization of small-scale processes in global climate
models, and advance the understanding and modeling of dynamical interactions of
the troposphere and stratosphere.
