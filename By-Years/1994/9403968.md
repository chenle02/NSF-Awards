thesis research dealt with biochemistry and physiology of chloroplast
metabolism. He will carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the
laboratory of Dr. William Adams at University of Colorado. The proposed research
is entitled "Assessing the role of active oxygen scavenging systems in
protection of plants against high light stress in their natural environment" The
postdoctoral experience will expand his scientific expertise to physiological
ecology. The research training plan includes 6 month visit to the Australian
