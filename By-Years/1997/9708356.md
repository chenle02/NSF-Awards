Dr. Thomas C. Flood, Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California,
is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division with a contribution for instrumentation from the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate for the study of the activation and functionalization of
hydrocarbons by soluble transition metal complexes. Investigations will focus on
alkene insertion and carbon-hydrogen activation through metal mediated oxidative
addition and electrophilic alkane metathesis. Using triamine-ligated complexes
of rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, and osmium, the influence of metal, oxidations
state, steric bulk, electronic effects of the ancillary ligands, alkyl group
structure, charge, and chelate ring size on these reactions will be assessed.
Amine ligation will be exploited to prepare high oxidation state and oxo species
that will display an enhanced ability to functionalize hydrocarbons. In all
cases reaction mechanisms will be analyzed. Chemical transformations of
hydrocarbons are the basis for much of our utilization of energy and material
natural resources, which are in turn an integral part of our economy and an
important source of our standard of living. Many transformations of hydrocarbons
are carried out through their interactions with metals and metal compounds. It
is a basic tenant of chemistry that a better understanding of mechanisms of
reactions will lead to improved methods for converting raw materials into
materials to improve our lives. Expressed as broadly as possible, it is the
purpose of the proposed research to enhance and extend our understanding of how
metal complexes can be used to manipulate the structures of hydrocarbons, which
should ultimately lead to enhanced availability of energy resources.
