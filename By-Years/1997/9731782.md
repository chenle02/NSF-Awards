9731782 Navrotsky The goal of this project entitled Energetics of Microporous
Materials is a fundamental understanding of the structure- stability-property
relations necessary for innovative synthesis, tailoring of properties, and
predicting long-term thermal stability and materials compatibility in complex
and useful systems. Despite their importance, the thermodynamic properties of
classes of materials such as zeolites are poorly known, and this project will
determine the energetics of zeolites and related materials using high-
temperature reaction calorimetry. %%% Zeolites and related microporous materials
form a large class of technologically important materials with applications in
catalysis, gas separations, ion exchange and sorption that impact many fields
important to society including the environment, energy, and national defense.
