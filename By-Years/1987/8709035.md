Plasma-surface interactions play an important role in a variety of industrial
applications of plasma physics, including plasma deposition and etching, surface
modification by plasma ion implantation, plasma switching devices, and the use
of thermal plasmas for materials processing and metallurgy, as well as in plasma
diagnostics using probes. A fundamental understanding of the interaction of the
plasma with the surface is required in order to optimize and develop these
techniques to their fullest potential. This grant will involve a theoretical and
numerical investigation of plasma-surface interactions, sheaths, and pre-sheaths
(both steady- state and time-dependent) using a kinetic description. In
particular, the role of Coulomb collisions and ion-neutral interactions in
affecting the flow of plasma to surfaces, the energy distribution of the ions
arriving at the surface, and the establishment of long-range electric fields in
the plasma as well as the electric field in the sheath itself, will be
investigated. It is planned to utilize a kinetic description in order to connect
to existing collisionless and fluid models for plasma-flow to the surface. The
work on time dependent effects will focus on RF sheaths and pre-sheaths when the
applied frequency is above and below the ion plasma frequency. This work will be
jointly supported by the Interfacial, Thermodynamics, and Transport Program
within the CBTE Division.
