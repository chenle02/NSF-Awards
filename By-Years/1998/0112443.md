The meeting entitled "Eighth International Meeting on Ciliate Molecular
Biology". will be held as a FASEB Conference at the Vermont Academy in Saxtons
River, Vermont, July 28- August 2, 2001. The meeting will bring together
researchers who employ molecular approaches for investigating diverse biological
problems using ciliated protozoa as their model system. The great value of
ciliates stems from their unusual genetic organization and extensive,
developmentally-programmed reorganization of the genome. These features have
provided remarkable insights into an array of fundamental chromosomal processes,
including the discovery of self-splicing RNA, telomeres and telomerase, and
chromatin remodeling by histone acetyltransferases. Recent advances, such as
targeted gene replacement by homologous recombination and antisense ribosomes
have been exploited to study a wide range of questions in cell and molecular
biology, ranging from telomeres and telomerase, to regulated protein secretion,
to tubulin modification during microtubule assembly. The pace of research has
quickened due to the development and dissemination of new experimental methods.
For this reason and others, the Ciliate Molecular Biology Meeting fills a
critical niche that is otherwise lacking in other scientific meetings. The 1999
meeting included a workshop for assessing practical issues and justification for
a Tetrahymena genome sequencing project. The Ciliate Molecular Biology meeting
will be organized into nine platform sessions and two poster sessions. Platform
sessions will cover leading edge research topics including chromatin remodeling,
telomeres and telomerase, DNA rearrangement, DNA replication, signal
transduction, the cytoskeleton, evolution and genome plasticity.
