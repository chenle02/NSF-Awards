Many modern and ancient mountain systems can be characterized as foreland fold-
thrust belts. These systems have major economic significance in that they are a
major habitat for oil and gas. Detachment folds are a common structure in these
terranes, but their abundance and overall significance are poorly known and
understood. This study will provide an in-depth analysis of the 3-D character of
these structure that will allow for the development of more complete models for
the formation of foreland fold-thrust belts.
