9316980 Mao The PIs will continue their systematic study of the equations of
state and elasticity of Earth Materials with diamond-anvil cells. They will use
synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques to determine lattice parameters and
molar volumes, and Brillouin spectroscopy to determine compressional and shear
wave velocities, both at high pressure and temperature. With recently
established experimental techniques, they will systematically acquire a
comprehensive and accurate database representative of realistic Earth
compositional models. They will continue to extend experimental capabilities of
accurate determinations of elastic properties to higher pressure and
temperature, and will conduct reconnaissance experiments at the extreme P-T
conditions of the lower mantle and core. The acquired database will be applied
to constrain structural, dynamic, and evolutionary models of the Earth's deep
interior. ****
