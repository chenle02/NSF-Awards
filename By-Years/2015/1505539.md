An international conference on K-theory, Cyclic Homology and Motives will be
held at Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey in New Brunswick, NJ from
August 19 through August 22, 2015. The conference will bring together senior
researchers from around the world with young mathematicians to exchange the most
recent developments in the field and facilitate scientific interaction. NSF
funds will support participants that do not have access to grant funds of their
own, with a particular emphasis on supporting the participation of graduate
students and recent graduates from groups underrepresented in the mathematical
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have recently been major advances in
several directions within the subject proposed for the conference, work which
has led to numerous new questions and research programs. Among these are: the
work on the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures and the new techniques introduced
for it, including a useable category of motives and motivic homotopy theory; the
introduction of algebraic cobordism and its use in proving degree formulas;
advances on and applications of trace methods; progress on the Farrell-Jones and
Baum-Connes isomorphism conjectures and applications in geometric topology. The
goal of the conference is to explore the connections between these research
projects and share methods and techniques as well as the newest results. More

funded by the Algebra, Number Theory, and Topology programs.
