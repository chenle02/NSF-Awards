The El Verde Field Station of the University of Puerto Rico is a long-
established research facility in the only Neotropical rain forest under the
jurisdiction of the United States. The field station is located in the Caribbean
National Forest, which is an Experimental Forest and a Biosphere Reserve. The
field station and the surrounding research area have been the focus of projects
by scientists from over 50 institutions in the United States and overseas.
Current research projects are funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the
National Sceince Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
and the U.S. Forest Service. Proposals to NSF for work at El Verde totalling
over $3 million are currently pending. An increase in the number of researchers
seeking accommodations at El Verde necessitates an expansion and renovation of
the facilities of the field station. This project will provide partial support
for construction and renovation of a dormitory for visiting researchers,
renovation of a collections room, upgrading of the electrical facilities, and
installation of air conditioning for the main laboratory building.//
