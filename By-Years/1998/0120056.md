ABSTRACT

Information Technology Workforce (ITWF)

Proposal Id: EIA-0120056 Investigator: Phyllis Bernt, Joseph Bernt and Sandra
Turner Institution: Ohio University Title: Getting the Media Message: The
Portrayal of Gender, Race, and Information Technology in the Media Environment
of Middle School Students.

This award provides support for a study examining media messages about
Information Technology (IT) careers that middle school students receive from
television, popular magazines, videotapes, movies, and from books, brochures and
Internet sites that provide career information. The analysis will concentrate on
the media portrayal of IT occupations, especially in terms of gender and race,
that students are likely to encounter during the middle school years. Sixth and
Seventh grade students in 12 demographically diverse classrooms across the
nation will participate in classroom-based action research employing
mathematics, language arts, and social science skills in surveying their peers
and conducting their own content analysis of media messages about IT careers.
