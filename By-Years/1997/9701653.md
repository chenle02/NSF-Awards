9701653 Friedman This award provides support for the research and programmatic
activities of the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications (IMA) at the
University of Minnesota. The IMA is a unique institute addressing a national
need. The programs of the IMA are designed to foster linkages among the
mathematical sciences, other sciences, and industrial research by identifying
problems and stimulating research in various interface areas of mathematical
sciences and to encourage the participation of mathematical scientists in areas
of application by providing an atmosphere conducive to multidisciplinary
research. Yearly IMA programs are carefully chosen to provide a meeting ground
for mathematical scientists with engineers and scientists from academia,
industry, and government laboratories. The interaction of senior and mid- level
scholars and postdoctoral fellows is designed to provide an environment where
new ideas can be developed and explored. The IMA places a high priority on the
training of postdoctoral researchers, including both individuals associated with
the annual program and those participating in the industrial postdoctoral
program. The IMA also supports summer research and training programs for
graduate students, as well as an ongoing seminar on industrial problems. Efforts
are made to schedule programs of timely research interest and where
opportunities exist for cross-disciplinary and programmatic collaboration and
scientific exchange. In addition to National Science Foundation support, the IMA
is supported by 29 Participating Universities and 12 Participating Corporations.
