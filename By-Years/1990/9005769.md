This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of laser excited photothermal spectroscopy. Professor Bialkowski will
study the nonlinear fundamental aspects of high intensity laser photothermal
spectroscopy. This grant will provide graduate student support only. This
research will use pulsed infrared laser irradiation of high intensity to
quantify multiphoton absorption coefficients for samples in the gas phase. This
research will find application in the analysis of atmospheric
chlorofluorocarbons in situ.
