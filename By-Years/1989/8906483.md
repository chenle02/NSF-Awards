A goal of this project is to develop a systematic understanding of the theory
and practice of highly concurrent data objects. The need for such an
understanding has become compelling as technological advances have made
multiprocessor machines readily available. Despite impressive progress at the
hardware level, there is little agreement on the relative merits of competing
architectures, and it has often proved difficult to realize these machines'
potential for parallelism. These difficulties are compounded when application
requirements include fault-tolerance or real-time performance. The PI's prior
work had made significant contributions to the theory of highly concurrent data
structures by exploiting the theory of abstract data types to derive (1)
impossibility results, showing that certain kinds of concurrency simply cannot
be achieved with certain primitives; (2) new techniques for specifying and
reasoning about the behavior of concurrent objects, and (3) synchronization
algorithms permitting high degrees of concurrency never before achieved. The
resulting theory has a rich mathematical structure, yielding a number of
unexpected results with consequences for algorithm design, implications of these
results are poorly understood. A principal objective of this project is to
undertake experimental work to translate theoretical results into practice.
