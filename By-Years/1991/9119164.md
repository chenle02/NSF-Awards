With funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo- metallic Chemistry
Program, Professor Teddy G. Traylor of the University of California, San Diego
will continue his studies on the mechanisms of oxidation reactions catalyzed by
iron-porphyrin complexes. These reactions are models for biological iron-
porphyrin based oxidations but may also be useful for laboratory or even
industrial oxidations. The design and preparation of new catalysts and detailed
studies of the individual steps involved in catalyzed epoxidation of alkenes,
hydroxylation of alkanes, oxidations of arenes and of phenols will be undertaken
in this grant period. Also to be considered are the utilization of dioxygen as
the oxygen source and the use of recently discovered halogenated porphyrin
catalysts, and especially polymeric versions of these, for oxidation reactions.
%%% Oxidation reactions are fundamental to many biological and industrial
processes. The mechanisms of many of these reactions are still unknown and limit
the ability of scientists to design new oxidants and particularly catalysts for
selective oxidation of organic compounds. The research to be performed here has
as its objective the determination of the way in which man-made mimics of
biological oxidants react with various types of organic molecules. Recently
discovered forms of the iron based compounds have unique reactivities that have
been retained in very stable polymeric forms of the compounds. These polymeric
catalysts show promise for preparative scale laboratory reactions and possibly
small-scale industrial processes.
