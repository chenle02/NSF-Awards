ASM International and the ASM Foundation for Education and Research have
requested support for a three-year project to assist 20 local chapters of the
ASM International in forming long-term partnerships with their local schools
and/or school districts. They propose using a "process model" which is based on
the experience of a pilot project involving a group of seven (7) chapters in
forming such relationships. That model is described in terms of three key
elements and will entail the conduct of a series of workshops, offered to a
progressively smaller number of invitees who have successfully negotiated the
prior element, designed to shepherd at least 20 local chapters through the final
stages in the establishment of durable partnerships. Foundation support is
approximately 10% of the total project cost which includes not only that of the
immediate partnership but also that anticipated as a commitment by the local
chapters of scientist time and materials.
