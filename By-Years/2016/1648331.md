The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in helping people cultivate healthy
lifestyles. Over the last few decades, an epidemic of lifestyle diseases has
developed in the United States. Unhealthy lifestyles, such as inactivity, poor
nutrition and sedentary behaviors are driving up the prevalence of chronic
disease such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease. As of 2012, about 117
million people had one or more chronic health conditions. Although chronic
diseases like obesity and diabetes are among the most common and costly of all
diseases, simply adopting healthy lifestyles can prevent many of these chronic
diseases. About 86% of all health care spending in 2010 was for chronic medical
conditions. Preventive approaches can offset current healthcare costs. However,
prevention is typically implemented as labor-intensive coaching or mobile health
apps that lack sufficient personalization to be effective. The technology
platform being developed in this project will combine the best of both mobile
and in-person coaching for a fraction of the cost of in-person coaching.

The proposed project will help people to cultivate lifestyle changes. For a
lifestyle disease patient, it is very difficult to change lifelong habits to
adopt a healthy lifestyle. Hence, compliance with the recommendations of a
doctor or coach is a long standing problem. Several reminder and tracker apps
attempt to help with compliance and adoption of healthy lifestyle. Unlike such
solutions, our approach is unique in its ability to proactively intervene with
highly targeted interventions at the right moment, which is when compliance is
most likely. Such moments will be captured through the ability of the platform
to incorporate context-sensitivity. The platform will understand the context of
each patient and will enable the coach to deliver interventional messages at the
right moment, thereby increasing the likelihood of compliance and assisting with
formation of healthy habits. The platform also provides scalability without
significant loss in personalization.
