A joint program of theoretical and experimental studies of cross sections for
the scattering of low-energy electrons by molecules is carried out. Such cross
sections play an important role in our understanding and modeling of both
fundamentally and technologically significant processes. Specific objectives:
(1) cross sections for excitation of electronic transitions in carbon monoxide,
oxygen, nitric oxide, and nitrogen; (2) theoretical studies of electron impact
excitation of carbon dioxide and water; (3) theoretical studies of vibrational
excitation of water and carbon dioxide; and (4) cross sections for elastic
scattering of electrons.
