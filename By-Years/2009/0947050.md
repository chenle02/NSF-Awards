With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Texas, Austin will acquire a fluorimeter with the capability of measuring
fluorescence lifetimes. This award will provide an instrument to be used by a
large group of researchers to investigate the fundamental photochemical
properties of a variety of molecular and materials systems. The areas to be
investigated include electroluminescence, the rational design of new photoactive
molecules, materials for solar energy conversion and measurements of excited
state lifetimes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Fluorimeters are spectrometers that
measure the properties of the light emitted from a sample that has been promoted
to an excited state by a light source. These emission spectra, measured over a
wide range of frequencies and time resolutions, allow determination of the
nature of photoexcited states and their lifetimes. The configuration of this
instrument will make it accessible to a large number of users in a variety of
disciplines both inside and outside of chemistry. The instrument will be used in
research and undergraduate laboratory classes including the departmental
Freshmen Research Initiative.&lt;br/&gt;
