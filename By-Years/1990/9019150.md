This award supports the continuation of a long term study of the stat formation
properties of nearby galaxies, with special emphasis on those observations which
are most relevant to understanding galactic evolution. Dr. Kennicutt is one of
the world leaders in this field of endeavor, and his investigations will include
studies of how the rate of formation of massive stars relates to the physical
properties of the interstellar medium. He will also investigate the properties
of HII regions in a variety of galaxies, to study the influence of variations in
extinction and the stellar initial mass function.
