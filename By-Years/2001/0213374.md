Professor Lewis and his collaborators have successfully studied thermal
isomerization and dissociation reaction mechanisms for cyclic hydrocarbons such
as cyclopropanes and cyclohexenes. This work provides important mechanistic
information about organic reactions where two or more bonds are broken and/or
formed simultanteously. In the new grant period, compounds which are
specifically deuterium and carbon-13 labelled will be used to investigate
details of cyclopropane isomerizations and rearrangements and labelled
cyclohexenes will be used for the study of retro Diels-Alder reactions. Some
related four-center elimination reactions will also be examined. Careful
experimental measurements of reaction rates, energy and entropy barriers and
branching ratios of competing reactions will be performed and compared with the
results of computational studies.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. David K. Lewis of the Department of Chemistry at Connecticut
College. Dr. Lewis and his collaborators will work on understanding the
mechanisms of fundamental chemical reactions involving small hydrocarbon
molecules. These molecules come primarily from petroleum feedstocks and a
careful understanding of their reaction chemistry may have relevance to chemcial
processes whereby petroleum feedstocks are converted into speciality chemicals.
Undergraduate research students who work on this project will gain
interdisciplinary training in aspects of synthesis, kinetics, and molecular
modelling, all of which are skills needed by the pharmaceutical and speciality
chemicals industries.
