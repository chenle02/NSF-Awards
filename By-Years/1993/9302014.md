In vitro mutagenesis has been used extensively in probing the structure and
function of ribosomal RNA from the bacterium E. coli Only recently has this
powerful technique been applied toward the study of ribosomal proteins. The
objective of this planning grant is the modification of a two plasmid, inducible
expression system based upon T7 RNA polymerase that was adapted for an
investigation of E. coli ribosomal protein L2. This system has made it possible
to quickly identify dominant-negative mutations by replica plating transformants
at two different temperatures. The refinements being carried out in this study
is the coupled expression of a mutant ribosomal protein gene and an rRNA operon
that codes for an antibiotic resistance. Upon induction of the T7 RNA polymerase
expression system, the vast majority of de novo ribosomes will include of an
antibiotic resistance marker as well as the targeted mutant ribosomal protein
during subunit assembly. Wild type ribosomes assembled prior to induction will
be functionally eliminated by the inclusion of the appropriate antibiotic during
invitro activity assays. This will allow for mutant ribosomal subunits assembled
in vivo to be characterized in vitro for their activity/inactivity in the
partial reactions of protein synthesis, eliminating the need to physically
separate the two ribosome populations. %%% The planning grant is testing the
applicability of a new technique to the study of ribosomal RNA-protein
interactions. Completion of the work will help us better understand the
mechanism by which proteins are synthesized in all cells.
