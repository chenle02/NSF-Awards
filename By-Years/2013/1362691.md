With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A Program
(CSDM-A) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Christian B. Hilty of
Texas A&amp;M University in a project that will use magnetic resonance
techniques to examine the structures of proteins in solution. These
investigations will allow a determination of the way solvents such as water
affect the shape and functions of the proteins they interact with. Since
proteins play crucial roles in life processes and often carry out their
functions in water solutions, these studies will impact research in molecular
biology and the biomedical sciences. The investigator will also develop a series
of web-based modules, aimed at middle school to high school students, which will
highlight the importance of molecular structure in chemistry and
biology.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will employ nuclear
hyperpolarization based NMR techniques to investigate site specific and time
dependent solvent-protein interactions. NMR spectra acquired after mixing the
protein with hyperpolarized solvent will reveal polarization transferred to
sites on the protein. The distribution of polarization on the protein will be
used to derive solvent binding sites, contact areas and protein structure.
