This MSP-Start Partnership project, "Power of Physical Sciences" (POPS), is
partnering the State University of New York at Geneseo and teachers and
administrators from five neighboring rural school districts in Livingston County
to investigating ways to encourage middle and high school girls to study physics
and geological science.

The POPS program is focusing on a hands-on, middle school enrichment curriculum
that emphasizes the role that physics and geology play in solving societal
problems, specifically in addressing future energy needs in an environmentally
responsible way. They are conducting a pilot study to collect preliminary data
to help address the question of whether or not a rigorous and engaging
enrichment curriculum that emphasizes the societal benefits of the physical
sciences can encourage more girls to study physics and geology. Furthermore,
pre-service teachers at SUNY Geneseo are involved with this project. They are
working closely with experienced science education faculty to develop some of
these learning activities as part of an undergraduate "research" experience.

An independent evaluator is working with the POPS team to design and implement
an evaluation plan to monitor the success of the program. The results of this
investigation are being used to develop an MSP Targeted Partnership proposal.
