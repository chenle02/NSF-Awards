High decibel acoustic waves will be used to remove micron- and submicron-sized
particulates contaminants from the surface of high density integrated circuits.
Efficient use of the acoustic energy provides the removal force necessary to
overcome the particle/surface adhesion. This innovative cleaning technique has
the potential to increase substantially the production yields of current chip
manufacturing processes and to advance the miniaturization of future circuit
designs. The experimental portion of the investigation includes: morphological
characterization of the contaminants prior to and after cleansing,
characterization of the acoustic field during the procedure, and a parametric
study of the removal efficiency as a function of the acoustic waver form (e.g.,
random, gated-random, tone burst) and intensity. The research also involves a
theoretical investigation of the interaction of acoustic waves with the surface
of the IC and of relative adhesive and removal forces under various
configurations and acoustic fields.
