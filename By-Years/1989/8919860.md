This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of solvent extraction. The award would provide six months of
support for Dr. Miran Chantooni. The goal of this project is to conclude studies
of the complexation behavior of crown ethers with cations. Dr. Chantooni has
been a senior postdoctoral in this research with Professor Kolthoff for thirty
years.
