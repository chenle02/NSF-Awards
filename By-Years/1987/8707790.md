The primary objective of this Engineering Initiation Award is to develop a
general methodology by which an optimized design for a particular application
can be generated autonomously by a computer based on basic principles, experts'
knowledge, and practical performance evaluation criteria. The underlying
hypothesis of this research is that some aspects of the design process can be
recast into an efficient, systematic, and automated search process. The basic
mechanism is the proposed THINK-SEEK-EXAMINE scheme. To accomplish this
objective requires that an expert system be developed to test the methodology.
The domain of the expert design system will be DC/AC electronic circuits. The
proposed design systems has the potential to produce innovative designs that may
be contrary to human intuition. This methodology will also enable the
development of designs that require knowledge in more than one field and will
allow for the evaluation of new technologies. The methodology may also be
extended for the development of innovative analytical techniques.
