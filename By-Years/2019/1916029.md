Sea Education Association (SEA) requests National Science Foundation funding to
support annual manufacturer calibration of existing oceanographic
instrumentation on its two sailing research vessels, the SSV Corwith Cramer and
SSV Robert C. Seamans. These vessels operate in the Atlantic and Pacific,
respectively, providing academically rigorous training for students in the
marine sciences. NSF funding support for instrument calibration is crucial to
allow high-quality oceanographic datasets to be collected and analyzed by
undergraduates enrolled in our SEA Semester academic programs and by
collaborating scientists from colleges and research institutions throughout the
country. All data generated will be freely shared with the entire oceanographic
community via submission to the appropriate long-term data archives through the
Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
