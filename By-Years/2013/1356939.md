The International Conference on "Modern Perspectives in Applied Mathematics:
Theory and Numerics of PDEs" will be taking place April 28-May 2, 2014. This
conference is proposed in order to highlight the recent advances and new
perspectives in applied analysis and computational mathematics, focusing on
theoretical, computational and applied aspects of partial differential
equations. The meeting will bring together researchers from different
disciplines and provide a unique opportunity for in-depth technical discussions
and exchange of ideas in all areas involving mathematical and computational
sciences, modeling and simulations, as well as their applications. The
conference topics are: the study of time-dependent partial differential
equations including hyperbolic conservation laws and their numerical
approximations, nonlinear wave patterns, image processing, kinetic PDE models in
biological processes, social network dynamics, traffic and pedestrian flows,
theory and numerics of interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will serve
as a forum for researchers at different stages of their career to share
experiences, exchange ideas, and explore new collaborations. The conference will
provide opportunities to promote scientific advances at the interface between
mathematics and the physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering. The
meeting will be used to identify new large-scale problems that require
innovative mathematical approaches. The organizers will take several measures to
attract young scientists. Graduate students, postdocs, and early-career
professors will be encouraged to attend.
