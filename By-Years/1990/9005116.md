Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research the Principal Investigator will
examine the feasibility of using acousto-optic filter techniques, coupled with
selection of times of excellent seeing lasting possibly only fractions of a
second, to search for faint companions of brighter stars. This technique could
be very useful in the search for brown dwarf stars and planets around nearby
stars.
