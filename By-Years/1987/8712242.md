In stable, long lasting social groups the progress of each individual through
life may be viewed as a trajectory, in which future position is influenced by
past history. In most vertebrate populations it is impossible for an
investigator to appreciate this perspective because studies are relatively
short. By employing a population in individually recognizable animals with
histories known since 1969, this project will make possible a lifetime
perspective. A variety of difficult questions will be addressed. When do
individuals with the greatest lifetime reproductive success begin to breed?
Should an individual emigrate before beginning to breed? If so, when? Such
questions are strongly influenced by social rank. How stable are the ranks of
individuals over their lifetimes? Does the status of an individual early in life
have a lifelong effect on its reproductive success? These and other questions
can only be answered when a population of individually recognizable individuals
is studied intensively for a long period. The proposed research will take
advantage of this unique opportunity to study the causes and consequences of
social dominance in long- term perspective.
