This award provides support to Dr. Mark S. Mizruchi under the National Science
Foundation's Young Presidential Awards program. The objectives of this program
are to provide research support to the Nation's most outstanding and promising
young science and engineering faculty. The awards are intended to improve the
capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly
qualified science and engineering personnel for academic and industrial research
and teaching. This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research in
the application of social network ideas to issues in organizational theory and
political sociology. Much of his work focuses on the behavior of large
corporations. He is interested in the factors that determine the types of
government policies supported by businesses. Dr. Mizruchi's focus is on the ways
in which factors such as market constraint exerted by one firm over another and
the number of common institutional shareholders determine whether a pair of
firms will support the same policy. He is also concerned with the methods
corporations use to handle their capital needs. The focus is on whether
representatives of financial institutions join the boards of nonfinancial
corporations when the latter are in financial difficulty, as well as the types
of alternatives that are available to capital- dependent firms and the factors
that influence how capital is raised.
