This is an interinstitutional collaborative project between Oregon Graduate
Institute of Science and Technology (OGI) and Portland State University (PSU).
Query optimizers are one of the main means by which modern database systems
achieve their performance advantages. Given a request for data manipulation or
retrieval, an optimizer will choose an optimal plan for evaluating the request
from among the manifold alternative strategies. Optimization for the basic
relational model is considered a solved problem by many. However, new
application areas such as knowledge discovery, on-line analytical processing,
and complex multimedia objects, have kindled renewed research in optimization.
Current optimizers have often proved inadequate to the needs of these new
application areas. Researchers have developed optimization techniques, and
several prototype optimizers, to support new applications. This research
addresses engineering questions related to the use of new optimizers for new
applications: which operators to use; which search strategies to employ; and
which transforms to utilize. These investigations use the Columbia query
optimizer framework and visualization environment developed at PSU and OGI. The
project interacts closely with companies which produce database management
systems and the hardware on which they run. The research results will help
database optimizer implementors make better choices in the design of their
systems, leading to better performance and more expressive query languages for
commercial database systems.
