360 Manufacturing and Applied Engineering ATE Regional Center of Excellence (360
Center) addresses critical manufacturing workforce needs that are imperative to
our nation's economic strength and national defense. The 360 Center team is
comprised of 15 higher educational institutions (14 of which are 2-year

goals, including baseline measures, tied directly to the needs of the
manufacturing industry to develop and expand technician education programs
resulting in improved student learning, making manufacturing education programs
more accessible, and leading to more individuals being qualified for employment
in the manufacturing industry. The use of Creative Commons licenses and the
archiving of materials with ATE Central will ensure that innovative best
practices and discoveries have nationwide impact, as they will be broadly shared
with the ATE network and other key stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 360
Center will expand and improve the 360 eTECH high school program; expand the 360
