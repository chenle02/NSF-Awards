An international symposium on the Geochemistry of the Earth Surface will be
held at University Park, Pennsylvania on August 1- 6, 1993. The symposium is the
third meeting of the Working Group on Geochemistry of Weathering and Diagenesis
of Sediments, (GWDS-3) which is affiliated with the International Association of
Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry. Past meetings have been held in Granada, Spain
(1986) and Aix-en-Provence, France (1990). The scientific sessions will cover a
wide range of topics in surficial geochemistry: paleoclimates and paleosols,
chemical weathering and denudation at scales from the watershed to global, early
diagenesis and organic geochemistry of sediments, geochemical kinetics at low
temperatures, global cycles, and environmental geochemistry. A prominent theme
of the symposium will be the role of surficial geochemical studies (of both
modern and paleoenvironments) in the international global change effort. Past
meetings have been truly international, and we will continue the tradition. In
addition, the GWDS-3 encourages the participation of students, and of scientists
from developing nations. To achieve these goals we are requesting support
(primarily for travel and meeting expenses of students and foreign participants)
from the National Science Foundation. We will defray part of the costs of the
distinguished foreign invitees, as well as to establish a NSF-sponsored, travel
assistance award for students and foreign participants.
