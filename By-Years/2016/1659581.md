This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Coe College provides
eight undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in
research on topics in optics, glass science, acoustics, molecular biology,
detector physics, modeling, and biomaterials, all under the common focus of
spectroscopy. In addition to participating in research with an experienced and
dedicated mentor, the REU students will engage in activities such as seminars
and lectures and give two oral presentations, one at mid-term and then a final
twenty minute talk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) site, where each summer two high school teachers
from nearby school districts participate in a research project. During the
academic year, the teachers are invited to bring their students to Coe College
to learn about the work they carried out. The teachers will use their experience
to motivate their students to better understand the physical world and prepare
them to become the future generation of scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
participants will be exposed and trained in a variety of techniques and
equipment, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman
spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Scanning Electron Microscope,
absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, x-ray fluorescence, calorimetry, and
others. The projects are designed to be suitable for undergraduates, but also
challenging and leading to results of interest to external researchers.
