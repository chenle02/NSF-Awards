H. E. Stanley of Boston University is supported by an award from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research concerned with
understanding static and dynamic heterogeneities in confined water. One focus of
this research program is to answer the question: "what features of bulk water
survive in confinement"? The PI and his students work closely with many
experimental groups to help interpret experiments on confined, glassy and super-
cooled water. One hypothesis that is being tested both experimentally and
theoretically is the existence, for confined water, of a liquid-liquid critical
point.

Understanding the properties of confined water is important to many fields
including biology and geology. The results from this research are being extended
to understand other materials such as metallic glasses that are now thought to
share some features of liquid water. Both graduate students and undergraduates
contribute to this research.
