The university is developing a course on the principles and technology of
multimedia, intended for juniors and seniors in Computer Science and Computer
Engineering. This course has a significant lab component to demonstrate major
ideas, generate enthusiasm, and develop hands-on skills. Major subjects include
signal processing, compression, scheduling, data retrieval, interface design,
device interfacing, networks, media (sound, music, voice, images, graphics,
video), and applications programming. Equipment for this lab consists of
networked personal computers, programming and applications software, and I/O
devices. The course's progress is being measured with the help of a group of
outside experts. The materials developed in this lab include lab exercises,
training materials, recommendations on hardware and software, and software for
functions that are not commercially available. These materials will be made
available electronically to other teachers.
