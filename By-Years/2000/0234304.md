Summary: This research explores the potential links between the east Asian
monsoon and the North Atlantic Ocean through atmospheric teleconnections as
revealed by analyses of climate records in the Late Holocene of ODP Site 1144 in
the South China Sea. The research will use total faunal census data of planktic
foraminifer assemblages and isotopic and trace element analyses (Mg/Ca ratios)
in surface dwelling and thermocline indicator species to determine sea surface
temperature variations, surface salinity variation, and thermocline structure.
The results will be used to test the hypothesis that quasi-periodic cold events
identified in subpolar and subtropical North Atlantic Ocean Holocene records are
present in Holocene records from the South China Sea. &lt;br/&gt;
