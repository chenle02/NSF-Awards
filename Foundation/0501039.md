This project concerns two important aspects of the descriptive set theory of
definable equivalence relations. On the theoretical side the PI proposes to
study the structures of Polish groups and the dynamics of their actions. The
scope of the groups ranges from countable nilpotent groups to the full unitary
group. On the application side the PI proposes to study the major open problems
concerning classification of mathematical structures arising in analysis,
topology and geometry. The main focus, though, will be classification problems
that are comparable to the orbit equivalence relations induced by actions of the
unitary group. One example of such a problem is the classification of bounded
linear operators on a separable complex Hilbert space.

Many important open problems in various fields of mathematics ask for
satisfactory classification of mathematical objects studied in the fields. These
classification problems can often be formalized as definable equivalence
relations, sometimes even orbit equivalence relations induced by Polish group
actions. A striking theory of definable equivalence relations has been developed
in the past 15 years or so and complete understanding of the complexity of many
classification problems has thus been obtained. This project seeks further
development of the descriptive set theory of definable equivalence relations. It
is anticipated that mathematics of different fields be brought together in this
foundational framework. For many of the old classification problems the
descriptive set theoretic perspective is new and worth investigating.
