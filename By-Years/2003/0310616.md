Chemistry (12) A new upper-division course based upon the SENCER (Science
Education for New Civic Engagements and Responsibilities) model is being
developed. The course, "Industrial Processes and Their Impact on Society,"
utilizes the active learning-civic engagement approach. The major course goals
are to forge better university relations/communications with local industry and
to provide the community with timely and accurate information on the impact of
industrial processes going on in the state of Montana. The course is based
around field trips to five local plants from different sectors of chemical
industry. The goals of the course for student impact include providing students
with a fundamental understanding of the chemical and process design principles
involved in making an industrial process economically viable, giving students
the critical thinking tools needed to understand the impact of a given industry
on the surrounding environment, and providing students with a balanced view of
how local industry impacts the state economically, socially and environmentally.
