An understanding of solid state physics and its associated laboratory techniques
is necessary not only for Physics majors, but also for Electrical Engineering
majors. Mankato State University will purchase an electron spin resonance (ESR)
system to upgrade the laboratory in the course Solid State Physics. Students
will first learn to use the system, and then use it to study properties of
various samples provided. For example, the ESR technique will be used to study
defect concentrations in the samples. The EE majors, in particular, need
experience with this type of equipment before continuing with additional
required courses covering the electronic properties of materials. The university
will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
