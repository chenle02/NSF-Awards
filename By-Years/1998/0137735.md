The overall aim of this project is to develop a set of videos on a CD-ROM
centering on the investigations of pond organisms to be used by elementary and
middle school teachers as complements to existing life science curricula and
environmental education programs. This product will be published nationally by a
commercial publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the three years of the project
the videos will be pilot tested by EDC and the New England Aquarium staff and
then field-tested in a range of school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
collaborators in the project will be the Education Development Center and the
New England Aquarium. Peace River Films and Squid Country Safari will be
subcontractors producing the videos and adapting them for a CD-ROM.&lt;br/&gt;
