This project deals with generating data such as Bainite Start Temperature (B's)
in the Thermostress Process (TSP), to determine the shift of B's, etc., for
various steels. The research is expected to result in complete integration, on a
theoretical level, of the recently developed thermostress process with the
present time, temperature, and transformation knowledge.
