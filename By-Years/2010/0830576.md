Abstract: Block ciphers are indispensable components of the communication
infrastructure, yet few unifying principles for their design and analysis exist.
As a result, it is not possible to easily characterize good and bad ciphers, and
the design of good ciphers is difficult. While notable general treatments of the
problem do exist and have contributed valuable insights, it has been difficult
to combine the individual treatments of specific attacks and specific cipher
designs into an overarching theory, and much remains to be
done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies a large class of attacks known
as statistical cryptanalysis, which exploits probabilistic relationships among
the plaintext, key and ciphertext to determine the key. The research extends
existing communication channel models of statistical cryptanalysis---where low
capacity channels carry encoded symbols of the key to the adversary---which have
been used very successfully to design attacks on stream ciphers, but are not as
widely used for block cipher cryptanalysis. A key insight exploited by the
project is as follows: existing cryptanalytic models do not provide a means of
studying the combination of related-key attacks and statistical attacks. The PI
observed that related secrets form codes over information leakage channels,
improving adversary communication efficiency. Using this approach, the project
obtains general results on attack efficiency---experimentally verified as far as
possible---and related cipher design criteria. Through an established r
elationship with local high school Chantilly Academy, where the PI teaches
cryptography modules, the project contributes to K-12 education, and inspires
high school students to study mathematics, engineering and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;
