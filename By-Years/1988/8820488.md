This grant is for partial support of a symposium on "Materials Science on
Mineralized Biological Tissues" to be held at the 1988 Fall Meeting of The
Materials Research Society, November 28 - December 2, 1988. Examples of topics
to be covered at the symposium include: pore structure of mineralized tissues,
use of advanced analytical instrumentation for research on mineralized tissues
(e.g., electron microscopy, ion spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy,
photoemission spectroscopy, electron microprobe), defect chemistry and
mechanisms of mineralization, piezoelectric effects. Funding by the National
Science Foundation will be used to support travel and related expenses for
distinguished scientists to actively participate in the symposium. Young
scientists will also be encouraged to participate. One objective of the
symposium is to promote discussion of the latest research in the field with the
thought of identifying the scientific issues which need emphasis in future
research.
