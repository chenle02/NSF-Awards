The substantial increase of energy consumption has brought up many serious
engineering problems and economic concerns to our society. Many energy-saving
scheduling algorithms have been proposed in the past decade to manage power
consumption. However, energy-saving algorithms' impact on chip lifetime
reliability, an important factor affecting overall system sustainability, has
not been carefully examined by computer science theorists.

The goal of this EAGER proposal is to explore the theoretical groundwork of
incorporating chip reliability in designing energy efficient scheduling
algorithms for modern computing facilities. The PI proposes a new model that
augments the existing energy-aware schedulers by enforcing additional chip
lifetime reliability constraints which are modeled as functions of processor
frequency changes. Novel scheduling algorithm design and analysis techniques are
investigated to solve this problem.

The project outcome may potentially be transformative to a spectrum of related
scheduling problems. In addition to studying the proposed theoretical problems,
the PI empirically measures the performance of the developed algorithms by
utilizing the FreeBSD operating system. This research suggests that through
operating system kernel development, the practical implications of theoretical
findings can be demonstrated.
