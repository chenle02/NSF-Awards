9452162 Ali Until recently programming has been a sequential, linguistic and
abstract undertaking. However, the development of visual, object oriented
languages and Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) used in conjunction with video
and audio displays has vastly increased the range of programming techniques and
information types to be used and mastered by computer science students. This
project seeks to improve the present undergraduate laboratory experience in
computer science through the establishment and use of the Multimedia,
Ergonomics, Design and Interface Activities (MEDIA) Lab for exercises associated
with eight existing undergraduate courses at Southwest Texas State University.
These new laboratory exercises require equipment that is not available to the
Department of Computer Science, although the department has made substantial
investments in microcomputers to augment the existing campus-wide mainframe
network. The MEDIA Lab provides hands-on, open and closed laboratory experiences
in the use, design, development and production of multimedia GUIs. The MEDIA Lab
also provides students a solid foundation of experience with the ergonomics (or
human factors) associated with the use of various GUI techniques and devices.
The MEDIA Lab functions in conjunction with the Computers in Society Laboratory,
CS1308 Lab, to train computer science majors and minors as well as students
enrolled in the departmental service course. The MEDIA Lab allows students to
experiment with multimedia information and interfaces and to actually produce
multimedia products for dissemination. The MEDIA Lab should serve as a model for
the development of multimedia GUI training facilities, materials and techniques
in other computer science departments that seek to prepare students to design
applications that accommodate the wide range of abilities and disabilities
present in American society.
