9315083 Atema Chemical signals play an important role in the lives of many
animals for orientation to food, selection of habitats and mates, and avoidance
of predators. It has been shown that benthic animals detect and respond to
chemical signals produced by other animals or food sources at distances of
centimeters to many meters. This study will test the hypothesize that the micro-
scale pattern of concentration distribution of odors in a current provides
information that is used by animals for orientation toward the odor source.
Laboratory and in situ experimental work will be carried out to describe and
quantify the distribution of chemical signals in aquatic odor plumes, and the
behavioral responses of crustaceans to those plumes. ***
