ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common problem faced by many secondary school
teachers of Earth Science is limited&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of local and regional
geology and limited field experience. The active continental margin in the
Pacific Northwest provides an amazing variety of geological
settings:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Themes of Teachers on the Leading Edge will be:
(a) Field-based geology investigations that feature the problem-solving approach
and instill a geologic sense of place; (b) Earth Systems Science promoting
critical thinking about mass and energy transfers within and between the
geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere; (c) A geophysical emphasis
that will demonstrate how subsurface geology is imaged by seismic, magnetic, and
gravity studies and will prepare teachers to convey to their students the
discoveries of Earth Scope's US Array and Plate Boundary Observatory
experiments. (d) Examinations of geologic hazards as understandable and relevant
to citizens who "live on the edge" of our continent. The planning workshops
will: (1) form a collaborative of university and K-12 Earth Science educators;
(2) determine the best field locations for learning Earth Science through
problem-solving; (3) develop an implementation plan for the inaugural set of
summer 2005 workshops for teachers; and (4) report program development and
design through contributions to the Digital Library of Earth System Education
(DLESE).&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
