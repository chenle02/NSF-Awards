*** 96-60528 Downing This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will demonstrate the feasibility of using a monolithic capillary optic
to enhance the capability of microfocus X-ray fluorescence (MXRF)
instrumentation. X-ray fluorescence is useful because of its ability
nondestructively to perform elemental analysis on essentially any sample with
high sensitivity. In commercial MXRF instruments, spatial resolution is
typically achieved by pinhole collimating, at the expense of greatly reduced
flux and detection limits. Multifiber polycapillary X-ray optics have a
demonstrated capability to collect and focus X-rays; however, the spot size is
typically 0.5 mm or larger. Focusing monolithic (one-piece) multichannel
capillary X-ray optics have just been developed. By collecting a large solid
angle from laboratory X-ray sources and focusing to less than 40 microns, they
should provide greater performance, potentially increasing X-ray intensity by
more than two orders of magnitude while decreasing the spot size compared to
available MXRF systems. This would improve detection limits, spatial resolution,
working distance, and reduced measurement time. Commercial applications include
use a process monitoring system in predictive maintenance. Low cost
installation, simple operation, and lower personnel requirements, as well as its
capability to access non-traditional process variables, are expected to be
commercially attractive. In addition, improved microfocus X-ray fluorescence is
expected to be used in many scientific disciplines, including geochemistry,
mineralogy, environmental monitoring and remediation, biology, and advanced
materials. ***
