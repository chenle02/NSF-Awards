The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CFA) will develop a modular,
hands-on, discovery-based, intercurricular, multicultural physical science
program for elementary students using astronomy as the central focus. In the
first three years of the project will develop, field test, and pilot four
modules in 60 third and fourth grade classrooms. At least half of the pilot
classrooms will be in settings where underserved minorities comprise a major
portion of the student population. The modules will be the initial components of
a complete program, which, when finished, may serve as a basic physical science
curriculum or as a complement to an existing course. Teacher enhancement
videotapes will also be developed by the CFA's Science Media Group, featuring
exemplary classroom teaching along with scientific background to the activities.
