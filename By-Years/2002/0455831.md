Multiple ground and space-based diagnostics are used to probe the plasmasphere
boundary from mid-latitudes. The primary diagnostics include the Intercepted
Signals for Ionospheric Science (ISIS) coherent software radio system, and an
extant Global Positioning System (GPS) array, which are constructed and operated
at no cost to this research. In addition to the GPS total-electron-content (TEC)
maps and passive multi-static radar imaging by ISIS, the Millstone Hill
Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) serves as a cross-calibration of ionospheric
conditions, and TOPEX and JASON satellite are also used to augment the collected
TEC database. The ISIS array is here composed of an expanded Manatash Ridge
Radar in Washington State, and a collection of coherent imaging Doppler
receivers placed by the University of Texas at Austin in an area around the
Millstone Hill radar. University of Texas at Austin also contributes expertise
with the Ionospheric Data Assimilation 3D (IDA3D) model. The GPS array used is
the Canadian GPS Network for Ionospheric Modeling (CANGIM), which is expanding
from four to nine receivers during the early period of this research effort
under the auspices of the University of Calgary. These widely distributed ISIS
and GPS arrays are a nascent example of the "distributed array of small
instruments" or DASI, concept. The purpose of this DASI is to examine the
evolution of ionospheric structures with a large-scale (mid-latitude to auroral
northern hemisphere latitudes) context and high spatial resolution. Detailed
statistical characterization of plasma transport, storm-time electric fields,
and instability onset are planned.
