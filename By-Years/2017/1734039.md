Wearable health monitoring systems offer tremendous potential to improve our
lives, yet a number of hurdles must be cleared before they become a reality. The
processors and architectures that enable this technology demand a large amount
of energy, requiring sizable batteries. The ultimate objective of this CAREER
research is to create programmable architectures which require no battery and
can rely on energy harvesting techniques. To achieve this objective, we seek to
reduce power consumption of the processing units by more than two orders of
magnitude. This power reduction is accomplished through novel, transformative
methodologies to compose and configure programmable, ultra low power, granular
decision-making architectures. New algorithms, tightly coupled with signal
processing for power reduction in communication blocks are investigated.
Research methods to activate and deactivate sensors with the granular decision
making architecture attempts to further reduce the power consumption. The
methodologies are validated and refined using two clinical case
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to dramatically
improve the quality of health monitoring practice and medical research,
empowering numerous applications that are not currently feasible. Growing demand
for health care monitoring applications requires students, engineers and health
care professionals to design, develop, deploy and operate wearable systems. This
project provides a multidisciplinary platform to realize the educational
objectives of developing wearable computers, involving high school students and
teachers as well as undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach programs are
offered through short courses and lectures to local undergraduate societies
(SWE, Honors and IEEE), K-12 students, health-care professionals, and local
industries.
