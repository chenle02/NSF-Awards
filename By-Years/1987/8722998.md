This research will focus on applications of analysis to problems in geometry.
Jerry Kazdan will investigate continuation properties of some elliptic
operators. Christopher Croke will continue his work on geometric inequalities
using techniques from integral geometry. Dennis DeTurck will carry out research
on the curvature operator, the spectrum of the Laplacian and on existence
theorems for some partial differential equations. Charles' Epstein's research in
complex geometry will involve the study of global biholomorphic invariants of
Cauchy Riemann manifolds. They will be joined by Wenxiong Chen who will continue
his research into variational problems that arise in geometry. Kazdan's research
is aimed at establishing uniqueness of continuation properties of elliptic
operators which arise in geometric settings. This is to be modelled on known
results about harmonic functions where the corresponding operator is the
Laplacian. Croke will investigate inequalities relating volume and injectivity
radius. He will also study various associated stability results. DeTurck's
research involves the study of nonlinear partial differential equations which
arise in geometric settings. These occur frequently when one prescribes various
invariants of a physical system or tries to find those geometric structures for
which such invariants are optimal. Epstein's work will include a study of the
behavior of Kaehler-Einstein metrics in the neighborhoods of simple
singularities. The aim here is to understand the effect of interior
singularities on the values of certain invariants.
