The objective of the Third China-Japan-USA Symposium on Advanced Adsorption
Separation Science and Technology (June 5-9, 1994 in Dalian, China) is to
provide an opportunity to follow developments in adsorption in these countries
and to foster international collaboration among participants. Funds are to be
used as travel subsidies to academic attendees from the United States. An
important industrial process, adsorption contributes to the treatment of
effluent streams, the separation and purification of products, and future
storage technology for vehicles operating on natural gas.
