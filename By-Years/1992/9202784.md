This integrated study of the nature of deformation at the toe of the Nankai
prism will include an numerical calculation of particle displacement and
deformation, a measurement of ductile fabrics in clay-rich sediments at ODP site
808 and Nankai Trough area and experimental deformation of the Nankai clay-rich
sediments. The work will be carried out by a graduate student under the PI's
supervision and will provide first-order estimates of the amount and
distribution of diffuse deformation in Nankai prism and may enable the proof and
refinement of the proposed analysis techniques.
