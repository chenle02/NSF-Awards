Abstract ATM-9421041 Leavitt, Steven University of Arizona Title: Tree-Ring
Isotopic Composition as a Proxy for Isotopic Composition of Paleoprecipitation
and Paleoclimate in the American Southwest This study is intended to define
relationships between isotopic composition (delD, del18O, del13C) measured in
tree-rings with instrumental climate data and actual isotopic measurements of
precipitation. Stable-isotopic measurements will be made on cellulose of
ponderosa pine from southeastern Arizona and southern New Mexico. The delD and
del18O of the trees will be calibrated with respect to a long record (&gt;12
years) of isotopic composition of precipitation from nearby Tucson, extended
with other precipitation isotopic data from the IAEA network. In the long term,
the connection between the tree-ring measurements and climate/source-water
variables established in this study can be used to explore periods preceding the
instrumental period to determine the spatial and temporal variability and
strength of precipitation sources.
