The proposed research will use the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model
system for the evolution of water balance in insects. A total of 27 populations,
derived from three collection sites, will be studied. Nine populations will be
selected for resistance to desiccation stress, and 18 will serve as controls for
the selection treatment. Physiological characters associated with desiccation
resistance (water content, water loss, metabolic rate, activity) will be assayed
at intervals of ten generations. Genetic differences between populations will be
investigated using DNA microarrays (gene chips). Genes that are turned on or off
in response to water stress will be identified, as well as other genes that
contribute to desiccation resistance. By integrating physiological and genetic
studies, it will be possible to relate specific changes in gene expression to
physiological mechanisms of desiccation resistance. These experiments will also
be used to identify new physiological mechanisms by identifying novel genes that
respond to selection, and thereby to learn more about how insects and other
organisms respond to environmental stress.
