This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will take
advantage of the unique properties of nanomaterials to develop membranes with
improved performance tailored for osmosis applications. Osmosis-based industrial
processes have a number of advantages over evaporation and pressure-driven
membrane processes, including low energy use, low operating temperatures and
pressures, and high product concentrations. The project aims to synthesize a new
membrane using a composite structure consisting of carbon nanotubes embedded in
a polymer matrix. The main factor limiting the industrial use of osmosis-based
technologies is a lack of optimized membranes. The unique nanofluidic properties
of the proposed nanomaterials-based membrane would make it ideal for osmosis-
based applications, offering improvements in all relevant aspects of membrane
performance: 1) improved structural integrity, 2) high permeability; 3) chemical
stability, and 4) low propensity to foul.

The broader societal/commercial impact of this project will be to enable
numerous applications in the areas of wastewater treatment, industrial
separations, industrial and emergency desalination, and energy generation. The
analysis using the planned desalination plant at the city of Santa Cruz as an
example demonstrates that the availability of optimized membranes creates real
opportunities for making a strong impact on the commercial use of osmosis-based
technologies. In the future the nanomaterials-based membranes developed over the
course of this project could be deployed on a global scale for osmosis-based
applications, making a measurable impact on this $2.6 billion annual market.
Applications of these technologies to water purification and energy generation
could provide not only commercial but high societal impact, improving the living
conditions in the US and worldwide.
