This award supports ongoing collaboration between Buford Price, University of
California at Berkeley, and He Yudong and Jing Guiru, Chinese Institute of
Physics, Beijing, on measurement of isotopic abundances of heavy cosmic rays.
Using a newly developed track-recording glass detector (BP-1, developed during
earlier collaboration), measurements of the isotopic composition of iron and
neighboring nuclei in the cosmic radiation will be attempted. The detectors will
be flown in a high altitude balloon, yielding tracks of over 1000 cosmic ray
nuclei. Data will be analyzed at both Berkeley and Beijing. These measurements
of isotopic abundances should tell us about the origin and acceleration of
cosmic rays and about how heavy elements are synthesized in very hot, dense,
highly evolved stars.
