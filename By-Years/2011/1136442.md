In this project the Biology Department and the School of Education of the
University of Southern California have formed a partnership with the Los Angeles
Natural History Museum and the Los Angeles Unified School District 7 to offer
scholarships to prepare 50 science majors to become high-school science
teachers. Known as Robert Noyce Scholars, these undergraduate students are
trained in formal and informal pedagogic methods while developing expertise in
their subject so that, once certified, they can provide high-quality science
education to students in high-need school districts such as the partner
district. A unique feature of the program is the MAT@USC, an online teacher
education program that involves a large number of pre-service teachers across
the nation as well as a smaller number on campus. The Scholars, scattered among
centers in San Diego, New York, Sacramento, and Seattle as well as Los Angeles,
remain in contact with the Robert Noyce Science Teacher Scholarship Program
through the Urban Science Teacher Network, which connects current and former
scholars on line to discuss and share aspects of their experiences as science
educators. This opportunity for daily support is expected to improve the long-
term retention of the teachers in challenging classrooms settings. Contributions
to the literature on education are drawn from assessments of the impact of the
network on retention and new ideas that the group as a whole develop on the
topic of appropriate pedagogy for the urban setting. The impact is more broadly
felt, too, in the opportunity for students to learn science in new ways and with
greater understanding.
