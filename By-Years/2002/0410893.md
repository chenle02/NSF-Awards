Mathematical Sciences (21) This Type II project is supporting a conference of
mathematical scientists from across the country to reconceptualize the
undergraduate mathematical sciences curriculum in light of two influences:
firstly, the increased role that symbolic and numerical computation plays in
research; and secondly, the increased interdisciplinary nature that
characterizes advances in the physical sciences and engineering. Participants
expect to identify and delineate goals, obstacles and strategies, and engage in
follow up visits to participating institutions to pursue collaborative
adaptation and implementation efforts.
