The objective of this project is to further develop large range nanopositioning
technology. A nanopositioning system is a macro-scale motion system that is
capable of nanometer-level precision, and is commonly used in scanning probe
microscopy and lithography. Current nanopositioning systems are limited in their
motion range to approximately 100 microns per axis, thereby restricting their
use in some industrial applications. Research conducted by the project team has
helped make large range (&gt;10mm) nanopositioning feasible via innovations and
scientific advances in flexure bearings, sensors, actuators, and
controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of this project are to further
refine this nanopositioning technology to determine product specifications in
terms of overall size, motion range, speed, precision and resolution that meet
market needs and using this information, develop a detailed CAD design of the
technology that leverages the team's on-going research with product-
specifications that fit with societal needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
nanopositioning system is a macro-scale motion system comprising a flexure
bearing, actuator(s), sensor(s), and feedback controls, and is capable of
nanometer-level precision and resolution. It provides the scanning motion
between a substrate and a probe in every scanning probe lithography and
microscopy technique. Via previous and on-going research, the research team has
established the feasibility of large-range (10mm) multi-axis (XY)
nanopositioning. This represents a 100 times increase in stroke and 10,000 times
increase in the scanning area coverage, compared to current technologies.
