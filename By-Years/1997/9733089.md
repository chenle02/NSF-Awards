The proposed research investigates techniques to enhance the dual properties of
robustness and adaptivity in communications systems. Robustness allows the same
transmission to work consistently well for a wide variety of channel conditions
while adaptivity permits transmitter specialization to match estimated channel
and traffic conditions. We propose investigation of five specific techniques for
improving robustness and adaptivity in practical systems. First, we will develop
new high-rate robust trellis codes to meet industry needs for robustness in
digital audio broadcast and asymmetric digital subscriber loops. Second, we will
identify new families of rate-compatible trellis codes that provide rate
flexibility for transmissions employing large constellations. Third, we will
explore the application of concatenated codes and iterative decoding (i.e. turbo
codes) to the robust coding problem. The fourth topic is the investigation of
channel estimation for robust and rate-compatible trellis codes, and the fifth
topic is an examination of how channel estimation accuracy affects the
information rates achievable with Tomlinson-Harashima precoding.
