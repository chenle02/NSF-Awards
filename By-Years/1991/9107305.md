This research involves the study of the surface characteristics of a model non-
stoichiometric transition metal oxide, tungsten bronze, as a function of
composition using scanning tunneling microscopy and tunneling spectroscopy
techniques. There are two objectives for the research: one is to determine the
geometric and electronic structure of the surface as a function of bulk
composition near the semiconductor-to-metal transition; and the other is to
study the nature of the hydrocarbon absorption sites on the surfaces of these
materials. From these results it will be possible to develop atomistic models to
explain observed macroscopic surface phenomena. A fundamental understanding of
the surface characteristics on non-stoichiometric oxides is essential for
developing interfaces with appropriate adhesion properties, sensors with
increased sensitivities, and catalysts with increased selectivity and
efficiency.
