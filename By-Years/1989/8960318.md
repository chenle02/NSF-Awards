This is a proposal to develop improved coatings to protect implanted electronic
devices from extracellular fluids. The approach is to modify existing parylene
vacuum deposition techniques to make the coating more impervious. Traditional
techniques result in linear carbon linkages, providing a relatively weak liquid
barrier link. The plasma-enhanced deposition method proposed should result in a
highly crosslinked parylene coating. The coatings will be evaluated using
simulated biological solutions.
