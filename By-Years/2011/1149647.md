Our society is becoming increasingly reliant on powerful and interconnected
computing devices that store much of our personal information. These devices
present an ever-growing tension between the desire for our personal information
to be private, and the desire to put our personal information to good use for
our own convenience. In cryptography, problems that involve requirements of
useful computation and privacy are understood through the lens of secure multi-
party computation (SMPC). Specifically, SMPC refers to the problem of how
mutually distrusting parties can securely and collaboratively perform tasks that
involve private information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI will
develop new techniques for understanding and overcoming the challenges and
limitations posed by SMPC protocols. In particular, the following major themes
will be explored: (1) is it possible in the real world to design protocols that
remain secure regardless of other concurrently running protocols? (2) what
security properties can be embedded into objects like ciphertexts and digital
signatures? (3) how can shared data be maintained persistently while remaining
private? The PI will develop new materials for undergraduate courses in
cryptography and algorithms, based on principles of pedagogically sound
visualization. The PI will also create resources for the cryptography research
community, in the form of an online database of cryptographic constructions and
primitives.
