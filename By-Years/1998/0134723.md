At the heart of the genomics revolution has been the democratization of genome
projects of all varieties - EST sequencing, large-scale mapping, and both
limited and complete genome sequencing projects. This has resulted in the
production of large, associated datasets of diverse types that are often
scattered in space, time, and format. This has made comparative analyses
difficult and makes the creation of integrated databases a significant, if not
often insurmountable challenge. The goal will be to discuss and to attempt to
define what is meant by accessible, timely, and usable data and how NSF and USDA
can help to facilitate such data coordination for plant genome data. The
objective is to define the design elements that will ensure modular, extensible,
interoperable, machine and human queryable data structures and interfaces.
