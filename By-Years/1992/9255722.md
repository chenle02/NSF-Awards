This modular, tenth-grade biology curriculum redefines biology instruction so
that the teaching of biology encompasses new concepts and technologies, is
socially relevant, is accessible and stimulating, and builds on the natural
connections between biology, health-related issues and society. Taken together
the six modules constitute a complete curriculum, which is interactive, hands-
on, and inquiry-based, in which information is integrated into a coherent and
related set of concepts which are relevant to students' lives and experiences.
The modules integrate concepts and themes of biology in topics such as
infections diseases, cancer, plants as food and medicine, habitat growth,
mitochondrial Eve, and your body, yourself. The biological concepts of cell and
molecular biology, evolution, energy and metabolism, development, reproduction
and heredity, ecology and human biology are woven into themes of systems and
interactions, energy and matter, evolution and patterns of change, diversity and
variation, and structure and function. Each module contains a teacher's guide,
students materials and performance assessment strategies and instruments, A
Curriculum Planner provides assistance in implementing the curriculum and also a
set of recommendations for program adopters for introducing and implementing the
materials into the school system. The materials are developed by EDC in
collaboration with distributors, evaluators, teachers and school districts.
