The subject of this project is the geometry of configuration spaces of
collections of points inside varieties of small dimension, and more generally,
the moduli spaces of sheaves on these varieties. The main objective is to reveal
new and further explore previously known links between the moduli spaces and
objects in other fields of mathematics, in particular Representation Theory and
Lower Dimensional Topology. The PI will work toward a proof of the mathematical
conjecture relating the topological invariants of the Hilbert scheme of points
on plane singular curves and the HOMFLY knot homology of the links of the
singularities of the curve (Hilb/HOMFLY formula). The conjecture also reveals
unexpected symmetries of the homology of torus knots: conjecturally, they form
an irreducible representation of the rational Cherednik algebra of type A. The
PI will explore the generalized Hilb/HOMFLY conjecture that relates the
representation theory of the symplectic reflection algebras and the rational
Cherednik algebras of types other than A. Finally, the PI describes the
cohomology ring of the compactified Jacobians of quasi-homogeneous
singularities. The PI (jointly with Zhiwei Yum) conjectures a relation between
the cohomology ring of the compactified Jacobian of the curve and the structure
ring of the moduli space of the rational maps to the curve: a local variation of
the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas relation. The educational component of the
project offers a new model for the UMass REU program.

Knot invariants and topological invariants allow us to analyze the global
structure of complicated shapes by collecting local information about the shape.
Complicated shapes occur naturally in biology (e.g. proteins, DNA), theoretical
physics (strings), and other areas of natural science. Thus developing new
invariants and computational methods for understanding of the global structure
of complex shapes is an important mathematical problem with many potential
applications. The PI strives to understand the hidden symmetries of already
discovered invariants, develop new invariants, and find unexpected applications
of these invariants to other areas of mathematics. The PI will also involve
undergraduate students in cutting edge research through a summer research
program integrating mentorship by faculty and graduate students. The PI aims to
attract more students from underrepresented groups to mathematical research by
reserving specific spaces in the summer research program for students from two
local women's colleges. The PI will prepare graduate student mentors during the
year by teaching related graduate classes and a reading seminar. This new summer
research program structure will increase diversity and strengthen vertical
integration in academia and improve the communication and flow of ideas between
different generations of present and future researchers.
