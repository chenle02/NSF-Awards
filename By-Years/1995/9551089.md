This project provides a variety of laboratory experiences using luminescent
techniques that represent current practice in both biology and chemistry. The
project funds the purchase of a versatile emission spectrophotometer with a
number of attachments to enhance its applications. Existing experiments are
being upgraded in the Biochemistry and Physical Chemistry Laboratories. New
experiments are being added in Molecular Biology and Plant Physiology in
addition to Polymer Chemistry. The instrument can also have a major impact on
the research efforts of the three principal investigators.
