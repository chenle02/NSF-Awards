This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project at
Washington State University supports the development of a multi-disciplinary
doctoral training program focused on designing and studying health-assistive
smart environments. This IGERT will provide integrated training in the
complementary disciplines of computer science, electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering, psychology, sociology, and health care to prepare
scientists who can design smart environment techniques and use them to study
aging and the development of health interventions. The faculty of the program
will develop collaborative and sustaining interdisciplinary research
opportunities in this area, provide new interdisciplinary classes that combine
theoretical and practical learning experiences, and build leadership and
cooperation skills through team problem-solving. Students will obtain real-world
experience through internships and will understand user needs by living in on-
campus smart environments. This IGERT program will partner with on-campus
Research Experiences for Undergraduates programs, enhancing participation by
students from underrepresented groups. IGERT participants will conduct research
to determine whether technology can automatically monitor and analyze human
health and behavior, whether it can simulate human behavior and activities,
whether it can enhance human physical and cognitive abilities, and whether these
technologies can be accepted by society. This program is intended to make a
contribution to a generation of a workforce that is trained in multiple,
complementary disciplines and that will open the door to new avenues of health
and science research. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the
challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the
technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of
the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate
education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and
training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends
traditional disciplinary boundaries.
