This engineering education research award to Loyola Marymount University will
employ researchers to create and assess an on-line interactive learning
environment called the Virtual Engineering Sciences Learning Lab (VESLL). The
resources of the popular Second Life fantasy world will be used to create a
cyberlearning environment for engineering students with focus on both discipline
specific content and interdisciplinary professional skills. The virtual learning
environment will offer benefits of visualization and simulation capabilities,
collaborative problem solving, access to remote resources, and immediate
feedback to students. The assessments of VESLL will provide a valuable deeper
understanding of how effective popular virtual environments can be as learning
environments for engineering students. The use of virtual learning environments
can increase interest in engineering and provide more resources to engineering
students to better prepare them for engineering jobs.
