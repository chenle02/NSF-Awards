This proposal will advance the investigator's research in the areas of Fourier
and real analysis. The posed problems lie at the core of the theories of
bilinear pseudodifferential operators and weighted bilinear Poincaré and Sobolev
inequalities and include the development and implementation of bilinear
techniques at their most fundamental level in time-frequency and real analysis,
thus broadening the scope of their applications to Analysis and Partial
Differential Equations. To further these ends, particular attention is given to
the study of boundedness properties in the setting of Lebesgue and modulation
spaces of bilinear pseudodifferential operators and molecular paraproducts, and
to weighted bilinear Poincaré and Sobolev inequalities through the study of
bilinear representation formulas and bilinear fractional integral operators in
the context of Carnot-Carathéodory spaces. Other relevant function spaces
considered in this research program include the scales of Sobolev, Besov,
Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, BMO, weak Lebesgue spaces, and Campanato-Morrey spaces
as well as their weighted versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourier Analysis has
since its origins made many significant contributions to various areas of
mathematics, physics and engineering; the research developed through this
program will positively continue to add to these disciplines. The proposed
research has in particular applications to the theory of nonlinear Partial
Differential Equations from areas of physics such as fluid dynamics, quantum
mechanics and optics. This project will also contribute to the integration of
research and education at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels,
to advancing discovery, forming human resources, and developing academic
curriculum.
