project has established a micro computer classroom with several workstations to
enhance the teaching of undergraduate economics. The classroom itself is
integrated into the College's existing computer network and into the
Department's curriculum. There is access to a VAX minicomputer, and classroom
materials can also be accessed from the dormitories. It is expected that
integration of the classroom into the Department's curriculum will add new
application and interaction techniques to teaching material that is now
presented in a lecture format. The computer classroom is being used in twelve
sections each semester, and students learn to use the computer to enhance their
economics and statistics. In addition, students have access to micro computers
outside of normal class periods to complete class assignments and projects. ***
