0206627&lt;br/&gt;Xiao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a two-day
symposium on "New Trends in &lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear Dynamics and Control, and Their
Applications," to be &lt;br/&gt;held at the Naval Postgraduate School in
Monterey, California &lt;br/&gt;from September 19-20, 2002. The conference will
focus on new &lt;br/&gt;and innovative developments in nonlinear dynamics and
its &lt;br/&gt;applications, such as nonlinear observer design, cooperative
&lt;br/&gt;control, flow control, and bifurcation control. The symposium will
&lt;br/&gt;include several invited 50-minute talks and a series of shorter
&lt;br/&gt;contributed presentations of approximately 20 minutes each. The
&lt;br/&gt;organizers plan to publish proceedings of this meeting in book
&lt;br/&gt;form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid pace of change in technology
constantly presents new &lt;br/&gt;challenges and new opportunities to
researchers in systems and &lt;br/&gt;control, especially those in nonlinear
control. Advances in &lt;br/&gt;materials science, active actuators and sensors,
and fluid &lt;br/&gt;mechanics challenge the community to develop controllers
for &lt;br/&gt;complex nonlinear systems of both finite and infinite dimensions.
&lt;br/&gt;Models of nonlinear systems that are especially interesting to
&lt;br/&gt;researchers in nonlinear control include fluid dynamics, flow
&lt;br/&gt;control, smart materials, and chemical reactions. The nonlinearity
&lt;br/&gt;of these complex systems leads not just to instability but also to
&lt;br/&gt;periodic solutions, bifurcations, and chaos. Recent research shows
&lt;br/&gt;promise for controlling such systems to achieve stability or
&lt;br/&gt;instability. Cooperative control is another research topic of
&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear systems that is attracting increasing attention. Recent
&lt;br/&gt;advances in computing and communications make it possible to
&lt;br/&gt;operate a large number of autonomous or semi-autonomous agents
&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously in a cooperative manner. Such systems involve
&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearities that are far more complicated than those exhibited
&lt;br/&gt;by a single system. Problems involving cooperative control of
&lt;br/&gt;multiple nonlinear systems are found to have numerous
&lt;br/&gt;applications. Several of the presentations and discussions during
&lt;br/&gt;the symposium will address issues related to cooperative control
&lt;br/&gt;and its applications (e.g., control of a satellite constellation,
&lt;br/&gt;multiple munitions). The symposium will provide an opportunity
&lt;br/&gt;for both well-established and young researchers to exchange ideas
&lt;br/&gt;on new developments and directions for future research. These
&lt;br/&gt;new challenges require a review of major developments in
&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear control theory from the past and to discuss new research
&lt;br/&gt;trends to meet the ever-increasing needs of industrial applications.
&lt;br/&gt;Major topics to be addressed in the symposium include new
&lt;br/&gt;developments in the theory of nonlinear systems and control such
&lt;br/&gt;as nonlinear observers, bifurcations and control, and turbulence
&lt;br/&gt;and control.&lt;br/&gt;
