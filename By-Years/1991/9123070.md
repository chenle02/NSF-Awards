The goal of this project is to develop methods for manipulating cell behavior in
three-dimensional gels. This is to be achieved by a systematic study of changes
in cell behavior for human leukocytes and PC12 cells dispersed within collagen
gels. Specifically, cell behavior (i.e. motility and neurite outgrowth) in
collagen gels with different hydration, cell behavior in collagen gels with
added extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and cell behavior in gels with
added biological response modifiers will be examined. By using controlled
release polymers as sources of bioactive agents (antibodies, growth factors,
chemotactic factors,and ECM molecules), cell behavior in well characterized
concentration gradients is also to be quantified.
