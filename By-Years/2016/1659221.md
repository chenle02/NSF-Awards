This grant funds the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in
mathematics at the University of Texas at Tyler. The eight-week program will
take place in the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Each summer, nine students
will work in groups of three with one faculty mentor leading each group. The
program focuses on building confidence of student participants and preparing
them to pursue careers in mathematics. The REU will have a greater effect by
recruiting students from underrepresented groups. In particular, African
Americans, Hispanics, women, and first-generation college students will be
recruited.

The mentors for the REU site will provide research questions that are accessible
to undergraduates, yet interesting to working mathematicians. The goal is to
provide participants the opportunity to conduct original research leading to
publication in professional journals. The research projects are in the areas of
graph theory, combinatorics, and abstract algebra. All topics will be accessible
to students who have taken early proof-based mathematics courses. By the end of
the eight weeks, REU students will write their results in a professional format
and prepare a final talk and a poster suitable for presentation at the Joint
Mathematics Meetings in January.
