0108922&lt;br/&gt;Hirschfeld / Baran&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research
project by an anthropology student from the University of Michigan studies how
children and adolescents learn about race in Belmonte, Bahia, Brazil. The
project advances our understanding of the interactions between child development
and the cultural environment in social category formation. The research will
synthesize two lines of work: cognitive psychology's studies of child
development and anthropology's work on the social and historical construction of
racial classification and inequality. The research design includes participant
observation in schools, extra-school social and family settings; semi-structured
interviews with a sample of family members of focal children and adolescents;
and a racial census with two different conditions to understand the relation
between biological systems of categorization and social identification based on
phenotype as a function of age. The information collected will shape
anthropological theories of childhood and social categorization, and
psychological notions of the universality of cognitive development. In addition
the research advances our understanding of race relations in Brazil and
contributes to the training of a young social scientist. &lt;br/&gt;
