In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Castner will investigate friction in polymer and polymer-
based complex fluids experimentally using time-dependent optical techniques. In
these experiments a simple hypothesis relating the microviscosity of a polymer
solution to the microviscosity of the monomer will be tested, and related
behavior in triblock co-polymers will be explored. Optical-heterodyne detected
Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy will be used to measure the
microviscosities. Recent advances in femtosecond spectroscopic techniques will
help improve the measurements. The widely variable shear viscosity of these
triblock co-polymer gels system will allow incisive tests of the microviscosity
hypothesis. A second set of experiments will explore dynamics in
thermoreversible hydrophilic polymer gels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of these
experiments will lead to better understanding of aqueous polymer solutions and
are of relevance to the design of improved polymer gels for drug delivery and
other applications. This research will be be conducted in collaboration with
theorist Robert Cave of Harvey Mudd College, an undergraduate institution. The
PI also mentors first-year women students from Douglass College in an
Introduction to Scientific Research course. As a result, undergraduates from
Rutgers University, Douglass College, and Harvey Mudd College can obtain
experience in this forefront research area. &lt;br/&gt;
