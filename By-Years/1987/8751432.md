The International Congress on Mathematical Education (ICME) is the most
important forum for exchanges of scientific information among scholars in
mathematics education. The Sixth ICME will be held on July 17 - August 3, 1988
in Budapest, Hungary. Given the current crises in mathematics education, it is
essential that the United States be well represented by key mathematics
educators and that information about the Congress be widely disseminated among
our nation's mathematics educators and educational leaders. The National Council
of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), with the support of the Mathematical
Association of America (MAA), will select 40 delegates to ICME-6 whose travel
will be partially subsidized and who will submit a written summary of the
Congress activities. Those reports along with invited papers by selected
individuals will serve as a basis for a monograph on Congress activities that
will be published by NCTM. Articles will be prepared by the Awards Committee to
be submitted for publication in NCTM and MAA newsletters and journals with a
combined circulation of nearly 70,000. Presentations on Congress proceeding will
be arranged at various NCTM meetings. The necessity to gain mathematics
education on a global basis cannot be too strongly emphasized. Problems in
education appear to be more universal than previously thought. The sharing of
solutions among nations is vital if we are to develop the most effective cures
in mathematics education. Attendance at this Congress by mathematics educators
from the United States and subsequent publications will provide invaluable
information to those persons concerned with the current state of education in
mathematics, an area of significance in future political and economic areas.
