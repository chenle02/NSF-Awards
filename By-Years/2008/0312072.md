This research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by
supercomputer simulations. The focus is to track the coalescence and merger of
binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by
such processes. These processes are primary targets for gravitational wave
detectors currently under construction, like LIGO, and there is an urgent need
for reliable waveforms. The numerical solution of this problem has proved to be
remarkably difficult. The investigators will use a new computational technique
on the problem, pseudospectral collocation. This technique has been successful
in many other areas of the physical sciences, and shows great promise for
numerical relativity.

The research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental
physics. There are currently no real tests of general relativity in the strong
field regime of black holes. For experiments like LIGO to confront theory with
observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the
black holes that LIGO may observe the black holes predicted by Einstein's
theory? The research will also have an impact on the broader area of
computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be
used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics,
meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these
techniques are in great demand.
