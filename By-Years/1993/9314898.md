9314898 bADBadler This is a workshop to exchange views on research directions
and update the mechanisms used by the research community investigating the area
of facial expressions, their semantics, and their animation in the graphical
media. Given the multiplicity and diversity of orientations in the field there
is need for a global assessment of the actual state-of-the-art and of improving
the methods of exchange of data and software. In particular, given the current
state of analysis of facial expressions there is need to find commonality of
tools for the synthesis of the extracted data. This workshop brings together a
small group of leading researcher in the NSF, government, and industrial
research community to define scientifically defensible, computationally
reasonable, and experimentally useful facial models which may provide the basis
for future research. The worksho produces a published account of the proceedings
of the meeting.
