The Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research has been awarded a Small Grant
for Exploratory Research to find rules for predicting the optimal
oligonucleotide to silence a gene. A promising new technology, siRNA (short
interfering RNA), provides an experimental method for studying the function of a
gene by reducing or eliminating its expression. This technology is being used to
study biological processes in model organisms. A properly selected short double
stranded RNA sequence (~21 nucleotides) can silence the expression of a gene.
However, selection of the best sequence among the many choices is still more of
an art than a science. The team will use experimental laboratory data consisting
of multiple siRNAs for many genes. Using novel computational approaches, they
will attempt to discover a set of rules that will help to predict the optimal
sequence for gene silencing. Because of the nature of the data, new statistical
methods will need to be applied to the data. The computational tools built based
on these rules will be useful to scientists wishing to silence specific genes,
specific gene families, or even specific biological pathways within a genome.
