Professor Freiser and his students will investigate the fundamental processes
involved in liquid-liquid solvent extraction of metal species. This project in
the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry will involve kinetic and
thermodynamic studies of solvent extraction mechanisms. Spectroscopic structural
probes will be used to study the exact role of the liquid-liquid interface in
solvent extraction separations. The results obtained from this investigation
will be used to optimize extraction schemes as well as develop new analytical
methods for the separation and extraction of metal compounds from analytical
samples. %%% This project involves an extensive investigation of the fundamental
mechanisms governing the liquid-liquid extraction of metals as metal ion chelate
complexes. Such investigations are particularly significant because liquid-
liquid solvent extraction is a commercially important technique for the
separation and recovery of heavy metals. The results of this investigation will
help to elucidate the mechanisms of similar processes such as liquid partition
and micellar chromatography, membrane-based ion selective electrode responses
and transport processes in biomembranes.
