This NSF supported project involves a multi-disciplinary team who will develop
new manufacturing methods to improve the functionality of dental implants. The
goal of this project is to produce dental implants through new powder processing
technologies to create functionally graded materials that can be biologically
bonded to the human bone. Specifically, the objectives are two-fold: (1) to
develop net shape/near net shape Ti implants of dense core with surface porosity
that are coated with biocompatible hydroxyapatite (HAp) coating and (2) to
characterize the implants in terms of mechanical properties and
biocompatibility. The hypothesis is that bone re-growth will be promoted by the
pores in the Ti that support the penetration of the HAp coating deeply into the
substrate. The dense Ti core will maintain the overall strength. An innovative
processing technique will be used to create an inverted porosity in Ti. Thick
films of HAp will be deposited on Ti using an electrodeposition technique. The
coatings will be characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray
diffraction, Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy techniques. Mechanical property evaluations such as hardness,
fracture strength, and adhesion will be performed to examine the quality of the
as-coated implants. In vitro testing in simulated body fluids will be carried
out to evaluate its bioactivity. The surface characteristics of the implant in
simulated fluid will be studied in situ by an Environmental Scanning Electron
Microscope. The participation of local high school students will be one of the
outreach activities of this project that will introduce them to the Biomedical
Engineering field. The high school students will work with both undergraduates
and graduate students on this project, creating an exciting learning environment
at all levels.
