9615568 Mak This award provides support for a continuing investigation into the
fundamental nature of winter storm tracks in the northern hemisphere. The
project involves three topics: (1) the influence of surface sensible heat input
over the north-western Pacific and Atlantic Oceans; (2) the impacts of
condensational heating on the dynamics of storm tracks; and (3) an exploration
of potential factors responsible for the mid-winter minimum in the Pacific storm
track. The first two investigations will involve modeling studies of the role of
diabatic heating processes in the evolution of storm tracks while the third will
involve diagnostic studies of the 40-year global reanalysis data set produced by
the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Storm tracks are the
regions where synoptic scale eddy activity is statistically most prevalent and
intense. Understanding the dynamics of storm tracks is of fundamental interest
as it relates to the general circulation of the atmosphere - storm tracks are
where the most of the poleward transport of heat and momentum by synoptic eddies
occurs. A considerable portion of the precipitation in the mid-latitudes is
associated with storm tracks. Understanding and accurately simulating storm
tracks has obvious bearing on improving numerical weather prediction and
regional climate forecasting. ***
