Hematopoiesis is the process where all the body's blood and immune cells are
generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These events
take place in, and are controlled by, unique regions of the bone marrow termed
'niches.' The investigators are developing an artificial bone marrow that
provides the correct sequence of niche signals to expand HSCs for clinical use
to treat diseases such as leukemia. However, the rising complexity of these
artificial marrow biomaterials requires new tools to help optimize their design.
The investigators will demonstrate an approach that combines these experimental
studies with computational tools capable of modeling complex systems. This
integrated approach will provide important new knowledge regarding how stem cell
biomanufacturing systems can be designed to control all phases of HSC activity.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a new paradigm for advanced stem
cell manufacturing. Hematopoiesis is the process where the body's blood and
immune cells are generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) whose behavior is regulated by regions of the bone marrow termed niches.
There is an unmet clinical need for stem cell biomanufacturing approaches to
selectively expanding donor HSCs while also priming them for HSC transplants
used to treat a wide range of hematologic diseases. The investigators have
developed a microfluidic platform (engineered marrow analog - eMA) to generate,
then sustain in culture, libraries of optically-translucent hydrogels containing
overlapping patterns of marrow-inspired niche signals. Using a series of
variants of increasing complexity the investigators will dissect how
combinations of microenvironmental cues impact HSC fate decisions. However, the
complexity of these studies demand a theoretical framework to provide insight
regarding how the complex system of signals within the eMA influence HSC
behavior. Thus the investigators will combine experimental studies with a rules-
based modeling framework to describe how constellations of engineered niche
signals dynamically influence HSC fate. This project has two aims: Aim 1:
Construct and validate an experimental-modeling framework to monitor the
dynamics of HSC fate specification in response to eMA culture. Aim 2:
Demonstrate predictive power for scaling eMAs that promote HSC self-renewal. The
boarder impacts of this effort are to train and empower the next generation of
engineers to address emergent challenges at the intersection of biological,
physical, and quantitative sciences. Additionally, the integrated experimental
and theoretical approach to efficiently control stem cell fate demonstrated here
will be of significant interest to the stem cell biomanufacturing community.
