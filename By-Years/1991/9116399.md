This research is concerned with developing autonomous, cooperating, adaptive
computational agents. Expected applications of this research are in the control
of mobile robots capable of performing delivery, maintenance, and/or
construction tasks and of agents that gather and manipulate symbolic information
over comuter networks. The research will concentrate on bounded-time action
computation and learning mechanisms and on combining these components in
integrated agents able to function cooperatively in dynamic, uncertain
environments.
