This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, deals with the mechanisms and synthetic applications of niobocene
complexes of ketenes as oxygen transfer reagents to nitriles, isonitriles and
ketones. The first two classes of substrates are converted to isocyanates (the
conversion of the nitrile involves an alkyl group migration) and the latter to
carboxylic acid esters, with regiochemistry that is opposite to that seen in
traditional Baeyer-Villiger methods. In each case the organometallic product is
a vinylidene complex. A major objective of the work is the development of a
catalytic process for mild oxidation of the above substrates based on the
niobocene vinylidene complex and readily available reagents as oxygen atom
sources. Oxidation is one of the most important reactions in synthetic organic
chemistry. New methods for selective oxidation are therefore important research
targets. This project has as its primary objective the development of a new
catalyst for the mild oxidation of several organic substrates. If successful,
the method could have considerable potential in the synthesis of new
biologically active compounds such as drugs, pesticides, herbicides, etc.
