This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "From
Dynamics to Chaos" conference that will be held from May 7--11, 2012, at the
Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto, Canada.

This conference will cover a variety of topics in analysis (e.g., dynamical
systems, complexity theory, mathematical physics), with partially hyperbolic
dynamics serving as a key unifying theme. All of the conference topics are
central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The
format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to
speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.
