The acquisition of a high-resolution neuromagnetometer will be utilized to study
how active tissue in the brain generates magnetic currents observable outside
the brain and how these currents related to cellular occurrences within the
tissue. Specifically, this study will analyze: 1) the ionic and structural
origin of spontaneous oscillation in the olive- cerebellum system, 2) the
current patterns that precede speeding depression and anoxia in cerebellum and
retina, and 3) correlations between current generation int he brain and
resulting magnetic fields.
