Cyclic di- and tri-sulfides bearing the carbon skeleton of phytol, the C20
isoprenoidal alcohol side chain of chlorophyll a, have recently been recovered
from the organic extracts of various marine sediments. This finding and related
others imply that labile biomarkers undergo reaction with reduced forms of
sulfur such as polysulfide during early diagenetic processes in recent
sediments. Few studies to date have examined the recent sediment record
systematically to retrieve more specific details of this geochemical phenomenon
and to assess the importance of sulfur "quenching" as a viable mechanism of
preservation for labile biomarkers. A multidisciplinary geochemical approach
will be used to explore this problem intensively. The overall goal of the
research is to develop a reliable method of extracting quantitative biomarker
information from the sedimentary component of total organic carbon that is
diagenetically modified by reactions with sulfur. Such information when
complemented with biomarker data obtained from sediments by more conventional
methods might prove invaluable to paleoceanographic research.
