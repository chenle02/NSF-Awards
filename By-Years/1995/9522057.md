This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in the
purchase of a networking IBM RISC workstation. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: theory and computer
simulation of polymers; mechanistic and exploratory organic photochemistry; ab
initio quantum chemistry; theoretical spectroscopy in condensed phases;
molecular shapes and catalyst design; and, local polymer dynamics. A workstation
network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the
computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves
as a development environment for new theoretical cods and algorithms, provides
state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities and supports research.
