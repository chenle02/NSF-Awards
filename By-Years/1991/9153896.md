The Museum will develop an interactive traveling exhibition entitled "Our
Weakening Web: The Study of Extinction" that will explore the process of
extinction and examine the current role humanity is playing in that process. Is
humanity accelerating the rate of extinction by modifying the global
environment? The goals of the exhibit are 1) that visitors discover that
extinction is a natural process, 2) that visitors explore the many ways humanity
is modifying the world,s environment, and 3) that visitors understand how their
actions are related to the world's environmental problems and how they can make
changes in their lifestyles to help protect the environment. Three size versions
(8000 sq. ft., 4000 sq. ft., and 1800 sq. ft.) of the exhibit will be created in
order to maximize the number of museums that are able to accommodate the
exhibit. After its opening in Cincinnati in 1994, it will travel to
approximately twenty-eight museums during the next three to four years. Each
venue will have the exhibit for about four months. Complementary activities will
be developed and manuals describing these as well as sample materials will
accompany each exhibit. These activities will include a teacher's guide, local
resource guide, on- floor demonstrations, short theater presentations, and an
adult lecture series. Sample press kits and copies of all promotional materials
will be included in the exhibit package as well.//
