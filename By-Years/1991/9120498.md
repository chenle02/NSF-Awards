This project is a study of air/sea exchange and tropospheric chemistry of
biogenic trace gases over the oceans. The first phase of the study is on a
shipboard field experiment to determine the diurnal variations of sulfur gases
(DMS, CS2, H2s, and SO2) in the marine boundary layer in order to estimate rates
of emission and atmospheric oxidation. This scientific team will work
collaboratively with other research groups to investigate the relationship
between gas phase chemistry and the chemical and physical characteristics of the
marine aerosol. The field work will be carried out in the eastern South Pacific
ocean. The cruise will be a multi-investigator experiment and is a component of
the MAGE/IGAC (Marine Aerosol and Gas Experiment/International Global
Atmospheric Chemistry) Program.
