This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is to develop
genetically-modified tobacco and fern plants to sense bioavailable arsenic, a
humam carcinogen, that is widely dispersed in the environment. The commercial
application of this project will be to assist in detection and cleanup of
environmental contaminants.
