The PI has been working on the isotope systematics of Iceland basalts for the
past two years. The overall purpose has been to document temporal isotopic
variation along the various rift zones in order to determine the underlying
causes of hot-spot volcanism. This award will allow the PI to finish up some
tasks which are nearly complete.
