This award supports participation of ten US scientists in a joint workshop with
Taiwan to explore current social and psychological theory regarding juvenile
delinquency through comparative analysis and to develop cooperative research
which will help determine the generalizability of prevailing behavioral and
social science theoretical models and research findings. Cross-cultural
comparison of theory and policy in the area of deviance and delinquency will
test current hypotheses which have largely been developed based on research in
Western countries. The different approaches which are used in delinquency
prevention in Taiwan and in the US can serve as tests of the validity of the
theoretical principles on which they are based and may suggest specific research
projects relevant to increased understanding of social, economic, and cultural
conditions affecting response to law.
