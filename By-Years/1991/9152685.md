The current CAD laboratory is upgraded to include a network of computer
workstations which support solids modeling and analysis software. Students in
the mechanical engineering technology and manufacturing and design technology
programs study the concepts and techniques of interactive solids modeling.
Utilizing the solids software students complete assignments that include solid
renderings and the support calculations of the mechanical properties of their
designs. Also, software related to finite element analysis, manufacturing
systems, machining centers, and HVAC design is used to support the design and
analysis components of the curriculum.
