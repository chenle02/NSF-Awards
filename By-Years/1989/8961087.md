TiNi Alloy Company proposes to develop high-force micro-actuators using vacuum
deposited shape-memory alloys. Improved micro-actuators are needed for micro-
mechanical devices now being researched in laboratories (and which will reach
market maturity in a few years) and for at least one device now in commercial
production (a gas chromatograph on a silicon chip). The potential advantage of
shape-memory alloy microactuators over electrostatic devices is several orders
of magnitude increase in force and displacement. TiNi shape-memory alloy
tolerates large strain, 3-5 percent, and produces large stress, greater than 100
mpa. Thin films of TiNi shape-memory alloy, which have been demonstrated in our
laboratory to exhibit a forceful shape recovery, will be incorporated with
silicon components by micro-fabrication. The combined technologies of shape-
memory alloy and silicon will result in a new engineering material for micro-
mechanical applications. The research objectives to be addressed include:
improved vacuum sputtering techniques to improve yield and quality of film;
physical characterization of TiNi film; planar fabrication by masking and
selective etching; and development of functional components such as valve and
pump actuators.
