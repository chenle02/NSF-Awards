Houghton&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0322471&lt;br/&gt;This award supports attendance of
fifteen graduate students to the Cities on Volcanoes conference held in Hawaii
in July-2003, including a volcanology field workshop held the week before the
meeting. Cities on Volcanoes is an annual, multidisciplinary conference, well
attended by scientists from the US and international communities. The field
program is constructed to provide students with a sound background for the
workshop and further work in the discipline. The broader impacts of this award
include unique opportunities for field training in volcanology, exposure to
multidisciplinary research, and opportunities to develop international
collaborations.
