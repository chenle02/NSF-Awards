9629556 Cerling This grant provides $270,000 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring a Nobel gas mass spectrometer equipped with ion counting electronics,
associated extraction and clean up lines at the University of Utah. This
instrument would allow these PI's to conduct in-house research on a wide variety
of topics using noble gas isotopic systematics as a tool. Specific research
projects uould include using the 3H/3He technique for dating groundwater and
tracing groundwater flow paths, dating of geomorphic surface exposures using
cosmogenically produced radionuclides such as 3He, and 21Ne for establishing the
timing of glacial retreat in volcanic terrains, timing of cataclysmic floods,
determining fault recurrence intervals, and reconstructing continental
paleotemperature records using noble gas measurements in aquifers. ***
