The goal of this conference is to introduce a mathematically oriented audience
to sensor array imaging in cluttered media. This is an emerging
interdisciplinary area in applied mathematics, with roots in wave propagation,
random media, statistics, optimization and numerical analysis. Over the years,
our ability to deploy very large sensor arrays and to collect large data sets
has increased steadily, but the available imaging methodology is reaching its
limits. Its foundations must be reexamined in an interdisciplinary framework,
its resolution limits must be reassessed and the robustness to noise and clutter
has to be addressed.

Some very interesting results have emerged in recent years: Novel adaptive
imaging algorithms for cluttered media have been developed and put in a clear
mathematical framework. New approaches to resolution theory, such as the concept
of statistical stability of the imaging process and quantification of resolution
loss caused by clutter have been advanced. Novel image enhancement-techniques
have been obtained using tools from statistics, wave propagation in random media
and modern optimization. The principal lecturer of the conference, Professor
George C. Papanicolaou, has been at the forefront of this research. His lectures
will introduce mathematicians from academia, the oil industry and medical
imaging to a new and mathematically advanced technology in imaging science. This
is a technology with potential for a big impact in crucial applications such as
seismic exploration, ultrasonic, non-destructive testing of aging concrete
structures, foliage or ground penetrating radar, etc.
