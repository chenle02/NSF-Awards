Plant cells synthesize a variety of defense compounds upon stimulation with
pathogen-derived or plant cell wall-derived molecules termed elicitors. While
much is known concerning the nature of these elicitors and the types of defense
molecules produced in response to elicitation, virtually nothing is known about
the sequence of events involved in transducing the extracellular elicitor signal
into the cell's nucleus. The objective of this research is to identify those
signal transduction and amplification processes which occur at the plasma
membrane during elicitation. Using signal transduction pathways in animal cells
as models, the goals of this project are to evaluate the possible participation
of the following signaling mechanisms during elicitation of phytoalexin
formation: 1) calcium transport, 2) proton transport, 3) changes in membrane
potential, 4) changes in trans-plasma membrane dehydrogenase activity, and 5)
changes in phosphatidylinositol turnover. Emphasis will be placed on mechanisms
1, 2, and 3. A detailed understanding of signal transduction processes in plant
cells is of great intrinsic interest and may eventually contribute to the
rational design of strategies for manipulating the various defense and growth
responses in plants.
