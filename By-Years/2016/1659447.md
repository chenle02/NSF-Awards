A new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of
Oregon Eugene's Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB) located in Charleston,
OR will be developed with this award. The program will support a total of ten
students each summer for a nine-week research program. The project model
includes offering research opportunities to students from 2-year colleges using
a tiered learning model with pairs of students working with mentors to conduct
research. Funding supports student stipends, housing and student travel expenses
from their home to the site. A total of thirty students will gain experience in
scientific research and participate in a variety of professional development
workshops during the three years of the grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students
will have the opportunity to conduct research in a wide range of biological
sciences, including research on the ecology of invertebrate embryos, larvae, and
juveniles; trophic interactions in food webs; biology and systematics of the
ribbon worms; ecological interactions of organisms with coastal physical
oceanographic and environmental processes; the ecology and hydromechanical
function in gelatinous zooplankton; cell biology; estuarine fish and
invertebrate ecology, and the ecology of deep-sea and subtidal invertebrates.
