CHENEY 9714917 The Secretary of the Navy has been designated the Executive
Agent of the Department of Defense (DoD) for the logistics support functions of
the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP). The Executive Agent will transfer to the
Secretary of the Air Force (Mar 98) and the Air National Guard (ANG) will assume
command and control of Operation Deep Freeze in accordance with the DoD/National
Science Foundation Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated 21 Jan 1997. During the
transition from the Navy to the Air Force, both the Navy and Air National Guard
provide support to the USAP. This award provides direct funding to the Air
National Guard for their portion of the support. The logistics support provided
by the ANG includes, but is not limited to, the air transportation of USAP
personnel, equipment, and materials; the operation of support facilities at the
109th Airlift Wing Schenectady, New York, Christchurch, New Zealand, and McMurdo
Station Antarctica; and the support of field science projects in Antarctica.
Normally, in order to exercise proper oversight and accommodate changing
requirements, funds under this MOA are awarded incrementally. This is the first
increment, in the amount of $2,000,000.00 for Fiscal Year 1997 funding, to be
awarded to the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Andrews AFB MD and will
provide operating funds for the 109th Airlift Wing through August 1997.
