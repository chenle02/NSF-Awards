The everyday world is pervaded by computational devices laptops, smart phones,
and many other personal and household electronic devices make it increasingly
easier to find solutions to any computational problem one may have. However when
it comes to physical problems in the real world, personal technology lags far
behind: typical users often have minimal to no interaction with robots in daily
life. The research in this project aims to address unmet needs, creating the
technology necessary to make robotics as ubiquitous as computing is today; by
democratizing access to robot creation reducing barriers to entry we can advance
technology in developing fields, bring opportunities for technical advancement
to under-served communities, and excite and encourage students to further their
education throughout the country and the world. The project will result in
creation of user-friendly tools that allow anyone with any background or
expertise to design custom, personalized robots. The research will include
development of new fabrication processes that enable the on-demand fabrication
of the designed robots. Also, new algorithms and frameworks will be investigated
for expanding autonomous control of distributed networks of these devices. The
goal of the project is for everyone to eventually be able to say, for any
personal physical task that needs to be solved, "there's a robot for
that."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research plan will address theory and
systems issues under the three parallel thrusts of design, fabrication, and
control for pervasive personal robots. Ubiquitous cyber-physical systems must
deliver uniquely specified functionality, and so this program will investigate
design automation algorithms that generate manufacturable specifications from
high-level task descriptions provided by inexpert users, feeding back
verification and validation results into user-in-the-loop and automated
optimization. These designs must then be realized into integrated
electromechanical machines at a personal scale, for which this research will
explore rapid manufacturing tools and processes that use robust mechanical
materials and integrated electromechanical metamaterials for subtractive
manufacturing and develop discrete microfabricated active elements for additive
manufacturing. Finally, these robots must be controlled; this program will
investigate universal communications and control subtasks at an integrated
system level, using the intended ubiquity of personal robots to develop
algorithms and protocols for distributed localization, communication-aware
motion planning, and mobility-enhanced networking.
