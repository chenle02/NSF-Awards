This project explores next-generation neural computing based on oscillatory
behavior of neuron columns found in the visual cortex and olfactory bulbs of
mammals. The biological basis for looking further than magnitude of signals is
sufficient as supported by recent discoveries such as evidence of oscillations
in the olfactory bulbs of rabbits which helped them to determine the sex and age
of other rabbits. That state of neuron would not be considered as a simple level
or magnitude, but rather a combination of magnitude, frequency, phase, and
perhaps other attributes, of its output relative to other neighboring neurons.
This research seeks to analyze and characterize the behavior of coupled
oscillatory systems by mathematically deriving closed-form solutions to the
dynamic equations and simulation, the behavior of the coupled oscillatory
columns can be observed by varying the stimulus, self-feedback gain, lateral
coupling, and frequency parameter of oscillation. The effects of Gaussian noise
on large networks of oscillatory columns will also be investigated.
