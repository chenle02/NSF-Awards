The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is the chemistry of compounds of main-group elements in
aqueous solution. Main-group elements include sulfur, oxygen, chlorine, nitrogen
and selenium, and the reactions of main-group compounds are involved in a
variety of processes of great ecomomic and social importance, ranging from
something as mundane as the action of chlorine bleach to the environmentally
important formation of acid rain. The primary focus of this project is the
oxidation and reduction of main-group compounds, especially through free radical
intermediates. One set of reactions will use substitution-inert coordination
compounds as the reaction partners, which will have the advantage of relatively
predictable reaction mechanisms. Oxidation of sulfite by a Ru(III) complex will
be used to estimate the standard redox potential of the sulfite radical, and is
expected to demonstrate the novel process of free-radical sulfonation. This and
studies with related complexes will be used to elucidate the factors affecting
electron transfer at pyramidal molecules. Oxidation of NO by a Ni(III) complex
will be studied to provide insight on the obscure phenomenon of nuclear
tunneling. Nuclear tunneling will be probed further in studies of the outer-
sphere reduction of BrCN and through kinetic isotope effects in the oxidations
of nitrite ion and NO. The other class of reactions to be investigated is redox
reactions between main-group molecules. The self-exchange rate for the
dioxygen/superoxide couple will be measured directly. Other reactions in this
class will probe the hypothesis that electron transfer between main-group
species invariably proceeds with rates much greater than predicted by Marcus
theory.
