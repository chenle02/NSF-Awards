9410645 Mooney This Research Planning Grant was designed to aid in the
preparation of a proposal by the principal investigator to facilitate
preliminary studies in the modeling respiratory sinus arrhythmia in the human
fetus. By examining the low and high frequency regions of the heart rate
variability power spectra, the developmental course of sympathetic-
parasympathetic balance is examined. Chaos analysis will be used to determine
whether the system is deterministic, and allow a deeper understanding of the
system. ***
