The New York State Museum houses numerous collections dealing with the
archaeology of New York State and the northeast. These materials are
irreplaceable and crucial to our understanding of the prehistory of the eastern
United States. Collected systematically by prominent archaeologists, they are an
important research resource both for the long sequence of occupation that they
represent and for their regional character. Unfortunately, they have suffered
because of past housing problems and lack of care of accompanying documentation.
The New York State Museum recently moved to new climate- controlled quarters.
This project, part of a three stage program, will upgrade curatorial standards.
Dr. Lynne Sullivan and her assistants will focus on accompanying documentation
and correcting accessibility problems, through creation of a centralized
repository, computerized cross-referencing with related artifact collections,
and a conservation survey. This project is important because these significant
archaeological materials cannot be properly utilized unless placed in their
proper site and stratigraphic context. For this, easy access to the relevant
documentation is essential.
