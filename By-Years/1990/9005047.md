We are examining the telomere region of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster,
as a model for metazoan telomeres. We have shown that in Drosophila, in contrast
to yeast, a chromosome from which the terminus has been deleted can be
transmitted for many generations. Our structural analysis of the subterminal
portion of the telomere region has revealed a complex interspersion of different
repetitive sequences. Preliminary results suggest an unexpectedly high frequency
of terminal and subterminal length variations. In addition, we have documented a
case in which the expression of a gene was repressed when it was transposed to a
subterminal site. The termini of eukaryotic chromosomes, called telomeres, are
specialized structures thought to be required for chromosome stability. It has
recently been shown that a characteristic terminal sequence motif is conserved
among unicellular eukaryotes, vertebrates and higher plants. In many eukaryotes
the telomere region also encompasses more complex repetitive sequences that are
shared among all or a subset or the chromosome tips. Telomeres have been studied
most extensively in single-celled eukaryotes and there is little known about the
overall sequence organization, functions, or dynamics of the telomere region of
multicellular eukaryotes.***
