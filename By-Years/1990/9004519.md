This project investigates the evolutionary patterns of gastropod shell biota
from subtropical and tropical Miocene to Recene assemblanges as a function of
ecological opportunities and preservational biases created by hermit crabs. PI
will study shell bionts associated with a guild of marine hermit crabs, living
snails, empty and experimental tethered shells in two habitats (rocky intertidal
and sandflat) in Purerto Penasco, Mexico. I will identify guilds of bionts
associated with each shell inhabitant and formulate criteria by which these
shell occupants (snail or hermit crab), and their prospective habitats, can be
recognized in the fossil record. I will then determine, using the fossil record,
if these bionts are (1) recurrent as guilds or change through time as a result
of hermit crabs providing a novel substrate (the empty gastropod shell), (2)
adequate to distingush the evolutionary history of the hermit crab, and (3)
indicative of how much the gastropod fossil record has been biased by hermit
crabs, thus potentially biasing gastropod paleoecology. Hermit crabs may have
caused evolutionary breakthroughs in shell biota and this biota, in turn, may be
indicative of the little known fossil history of hermit crabs and their shell
use through time. Research will address how ecoligcal interactions may have
changed through time.
