9415286 Sideris Constrained H-inf optimal control (CH-inf) provides a framework
for robust control system design with mixed time and frequency domain
specifications. In Choo, the frequency domain specifications are formulated in
terms of an Hoo-norm minimization problem and the time domain constraints in
terms of hard bounds on specified time responses of the closed-loop system such
as step responses, etc. The latter are expressed as affine constraints on the
solution of the Hoo optimization problem and thus are treated exactly instead of
being approximately converted to frequency domain specifications. The complete
solution to this problem has been obtained for general discrete time
multivariable systems and it consists of solving a finite dimensional convex
minimization problem (FDOP) and a standard Hoo optimization problem. The
research will extend the current status of CH-inf optimization in many
significant ways. More specifically, first a Ch-inf framework in which
structured model uncertainty is handled with reduced conservatism will be
obtained and thus an even broader set of specifications (time and frequency
domain specifications, structured and parametric model uncertainty) can be
addressed directly. ***
