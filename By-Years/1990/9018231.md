The molecular properties and the regulation of the carriers involved in the
sodium cycle of extremely alkaliphilic bacteria are the focus of the research
planned. Transposon mutagenesis will be used to identify genes of Bacillus
firmus OF4 that encode the Na+/H+ antiporter or its regulatory genes. This
approach, coupled with analysis of gene sequences, should provide a key initial
step in the definition of these antiporters characteristic of extreme
alkaliphiles and permit rigorous testing of hypotheses about the functioning of
such antiporters. Bacteria which thrive under alkaliphilic conditions carry out
a cycling of sodium using proton pumps. The molecular properties of, and the
regulation of, the carriers involved in the unusal, membrane-related events of
these bacteria will be studied and should lead to a more complete understanding
of the functioning of these carriers in extreme alkaliphiles.
