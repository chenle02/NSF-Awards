Research will be conducted on a number of problems &lt;br/&gt;in Several Complex
Variables and Cauchy-Riemann&lt;br/&gt;Geometry. More specifically, the better
&lt;br/&gt;understanding of various rigidity phenomena in &lt;br/&gt;complex
analysis and complex geometry will be sought.&lt;br/&gt;The study the analytic
structure of real surfaces&lt;br/&gt;in the complex space of dimension two, and
the &lt;br/&gt;investigation of its intrinsic connections with &lt;br/&gt;many
well-known problems in classical mechanics&lt;br/&gt;will be pursued.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex numbers and functions of complex
variables&lt;br/&gt;have become, since the 19th century,
indispensable&lt;br/&gt;tools in many areas of mathematics and in
its&lt;br/&gt;application to other areas of science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, the solutions of many problems in the
applied&lt;br/&gt;sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in
&lt;br/&gt;these complex analytic tools and a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of
their basic properties. For instance,&lt;br/&gt;in material science the standard
method for treating&lt;br/&gt;multidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to
&lt;br/&gt;represent them as complex numbers or, in more&lt;br/&gt;complicated
situations, as complex functions. It then &lt;br/&gt;turns out, for instance,
that the direction of the &lt;br/&gt;propagation of cracks in materials is
related to the &lt;br/&gt;properties of certain equations
associated&lt;br/&gt;with these complex numbers or functions. Results of
&lt;br/&gt;the research to be carried out in this project could&lt;br/&gt;lead
to the discovery of new properties&lt;br/&gt;of solutions of these
equations.&lt;br/&gt;
