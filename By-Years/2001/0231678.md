The Pacific Resources for Education and Learning (PREL) is requesting a planning
grant for the development of a Masters of Science degree program in Program
Evaluation as a distance learning program. The two-year program will offer
approximately 36-semester credits for courses focused on program evaluation
theory and techniques, research methods and statistics. The program will be
modeled after PREL's distance learning MS degree program in Instructional
Technology and Telecommunications. Courses will be offered in an asynchronous
online format. Instruction will be self-paced and students will interact with
faculty and each other through e-mail, videoconferencing and web
boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI believes that training in evaluation for
personnel in educational settings will increase organizational capacity to
assess the effectiveness of their educational efforts in STEM and lead to
improved educational outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;
