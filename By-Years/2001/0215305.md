This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is directed to
the development of a novel planar excimer lamp. This lamp design offers numerous
potential advantages over conventional cylindrical coaxial lamps which includes
high irradiance (>100 mW/cm2), uniform area illumination, compact size, improves
cooling, longer life, and lower cost. This lamp will be designed to be easily
integrated able in tools used in the manufacture of electronic devices. Excimer
lamp applications include in-situ reticule cleaning, in-situ pre-deposition
cleaning, photochemical vapor deposition, and UV curing. Conventional UV lamps
are inadequate for these tasks. Excimer lasers, which can easily illuminate a
large field size, are often inadequate at integrating into a production tool,
and have a very high cost of ownership. Three goals has been established to
guide this work in: 1) design and fabricate a planar excimer lamp with novel
electrode structure and lamp cell design, 2) evaluate the area uniformity of the
narrow band excimer emission, and 3) measure the UV spectra, radiant power
output, and efficiency of the lamp filled with KrCl* (222 nm) or XeCl*(308 nm).

The technology, once successfully developed, will be used the semiconductor
manufacturing industry.
