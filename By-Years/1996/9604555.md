9604555 Ashe Everyday limb movements can be described both in terms of the
forces that the muscles produce and in terms of the more spatial, descriptive
aspects of the movement such as trajectory, direction, position, and velocity.
The brain controls all aspects of limb movement, but it is not known how the
brain codes the different aspects of movement. The basis of this project is the
hypothesis that the brain controls both muscle force generated during a movement
and the spatial aspects of that movement together by regulating the stiffness
(force/position), viscosity (force/velocity) and inertia (force/acceleration) of
a moving limb. To test this, the project monitors the activity of cells in the
motor control area of the brain during the execution of a trained arm movement
performed under different conditions. Sophisticated statistical techniques
developed by the experimenters are then used to extract the rules used by cells
in this brain area to control arm movements. Potential long-term significance of
this work includes the application of the understanding of brain codes for
movement to the development of prosthetic devices, the treatment of movement
disorders, and the development of robotic systems.
