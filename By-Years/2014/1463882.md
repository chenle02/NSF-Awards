The interplay between number theory and algebraic geometry has been a source of
inspiration in modern mathematics. Having led to the solution of a number of
outstanding conjectures, such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Mordell
Conjecture, it continues to give rise to deep and important problems in algebra.
Local-global principles are a central theme in this interplay of subjects, and
many important outstanding problems can be expressed in terms of such
principles. This project has the objective of understanding local-global
principles and their obstructions, in contexts that are broader than those
considered in number theory. The project will also support and enhance the
training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers through seminars,
conferences and workshops, and mentoring activities.

The Focused Research Group will focus on local-global principles for algebraic
structures defined over function fields of curves over base fields such as
p-adic fields, with a longer term goal of treating the case of function fields
of curves over global fields. The obstructions to such local-global principles
can often be formulated in terms of cohomology. Our project aims to study the
finiteness of these obstructions and determine criteria for them to vanish. The
resulting understanding will be applied to proving conjectures and solving open
problems concerning algebraic structures such as quadratic forms and associative
algebras. This will include situations that have been studied by many
researchers but where solutions had previously seemed out of reach. Research
methods will include field patching, cohomological methods including residues
and duality, and approaches from geometry.
