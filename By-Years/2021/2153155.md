While forward optimization methods seek to calculate the optimal values of
decision variables for given values of model parameters, the goal of inverse
optimization is to infer parameters that render given values of decision
variables optimal, i.e., prescribing needed actions or inputs to achieve an
optimal result. This grant will contribute to the advancement of national
health, prosperity, and welfare by developing a computational framework to
efficiently solve a large class of inverse optimization models. The methodology
will be applied to system identification problems in cancer radiotherapy to help
validate current treatment protocols. The PI will mentor doctoral students on
this research topic throughout the project. Results will be incorporated into a
graduate-level course and two new books that the PI is drafting, as well as
workshops and seminars on applications of optimization for underrepresented
students in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current inverse optimization
literature focuses almost entirely on imputing objective function parameters.
There has been little work on imputing constraint parameters because these
inverse optimization models are nonconvex, bilinear and hence difficult to
solve. The project will pursue two approaches to solve these models: (1)
conversion into equivalent convex problems via a variable transformation, if
possible; and (2) a suite of tailored approximation algorithms that solve a
sequence of convex problems, if not. The researched methods will be evaluated
computationally against classic branch-and-bound algorithms using several
publicly available data sets, together with an in-depth case study in cancer
radiotherapy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
