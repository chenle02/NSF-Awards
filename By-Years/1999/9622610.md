Abstract Prezbinda This project is concerned with a microlocal study of
characters and matrix coefficients of irreducible unitary representations of
classical Lie groups in the context of Howe's theory of real reductive dual
pairs. The goal is to understand the characters, matrix coefficients and wave
front sets of such representations in terms of the moment maps which occur
naturally in that theory. These are the moment maps of classical invariant
theory. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician
Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics.
As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system,
the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon
mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics. The mathematical techniques, on which this particular project is based,
are also useful in signal processing, data compression and cryptography.
