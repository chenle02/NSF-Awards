The University of Florida's Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program is a
collaborative effort between the National Science Foundation, the Florida-
Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, the University's
Graduate School and its four colleges with STEM disciplines, the Colleges of
Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Agricultural and Life Sciences, and
Medicine. Integrating research and education, students will engage in cutting
edge research experiences through the Particle Engineering Research Center, The
McKnight Brain Institute, the Center for Chemical Research at the Bio/Nano
Interface and over 100 other interdisciplinary centers at the University of
Florida and alliance institutions. The term of the program is 24
months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program activities provide student graduate
opportunities and linkages to the Southeast Alliance for Graduate Education in
the Professoriate (SEAGEP) and other graduate associations as well as the
commitment of support for graduate education through the science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
total of 12 students from underrepresented minority populations in STEM fields
will participate in the program at the University of Florida during the
2008-2010 academic years. Results from this support will broaden the
participation of African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Pacific-
Islanders in the STEM pipeline, U. S. workforce and abroad. Results from
rigorous evaluation of the project will add to the body of literature in the
recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students in STEM fields.
