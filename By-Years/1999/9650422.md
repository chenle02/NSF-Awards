Since 1992, the Introductory Biology course has been taught as a tightly
integrated lecture/laboratory experience involving group-based semester-long
projects. One theme of the course, and of a special science course cluster for
freshmen, is the study of light as a signal (gene regulation), as an energy
source (bioenergetics), and as a tool for studying biological processes. This
project makes heavy use of UVMS spectroscopy, some fluorimetry, and some
microscopy. To increase students' understanding and appreciation of the role of
light in biological processes, the department needs to add the techniques of
fluorescent microscopy to increase the levels of measurement. In addition, the
department is arranging to increase the opportunities for observing and
recording experiments with the addition of another stereomicroscope with video
camera and printer. Previously, there have only been limited controlled
environment space and growth facilities for plant tissue cultures, cell
suspension, and algal cultures. There is an effort to increase the capabilities
for alternative environments so that students have more choices for
experimentation. Students who have completed these sorts of laboratory
experiences are much more demanding in their later courses and tend to drive the
department in new directions. They also disseminate to other students the
message that research is intellectually stimulating and fun.
