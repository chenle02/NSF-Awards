9619715 Barnicki ABSTRACT This REU program, has several important objectives
including a) exposing more undergraduate students - both external to MSOE and
internal - to the fascinating technological opportunities made possible through
Solid Freeform Fabrication, b) contributing real research results and
publications in a field which vitally needs to understand and improve materials,
processes and applications, c) examine opportunities in photonics, biomedicine
and manufacturing and d) successful recruiting of women, minorities and disabled
undergraduate students. In turn, this will significantly enhance these students'
knowledge, experience, professional growth and confidence; it also is expected
to be a major factor in their retention and has increased the likelihood of
their going to graduate school. Undergraduate students will be recruited for
both summer and academic year research, with target numbers of 3 during the
academic year, growing to 8 during the summer, at least 30-40% being non-MSOE
students during the summer. These students will work with other undergraduates
and graduates in this vigorous and exciting Center of Excellence. To ensure the
continual improvement of the REU program, a periodic evaluation effort will be
carried out in two ways: a) self evaluation of project activities by the student
participants in the REU program and b) evaluation by a team that will include
faculty members associated with the REU projects. The project director will use
these faculty researchers to ensure the success of the REU program. ***
