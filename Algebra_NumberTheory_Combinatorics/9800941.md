9800941 Shimozono The proposed research project is a combinatorial and
algebraic study of the category of finitely generated graded modules over the
coordinate ring of the affine space of n by n complex matrices, which are
supported in the closure of a nilpotent conjugacy class and afford a compatible
action of the general linear group. The Grothendieck group of this category is
generated by a distinguished family of modules, whose isotypic components have
Poincare polynomials with marvelous combinatorial properties. This subject
provides a beautiful example of the interplay among classical subjects such as
the geometry of conjugacy classes, characteristic-free invariant theory, and the
combinatorics of Young tableaux, and the modern representation theory of quantum
groups and two-dimensional solvable lattice models in statistical mechanics.
This research is in the area of Algebraic Combinatorics, which is a discipline
within mathematics which uses discrete structures and algorithms to analyze
algebraic systems. It has recently enjoyed rapid growth and unprecedented
success, since symbolic computation can often be employed to help solve its
problems. This particular proposal has connections with physics, more
specifically, with statistical mechanics.
