The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is in the creation of a much-
needed alternative to biosolids disposal. Biosolids are a by-product of
wastewater treatment; their formation and disposal contribute to significant
air, water, and soil pollution. In particular, biosolids contribute to
greenhouse gas emissions and the release of over 350 organic contaminants,
including high concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).
Biosolids disposal challenges are expected to grow due to population increases
and stricter environmental regulations. Current biosolids disposal options have
shortfalls and disposal costs are increasing. This project develops a
breakthrough technology that cleanly and affordably destroys the organic
contaminants present in biosolids. Air, water and soil pollution will be
reduced, and, importantly, wastewater treatment plants will be able to meet new
regulatory standards for sustainability. Volume of final by-product, and
therefore transport cost and associated emissions, will be decreased by over
85%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project turns supercritical water
oxidation (SCWO) into an energy-efficient technology by recovering compressive
energy. SCWO rapidly and completely destroys organics. To date, the technology
has been used in few applications, including chemical weapons dismantling.
Recovery of compression energy saves 30-40% of total treatment cost, opening new
markets, such as wastewater treatment. Recovery of compression energy during
SCWO has been demonstrated previously. This project's goals are to further
optimize, scale-up and iterate on compression energy recovery equipment for
added capacity and reliability, and long-term field test these updated/new
pieces of equipment by adding them to an existing supercritical water oxidation
pilot system. The goal for the system is to achieve reliability on par with
industrial high-pressure compressors, which can operate over 24,000 hours
between major services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
