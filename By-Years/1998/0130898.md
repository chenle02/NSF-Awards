EIA-130898-John Granacki-University of Southern California- Architectures for
Neuromimetic Information System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biologically inspired
computing modules performing spatio-temporal pattern recognition will be a key
aspect of future computing systems. Current prototypes of biomimetic circuit
models have demonstrated real-time performance at very low power levels and high
physical density. Further, these simple structures are capable of recognizing
signal patterns masked by significant noise levels. These properties are
difficult to mimic in digital signal processing algorithms, which require
substantial modification when adapting to new
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to implement second-order dynamic
synapse neural models with digital equivalents that use features extracted from
software simulations. Arrays of these digital equivalents can be readily
implemented in dense re-useable commercial field-programmable gate arrays
(FPGAs), enabling very high-speed operation. Additional features, such as
writeable registers for user tuning of dynamics, will accelerate the evaluation
of new kernels as well as enable investigation of high-speed "super-time"
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
