The project addresses questions in Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry. It is proposed
to study the distribution of rational points on algebraic varieties over number
fields, and to explore the interplay between global geometric invariants and
arithmetic properties of varieties. The focus is on proving potential density
for families of varieties, such as Fano varieties or Calabi-Yau varieties, and
on establishing asymptotic formulas for the number of rational points of bounded
height on equivariant compactifications of groups and homogeneous spaces.

The proposed research ranges from explicit numerical experiments to advanced
problems in modern and rapidly developing areas of mathematics. This work will
have a broader impact on the education of students and training of young
mathematicians, as there is a rich supply of concrete questions and examples,
consolidating our understanding of the subject and leading to new structures.
Increasingly, applications of Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry are spreading to
vital areas of information storage, processing and transmission; these
applications rely on further advances on fundamental problems to be addressed in
this proposal.
