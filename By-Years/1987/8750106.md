The recent acquisition of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer by the
Chemistry Department at Washington and Lee University is affording students
additional opportunities to become familiar with a broad spectrum of modern
instrumental techniques. Specific applications of NMR spectroscopy have been
incorporated into quantitative analysis, organic chemistry, organic qualitative
analysis, instrumental analysis, and biochemistry. In addition, NMR is used
extensively in the undergraduate research participation program, which has been
a strong emphasis in the Department for many years.
