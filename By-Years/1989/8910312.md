Investigations will be pursued into: automorphisms of the recursively
enumerable (r.e.) sets, a combinatorial problem related to initial segments of
the truth-table r.e. degrees, and Borel orderings. These are topics in the
foundations of mathematics and computer science, underpinning our notions of
what constitutes a proof.
