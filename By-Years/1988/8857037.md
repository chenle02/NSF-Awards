Experiments are planned that will combine conventional surface analytical
techniques with new laser-based methods to examine surface chemistry in the
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin semiconductor films, particularly of
gallium arsinide. These laser techniques include photoreflectance (PR) and
surface second harmonic generation (SHG). They will be used to examine the
individual steps of adsorption, surface diffusion, and desorption in the overall
deposition mechanism. Surface bond energies, surface diffusion coefficients, and
adsorbate interactions will be measured. The surface chemistry of CVD remains
virtually uncharted. This lack of understanding may result from the weakness of
the interactions between gases and semiconductors. Ambient pressures greater
than 10-4 Torr are often required to induce significant chemistry, but at these
pressures most conventional surface analytical tools (which employ charged
particles) fail. PR and SHG have not been widely employed but are effective at
such pressures. Furthermore, high spatial resolution (~0.5 micron) makes these
techniques particularly suited for measurements of surface diffusion. Such data
are currently nonexistent for semiconductors, even though surface diffusion is
expected to be rate-limiting in many deposition reactions. Surface chemistry
controls impurity incorporation, defect formation, low-temperature growth rates,
and many other deposition phenomena that are vitally important to the
manufacture of thin semiconductor films. Reliable surface reaction rates and
mechanisms are crucial for intelligent CVD reactor design. This is particularly
true for gallium arsinide, for which the current trial-and-error approach to
film growth has yielded only mixed results; the potential application of gallium
arsinide to high-speed circuits and to optoelectronic devices for communications
warrants a major effort toward the understanding of surface growth phenomena.
