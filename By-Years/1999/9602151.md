With National Science Foundation support Dr. Vernon Smith will purchase 20 90
mHz Pentium `IBM type compatible` micro computers, 27 16 MB RAM upgrades for
existing machines and a portable high resolution projection system to upgrade
and expand the University of Arizona Economic Science Laboratory. Dr Smith is a
leader in experimental economics and he and his collaborators have worked to
develop experimental situations in which human subjects make choices which have
real potential economic rewards. Computerization has made it feasible to design
various real time market institutions, to study their performance in the
laboratory and thus gain insight into how markets function and how humans
respond. Beginning about a decade ago laboratory experiments started to explore
the performance of `smart` computer assisted markets. In these experimental
markets the messages (bids) of decentralized agents are processed using various
optimization algorithms applied to batches of bids or to bids arriving in real
time. This has greatly expanded the demands on hardware capacity and software
sophistication. As these experimental markets have become technologically more
complex, and demanding of system design and support, they have also become more
demanding on the ability of human subjects to articulate rational message
responded based on judgment and calculation. Consequently the next generation of
experimental markets will require `expert system` computer support at each
station for the decision maker(s) at that station. The computers provided in
this award will make such an advance possible. In addition to increasing
understanding of principles which underlie human economic behavior, experimental
economics serves a number of practical functions. It helps regulators and
government officials to design systems to allocate scarce resources such as
radio wave space or airline gates and to design effective bidding processes. At
Arizona the programs developed will also be incorporated into the teaching of
economics on both a local and worldwide basis.
