With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support for the work of Professor David B. Collum of the
Department of Chemistry at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. The research will
extend the PI's work on structure-reactivity relationships and their correlation
with important synthetic reactions in organolithium chemistry. The research will
focus on four major reactions: 1,2 additions, ortholithiations, Fries
rearrangements, and benzyne formation. A combination of NMR spectroscopic
investigations, kinetic measurements, and computational chemistry will be used
to probe the interplay between solvation, aggregation, and reactivity in these
important reactions. The proposed investigations are expected to provide
synthetic chemists with much valuable information and allow extensions of
ogranometallic chemistry into new applications.

Since many of the reagents to be investigated in this project are also used to
prepare some of the most pharmaceutically important drugs, these studies offer a
unique interface between basic academic and applied industrial research.
Collaborations with pharmaceutical laboratories, in areas such as the
preparation of anti-addiction drugs, will continue during this funding period.
This work will provide valuable professional preparation for students in an
important field that bridges academic and industrial chemistry.
