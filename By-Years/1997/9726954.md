This award supports a dissertation enhancement project on how to reconcile
quantum mechanics with the theory of relativity. The graduate student, Alisa
Ellingson, proposes to conduct research under the direction of James Cushing of
the University of Notre Dame and in cooperation with Harvey Brown of the
University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. The objective of the research is to
study a new formulation of relativity which postulates a preferred reference
frame, yet makes all of the same empirical predictions as the theory of special
relativity. Claims of empirical evidence will be critically examined. If
correct, the theory of special relativity and the structure of space-time will
be reassessed and the relevance of this work to the larger project of
reconciling quantum mechanics with relativity will be shown.
