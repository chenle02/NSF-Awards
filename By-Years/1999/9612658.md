This project gathers some of the principal cast of IR coronal experimenters in a
concerted effort to mount a decisive campaign from an aircraft platform at the
total solar eclipse of February 1998. The objectives are fourfold: (1) survey
the intermediate infrared spectral region for the presence of coronal emission
lines, to add diagnostic capability in coronal studies; (2) conduct photometric
measurements of the infrared coronal radiance, to specify the relative roles of
thermal emission and scattering from the interplanetary dust comprising the
F-corona; (3) measure the spectral shift of Fraunhofer lines in the coronal
signal to determine the motion of interplanetary dust near the sun, and
understand previously reported variations from Keplerian orbital motion; and (4)
study the He I 1083 nm radiation observed at the 1994 eclipse in the outer
corona by means of line profile measurements.
