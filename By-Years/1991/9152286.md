The teaching/learning environment in undergraduate physics laboratories inhibits
critical thinking about the experiment, the data, and the physics by a lack of
time to do detailed analysis of the data during the laboratory period. This
situation can be corrected significantly by the use of microcomputers in the
laboratory with data acquisition hardware and software to speed data collection.
A spread sheet program and a graphical package allow real-time data manipulation
leading toward increased confidence in the quality of the data and into insights
into the physics the data portray. Student or instructor written programs
provide special analysis tools.This new environment, common to the physics
researcher, now can be the domain of the physics student. Modest prices for
powerful desk-top computers makes it possible to install one work station for
every two students with data acquisition hardware and software. Given these
tools and guided in their constructive use, students can investigate the "what
if" questions prompted by a critical analysis of the experiment. A greater
appreciation of the real methodologies of experimental physics can emerge and
develop.
