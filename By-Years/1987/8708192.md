The objective of this work is to identify interrelations among mineral
structure, bonding, physical properties and stability through the study of high-
pressure minerals in the system CaO-MgO-FeO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O. Several research
disciplines, including crystal chemistry and crystallography, vibrational
spectroscopy, single-crystal synthesis and solid-state theory, will be applied
to well-characterized samples from this group of minerals. A unique feature of
this research will be the application of newly-developed techniques for studying
single- crystals to hydrostatic pressures of 500 kbar (50 GPa) in a diamond-
anvil cell with hydrogen or rare gases (helium, neon or argon) as pressure-
transmitting medium. Structural variations with pressure will be studied by
x-ray crystallographic techniques; high-pressure structures up to the 500 kbar
pressure range will be performed for the first time. Computational methods based
on density functional theory will be used to calculate structure, lattice
dynamics, equations of state, and thermodynamic functions for the important end
member oxide and silicate minerals in the system.
