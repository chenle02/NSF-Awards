ABSTRACT Alan Roche Purdue University DMS-98 01131 Professor Roche will study
the complex representation theory of a reductive p-adic group by restricting to
compact open subgroups. Building on an idea due to Bushnell and Kutzko known as
the method of types, the investigator expects to be able to connect precisely
components of the Bernstein decomposition of a reductive p-adic group with data
from the open compact parts of the group. Professor Roche also more fully
understand associated Hecke algebras using theses new methods. One of the most
important mathematical ideas of the second half of the century, is that analytic
formula often encodes discrete information. For example, one might want to count
the number of solutions of a particular equation, but discover that the
solutions are very hard to find. On the other hand, you might want to count the
number of solutions to a sequence of equations and consider the answers as a
sequence. Mathematicians call these kind of problems 'discrete'. The functions
that appear in calculus, and for which calculus works so well, are not
'discrete', but 'analytic.' Amazingly, the right kind of analytic function can
contain the answer or answers to the discrete examples above. Actually the first
examples of this were discovered a couple hundred years ago, but in the past
thirty years, these examples have been systematized into a branch of number
theory called the Langlands program. This project is an important part of the
Langlands program.
