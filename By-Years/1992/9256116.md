The Florida State University will initiate a six-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in biology, biochemistry, computer science, physics, and
mathematics for 50 students entering the 11th and 12th grades. This summer
program will emphasize integrated course work and independent research. Each
participant will take a mathematics course, a computer course, and a science
elective. All students complete an individual research project in collaboration
with a researcher at the university. Evening seminars on science ethics and
career exploration and weekend field trips complete the summer program.
