This project has incorporated a kinetics experiment using fast UV-Visible
spectrophotometry into the established project- based laboratory program. This
laboratory program is based on the premise that education in chemistry is
appropriately augmented by realistic laboratory experiences that are designed to
produce attitudes of resourcefulness and independence through a four year series
of stand-alone projects. In the Analytical- Organic Lab, the projects require
students to make measurements and determinations using modern microcomputer
controlled instruments as well a s to learn classical organic experimental
techniques. This project connects the analytical and organic aspects by
employing fast UV-VIS spectrometers in the measurement of reaction rates and
then analyze a reaction mechanism and related structure with reactivity by using
these rates. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
