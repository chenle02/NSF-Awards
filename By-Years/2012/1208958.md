This award supports a specialty conference entitled Biogenic Hydrocarbons and
the Atmosphere to be held in June 2012, in Lewiston, Maine. The conference will
be convened under the auspices of the Gordon Research Conferences. The focus
will be on biogenic hydrocarbons and the atmosphere and will specifically target
discussion of emerging findings on hydrocarbon biosynthesis in plants, the
ecological role of hydrocarbons, and the range of hydrocarbon impacts on
atmospheric processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project
include advancing our understanding of the influences of biogenic hydrocarbons
on atmospheric composition, radiative transfer and climate. In addition, the
workshop will bring together established researchers and early career
scientists, providing invaluable opportunities for professional interactions in
a focused and productive forum. The award will assist with covering the costs of
travel and/or conference fees for 20 to 30 junior scientists. In support of the
conference theme, several sessions will include junior scientists as oral and
poster presenters.
