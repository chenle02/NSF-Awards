This award supports US-based participants, primarily graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers, in the "Workshop on Hecke Algebras and Lie Theory,"
held May 12-15, 2016 at the University of Ottawa. The workshop brings together
experts in algebraic combinatorics and Lie theory with the goal of fostering the
international collaboration between researchers in several areas connected to
representation theory and algebraic combinatorics, including Lie superalgebras,
extended affine Lie algebras, and Hecke algebras. In addition to talks by
experts in the field, the workshop includes a mini-course accessible to non-
experts, including junior researchers, that covers recent progress in double
affine Hecke algebras and related areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hecke algebras of
finite and affine Weyl groups arise naturally as convolution algebras associated
to finite and locally compact groups, and they play a prominent role in the
representation theory of finite groups of Lie type and of reductive p-adic
groups. In the early 1990's a class of algebras, known as double affine Hecke
algebras, was introduced in connection with affine quantum Knizhnik-
Zamolodchikov equations. Since then, profound connections have been discovered
between double affine Hecke algebras and a broad spectrum of areas in
mathematics, including combinatorics, algebraic geometry, number theory,
representation theory, harmonic analysis, knot theory, special functions, many
body problems, and conformal field theory. Recent results hint at a new and
promising connection between double affine Hecke algebras and Lie superalgebras
and open the door to many intriguing possibilities that will be explored at the
workshop. The website for the workshop is
