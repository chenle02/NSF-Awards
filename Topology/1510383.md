A 3-manifold looks like the 3-dimensional space locally. The classical physics
describes the universe we live in as a 3-manifold. Hyperbolic geometry is a
(non-Euclidean) geometric model satisfying Euclid's first four postulates but
not the fifth (the parallel postulate). It turns out that hyperbolic geometry is
much more important than Euclidean geometry for 3-manifolds. Thurston's and
Perelman's works imply that "most" 3-manifolds have a hyperbolic geometric
structure (i.e., they are hyperbolic 3-manifolds). These hyperbolic 3-manifolds
can be described by so-called discrete groups of two-by-two matrices, and their
covering spaces correspond to subgroups of these discrete groups. Although
subgroups of the matrix groups may seem easy to understand, various properties
of covering spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are actually quite mysterious. The
PI plans to investigate covering spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds by various
geometric and algebraic methods.

The main goal of this project is to investigate finite covers of hyperbolic
3-manifolds, and to use finite covers of fibered hyperbolic 3-manifolds to study
finite covers of pseudo-Anosov maps. The research will be based on tools
developed during the recent progress on the Virtual Haken and Virtual Fibered
Conjectures. In particular, the PI will focus on three topics. The first topic
is about the asymptotic behavior of topological invariants of finite covers of
3-manifolds (e.g., the Seifert volume, the size of homological torsion). The
second topic is to use finite covers of hyperbolic 3-manifolds to study finite
covers of pseudo-Anosov maps (e.g., the virtual homological spectral radii of
pseudo-Anosov maps). The third topic is to study the mapping tori of small
dilatation pseudo-Anosov maps (e.g., to find the explicit finite collection of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds that generates all pseudo-Anosov maps of smallest
dilatation). Methods from hyperbolic geometry, low-dimensional topology,
geometric group theory, dynamical systems, and metric geometry will be involved
in the work.
