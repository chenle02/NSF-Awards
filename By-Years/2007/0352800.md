Professor Catherine Fenselau of the University of Maryland and Dr. Michael
Ramsey of Oak Ridge National Laboratory will lead a workshop focused on the
miniaturization of mass spectrometers. The availability of rugged and reliable
miniaturized and portable mass spectrometers would have important impact on
research, education, and test and measurement applications in a wide variety of
disciplines. Recent relevant successes include advanced ion analysis,
electronics, micro-fabrication technologies and the construction of truly
miniaturized chemical measurement systems, e.g. fluidics-based experimentation.
Further breakthroughs are needed in understanding the scaling issues of mass
analyzers, and in ancillary technologies such as vacuum pumps and power sources.
This workshop brings together leading researchers, technologists, users,
potential new contributors, manufacturers and funding agencies. The workshop,
its website and its final report will serve to inform the community of progress
and needs in the miniaturization of mass spectrometry, and to identify topics
for basic research and technological development that will impact progress. The
meeting takes place November 3-4, 2003 in Arlington VA.
