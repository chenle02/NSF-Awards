The Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) proposes to conduct a
seminar for senior staff at science centers on project planning, proposal
development and project management, including grant management. The overall goal
is to build capacity within science centers to develop and manage fundable
projects consistent with the guidelines of the ISE program. Presenters and
discussants will include successful ISE PI's and reviewers. ASTC will stipulate
that participation requires teams comprised of a top-level decision-maker,
project planner and a development officer or other cognizant team member from
each institution. Furthermore, teams from medium- and smaller-sized institutions
will be encouraged to participate and given priority consideration.
