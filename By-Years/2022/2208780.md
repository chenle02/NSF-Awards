The Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC) is a student-run IEEE technical
conference that started in 2017. The sixth annual event, TPEC 2022, will be held
on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas, on February
28 and March 1, 2022. This two-day event will bring together participants from
industry and academia to present and discuss the latest technological
developments and challenges in the area of power and energy engineering. The
conference will include paper sessions, keynote speakers, a student poster
competition, and an industrial sponsor and job fair. There will also be a tour
included of the Smart Grids Control Room Lab located at the Center for
Infrastructure Renewal (CIR) at Texas A&amp;M
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will be used to support students
traveling to and attending TPEC 2022. It is expected that about 15 students will
benefit from this grant, offsetting their cost of participation. By joining in
with TPEC 2022, they will benefit from hearing and discussing new research
developments, hearing keynote speakers, networking with industry and academia,
and having the opportunity to present their work in a paper or poster. The whole
research community in power and energy engineering will benefit as well, by the
value and perspectives these students will bring to the
event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
