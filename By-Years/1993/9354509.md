9354509 Meyer A two-semester introduction to the principles and practice of
mathematics is being developed for students who wish to study a significant
amount of mathematics, including majors and minors in mathematics, computer
science, and many science and engineering disciplines. This course is designed
as an alternate (to the standard calculus sequence) route into the mathematics
curriculum, one which stresses breadth and includes much of the modern
mathematics and applications which are currently "homeless" in the mathematics
curricula. The design, review, field test, and production of the course is being
overseen by an advisory/editorial board and author team with a wide range of
mathematical expertise and writing experience. There is an extensive outreach
effort including regular mailings, professional meetings presentations, and
faculty enhancement workshops. The project will culminate with the dissemination
of the materials by a major textbook publisher.
