This project is building and experimenting with a prototype video server, which
extends the Stony Brook Video Server (SBVS). Developed over the past two years,
SBVS provides an end-to-end performance guarantee for digital video delivery
from the server's disk, through multi-hop Ethernet-based networks, to the
client's display. The extended server, called Stonehenge, will eventually store
lectures for use on all 64 SUNY campuses. Stonehenge has three unique aspects:
(1) it provides software tolerance to disk failures, maintaining performance
guarantees in the presence of faults; (2) it integrates disk and tape arrays,
and includes dynamic striping and load balancing; (3) detailed performance and
traffic statistics from the running video server will be collected and analyzed.
