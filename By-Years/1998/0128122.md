This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use a
moisture sensor to monitor moisture ingress, corrosion, and delamination of
fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) concrete structures. Phase I will build on the
development of a moisture sensor for composite aircraft and adapt its use for
infrastructure such as bridges. FRP is increasingly being used to reinforce such
structures during rehabilitation, but uncertainties concerning the health of the
composite and the bond between the composite and the concrete prevent widespread
application. The moisture sensor, which is based on the established technique of
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), will allow moisture intrusion and
the effects of moisture to be tracked from very early stages.

Initial commercial applications will involve an inspector using a portable
computer to interrogate the sensors to determine structural health. The advanced
application would include a permanently mounted potentiostat module that would
periodically send signals to a central location. Commercial opportunities
include over100,000 structurally deficient bridges that are candidates for FRP
rehabilitation.
