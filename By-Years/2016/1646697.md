Academic and practitioner communities have few opportunities to engage directly.
The purpose of this workshop is to increase practitioner awareness of relevant
scholarship to better inform policy, influence program design and refine
evaluation practices, and engage researchers and practitioners in a dialogue to
help influence the design of new research questions and methodologies. Held in
concert with the State Science and Technology Institute(SSTI)'s 2016 Annual
Conference, a gathering of more than 300 federal, state, local and private-
sector technology based economic development practitioners this workshop
provides a unique opportunity to cross-fertilize the interests and needs of
practitioners who make policies and develop programs supporting capital access,
entrepreneurial assistance, industry/university partnerships and cluster
development with SciSIP researchers. The objective of this workshop is to learn
each other's perspectives in order to develop new directions and datasets for
future research and to better inform policy and practice.
