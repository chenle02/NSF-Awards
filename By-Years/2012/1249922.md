The past decade has seen an explosion of information concerning the neuroscience
of language and other cognitive processes. We now have quite reasonable 'brain
maps' that specify where in the brain the major operations occur that underlie
various aspects of language processing. However, the relation between language
and the brain is still at best understood at a correlational level. There is no
explanatory understanding of how specialized neural circuits account for the
implementation of the specific operations that underpin linguistic computations
and representations.

The emphasis of this workshop is to bring together experts from various fields
(e.g., neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, computer science, and
psychology) to identify new directions in the computational neurobiology of
language. There are two intended outcomes. First, the workshop should stimulate
new scientific collaborations that use computation to connect cognition/language
and neuroscience. Second, participants will write a "white paper" that (i)
summarizes key ideas, problems, and prospects for research in this
interdisciplinary area of inquiry and (ii) identifies and recommends promising
questions and methodological tools for future work in cognitive neuroscience,
with a special emphasis on speech and language processing.
