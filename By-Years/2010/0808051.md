This project examines extra-pair mating in birds from the female perspective.
The research asks whether females that mate with more than one male benefit
directly, by producing more offspring than they would if they mated with just
one male, or indirectly, by producing offspring of higher quality. Conclusions
will be based on DNA samples collected over 18 years from more than 4000
individuals and on long-term records of population dynamics and reproductive
success. The study species, the dark-eyed junco, is a socially monogamous
songbird. Males and females form a long-term pair bond and jointly raise
offspring, but ~25% of all offspring are sired by a male other than the socially
bonded male.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Extra-pair mating is easily understood from
the male?s perspective; a male?s reproductive success will increase if he mates
with multiple females. Less clear is why females participate in this behavior,
and past research has not resolved the question. The duration and scope of this
study provide a unique opportunity to examine the influence of mating patterns
on lifetime reproductive success of females. Results will clarify the potential
for sexual selection in a species with a complex mating system.&lt;br/&gt;
