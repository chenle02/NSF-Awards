Blok will continue his work in universal algebra and algebraic logic. The main
themes of this research are the finite basis problem for quasivarieties, the
structure of congruence distributive varieties, and the connection between
metalogical properties and algebraic ones. It is unlikely that such foundational
studies will have immediate impact outside of algebra and mathematical logic,
but given time, it is surprising how much of foundations finds its way into
computer science.
