A standard notational system for scientific and mathematical symbols will be
developed to be used in computerized versions of science and mathematics
textbooks. Software will be written to strip publishers' typesetting tapes for
science and mathematics textbooks of compositing symbols. The resulting ASCII
format can be used to drive refreshable computer braille, large print display or
speech output devices. The print disabled student can then study the texts using
a personnel computer with a user-friendly word processor. This technique
complements services of readers and recordings.
