This research will focus on three areas: commutative algebra, representation
theory and invariant theory. In commutative algebra, the project will construct
and study the generic ring for resolutions of length 3. In representation theory
, the Littlewood-Richardson rule will be generalized for all classical and
spinor groups. In the area of invariant theory, the principal investigator plans
to find generators of multiplicity ideals for binary forms and prove the M.
Green conjecture for general canonical curves of genus g. One of the main
sources of commutative algebra was 19th century invariant theory. The problem of
finite generation of rings of forms and its famous solution by Hilbert were the
starting point of commutative algebra and representation theory. This project
will investigate the connections between those three areas. It is anticipated
that the combination of algebraic, geometric and representation theoretic
methods will lead to substantial progress in those areas.
