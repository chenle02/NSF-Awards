Collection of thunderstorms know as mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have
been shown to be important to the understanding of a wide range of
meteorological phenomena. MCSs bring beneficial range as well as severe weather
and are believed to be important conduits for the redistribution of heat and
moisture in the atmosphere. The Principal Investigator will continue her studies
of the dynamical structures of MCSs and the relationship of these structures to
precipitation production and to the larger-scale environment. This observational
study will include data from previously held field programs in the mid-latitudes
(Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM) and the tropics
(Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment).
