This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science
Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the
University of Montana (UM), led by Professors Aaron M. Thomas and Earle R.
Adams. The Department of Chemistry at the University of Montana is the center of
a summer REU program, which is built around environmental chemistry with a
primary objective of recruiting Native American students in the physical
sciences and providing them with a relevant research experience. From prior REU
programs at the UM campus, it is known that environmental issues often create
interest among science students. This program is designed to include a writing
experience, an industrial overview of a green industry, and personalized, well-
focused research experiences that will broaden their depth of understanding in a
STEM field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following components are in place for the
success of this program: 1.) a director for Indigenous Research and STEM
Education (IRSE), who provides a leadership role to build relationships and
recruit Native American students in the STEM fields; 2.) focused research
projects under the broader theme of environmental chemistry which is a specialty
of UM chemistry faculty and of high interest among students at the tribal
colleges in Montana and Idaho; and 3.) in collaboration with the Journalism
Department and a present NSF program on campus, a Science Communicator will
train students in writing techniques and media platforms that effectively reach
Native audiences.
