Matchup scheduling is a strategy for overcoming disruptions in large, complex
scheduling systems. It assumes that a preschedule has been constructed offline
to set material and labor schedules. While operating the system, a disruption,
such as machine breakdown or material unavailability, has rendered the
preschedule obsolete. Matchup scheduling reconstructes a small section of the
preschedule resulting in a feasible, near-optimal schedule. To execute this
strategy, the schedule beyond a selected matchup time is not altered. Jobs on a
subset of machines are rescheduled with the objective of matching up with the
preschedule at the matchup time. That is, all inventories and machine setups
should be as if the disruption had not occurred. It is assumed that this is
possible due to slack in the preschedule for the disrupted family of machines.
It has been shown that, under quite general conditions, such a process can be
carried out without loss of optimality. It is the intent of this project to
enhance this strategy by (1) applying new theory to better choose the matchup
time, and (2) enhancing the methods used for reconstructing the schedule
section. The approach will be evaluated against optimal schedules or bounds on
optimal schedules.//
