This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant award supports the development
of a research proposal intended to produce an assessment of the degree to which
critical elements of the political line of the Unified Black Movement (MNU) are
distributed among selected sectors of the Afro-Brazilian population in Bahia,
Brazil. If a successful proposal is developed, the research will produce
information about the ideological congruence between a prominent, Brazilian
Black consciousness organization and Afro-Brazilian mass populations. Such
research will be of considerable interest for understanding current and future
Brazilian politics.
