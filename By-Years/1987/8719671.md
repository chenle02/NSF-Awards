NSF has sponsored a series of science policy seminars for over a decade for the
science policy community. PRA wishes to continue the seminar series for an
additional three years. Since the current contract for conducting, planning and
managing the seminars lapses in November, 1987, PRA issued an RFP to ensure that
the new contractor will be in place by then. The purpose of the seminars is to
bring together members of the science policy community on a periodic basis in a
venue that allows for discussion of science policy issues that are of general
interest and concern. Speakers and topics for each of the seven annual seminars
are chosen, with NSF input and concurerence, by the contractor, who also manages
and conducts the seminars. The seminar series serves to keep PRA, science policy
professionals, and local graduate students in the field, abreast of the issues
facing the science policy community.
