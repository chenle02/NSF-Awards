ABSTRACT Solar variability is one possible source of climate change. The
objective here is to obtain an improved observational and theoretical
understanding of the dynamical effects of short-term solar ultraviolet
variations in the upper stratosphere. Detailed cross-spectral studies of zonal
mean temperatures, winds, and derived circulation statistics versus the measured
solar flux near 200 nm will be conducted to determine the existence and
statistical significance of dynamical changes in the stratosphere produced by
solar UV variations. Special attention will be given to the possibility that
solar UV variations may force or excite traveling planetary-scale waves with
preferred periods near 27 days in the upper stratosphere (1-3 mbar).
Interference between short-term solar UV-driven transient waves and stationary
waves forced from below may be capable of affecting the initiation of
stratospheric warmings in the northern hemisphere winter with consequent effects
on the interannual climatology of the middle atmosphere. ***
