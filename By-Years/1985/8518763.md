This study focuses on work in fluid dynamics problems related to ocean waves and
the stability of ocean currents and eddies. Particular problems to be addressed
under this aware will be hydrodynamic stability and chaotic phenomena, internal
tides, tidal friction, and Modons. An early idea held that fluids become
unstable in every more complex modes until they become turbulent in the
stochastic sense. Recent developments in hydrodynamic stability use the
techniques of strange attractors to show that the final state may termed
"choatic", i.e., not stochastic, and in some sense determinestic. These
techniques will be applied to the study of surface waves, tides, internal tides,
reasonantly forced Rossby waves, and quasigeostrophic solitary waves in the
ocean. These studies address problems of fundamental importance to the overall
dynamics of ocean motion, and are likely to stir interest among many in the
oceanographic community.
