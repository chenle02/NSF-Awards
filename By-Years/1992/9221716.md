This US-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr. Mark Hillery of Hunter
College, City University of New York, and Dr. Vladimir Buzek of the Institute of
Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, will pursue application of the basic theory
of squeezed spin states to interferometric phase measurements. Specifically, the
researchers will examine quadratic squeezing involving variables in quantum
optical systems which are quadratic in the mode creation and annihilation
operators. Drs. Hillery and Buzek maintain that these variables can be observed
using combinations of beam splitters and parametric amplifiers or four-wave
mixers. They intend to use these variables as probes of quantum optical systems
or field-matter systems to determine more accurate and practical measurement
schemes. This joint research project in theoretical physics fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
