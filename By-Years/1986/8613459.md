Liquid HeII is widely used as the cooling agent in a variety o cryogenic
engineering applications because of its remarkable-large effective thermal
conductivity. The specific application of concern is the cooling of
superconducting magnet wires. Measurements will be made of the heat transfer
coefficient for radial heat transfer in HeII. The experiments are unusually
difficult because the high conductivity of the HeII reduces the radial
temperature difference to a very small value.
