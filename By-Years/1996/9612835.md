The PI will make detailed comparisons of theoretical model predictions with
comprehensive data sets collected during CEDAR-HLPS high-latitude observational
campaigns and routine observations. The three areas emphasized involve sun-
aligned polar cap arcs, the effects of thermospheric gravity waves on the high-
latitude ionosphere, and the spatial and temporal resolution needed to elucidate
the dynamics of thermospheric and ionospheric structures. First, the researchers
will quantitatively test theoretical predictions concerning the relationship
between spacing between multiple polar cap arcs and the hardness of the arc
precipitation. Next, they will determine the spatial and temporal resolutions
needed with regard to convection, precipitation, and current patterns in order
to correctly elucidate the dynamics of thermospheric and ionospheric structures.
Successful completion of all these tasks will enhance knowledge of fundamental
magnetosphere-ionosphere and thermosphere-ionosphere coupling processes.
