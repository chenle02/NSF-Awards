Lay abstract Wright IBN-0131743

What happens in our brains when we learn? How do evolutionary changes in
mechanisms underlying one form of learning impact upon the evolution of other
forms of learning? In previous research this investigator used
neurophysiological and behavioral studies of several present-day species
(related to the popular models species, Aplysia californica) with known
relationships to each other to establish that fundamental mechanisms of
sensitization, a simple form of learning, have changed across evolution. In this
research the consequences of evolution will be examined with respect to a more
complex form of learning, classical conditioning. The hypothesis to be examined
is whether loss or reduction in the simple mechanisms of sensitization reduces
the persistence of the more complex neural changes underlying classical
conditioning. This study will lead to a deeper understanding of the neural
mechanisms of learning and memory.
