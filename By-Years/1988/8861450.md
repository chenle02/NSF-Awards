Research on gas phase biosensors is proposed, leading to the development of
highly specific, ultrasensitive detectors for inorganic and organic substances
in the gaseous phase. These sensors will utilize bioadsorbents as coatings on
piezoelectric crystals to form continuous responding detectors for substances of
interest in fermentation research. The feasibility of use of a CO2 monitor will
be demonstrated in Phase I. Detailed studies of the gas phase reactions will be
conducted to provide insight in the design of optimal responding biosensors.
Such factors as the coating phase, immobilization of the protein for optimal
reactivity and stability, achievement of maximum sensitivity and specificity,
reversibility of response required, lifetime stability, reliability and protein
orientation will be evaluated.
