This is a collaborative theory/experiment research project on the surface
optical spectroscopy (SOS) of electronic materials. The objective is to
understand the fundamental factors which govern the intensity of surface
resonance Raman spectroscopy (SRRS), second harmonic generation (SSHG), and
hyper-Raman spectroscopy (SHRS) at the surface of any material. Applications to
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and laser microchemistry (LMC) are developed.
Interactive theoretical studies are designed to interpret the experimental
spectra, kinetic parameters, and provide predictive capability for the surface
optical properties of new materials and new spectroscopic phenomena. The
specific projects to be undertaken include SRRS studies of selected adsorbates
using visible and UV, CW, mode-locked lasers; time-resolved and space- resolved
SSHG studies of materials growth via MBE; and LMC methods for semiconductor and
transition metal processing which produce submicron scale surface roughness.
