Abstract This award supports a project to test the recent hypothesis that
Laurentia (the cratonic part of present-day North America) was adjacent to the
East Antarctic craton during late Proterozoic time and was therefore a part of
Gondwana. The hypothesized geographic disposition of these continental masses
has far-reaching implications for the assembly, evolution, and breakup of
Gondwana. This hypothesis, however, has not yet been substantially tested. If
Laurentia did breakout of Gondwana from a position adjacent to Antarctica, rift-
related sediments should record this event and contain detritus, including
detrital zircon, derived from the rifting continent. Late Proterozoic
metasedimentary rocks exposed throughout the Transantarctic Mountains (including
the La Gorce, Duncan, Goldie, and Cobham Formations, and the Skelton and
Koettlitz Groups) are the most-likely candidates for such rocks. This project
will produce a geochronometric inventory of detrital zircons from samples of
these units distributed along the length of the Transantarctic Mountains. The
geochronometric data will provide a useful test of the hypothesis and will
complement on-going detrital zircon studies of other Proterozoic rocks in the
Transantarctic Range.
