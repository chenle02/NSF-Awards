The IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Symposium is a top-tier venue for cybersecurity
and privacy research, and has been for much of its 40-plus-year history. Student
attendance at S&amp;P is an important part of graduate education in
cybersecurity. The 2020 Symposium will be held in San Francisco, CA and consist
of approximately 80 technical papers and Systematization of Knowledge papers,
which provide valuable background to students who are learning the
literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage
participation in the IEEE Symposium and its Student Program Committee by
students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection
include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by
coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of
women and students from other under-represented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
