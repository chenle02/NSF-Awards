Professor Norberg will continue a program of pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance
at low temperatures. The research includes: NMR studies of molecular hydrogen
and (NMR) deuterium trapped in microvoids in amorphous semiconductors and in
large crystal fields in solid argon and new NMR studies at low temperatures of
hydrogen layers on uniform surfaces and in restricted geometries provided by
well-defined porous matrices; new NMR experiments on physisorbed layers of
krypton and xenon on well-characterized surfaces. Studies on rare gas solids at
high pressures to determine the isochoric behavior of diffusion and relaxation
by impurities will be made. NMR at very high pressures in a diamond anvil cell
will be used to examine phase transformations, structure, and dynamics in
condensed hydrogen, deuterium and in rare gas mixtures and in ammonia.
