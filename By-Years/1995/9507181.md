9501332 Cappo In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project,
Learning in Motion is developing a collection of assessment items to support
mathematics instruction in grades K-2 that is aligned with the NCTM Standards.
The collection of items was begun in 1994 and is being evaluated and augmented
with additional items with the cooperation of Thomas A. Romberg of the
University of Wisconsin and Jan de Lange of the Freudenthal Institute in the
Netherlands. Scoring rubrics are being developed and the items and rubrics are
being tested in schools. a Teacher enhancement component is being designed to
help teachers build their own expertise in the area of assessment. The
collection of assessment items is being made available for Macintosh and Windows
environments and the accompanying software allows teachers to search for items
using a variety of criteria, including level of difficulty, grade level, content
strand, role of context, and length of time for completion. This project will
create an assessment tool offering dynamic reporting thus giving teachers the
direction they need to make important curriculum and testing decisions at the
classroom level. Teachers will be able to assess their students' understanding
of mathematics at higher levels and to build better assessment programs overall.
