Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute will operate the Deep Submergence Vehicle
(DSV) ALVIN during 1990 in support of NSF-funded research projects. The DSV
ALVIN is a 7.1 m National Oceanographic Facility that is owned by the U.S. Navy
and is jointly funded by NSF, NOAA and ONR for oceanographic research. Support
for the DSV ALVIN is provided by each agency according tothe terms outlined in a
joint Memorandum of Agreement. The ALVIN Review Committee, which is composed of
scientists and agency representatives, provides guidance for operations of the
submersible. The submersible is carried by the R/V ATLANTIS II. The support
vessel and the submersible operate worldwide, and the submersible is capable of
diving to a depth of 4,000 m. Operation of a submersible requires highly
specialized equipment and extensive support from both the support ship's crew
members and the submersible team. Crew members for the DSV ALVIN are highly
trained to ensure proper maintenance and saftey for operations. The support ship
is outfitted with a special A frame on the stern that allows the submersible to
be safely deployed.
