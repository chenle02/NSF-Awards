The fish collection of the School of Fisheries of the University of Washington
consists of over 200,000 specimens and constitutes the only repository in the
country with archival storage of North Pacific and Bering Sea fishes. The
University has pledged its sustained support in maintaining this nationally
important collection at a high level of activity. The University's long-term
commitment is evidenced by its plans to provide in excess of $1.4 million over
the next six years for new facilities to house the collection. NSF support
through this award will augment the University's funds by supporting a
collection manager for three years, providing one-half of the cost of a
compactorized shelving system for the specimens, and facilitating a computerized
catalog for the collection. At the end of the three-year grant period, the
University will assusme the cost of the collection manager's salary, and it also
will provide the remaining half of the compactorized shelving.
