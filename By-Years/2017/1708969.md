Intermetallic compounds are an integral part of materials design for structural
and functional applications and, thus, understanding their behavior is critical
to improved performance. Extensive research has been underway to understand the
fundamental aspects of intermetallics and the knowledge base is continuously
evolving. Nevertheless, significant knowledge gaps exist in the fundamental
science of intermetallics, as well as in processing and scale-up for eventual
application. This award supports a symposium on fundamental understanding of the
processing, microstructure, and properties of these materials at the Materials
Research Society (MRS) Fall Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, November
27-December 2, 2016. This symposium series was started in 1984 and is one of the
longest running symposia in MRS history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
enable the attendance at the symposium of graduate students, post-doctoral
researchers, early career faculty and researchers from underrepresented groups.
Support for students and early career researchers for travel and registration at
the MRS meeting is a critical part of broadening and educating the field of
researchers, as well as advancing knowledge and information exchange about this
important class of materials.
