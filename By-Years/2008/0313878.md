This project envisions work in two interrelated areas: 1) the extension and
improvement of a partially completed computational method to estimate the free
energies of binding of carbohydrate ligands to proteins, either enzymes or
lectins; and 2) computational docking using AutoDock of many different
carbohydrates substrates into glycoside hydrolase Families 1 (B-glucosidases,
B-galactosidases, B-mannosidases, 6-phospho-B-galactosidases, 6-phospho-B-
glucosidases, and myrosinases), 2 (B-galactosidases, B-glucuronidases, and
B-mannosidases), 6 (cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases), and 7
(cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impacts of
this project are potentially the following: 1) A very useful computational model
that until recently predicted general energies of binding of carbohydrates to
proteins will be made much more precise, and will better predict actual binding
free energies; 2) in a more general fashion, the importance of computational
tools to supplement and extend experimental protein structural data will be
further demonstrated; 3) the mechanisms of the enzymes in several very extensive
and important glycosyl hydrolase families will be better elucidated, giving
members of the communities researching these enzymes new insights not easily
obtained by experimental studies; 4) a number of graduate and undergraduate
students will be trained in the area of computational enzyme structure-function
determination, where there is a paucity of well-trained practitioners and an
overwhelming amount of raw and partially data to be processed and
understood.&lt;br/&gt;
