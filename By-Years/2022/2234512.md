The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is in addressing the critical industrial
need for advanced pressure sensors that can operate at high temperatures and in
harsh environmental conditions. Next generation electric vehicles, oil rigs,
power plants and outer space missions require sensors and systems that are
capable of operating under extreme environmental conditions with high
reliability and outstanding performance. Additional potential markets include
high performance sensors that can be used in rescue missions as well as flight
and drone operations with better location detection. The development of these
sensors, with a potential market in the hundreds of million dollars, is also
expected to significantly expand knowledge of next generation semiconductor
devices and chip manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will
advance scientific understanding of wide bandgap semiconductors and device
manufacturing processes. The proposed sensor, which leverages the piezoelectric
properties of these materials along with their chemical inertness and thermal
stability, will ensure their high performance even at high operating
temperatures, exceeding the capabilities of existing sensors. Additionally, the
sensors would offer novel tunability of pressure sensitivity and very low
operating power requirements, as an integrated transistor is used to detect
membrane deflection caused by pressure changes. The sensors will be built using
epitaxial III-Nitride ((Al, In, Ga)N) layers on a silicon substrate, which will
ensure low cost and easy substrate removal through etching. The research and
translation will be done with multiple research and commercial in
partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
