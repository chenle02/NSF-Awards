Professor Greenleaf will apply the theory of group representations to problems
in mathematical analysis on nilpotent Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces.
Particular emphasis will be placed on studying the invariant differential
operators on homogeneous spaces, describing algebras of such operators in terms
of Kirillov's orbit picture, and developing solvability criteria for large
classes of differential operators on these spaces. Lie groups arise naturally in
mathematics and physics as groups of symmetries. An interesting example that
lies readily at hand consists of all rotations of a sphere, made into a group by
applying rotations successively. Understanding this group is important in any
situation in which spherical symmetry is present. The simplest noncommutative
example of a nilpotent Lie group (the class of most immediate interest here) is
the Heisenberg group of upper triangular three-by-three real matrices with ones
on the diagonal. The Heisenberg group plays a fundamental role in the quantum
mechanical treatment of the harmonic oscillator, as the symmetry group of a
certain differential equation. The strong relationship between differential
equations and the representation theory of the underlying symmetry group is at
the heart of Professor Greenleaf's project.
