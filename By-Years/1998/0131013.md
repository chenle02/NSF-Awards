With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Emory University will acquire a Circular
Dichroism Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including a) the design of polypeptide materials of precise and
controllable molecular structure (Conticello); b) studies on flavoenzyme systems
(Edmondson); c) peptide structure and self-assembly (Lynn); d) transition metal-
DNA interactions (Marzilli); and e) bio-organic chemistry of protein-DNA
complexes (Mohler). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circular dichroism spectroscopy is an
extremely useful tool in modern analytical chemistry. It provides a very
reliable and sensitive method for assigning absolute molecular configurations.
The results from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in
particular, biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
