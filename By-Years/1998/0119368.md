A key advantage in mouse molecular genetics is the ability to tailor transgene
expression to particular tissues at particular times in development. Such
ability allows for increasingly more sophisticated analysis of gene function and
detailed understanding of developmental fates, and the molecular and cellular
mechanisms underlying those fates. These methodologies rely on germ-line
manipulations in mouse embryos and are not directly applicable to other models
of development, such as chick embryogenesis. Dr. Ragsdale and his coworkers will
explore a more broadly applicable method of heritable, conditional transgenesis,
one that could be used in a range of animal embryos. Avian retroviruses have a
restricted host range, and even among chickens there are strains of birds that
are susceptible to infection by only certain viral subgroups. The relevant viral
receptors have now been cloned and can confer viral infectivity to heterologous
cells. In addition, in a growing number of experimental systems, transient
transgenesis can be achieved by direct tissue electroporation of embryos. Dr.
Ragsdale will develop a transgenesis system in which electroporation delivers
avian retroviral receptors for transient misexpression. The location and timing
of the exogenous receptor expression is controlled by the time and site of the
electroporation and can be further restricted by tissue-specific promoters.
Subsequent retroviral infection then provides for heritable transgene delivery
only to those cells expressing the viral receptor at the time of the infection.
Dr. Ragsdale will explore this system in chick neural development, but its
applicability is potentially much broader and includes the range of embryos,
from ascidians to mice, where in vivo electroporation can be used to introduce
plasmid DNA into developing organs.
