The principal investigator proposes to study certain elliptic and parabolic
problems that arise in differential geometry. One example is the conformal
deformation of Riemannian metrics by their scalar curvature (the so-called
Yamabe flow). An interesting question is whether the solution approaches a
metric of constant scalar curvature or whether the flow may develop a
singularity. (The answer is known in dimensions 3 -- 5, but the general case is
not yet fully understood.) A solution to this problem will likely require a good
understanding of the local properties of the solution in a neighborhood of a
blow-up point. Another tool that is likely to be relevant is the positive mass
theorem in general relativity. It would also be interesting to see whether
similar ideas can shed light on the prescribed scalar curvature problem in
higher dimensions. The proposed project lies at the intersection of three areas
of mathematics: differential geometry, nonlinear partial differential equations,
and the calculus of variations. One of the goals of this project is to study the
deformation of manifolds by their curvature, and to gain a better understanding
of the longtime behavior of the solutions. Some of these geometric evolution
equation are closely related to equations studied in applied mathematics, such
as the porous medium equation.
