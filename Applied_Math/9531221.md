9531221 Gurtin This project is a continuation of a research effort toward
developing, analyzing, and unifying mathematical models that characterize
material behavior at a phenomenological level. The long-term goal of this
project is a continuum-mechanical framework for the study of materials that
provides a basis for general theories and leads to boundary-value problems of
physical relevance. The following specific studies are planned: (i) the
development of a small-strain theory of incoherent phase transitions that
results in free-boundary problems amenable to analysis and computation; (ii) the
development of a theory of deformational phase transitions appropriate to fully
faceted crystals; (iii) the analysis of models that generalize motion by
curvature. The goal of this project is a continuum mechanical framework for the
study of materials. This framework should provide a basis for the development of
general theories that lead to new ways of understanding defects and
microstructures and provide an ability to predict macroscopic properties as well
as detailed behavior at the microscopic level.
