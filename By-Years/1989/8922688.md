This is a project to measure the abundance and vertical profiles of several
trace gases that are important to understanding the chlorine induced destruction
of stratospheric ozone. The measurements will be made over McMurdo, Antarctica
during the austral spring of 1990, when a reoccurrence of the annual ozone hole
is expected. The instrument used will measure microwave radio emission from
ozone, nitrous oxide and chlorine monoxide. By measuring the total radiation in
the emission lines and the widths of the lines, both the amount and height
profiles can be calculated. A unique feature of the instrument is that it
employs a superconducting.insulating.superconducting hetrodyne radio receiver
that should allow these measurements to be made with unprecedented sensitivity.
This is a technology not previously employed for these purposes. This project is
jointly funded by the Division of Polar Programs and the Division of Atmospheric
Sciences.
