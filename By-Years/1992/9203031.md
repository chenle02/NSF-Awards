The objective of this research is to study fine root dynamics along a
floodplain forest chronosequence sere on the Bonanza Creek LTER near Fairbanks,
Alaska. The aboveground structure and function of these and other taiga forests
are well documented, but little is known about below ground processes. Direct
observations of roots, made with minirhizotrons, will be used to study the life
history and longevity of fine roots and mycorrhizae. These data will be used to
estimate the rate at which the fine root system is turning over and being
replaced each year. Fine root/mycorrhizae production and motality rates
determined via direct observation will be combined with biomass and nutrient
content data derived from destructive harvest of the root systems to determine
patterns of carbon allocation to fine roots and mycorrhizae during succession.
The research is designed to capitalize on the strengths of direct and indirect
methods of studying root systems to better understand the role of roots and
mycorrhizae in ecosystem processes in the Alaskan taiga.
