This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the Polytechnic
University of New York entitled, "RET Site: Science and Mechatronics Aided
Research for Teachers", under the direction of Dr. Vikram
Kapila.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in
Engineering Site will provide a professional development opportunity to 10 high
school teachers per year (total of 30 teachers) in the areas of science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). These teachers will work with
and be mentored by Dr. Kapila and three senior personnel as they conduct
inquiry-based, hands-on, engineering research in the exciting field of
mechatronics during six-week long summer workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will benefit the teachers by reinforcing their science and math skills;
enriching their STEM experience through exposure to real world engineering
research; developing and honing their research, communication and presentation
skills; and providing them opportunities to network with STEM educators.
