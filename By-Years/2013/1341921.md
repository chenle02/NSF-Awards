This award will support student travel to the 2013 International Conference on
Supercomputing (ICS), which is being held in Eugene. Oregon. ICS is a highly
regarded international technical conference with a multi-disciplinary focus on
high-end computing for scientific and engineering applications. The funds will
help support U.S. students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in
their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend ICS.
Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a
very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next
generation of researchers in this important research area.
