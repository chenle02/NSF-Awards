Funds are being provided to the Gordon Research Conference on Catalysis to
support the attendence of junior and emeritus faculty members who have no
support of their own at this meeting. This annual conference has established
itself as a major forum for exchange of information among research groups from
differing disciplines, countries, and types of affiliation. It can be especially
valuable for younger investigators who lack an extensive personal network. As a
contact point between industry and academia it is unmatched. Dr. Gonzalez has
assembled a promising program for the 1987 session. I recommend that a
conference grant for $5,000 be awarded to the Gordon Research Conferences for
the conference on Catalysis.
