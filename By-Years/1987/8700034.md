It is proposed to develop an extremely stable, spectrally narrow (150MHz),
single longitudinal mode tunable dye laser system of generating nanosecond
pulses with peak power exceeding 5 MW at a 5 KHz repetition rate. A previously
constructed dye laser oscillator system is combined with multistage dye
amplifiers, longitudinally pumped by a frequency.doubled Nd: YAG laser. The dye
oscillator performance is optimized by introducing a small prism in the cavity.
Selection of the pivotal point of the tuning mirror results in continuous single
mode scanning over the entire tuning range of the dye. The repetition rate is
extended by constructing a fast.flow cell. The oscillator output will be
increased by constructing a two stage dye amplifier.
