Interactive science exhibits will be designed, developed, and installed in the
Brookings Interpretive Center at the Missouri Botanical Garden. The Brookings
Interpretive Center is a new educational facility attached to the Climatron, a
geodesic dome greenhouse. The exhibits will be installed in one of five theme
areas: Tropical Rain Forest Biome, Tropical Rain Forests at Risk, Global
Ecosystem, Desert Biome, and Temperate Biome. In addition to the science
exhibits, the project will develop a series of science demonstrations to be used
in the Brookings Interpretive Center and will allow for additional signage and
audio effects to be added to the Climatron.
