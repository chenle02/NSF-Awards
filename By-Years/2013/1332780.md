The objective of this project is to develop a simple, yet robust, flow-enabled
self-assembly (FESA) method through the use of two-parallel-plate geometry with
a fixed upper plate and a moving lower substrate to reproducibly create highly
ordered structures over large areas composed of functional nanocrystals (i.e.,
quantum dots and quantum rods) and diblock copolymers. Luminescent nanocrystals
with precisely controllable size, shape, and surface characteristics will be
synthesized. Subsequently, hierarchically ordered structures composed of
nanocrystals over large areas will be obtained via the synergy between FESA at
the microscopic scale and spontaneous self-assembly at the nanoscale. A
theoretical model of the process will be developed and used as a guide for
optimizing the process. Knowledge generated in this project may lead to the
creation and development of intriguing nanodevices and materials for use in
microelectronics, optoelectronics, sensors, and biotechnology. The project will
also offer summer research opportunities for high school teachers in addition to
providing research training to undergraduate and graduate students.
