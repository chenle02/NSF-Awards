This award covers network router equipment for nine institutions which are
members of the North Carolina statewide CONCERT network. The IP routers replace
LAN (local area network) bridges. Further, by including these institutions in a
National Science Foundation award, it enables them to obtain lower dues from
SURANET, the mid-level network serving North Carolina.
