The Fourier Transform and Convex Bodies

The proposed research aims at achieving considerable progress towards the
development of a Fourier analytic approach to the solution of several problems
of convex geometry, related to sections and projections, and also to the
problems of uniqueness, reconstruction and duality of convex bodies. A recently
discovered formula expressing the volume of projections in terms of the Fourier
transform of the curvature function, has led to Fourier analytic proofs of
several results on projections, including the characterization of projection
bodies in terms of sections of the polar body, and the Fourier analytic solution
to Shephard's problem (asking whether symmetric convex bodies with smaller
projections necessarily have smaller volume) surprisingly similar to that of the
Busemann-Petty problem (a section counterpart of the Shephard problem). The
similarities in the Fourier analytic proofs of these results indicate in
particular that there must exist deep dual connections between volumes of
projections and sections of convex bodies. To achieve progress in obtaining the
Fourier analytic description of this duality phenomena, the PI plans to find
extremal projections of certain classes of bodies, to undertake a further study
of the projection and intersection bodies, to obtain results concerning non-
central sections, and to construct a nonsmooth projection body whose polar is
also a projection body in higher dimensions.

Convexity is a very old topic which can be traced at very least to Archimedes.
It is still in favor due to its numerous applications to linear programming,
tomography, medicine, and it is a surprise that Fourier analytic methods have
been applied to the subject only very recently. These methods can serve as an
additional source of ideas, coming to both fields, convex geometry and harmonic
analysis, and will find new applications. At the same time, convexity is an
extremely simple and natural notion. Interesting in itself, it also illustrates
some facts about mathematics, facts that are more or less classical, but always
important to realize, so it is a perfect field for undergraduates. First of all,
questions or problems arise that are very simple to formulate and understand, so
students do not need to take several classes before approaching the material.
Secondly, intuition is sometimes misleading in ``obvious problems'', and the
undergraduate feels the beauty of the subject. Many problems can be solved by
fairly elementary means, but on the other hand, answers to many problems are
still unknown or have been found recently, often using different techniques from
other parts of mathematics. Therefore, it is a perfect field for research
projects for more senior students and all people dealing with exact sciences.
