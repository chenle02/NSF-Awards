ECS-9619220 La Berge The present trend toward a global economy, especially in
the energy sector, as well as the formation of powerful transnational economical
and political entities such as the EEC, are having important impact on
engineering education. These developments when combined with changing
requirements of industry for the capabilities of engineers and different
patterns of engineering research, have prompted faculty members at Virginia Tech
to propose a four and one half day workshop entitled "International Workshop on
Engineering education Reforms with Emphasis on Electric Power Systems." The
workshop will be held in Grenoble, France, in December, 1997 and will bring
together faculty members and graduate students from universities in the United
States, Japan, Korea, Singapore and the Middle East, with representatives of
industries, EPRI, ABET, and FEANI to discuss these developments. Invited
presentations have been solicited and proceedings will be issued. In addition to
support from NSF, support from European universities and regions is anticipated.
