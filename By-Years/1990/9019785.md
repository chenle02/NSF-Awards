The specific aims of this project center on the structure study of cytochrome c
oxidase by digital image processing of electron micrographs of 2-dimensional
crystals. Cytochrome oxidase is the terminal component of mitochondrial electron
transport which is responsible for generating energy in the form of ATP for use
by all cells undergoing aerobic respiration. Cytochrome oxidase can be purified
in detergent solubilized form as both a monomer and a dimer which are equally
active in electron transfer. Likewise, 2-dimensional crystals of monomers and of
dimers have been isolated and preliminary structural studies completed. Dr. Frey
has recently obtained images of both crystal forms at a resolution of
approximately 10A by cryo-electron microscopy, and the principal goal of this
project is to determine the 3-dimensional structures of both monomers and dimers
at this resolution. Specific sites on the enzyme will be identified by labeling
with molecules visible by electron microscopy. Cytochrome c, binds with high
affinity to monomer crystals, and the site of binding has been identified in
2-dimensional projection. A maleimide derivative of a water soluble undecagold
cluster compound selectively labels Cys-115 of subunit III, and preliminary
results show the location of this compound in 2-dimensional projections of dimer
crystals. The binding sites of both molecules will be determined in
3-dimensions. The results will be interpreted to provide not only the position
of both binding sites but also the orientation of cytochrome c bound to
cytochrome oxidase. finally, the form of cytochrome oxidase most active in
proton pumping will be determined by electron microscopy of vesicles
reconstituted from purified cytochrome oxidase and phospholipids. The proportion
of monomers and dimers observed in these vesicles will be compared with their
efficiency of proton pumping to determine whether there is a correlation between
the two properties.
