9306518 Petrino This research planning grant for women examines the periodic
release of 17B-estradiol throughout the reproductive cycle of teleosts. It is
crucial for oocyte growth (vitellogenesis) and appears to have a programming
role in the regulation of spawning patterns. Therefore, it is of great interest
to investigate the regulation of its periodic synthesis. The hormonal and
molecular mechanisms of induction, maintenance or regulation of enzyme activity
in the steroidogenic pathway during the cyclic spawning activity and follicle
development in teleosts are not at all defined. This project focuses on ovarian
aromatase, the enzyme required for the conversion of testosterone to estradiol
that is located in the follicular (granolosa) cells surrounding the oocyte. The
specific aims of this preliminary study are: 1) to construct a cDNA library,
respresentative of ovarian mRNA from the cyclic spawner teleost Fundulus
heteroclitus, and 2) to clone and sequence the cDNA for aromatase using specific
probes. Segmants of the sequenced enzyme can then be used in future studies for
generating radioactive probes necesaries to detect the levels of aromatase mRNA
under gonadotropic stimulation and follicle development. Isolating F.
heteroclitus aromatase cDNA will allow comparison amoung teleosts species that
show a very differant pattern in spawning behavior, and thus it will contribute
to a better understanding of the regulatory control mechanisms operating during
cyclic reproduction in teleosts. This inforamtion will be helpful in an overall
understanding of ovarian physiology and reproductive endocrinology in
vertebrates. ***
