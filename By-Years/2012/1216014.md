High-speed multicore computers are widely available at low cost. They have the
potential to process high speed network applications, such as deep packet
inspection, and multi-channel real-time streaming of high-definition audio and
video. However, they need better scheduling approaches to address the demand of
high throughput and low latency of these applications while reducing energy
consumption. Current approaches do not consider real-time demands, network
traffic patterns and details of the specific multicore architectures. Lack of
power-aware core scheduling and thermal management has also led to a great
challenge in energy efficiency. Reducing power consumption saves energy cost,
reduces the need for building additional cooling, and improves computer hardware
reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project makes fundamental contributions
to the design and applications of high-demand network systems. It provides
packet level scheduling solutions that improve throughput, reduce latency and
energy consumption. The project develops and incorporates network traffic
models, architectural details, power consumption models, and thermal models
simultaneously for coordinated workload processing and energy consumption.
Quality-of-service (QoS) of packet streams/connections is also considered by
improving the jitter and out-of-order packet departures. Superiority of the
proposed technical approaches is verified through real implementation of network
applications and performance and power measurements on commercial multicore
architectures. An open-source framework is developed for multicore scheduling,
and is made available to the researchers along with optimized multithreaded
codes for network applications.
