This proof-of-concept project is developing a modular electronic product for use
in a Civil Engineering curriculum. The web-based learning system is being used
teach students the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) within the
foundational courses of a typical Civil Engineering program. As opposed to
generating a series of GIS courses, the GIS know-how is being introduced within
an existing course as a module that will reinforce basic concepts taught in a
comprehensive manner. The prototype has a geotechnical emphasis for inclusion in
a typical soil mechanics course. However, based on the proof-of-concept, the
prototype can serve as a template to further develop other modules
(environmental, transportation, hydrology, and/or construction) in a potential
full development effort. The principal objectives of this proof-of-concept
project are: (1) To create a prototype web-based learning system to support
students in learning how to apply GIS within the context of Civil Engineering
(geotechnical emphasis) classes; (2) To carry out an initial series of
evaluation studies with components and iterations of this system; and (3) To use
the prototype system and evaluation data as the foundation for full scale,
comprehensive project proposals. The GIS tool and the Civil Engineering
(geotechnical prototype) content were selected because of the importance of
these disciplines within the engineering profession and within the broad context
of current U.S. infrastructure needs. As a viable learning technology is being
developed, a detailed understanding of how students go about using interactive
software as a vehicle for learning to solve complex problems is also being
formulated. Moreover, the project has the potential to directly impact Civil
Engineering programs across the country and indirectly impact GIS instructional
technology across other disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
