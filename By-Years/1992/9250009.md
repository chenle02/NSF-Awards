This project will be implemented by an organization that has a ten-year history
of preparing students from underrepresented minority groups for careers in
science and engineering. Specifically, the proposer will work with the National
Science Foundation to initiate eight new Venture school-based projects in
Washington, DC. The Ventures (Macy) program in the selected DC public schools
will comprise all core areas of the curriculum: English, mathematics, science,
social studies, and foreign languages. Also included are the academic and non-
academic aspects of a comprehensive educational program, including personal
guidance and counseling services, formalized educational experiences that
develop cognitive problem-solving and analytical skills, and activities that
focus on enhancing independent study. Support will also be provided to continue
faculty development activities at the original Macy-sponsored schools in Alabama
and New York as well as the participating DC schools. In addition, evaluation
studies will be continued for all the sponsored schools.
