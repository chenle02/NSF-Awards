This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for
Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices
that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields
of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by introducing high
school teachers and students to the field of nanotechnology. The project will
develop and study the outcomes of a program that includes a concentrated two-
week summer program coupled with academic year mentoring, support, and research
opportunities. Nanotechnology teaching modules will be developed and tested,
with the aim of implementing, researching, and refining a nanotechnology-focused
program for secondary students, along with a professional development program
for teachers. The project is intended to generate student awareness and interest
in emerging workforce opportunities, particularly among students from low-income
and underrepresented populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to
increase nanotechnology content knowledge among students and teachers, increase
associated pedagogical content knowledge among teachers, increase scientific
research knowledge and skills among students and teachers, foster career
readiness in nanotechnology-related fields among students, and foster increased
teacher self-efficacy as it relates to teaching nanotechnology concepts. A
mixed-methods research approach will be used to study outcomes among teacher and
student participants, with pre-test and post-test data being collected in
association with each implementation of summer sessions and academic-year
modules. A quasi-experimental design will be used to compare results from
treatment and comparison groups. Content assessments and interest surveys will
be used to measure program impacts on student and teacher knowledge and
interests, and a series of observations, interviews, and surveys will be used to
guide interpretation of patterns detected in results from the treatment and
comparison groups.
