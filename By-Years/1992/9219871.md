Despite the evident importance of cone sheets in basalt volcanic systems, cone
sheet complexes are still poorly understood and their origin is the subject of
several competing hypotheses. We will apply paleo-magnetic techniques to test
these hypotheses in two study areas: the Cuillin Hills of Skye (Scotland) in the
roots of a major early-Tertiary basaltic volcano; and Kalfafellsdalur, a deeply
eroded Quaternary spreading ridge in SE Iceland. We will use the NRM orientation
to determine whether the centrally-inclined character of the sheet-intrusions is
due to post-intrusion tilting. We will determine the magma-flow direction by
magnetic susceptibility anisotropy, and we will estimate thermal gradients in
country rock adjacent to sheets by paleomagnetism.
