In this project, jointly funded by the Physical Chemistry and Biophysics
Programs, X-ray absorption techniques for high resolution studies of metal ion
centers in biologically important molecules will be developed. Specific
attention will be paid to developing direct probes of covalence in iron- and
copper-containing proteins. %%% Nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for
converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, is one of nature's major sources of
fertilizer. Detailed chemical understanding of the biological process by which
this conversion is accomplished brings us closer to the goal of economical and
environmentally benign fertilizer production. This project, by developing X-ray
methods of determining structure and bonding in the relevant enzymes, may lead
to major breakthroughs in this effort.
