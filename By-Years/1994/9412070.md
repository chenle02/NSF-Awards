9412070 Richards This equipment will be used in studies of turbulent mixing
phenomena (single and two phase) in nonreacting and reacting shear flows. Two
major projects will extensively employ this equipment. These are: (1) droplet
dispersions by large scale structures in reacting and nonreacting jets; and (2)
dynamics of a scalar field in a swirling jet. Besides these two projects, it is
anticipated that the equipment will provide broad support to faculty doing
experimental fluid mechanics research. ***
