American University (AU) will implement an ADVANCE Catalyst project: 1) to
undertake the collection and synthesis of quantitative and qualitative faculty
data with attention to intersectional perspectives as well as non-tenure track
faculty; 2) to review structures, policies and procedures that impact equity
among faculty in STEM; and 3) to develop and disseminate a STEM Faculty Equity
Plan that is aligned with the university-wide Strategic Plan and Inclusive
Excellence Plan. AU is a medium-sized, urban, private research university and
will be a model for other similar institutions. This two-year project will
prepare the university for future data collection and data analyses of faculty
equity which can be used by institutional leadership to inform decision-making.
The Catalyst work will also prepare the institution to implement evidence-based
strategies to enhance the university climate for all faculty which will be
outlined in a five-year faculty equity strategic plan that will be produced as
part of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF ADVANCE program is designed
to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of
organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of
diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit
equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational
culture and climate. ADVANCE "Catalyst" awards provide support for institutional
equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic
plans at an academic, non-profit institution of higher
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
