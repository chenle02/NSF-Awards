Torres, Rebecca U. of California, Davis This doctoral dissertation research will
examine the relationship between tourism and agriculture in Cancun, Mexico. The
area accounts for 28 percent of Mexico's tourism and a high proportion of
Quintana Roo state's domestic product. Nearly all Cancun's food requirements
must be imported and thus the situation is an ideal one in which to examine why
predicted linkages between agriculture and tourism have failed to develop. The
research will seek to answer the question by analyzing product flows,
infrastructure investments and tourist visits. A tourist typology with respect
to food demand and satisfaction will be developed from interviews with tourists,
managers, and operators. In addition farm households will be surveyed to
determine linkages, local knowledge of tourism industry demand, as well as,
factors affecting response to expressed tourism demand. The research captures
the need for more integrated studies which examine the primary elements of
demand, supply, and distribution that determine the linkages between agriculture
and tourism.
