KUMUNUjr 2014 is a regional commutative algebra conference for graduate students
and postdocs to be held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln during April
26-27, 2014. The goals of the conference are to foster collaboration among young
researchers in commutative algebra from Midwestern institutions, and to expose
commutative algebra students and postdocs from Midwestern institutions to the
current work being done in their fields at neighboring institutions. NSF funding
for KUMUNUjr 2014 will support participants' travel and lodging expenses.

The primary impacts of the conference will be its enrichment of the research
careers of the participants and the dissemination of recent ideas in commutative
algebra research at the graduate and postdoctoral level. In addition,
participants will take ideas and collaborations initiated at the conference to
the institutions where they eventually find careers.
