It has recently been shown theoretically that soliton-like waves can be guided
by optical waveguiding structures containing at least one Kerr- type, self-
focusing medium, and that under conditions of high excitation, spatial solitons
can be emitted from such a nonlinear structure. This has led to the prediction
of new soliton-based single waveguide devices such as optical limiters and all-
optical switches, as well as new modes of coupling between isolated waveguides.
This proposal concerns a combined program of theory and experiment, with theory
leading the way, to establish the feasibility of observing and utilizing
spatial-soliton-based nonlinear guided-wave phenomena in integrated optics. The
investigators will initially: (a) extend their previous 2-D cw studies to full
3-D simulations; (b) incorporate more realistic material nonlinearities and
assess their effects on these phenomena; (c) address the full 4-D spatio-
temporal problem which is associated with pulsed inputs; and (d) search for new
soliton-based devices for single and multiple waveguides. Based on these
calculations and in parallel with them, experiments will be initiated to
investigate both spatial and temporal soliton effects in nonlinear waveguiding
structures.
