This STTR Phase II project will develop commercially viable atomic force
microscope (AFM) probes fabricated from ultrananocrystalline diamond. The
project will refine the processes developed in Phase I and bring contact and
non-contact all-diamond probes to market. Probes using conducting diamond that
are chemically and electronically tunable and have superb tribological
properties will also be developed.

This work will facilitate new industrial applications for AFM, including high-
throughput imaging, metrology, and characterization of large quantities of
materials, local electrical characterization for process control in
micro/nanoelectronics, nanomechanical characterization of MEMS/NEMS devices, and
ultraprecise hard mask correction for the micro/nanolithography industry.
