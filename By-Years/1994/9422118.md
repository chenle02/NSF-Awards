Some apes (especially gibbons), and perhaps some ancestors to humans, used
special forms of arm-swinging to move among the tree branches. Brachiation is
the term given to the most specialized form of such suspensory behavior. In
attempting to understand the mechanics of brachiation, it has been modeled as
the movement of a passive pendulum. However, this likely does not accurately
represent the actual mechanisms by which gibbons, for example, move through the
complex and obstacle-ridden world of tree branches. There be active propulsive
forces to modulate speed and direction. This research project will identify the
muscular mechanisms the gibbon can use to maneuver and propel itself, and what
strategies other than pendular motion exist for minimizing energy expenditure in
brachiation. To date, research in this area has been limited by the lack of a
method for directly measuring the kinetic reaction forces produced by an animal
subject during locomotion. In this study, a newly developed 6-component
force/torque transducer will be attached to a handhold used by brachiating
animals. Combined with simultaneous video analysis,iti will be used for a
comprehensive study of the mechanics of brachiation.
