The objective of this research is to improve the fundamental understanding on
the interactions between organic semiconductors and self-assembled monolayers,
and to apply it towards the development of a low-cost, high-throughput
patterning technique for organic thin-film transistors. The approach is to
exploit film-forming properties on selectively chemically modified surfaces and
induce patterning by differential microstructure.

This project will explore ordering of organic semiconductor molecules driven by
interactions at interfaces. A high degree of order in the transistor channels,
where the interactions are present, promotes high-mobility. Film regions
surrounding the devices, where the interactions are not present, consist of
high-resistivity regions of randomly oriented molecules, electrically insulating
devices and yielding self-patterning. A wide variety of semiconductors will be
employed as active layers, in combination with various surface treatments.
Correlations between the chemical structure of the organic semiconductor and
self-assembled monolayer, and their eventual film microstructure and electrical
properties, will be established and used to generate design rules governing the
limits and applicability of this technique.

This research will deliver methods for patterning organic thin-film transistors.
Such progress may accelerate commercialization of organic electronic devices.
This interdisciplinary program not only will create an environment for cross-
training graduate and undergraduate students from Wake Forest University in
Physics, Chemistry, Material science and Engineering, but at the same time will
cultivate community engagement by offering research opportunities for local
high-school students, Forsyth Tech community college students and minority
students, who will be trained in semiconductor fabrication and characterization
techniques that will make them uniquely employable.
