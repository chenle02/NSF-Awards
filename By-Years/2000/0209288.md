One of the goals of the U. S. Weather Research Program is to improve the
prediction of heavy precipitation events that are often associated with frontal
systems. The objective of this research is to improve understanding of the
influence of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) on atmospheric fronts. Extensive
research has been devoted to frontal dynamics and the influence of the
underlying topography on them. However, the effect of the boundary layer on the
development and modification of fronts as they move over various surfaces is not
well understood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the current proposal is to
improve understanding of the influence of the planetary boundary layer on
atmospheric fronts. In his study, the Principal Investigator (PI) will utilize
numerical models and data from three completed field programs. The PI lists four
research thrusts, which are to investigate the role of the boundary layer
(marine and land, including topography) on:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. the
evolution of fronts over topography;&lt;br/&gt;2. the development of marine
fronts;&lt;br/&gt;3. the evolution of fronts that travel from the ocean to a
coastal mountain range;&lt;br/&gt;4. the evolution of unbalanced
fronts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will enhance understanding of frontal
development and variation that are crucial in mid-latitude weather prediction.
If the research is successful, results could positively impact the forecasting
of frontal related weather (e.g. precipitation) through better numerical
forecasts and better conceptual models.&lt;br/&gt;
