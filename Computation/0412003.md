The project aims to develop robust numerical methods and a high quality software
package PolynPak for solving three fundamental algebraic problems: the
univariate polynomial AGCD (approximate greatest common divisor), the
multivariate polynomial AGCD, and accurate multiplicity-identification/root-
finding. All three problems are under a common assumption in application that
the given data are empirical and may contain errors from measurement and
rounding-off. The methodology in this project consists of a two-stage approach
and the theory that, while GCD and multiple roots are ill-posed/ill-conditioned
under arbitrary perturbation, they are remarkably insensitive when perturbations
are structure-preserving. Therefore, the ill-posedness can be removed by
reformulating the problem in a least squares setting under a structural
constraint after calculating the structure of AGCD and multiplicity. The
approach in this project may also be applicable to other ill-posed problems in
numerical computation.

This research is carried out in the fields of computer algebra and numerical
analysis where the mission is to provide the scientific and industrial community
with reliable algorithms and software for solving mathematical problems. Since
polynomial is one of the most fundamental models in applied mathematics with a
wide range of applications in areas such as economic equilibria, chemical
reaction, image processing/restoration, to name a few, developing robust
algorithms and software for polynomial algebra, as the objective of this
project, may have profound impact in those applications and in scientific
computing.
