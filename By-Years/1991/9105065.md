The proposed research program is designed to examine the fundamentals of both
interfacial carbide precipitation and precipitation of carbides within a grain
matrix in 316 stainless steel. Researcher, including engineers and minority
students at the University of Texas, will compare the geometrical and
crystallographic features of 316 stainless steel with martensite nucleation in
304 stainless steel. Their task will be to determine whether specific
interfacial sites for precipitation of carbides are also specific for martensite
nucleation, and whether invariant strain intersections within the grains (which
are specific to alpha prime-martensite nucleation in 304 stainless steel) are
precipitation nucleation sites in 316 stainless steel. Practical consequences of
developing a fundamental understanding of the deformation-induced sensitization
and precipitation mechanisms will be examined in the context of potential alloy
modification and modeling of potential hazards imposed by storing and
transporting hazardous and corrosive wastes in stainless steel containers or
pipeline systems.
