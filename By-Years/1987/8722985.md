This project is in the general areas of analytical and surface chemistry and
inorganic, bioinorganic, and organometallic chemistry and addresses the broad
subfield of electron transfer processes. Dr. Hupp, who is supported in the
Inorganic, Bioinorgaqnic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program under NSF grant
CHE-8710014 and who is also a Presidential Young Investigator awardee in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is focussing his research efforts on
two areas. The first involves the development and characterization of new,
electroactive polymeric materials from which large dimension structural arrays
will be prepared. These assemblies should enable the three dimensional control
of redox site distribution and are expected to be applicable in the
technologically important areas of imaging displays and electrocatalysis. Dr.
Hupp's second research focus centers on mechanistic studies of photolytically
and thermally induced electron transfer reactions. These studies are relevant to
an enhanced understanding of light-driven energy conversion processes,
particularly those involved in photosynthesis. This present action provides
funds for the acquisition of a spectrophotometer with which the ultraviolet,
visible, and near- infrared spectral characteristics of species involved in
electron transfer processes of interest to Dr. Hupp can be studied. This
instrument will be extremely useful to both of Dr. Hupp's NSF- supported
research activities.
