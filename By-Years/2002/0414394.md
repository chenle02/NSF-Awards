0414394 Sanderson The Hudson River and Estuary is a region that faces critically
important environmental challenges ranging from urban development, suburban land
use, and agricultural practices, to power generation, industrial contamination,
and recreational use. This Riverscope CLEANER planning initiative will define an
engineering assessment infrastructure for distributed sensing, data handling and
visualization, modeling and simulation and integrated assessment with
application to issues in rivers, estuaries, and coastal environmental systems
and particular attention to adaptive environmental management of the Hudson
River and Estuary. This CLEANER planning project will be based on a
collaborative program of universities associated with the Rivers and Estuaries
Center on the Hudson (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University), and will take advantage of existing
projects and infrastructure to build new capabilities and linkages.
