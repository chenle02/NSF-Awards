The aim of the proposed research is to create a set of augmented, theory-driven
examinations that expand the range of cognitive skills assessed and to examine
the impact of this approach on student achievement. The PIs will use the College
Board's Advanced Placement (AP) programs in Physics and Biology as a testing
ground for the project. The augmented exams will be based explicitly on
Sternberg's theory of cognitive processing skills. Augmented AP Exams in Biology
and Physics would be developed to test students' ability to utilize different
cognitive skills (analytical, practical, creative) as well as their content
knowledge. Tests would be developed by teams of AP high school teachers working
with professors of physics and biology. In Study 1, the PIs will gather content-
related validity evidence for the Augmented exams, establishing the extent to
which items tap the intended content domains and cognitive-processing skills. In
Study 2, the PIs will conduct a psychometric study of the Augmented AP exams,
seeking to establish the internal validity of the cognitive subscales. This
research has the potential to bring theoretical notions of intelligence and
cognitive ability to bear on widely used high-stakes tests.
