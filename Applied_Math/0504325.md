Do leaves compute? That is, how do they solve the problem of optimizing CO2
uptake while minimizing water loss during respiration? The devices of
respiration, the leaf stomata, are also the information processing units in the
system, and they self-organize to locate an optimal solution given the
environmental conditions. This project will explore the evidence of emergent
behavior in leaf stomata during respiration through dynamic pattern analysis and
the use of computational mechanics ideas. It is interdisciplinary, involving
mathematicians, physicists, and biologists, and will merge data from biological
experiments and the information processing theory of distributed computational
systems.
