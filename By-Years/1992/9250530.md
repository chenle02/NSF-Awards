The Department of Chemistry's acquisition a 200 MHz fourier transform (FT)
spectrometer is providing undergraduate chemistry majors with training in modern
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The integrated instructional
approach uses introductory experiments to introduce and reinforce the basic
concepts and builds to advanced two- dimensional NMR projects. Availability of
the instrument is leading to the development of a new advanced undergraduate
laboratory/lecture course focused entirely on multipulse and two-dimensional
NMR. The undergraduate research program is also benefitting from the new
instrument.
