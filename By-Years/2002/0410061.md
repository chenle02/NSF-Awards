This is award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports research by Professors James Demas at the University of
Virginia and Benjamin DeGraff at James Madison University to continue an
integrated program of metal complex and polymer synthesis coupled with
fluorescence microscopy, dynamic polarization, time resolved emission
spectroscopy to probe the fundamental photochemical properties of Ru(II),
Os(II), Re(I), and Ir(III) complexes with diimine ligands. The research aims
toward an in-depth fundamental understanding of the detailed interaction of
these complexes in solution and in polymers with regard to the rational design
of new types of luminescent sensor systems or systems with enhanced sensivity
and stability. Sensor systems for oxygen, pH, carbon dioxide sensors, and metal
ions will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is designed to enable
the development of new and enhanced sensors for a wide range of technological
areas including industrial, biomedical, and environmental monitoring. Graduate
and undergraduate students will be trained in the fundamentals of luminescence
and in applying these techniques to an important range of problems amenable to
spectroscopic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;
