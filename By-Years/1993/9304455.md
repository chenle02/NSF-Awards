The proposed work involves three parts aimed at the study of crust-mantle
evolution from 4.3 Ga to present, all of which use Hafnium isotope variations as
the common theme. The projects we have chosen reflect a balance between
identification of key localities and sample suites and areas of research in
which the PI and Co-PI have extensive experience. Our investigations of the sub-
continental mantle focus on sites which represent major, rapidly- developed
thermal anomalies in the mantle that involved various contributions from plume,
depleted mantle, and lithospheric mantle. Work on the earliest differentiation
of the Earth concentrates on integrated Nd, Hf, and U/Pb isotope work on the
oldest terrestrial materials: 4.3 to 4.0 Ga zircons from western Australia and
the 4.0 Ga Acasta Gneiss, NWT Canada. Investigations of crust-mantle recycling
focus on the Penokean Orogen in Wisconsin through whole-rock/mineral Nd and Pb
and combined Nd, Hf, and U/Pb isotope analysis of inherited, Proterozoic, and
Archean zircons. This work represents a collaborative effort with 11 other
researchers at seven institutions.
