Optical tomography will be applied to the measurement of turbulent mixing fields
and flames, providing multi-dimensional quantitative measurements and three-
dimensional flow imaging. This project will develop a formalism for evaluating
limited-data reconstruction techniques, determine the available information from
various experimental geometries, and develop new algorithms which incorporate
constraints based on turbulence theory. Approaches to the problem include
artifact and null-space estimation, super-resolution, and the use of statistical
constraints. Research will also explore the applicability of parallel
computation and micro-computers for laboratory implementation. Simulated object
sets will be used for verification.
