Texas Lutheran College requests funds to renovate the faculty/undergraduate
research spaces of the multidisciplinary Moody Science Hall. Renovations will
include a total of 23 spaces and the renovation of a number of small and several
larger faculty/undergraduate research/research training laboratories. These
spaces will be equipped fully with new or renovated systems for water, gas,
distilled water, steam, plumbing and HVAC. The roof will be repaired, hoods will
be renovated, and the humidity controlled. Research/research training currently
conducted in the facility includes: exploration of Titanium (II) complexes;
study of the reaction products of alkali metals with substituted pyridines;
facilitated chemical reactions using phase transfer catalysis and ultrasound;
gravitational physiology and the control of circulation; and the study of
myocardial cell ultrastructure. The renovation will more than double the number
of students participating in research. The college will be able to move toward
projects in independent scientific inquiry for all science majors and increase
the current total of undergraduate research/research training stations to 34.
Research will be more fully integrated into the curriculum, and new pursuits in
research will be made possible. Future ability to attract and retain both gifted
students and accomplished faculty will be greatly affected by research
facilities which are complete and functional.
