PROJECT ABSTRACT AN INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON NANOMECHANICS

Funding of approximately $30,000 is requested from the National Science
Foundation to co-fund a workshop on nanomechanics. The 3-day workshop will have
a maximum of 50 participants representing nanomechanics theories, computational
techniques, applications, and experimental verification. High technical merit is
achieved through a scientific advisory committee of leading researchers from
academic, industrial, and government institutions who will identify critical
issues and potentially serve as speakers or discussion leaders. The broader
impact of the workshop will be maximized through peer-reviewed technical
proceedings, a web page with audio/video proceedings, graduate student
participants, and development of future technical symposia. The requested NSF
funds will support approximately 15 speakers and 5 graduate students from
domestic institutions as well as web page development. The National Science
Council of Taiwan and National Institute of Standards and Technology have
committed $38,000 in matching support for the workshop.
