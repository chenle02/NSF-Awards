9313685 Hinton This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Arkansas in Fayetteville in the purchase of a workstation cluster of IBM RS
6000/370 computers. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: 1. NMR Chemical Shift Calculations a. Develop GIAO
(Gauge Including Atomic Orbital) NMR chemical shift code for network parallel
processing. b. Develop a parallel NMR chemical shielding program using local
density functional (LDF) theory. 2. Methods for Molecular Potential Surfaces a.
Efficient multiconfigurational methods for potential energy surfaces: UNO-CAS
and generalized Miller-Plesset Perturbation theory. b. Dynamical correlation
methods for large molecules. %%% A workstation network of fast, modern computer
workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry
departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development environment
for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and
visualization facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art applications
of parallel processing. ***
