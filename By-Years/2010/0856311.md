This multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Safety, Security and Rescue Research located at the University of South Florida
and the University of Minnesota will bring together industry, academe, and
public sector users together to provide integrative robotics and artificial
intelligence solutions in robotics for activities conducted by the police, FBI,
FEMA, firefighting, transportation safety, and emergency response to mass
casuality-related activities. The need for safety, security, and rescue
technologies has accelerated in the aftermath of 9/11 and a new research
community is forming, as witnessed by the first IEEE Workshop on Safety,
Security and Rescue Robotics in February 2003. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center
will be built upon the knowledge and expertise of multi-disciplinary researchers
in computer science, engineering, industrial organization, psychology, public
health, and marine sciences at the University of South Florida (the lead
institution) and the University of Minnesota.&lt;br/&gt;
