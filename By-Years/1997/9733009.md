9733009 Chilkoti The major goal of the proposed research is to reversibly
modulate protein-ligand affinity by a thermally-triggered molecular switch
attached to the protein scaffold in the vicinity of the active site. The design
includes a novel two-step strategy, combining genetic circular permutation with
enzyme-assisted reversed proteolysis, to produce the final protein-polymer
conjugate. The PI envisions future development of a regenerable, semi-continuous
biosensor based on permustat-poly (NIPAAm) constructs that display "off-rate"
controlled affinity modulation. The research activity is complemented by an
educational program which addresses two primary aims: the establishment of an
outreach program for high school students within the Duke School of Engineering,
and the expansion of the Biomedical Engineering curriculum to include new
elective courses in the fields of genetic engineering, molecular biology and
protein engineering. ***
