9355589 Austin Project SCORE (Science Concepts Organized Reinforced and
Enhanced) is a program designed by teachers and university professionals to
develop a long term interactive support system for teachers in Prince George's
County, Maryland who teach life sciences. The premise of the project
acknowledges the critical role of the teacher in science education and the
responsibility of higher educational institutions in providing support for
teachers. An interdisciplinary core of university science content teachers,
government and private industry scientists and other educational professionals
will introduce teachers to the latest scientific information in the life
sciences via hands-on laboratory experiences and learning resources (kits,
modules, etc.). Project SCORE consists of three summer science institutes for
twenty-five new mentor teachers each year who will mentor teachers in schools in
Prince George's County. The mentor teachers and mentorees will be given
sustained support throughout the year by Howard University science content
teachers and graduate students. Life science awareness workshops will also be
conducted for parents and students.
