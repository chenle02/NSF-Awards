The mystery of how people succeed in representing abstract things has engaged
scholars for a long time. This dissertation research tests the idea that some
conceptual structures are not constructed entirely de novo, rather they arise
through the reuse or functional redirection of existing structures. The fact
that people talk about time in terms of space may be a clue that they think
about time using spatial representations. The experiments in this research
project inquire about relationships between language and thought using simple
psychophysical tasks with entirely nonlinguistic, non-symbolic stimuli and
responses (e.g., lines and dots). By using psychophysical paradigms,
relationships will be explored between abstract and concrete domains of
knowledge, guided by patterns in language, but free of the potential confounds
associated with using linguistic stimuli to investigate nonlinguistic mental
representations. Experiments will be conducted in the US, Spain, France and
China. Broader impacts. This research aims to understand the impact of cross-
linguistic diversity on human cognition. To this end, it is necessary to recruit
research personnel who speak a variety of languages. This project has already
involved students and colleagues who are native speakers of English, French,
Greek, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish, and has fostered potentially lasting
international collaborations. This project encourages the participation of
undergraduate researchers from minority groups that are underrepresented in the
sciences, by making their cultural and linguistic heritage the focus of
scientific inquiry. By exploring previously hidden links between language and
thought, and by asking how these connections may be shaped by newly discovered
cross-linguistic differences, this project has the potential to advance our
knowledge of human cognitive diversity, to enhance cross-cultural understanding,
and to address one of the central questions in the cognitive sciences: what is
universal in the human mind, and what is shaped by our particular linguistic and
cultural experience?
