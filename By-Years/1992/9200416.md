Research in Particulate Systems Engineering is crucial to advances in
combustion, atmospheric and environmental sciences, nuclear winter studies,
nuclear reactor safety, and materials manufacturing. The purpose of this project
is to provide research experiences for twelve undergraduate students in this
area at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Each student will undertake a
specific research project, and faculty advisors will work with the students to
develop his/her research skills. An essential element of the program is its
emphasis on professional development of the students. The purpose is to infuse
bright, undergraduate students with an enthusiasm towards research careers,
including graduate level education.
