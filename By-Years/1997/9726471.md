The focus of this research is the development of methodology for the
construction of a variety of C-X bonds: C-C, C-N and C-O. The majority of the
effort will be be spent developing methods for catalytic asymmetric activation
of alkenes for attack by non-metal bound, external nucleophiles. To this end,
the synthesis of a variety of novel planar chiral Pd(II) catalysts will be
carried out. The reactions targeted for catalysis include allylic imidate
rearrangements, Cope and Claisen rearrangements, allylic ester rearrangements
and cyclizations to form chiral nitrogen and oxygen containing heterocycles. A
second aspect of the research focuses on the asymmetric Heck reaction. The
objective of all of the investigations is to develop practical catalytic methods
through systematic studies that will provide fundamental insight that will
enable future rational development of new asymmetric catalyst architectures.
With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Larry E. Overman of the Department of Chemistry
at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Overman will focus his work
on developing new catalytic asymmetric transformations of inexpensive alkenes to
valuable enantiopure products. The development of this type of methodology is of
great importance to the pharmaceutical industry.
