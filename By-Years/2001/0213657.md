This project seeks to use fossil wetland deposits and fossil rodent middens from
the Atacama Dessert in the Central Andes as a means to estimate precipitation
and seasonality for the region as a aid to reconstructing Quaternary climate.
The fossil data and paleoclimatic reconstructions will be guided, in part, by
consideration of the modalities of the modern climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the research is to use the fossil data to understand the steep
transition between two seasonal rainfall regimes linked to the South American
Summer Monsoon and the southern westerlies. The chosen research sites underlie
this transition zone and are along a 300-km stretch of Atacama Desert highlands
and the southern edge of the Altiplano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking,
the research will support international scientific collaboration and
undergraduate student training. It has the potential to link important
paleoclimate proxy records with modern climatology in order to interpret past
climate processes in a region with little existing paleoclimate data.
