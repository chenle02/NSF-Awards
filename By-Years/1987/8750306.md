In the area of Animal Physiology, fundamental research tools are a computer-
recorder system and a storage oscilloscope for monitoring physiological
functions and changes. In Animal Behavior and Ornithology a storage oscilloscope
has become the standard tool for displaying and analyzing an array of animal
vocalizations. In both areas there are many experiments that help to elucidate
important concepts that cannot be done without these instruments. The purchases
made possible through this grant are enlarging this Department's capacity to
train undergraduates in these areas. The importance of these additions stems
from the fact that, over recent years, research in Physiology and Animal
Behavior has become increasingly dependent on high-technology equipment. As
usage of this type of equipment has become a matter of course in research
laboratories, it has become essential for instructional purposes as well.
Students must be introduced to equipment that is used routinely to gather data
if they are to become familiar with and eventually to evaluate concepts
developed as a result of that experimentation. Likewise, their potential as
research scientists is enhanced by a working familiarity with the methodologies
that are used widely in current research.
