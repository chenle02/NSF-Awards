Astronomy is a fully international endeavor. To participate in the international
scientific community, American researchers must meet and collaborate with
researchers from around the world, and to do this they must attend international
scientific meetings. These meetings provide a forum for interacting with other
researchers, forming collaborations, presenting new results and participating in
the international scientific community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
provide support for approximately 150 US astronomers, postdocs, and students to
participate in international professional meetings. This award will be
especially important to early-career scientists and those from less-endowed
institutions as it will help give them the opportunity to actively participate
in these important meetings.
