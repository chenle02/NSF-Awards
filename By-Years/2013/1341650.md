Intellectual Merit: The Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) encompasses exposures of
Antarctic bedrock that provide a history of Antarctic continental evolution. The
TAM also creates microhabitats for extremophiles and hosts unconsolidated
sedimentary deposits that record the history of the ice sheet and Antarctica?s
changing climate. Much less is known of the extant faunal and floral
assemblages, climate, or geophysics of this region. The PI proposes a workshop
to facilitate the gathering of multi disciplinary researchers to exchange ideas
for investigating processes that are occurring or that have occurred in the TAM.
This workshop will take place in September 2013 in Minneapolis and will be
locally organized by Polar Geospatial Center.

Broader impacts: TAM researchers come from diverse fields in geoscience,
atmospheric and climate science, glaciology, and ecology and evolutionary
science. This workshop will encourage the participation of graduate students,
post-docs, and early career researchers and the organizing committee will strive
to include a diverse group of participants.
