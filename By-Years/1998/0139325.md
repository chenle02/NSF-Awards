The program aims to help improve articulation between high school mathematics
and science courses and between middle and high school science courses. It
capitalizes on existing programs and partnerships between the schools and Boston
University and the technology already present but underutilized in the schools.
The fellow-teacher teams are combining virtual models and existing software
(such as Biologica or MathSoft Study Works) with hands on data collection to
enhance student understanding of concepts in the state science standards. The
Fellows' understanding of classroom practice is enhanced through participation
in a teacher enhancement summer workshop that precedes their work with their
teacher team members and their classroom experience, and participation during
the year in a GK-12 seminar series and specifically designed education courses.
The project includes work with Fellow faculty advisors to help them understand
the potential benefits to their students and specific efforts by the evaluation
team to explore ways to ensure sustainability of the project. This project is
receiving partial support from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical
Sciences
