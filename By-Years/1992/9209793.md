Numerical simulation is an important tool for predicting the behavior of
physical systems. Many powerful numerical simulation programs exist today.
However, using these programs to reliably analyze a physical situation requires
considerable human effort and expertise to set up a simulation, determine
whether the output makes sense, and repeatedly run the simulation with different
inputs until a satisfactory result is achieved. Automating this process is not
only of considerable practical importance but will also significantly advance
basic AI research in reasoning about the physical world. This project will
address these problems of setup, analysis, quality assurance, and feedback for
numerical simulation.
