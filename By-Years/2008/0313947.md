0313947&lt;br/&gt;Dutta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports 18 American
students to travel to Seoul, Korea to participate with counterpart British and
Korean students in the final phase of a graduate level global product
development course. The University of Michigan, in collaboration with Oxford
University and Seoul National University, manages the course. During the
semester, students work in multi-national teams to design, develop and
manufacture a product for the global market. The projects and the course are
completed during face-to-face interactions of the student project teams. This
project is developing a holistic approach to the development of products for
multiple markets and helping to prepare a globally engaged U.S. engineering
workforce. &lt;br/&gt;
