Field work supported under EAR8607330 has suggested that the southern Lake
Michigan region is indeed dynamic, responding to global relaxation forced by the
melting ice sheets of the last ice age. The goal of this research is to continue
field work by eliminating the extent of ice transgression. The theoretical
aspect includes use of field data to reconstruct, using generalized inversion
theory, the most likely insight into most appropriate models expressing earth
rheology. Results will shed light on the current "hinge-line" hypothesis
exploring glacial rebound of the crust, provide information on the nature of the
ice sheet and style of glaciation, and yield a greater understanding of glacio-
isostasy and the mechanism for earth mantle convection. Undergraduates will
fully participate in this research project.
