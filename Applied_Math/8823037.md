8823037 Bloom This proposal is for a continuation of work on models of wave
propagation in nonlinear dielectric media and on problems associated with the
behavior of nonlinear transmission lines. The mathematical formulations involve
partial differential equations in one and several dimensions of both hyperbolic
and mixed type; the interest is in establishing results on the local and global
existence of solutions to Cauchy and initial-boundary value problems, as well as
results on the asymptotic behavior of solutions. Also considered are the related
problems of breakdown of smooth solutions, shock formation, and the existence of
shock surfaces. Many of the models presented are new (e.g., wave propagation in
a nonlinear superconducting media and the multidimensional wave propagation
problems in dielectrics with nontrivial conductivity) and several lead to
problems in which a physical parameter tends to zero.
