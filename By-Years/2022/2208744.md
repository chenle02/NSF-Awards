Rechargeable batteries are powering the rise in plug-in electric vehicles and
intermittent renewable energy storage/transport/utilization in the electric
grid. With double-digit annual growth expected over the next decade for
production and sales of electric vehicles, cost of materials, resource
availability, and supply chain will become increasingly critical factors in
novel and sustainable battery technologies. In this regard, aluminum ion
batteries hold great promise for large-scale energy storage applications based
on their fast-charging capability, earth-abundant resources, and lower cost of
raw materials. The overall objective of this project is to 1) develop novel
chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolytes with low-viscosity and highly
conductive additives, and 2) elucidate microscopic conversion chemistry,
transport, charge storage mechanism, and stability challenges of chloroaluminate
anions in aluminum ion batteries. Such knowledge is critical to enhance the
commercialization potential of earth-abundant, safer, and long-life aluminum ion
batteries. This project strives to increase participation of underrepresented
undergraduate and graduate students in science and engineering research in rural
west Alabama. The educational benefits of the project include graduate and
undergraduate researcher training in electroanalytical chemistry, materials
science, battery science and engineering, microfabrication, and cell
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projectâ€™s aim is to systematically explore the
effects of ionic liquid electrolyte compositions and surface engineered graphene
foam electrodes on the chloroaluminate anions adsorption, conversion,
intercalation, and mass transport, which will provide a fundamental
understanding of effective conversion and intercalation/deintercalation
chemistry of chloroaluminate anions species in aluminum ion batteries. New
insights, including quantitative molecular or atomic-level structural, chemical,
spectroscopic, and electrochemical characterizations, into graphene/ionic liquid
electrolyte interfacial structures will provide powerful practical strategies to
promote or suppress various kinds of interface phenomena. The outcome and
knowledge gained from such studies will guide the design and fabrication of
novel ionic liquid electrolytes and graphene-based electrodes for superior
energy storage density and cycling performance of aluminum ion batteries. Such
knowledge is critically needed for designing long-life electrolytes/electrodes
and low-cost energy storage systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
