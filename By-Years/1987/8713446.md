This is a follow-up conference on structural failures by the Engineering
Foundation Conference held in 1983. The conference addresses primarily the
practicing structural engineers. Bridge and building designers from other
countries will also participate in the meeting to share their experiences and
the approaches to safety taken in their country. The primary objectives of the
conference are as follows: 1. To review the recommendations of the 1983
conference on Building Structural Failures. 2. To share the experience of
designers in other countries in using various methods to insure safety. 3. To
identify more specifically the steps to be taken to ensure structural integrity.
4. To communicate these findings to the practicing structural engineer. The
meeting will provide an effective forum to focus on the discussion of impact to
the structural integrity by the new computers and computer technology, and by
the increasing implementation of limited states design practice.
