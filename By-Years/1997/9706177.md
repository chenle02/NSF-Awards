9706177 Bumgardner This award provides partial support for the Southern
Biomedical Engineering Conference, April 4-6, 1997, to acquire, install, and
begin the operation of a computer server connected to the World Wide Web, a part
of the Internet. The server would give access to the audio and visual displays
of the plenary presentations and the abstracts of the scientific papers read at
the meeting. The system is to be linked to other biomedical engineering programs
and resources such as BMEnet. The conference proceedings thereby would be made
available world wide at no cost to the user. The system will be used by the
organizers of future Southern Biomedical Engineering Conferences for program
planning and post-conference information dissemination. System maintenance will
be managed by the Agricultural and Biological Engineering Department of
Mississippi State University. ***
