The objective of the proposed work is to acquire the data needed to determine
field sites for tests of a conceptual model that describes the geomorphic
processes active on a floodplain during inundation. To determine the study
reaches for field reaches for field investigations, from June 10 December 1991,
the literature on hydrologic, sediment transport, geologic, geomorphic, and
vegetative characteristics of domestic and foreign alluvial rivers will be
compiled. Data regarding the hydrologic and sediment transport characteristics
of rivers during overbank flooding and the relation between floodplain
topography and the depths of inundating flows will be especially sought.
