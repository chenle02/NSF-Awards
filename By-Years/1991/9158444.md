This grant supports continuation of work on the molecular biology of a molecular
"switch" that causes alternate expression of the flagellin genes of the
bacterium Salmonella typhimurium. Both genetic and biochemical approaches will
be taken on defining the roles of protein-protein interactions in the enhancer
stimulated recombination reaction that inverts a critical piece of DNA on the
bacterial genome. In addition to these studies, new work will be started on
another antigenic variation system in bacteria, that of the bacterium Mycoplasma
hyorhinis. This bacterium exhibits antigenic variation of its lipid-modified
surface proteins. The complex patterns of alteration in antigenic nature and
size of the surface proteins suggest a very interesting and perhaps novel
mechanisms of control. A plasmid or transposon system for mutational studies
will be developed in order to facilitate studies in Mycoplasma, organisms with
the smallest known genomes of any living organisms.
