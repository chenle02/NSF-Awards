0402775&lt;br/&gt;Walden&lt;br/&gt;This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides shared-use instrumentation to
significantly improve the oceanographic research capabilities of the research
vessels Atlantis, Knorr and Oceanus, three ships operated by WHOI as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.
Specifically, this award will provide a 75 kHz shipboard acoustic current
profiler, a transmissometer, temperature and conductivity sensors and an
altimeter for use with CTDs, two scintillation counters, clamps for use with in-
situ pumps, freezer and refrigeration systems for scientific sample storage, and
supplies for use with multiple opening/closing biological net systems. These
improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using these
three ships in their research during 2004 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
