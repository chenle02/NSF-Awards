This project is upgrading the laboratory component of optics by introducing
current instrumentation related to setting up and testing erbium-doped fiber
optical amplifiers and distributed feedback lasers. Students are characterizing
the output of a distributed feedback laser by measuring it output power,
linearity, central wavelength, and spectral width using power meters,
monochromators, and scanning interferometers. They are assembling and testing an
erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) system. Using a leveled sine-wave generator
as a driving source or an LED and a DFB laser, appropriate detector and a wide
bandwidth oscilloscope, they are measuring amplification and linearity of the
EDFA for a range of signal strengths. They are also measuring bit error rate
using a BERT driving a DFB laser source, sending a signal through a length of
fiber with and without amplification by an EDFA. Finally, they are using two DFB
lasers as sources to make a narrowly-spaced (in wavelength) wavelength division
multiplexer which inputs its signal to an EDFA before the demultiplexing stage.
All instruments are representative of those which a technician working with
fiber optics uses.
