Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trade agreements increasingly focus on domestic
policies such as product standards or environmental regulations, which has
implications for society at large. The main objective of the project is to use
rigorous economic analysis to examine the welfare impacts of deep-integration
agreements. These are international trade agreements negotiated by considering
the views of different interest groups. While the natural starting point of the
project is an examination of shallow trade agreements that deal only with trade
policies, this research focuses primarily on deep-integration aspects. The
overarching insight is that a key determinant of the welfare effects of an
international trade agreement depends on the structure of coalitions among
different interest groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reference point for this
project is the canonical terms-of-trade model, in which there is no political-
economy rationale for trade negotiations; in this model the only rationale for
negotiations is to prevent countries from manipulating terms of trade. The
approach in this project differs from the canonical one in several ways. The
project considers a continuum of small countries, which have no ability to
manipulate terms of trade, and take into account the role of interest groups in
trade negotiations. In order to examine how agreements that incorporate the
stance of interest groups affect welfare, the research distinguishes between the
governments' positive objectives and a normative criterion. Finally, the project
models regulatory policies in a novel way that is tractable and will highlight
the different implications of product regulations that primarily deals with
locally-sold products, and process regulations that are on the production
processes used locally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
