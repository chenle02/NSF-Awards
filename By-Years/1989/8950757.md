This project secures equipment for developing a robotics laboratory to support
the recently implemented robotics course in mechanical engineering. Most of the
equipment is designed and offered for educational purposes and comes with
prepared laboratory and experiments manuals. The laboratory requires each group
of students to perform an experiments each week and then rotate to the next
experiments. This robotics laboratory, in conjunction with the institution's
"hands-on" philosophy, prepares engineering students more effectively for the
rapidly expanding area of robotics. This award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
