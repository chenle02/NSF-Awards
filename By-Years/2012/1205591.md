Among the exciting events of recent years has been the mounting evidence that
the very early universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion known as
"primordial inflation". During primordial inflation there is a vast enhancement
of quantum effects, which are ordinarily very small. Another significant feature
of primordial inflation is that these quantum effects become fossilized so that
they can be detected by current observers. The goals of this study are, among
others, to work out how quantum effects arise from primordial inflation, to
settle the long-standing controversy over whether or not the self-gravitation of
particles produced during inflation can slow down the expansion of the universe
and to investigate modified gravity theories which might describe the current
universe.

Such a study is interesting because there is a vast reservoir of largely
untapped data in the radiation from the very early structures which can be seen
at great distances. This data offers sensitivity to energy scales and physical
laws far beyond those that can be reached in accelerators such as the Large
Hadron Collider. This project will promote teaching, training and learning. To
this end, the PI will continue serving as a host in the University of Florida's
Junior Science, Engineering and Humanities Symposium. These presentations
typically involve simple explanations of, for example, why galactic rotation
curves suggest dark matter. Then the PI discusses how students can prepare for a
career in theoretical physics. The PI will also continue to deliver colloquia
based on his 2009 review article, "How Far Are We from the Quantum Theory of
Gravity?" in Reports on Progress in Physics. These colloquia are accessible to
interested but non-specialist physicists, and to graduate students new to the
field.
