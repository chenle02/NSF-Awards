There are materials whose electrical properties change substantially depending
on external conditions such as temperature, magnetic field, and pressure. These
materials can potentially be used to improve electronic functionalities and/or
create new ones. One such functionality involves the utilization of the spin
property of electrons instead of their charge property like most electronics do.
Devices which take advantage of this functionality offer several improvements
over their traditional counterparts including, but not limited to, reduction in
power consumption and increase in speed. The magnetic crystal that will be
studied exhibits properties that depend sensitively on the external conditions
and has a very simple crystal structure which makes it an ideal model system for
the study of more complex materials. This research will be conducted in
collaboration with Dr. Cong Ren at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
Dr. Ren's lab is equipped with the equipment needed to perform the desired
resistance measurements: two cryogenic systems with different temperature and
magnetic field capabilities as well as a high-pressure cell adaptable to these
systems.

Europium hexaboride (EuB6) is the crystal that will be studied; recent Hall
Effect measurements revealed a percolative phase transition in its macroscopic
magnetotransport property. The Hall resistivity in the paramagnetic phase
exhibits two distinct linear regions with a transition point at a single
critical magnetization over a broad temperature range, which was interpreted as
the percolation point for the more conducting phase. This project focuses on the
further understanding of this phenomenon by performing magnetotransport
measurements on EuB6 under high pressure. Hydrostatic pressure is known to
substantially modify the magnetic state of EuB6; this project aims to examine
whether the close correlation between magnetotransport and magnetization
observed in ambient pressure persists to high pressure. This NSF EAPSI award is
funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.
