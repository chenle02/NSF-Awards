9411846 Yalamanchili The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the
School of Aerospace Engineering, the College of Computing and the School of
Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology will purchase a
cluster of multiprocessor and uniprocessor graphics workstations interconnected
by state of the art high speed communications networks to existing parallel
supercomputers. This tested will provide a feasible hardware basis to pursue the
development and application of new computational paradigms for large scale
engineering applications. In particular, we foresee the ability to harness such
high speed networks of specialized graphics and parallel machines such that
components of applications can utilize distinct parallel machines while results
from these distinct platforms can be visualized, integrated and manipulated in
real-time on workstations. This integration opens new avenues for solutions to
solving many large problem. The research projects that will be the primarily
users of the equipment are drawn from the development of large scale engineering
applications, and the technology to realize an integrated, interactive for
engineering applications.
