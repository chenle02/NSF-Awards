9451597 Slough The project addresses the "brief" calculus course, which serves
the needs of students majoring in business, management, and the biological and
social sciences. Currently, the primary emphasis in this course is placed on
mechanical skills such as differentiation, integration, and algebraic
manipulations. However, the primary emphasis should focus Structured laboratory
investigations, coupled with a computer algebra system to assist with purely
mechanical aspects, are being developed so that the students will focus more on
the fundamental concepts of calculus and on the development of high-level
problem-solving skills. Previously, this course was taught assuming that
students did not use computational tools beyond a calculator. As a result, it
was difficult for them to obtain numerical insight. However, ready access to a
computer algebra system allows new types of activities to be used, providing a
more rounded view of the subject matter--including graphical, numerical, and
analytical aspects. Approximately 15 Maple worksheets are being developed. These
worksheets will be made available nationally through the Interactive Mathematics
Text Project and through internet services.
