The magnocellular neuroendocrine system is a very important region of the
hypothalamus which is involved in control of uterine contractions during
parturition, the milk let-down reflex, and maternal behavior via oxytocin as
well as the regulation of fluid homeostasis, vasoconstriction, stress responses,
and possibly memory via vasopressin. The release of oxytocin and vasopressin are
governed by the activity of these large magnocellular neurons. Dr. Weiss will
identify the inputs to these neurons in normal animals since it is likely that
the afferents play an critical role in determining their activity. He will then
examine the influence of lactation and water deprivation on these synaptic
inputs. Discerning the synaptic plasticity following physiological stimuli will
contribute greatly to our knowledge of how the brain organizes actions and
maintains our vital functions. Given the relationship of this hypothalamic
region to regulation of fluid balance and the cardiovascular system, basic
research may lead to better understanding of the neural regulation of
hypertension and heart disease which are a major cause of death in middle-age
males in our society.
