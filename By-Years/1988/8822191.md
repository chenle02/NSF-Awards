This is a MRI planning grant proposal whose research will attempt to design a
more intelligent and realistic robotic task planner that will be able to operate
effectively under uncertainty in a time constrained environment. The meta-
knowledge structure of the system will insure proper functioning under ill-
defined environments. The system will also include a learning mechanism based on
a bayesian--based neural model.
