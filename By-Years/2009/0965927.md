The S-STEM scholarship program in the School of Engineering and Technology at
Alabama A&amp;M University (AAMU) supports 25 low-income and talented scholars
per year up to graduation in the civil engineering, electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering, technology and computer science programs. The amount of
each scholarship is up to $6000 per year for a 4-year period. The primary
objectives of this project are: 1) provide financial support for talented and
low-income African-American students in engineering, technology and computer
science; 2) identify the special needs of low-income students and provide
academic support to these students in the form of supplemental math and science
courses, faculty and peer monitoring, student/faculty research opportunities,
attending technical and scientific workshops and independent study
opportunities; 3) provide the S-STEM scholars with solid career counseling that
includes preparation for graduate schools, service learning opportunities,
research and internship employment opportunities in national need areas and
effective employment strategies such as resume writing, and interviewing skills;
and 4) address the local educational and industrial needs.
