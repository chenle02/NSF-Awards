This research in mathematical physics will use the renormalization group
technique to analyze the short and long distance behavior of mathematical models
with many (and infinite) degrees of freedom. The specific topics include
establishing infrared asymptotic freedom for the effective photon interaction in
quantum electrodynamics, studying the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase of the two
dimensional classical Coulomb gas, examining the solutions to the time-dependent
Landau-Ginsburg equation near the critical point, establish the free photon
field as the continuum limit for a (1) gauge theory with Wilson action, further
study the short distance behavior of non-Abelian gauge theories.
