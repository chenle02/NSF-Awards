A Doppler High Frequency (HF) radar is placed at the Jicamarca Peru Incoherent
Scatter Radar Facility for the purpose of untangling the processes that lead to
the onset of equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs), and in turn to scintillations of
radio signals traversing the ionosphere, including GPS signals. The spectra and
propagation of ionospheric perturbations just below the F-region peak are
characterized, and their relationship to EPBs observed at Jicamarca is
determined. The variability of vertical ion drift in the enhanced ion density
preceding the neutral wind reversal is determined during solar minimum
conditions, and the relationship of that variability to equatorial plasma bubble
onset is determined. The extent to which neutral winds modulate the occurrence
of EPBs, and possibly override otherwise effective triggering mechanisms is also
evaluated using data from nearby Fabry-Perot interferometers. The determined
relationships between plasma perturbations below the F-region ionospheric peak,
variability of the vertical ion drift, the neutral wind, and EPB onset are
finally used to in an attempt to predict EPB generation, along with associated
radio scintillations.
