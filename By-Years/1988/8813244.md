Friction in tribological systems often causes vibrations. The question to be
answered by this exploratory study is whether it is feasible to turn this
process around - to affect and control friction in a mechanical system by
introducing vibrational energy into the system, in parallel with the friction
forces. Potential applications include methods for keeping idle bearings from
freezing up, very low friction bearings and slides, very high friction brakes,
and improved feasiblity of processing difficult materials. Two main frequency
regimes will be tested-the characteristic vibrational frequency of the test
system itself and the characteristic frequency of the friction forces in the
contact zone. Care will be taken to eliminate any extrinsic vibrations. If the
results of this initial experimental study are encouraging additional
theoretical and experimental work will be planned.
