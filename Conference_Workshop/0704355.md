For the three weeks, July 22, 2007 through August 10, 2007, The PIs Matusevich
and Sottile together with Theobald of the Universitat Frankfurt will organize
the 2007 Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) Participating
Institutions Summer Graduate Program on the topic ``Applicable Algebraic
Geometry''. The IMA will send up to two students from each of the 37 IMA
participating institutions to this Summer Graduate Program. This proposal in
intended to allow greater participation in this Summer Graduate Program, which
will enable more students to take advantage of this opportunity to. This
proposal will support the attendance of approximately 13 additional graduate
students, mostly from institutions not affiliated with the IMA, but also some
students from IMA affiliates.

The program will be structured around a course in applicable algebraic
geometry, treating foundational material and current applications. The
foundations will include Grobner bases, toric varieties, and real algebraic
geometry, while the applications will be drawn from optimization, non-linear
computational geometry, algebraic statistics, and mathematical biology. We will
emphasize computational aspects by including computer tutorials and laboratories
on relevant software. We will also have guest lectures explaining current
research topics. This multi-tiered menu, ranging form introductory material
through current research, will ensure that every student gains something from
their experience.

Broadening the paraticipation in this Summer School will magnify its impact, and
help to educate the next generation of US Scientists. It will influence the
spread of techniques from algebraic geometry into the applied sciences.
