The goal of this project, funded as a Research Planning Grant (RPG) is to
perform preliminary studies and develop a long term research proposal to
investigate strategies for implementation of file system extensions in widely
used operating systems. Examples of extensions under consideration include
disconnected operation, weak and partial connectivity, informed prefetching and
file reference tracing. The major difficulty in transferring these technologies
into commercial practice stems from frequent inability to modify the native
system source code. Therefore, alternative mechanisms and tools, such as
microkernel augmented DLLs, installable file systems, loadable modules, proxies
and TSR programs, will be considered. The scope of the study will span the
families of all widely used operating systems such as Windows family, Unix
family, and OS/2 family. In addition to the inability to modify the native
system source code, constraints such as hardware limitations, and the effect of
the extension on system performance will be investigated. The long term goal of
this research is to develop a set of guidelines for practical implementation of
file system extensions, and study their impact on the native system, thereby
furnishing a vital missing link in the transfer of file system research results
into computer practice.***
