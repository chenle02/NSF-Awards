9401898 Musgrave This project is a contribution to the Indian Ocean Expedition
(IOE) of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). In it, the PI will
participate as a co-principal investigator on the hydrographic survey through
the Arabian Sea, denoted as WOCE line, I-7N. The PI will then participate in the
analysis and synthesis of the data on these and other sections collected as part
of the IOE. Objectives are to describe water characteristics, velocity
structure, and transport of the boundary currents thought to exist in the
region. The observations will provide the foundation for the first measurements
of the meridional overturning rate in the Indian Ocean. ***
