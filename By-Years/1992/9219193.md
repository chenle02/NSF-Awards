This is an experimental investigation of the shapes of melt inclusions in upper
mantle partial melts. This investigation is motivated by the observation that
the crystal-melt morphology of experimentally produced samples is not consistent
with theoretically predicted smoothly curved crystal-melt interfaces. The melt
geometry has a paramount effect on seismic velocities, and the data can be
applied to model the upper mantle velocity structure in the presence of melt.
Analysis of digital backscattered electron images of the post-run samples will
be used to obtain the parameters needed (such as the aspect ration of melt
inclusions, their area, the total melt fraction) to calculate seismic
velocities, based on established models of elastic, anelasic and electrical
properties of partially molten rocks. This is a promising new approach to
characterize the melt distribution in upper mantle systems.
