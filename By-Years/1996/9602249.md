9602249 This award provides additional support for a multidisciplinary training
research training program focused on Plant-insect interactions. The program, a
joint effort of 14 faculty from five departments, aims to train young scientists
to couple basic understanding of plant genetics and molecular biology with
similar knowledge of insect physiology, behavior and ecology. Training is
provided at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels through a
variety of new courses, rotations, seminars and retreats. Trainees are supported
through several mechanisms, including stipends and small awards to help defray
costs of materials and supplies for particular projects. Opportunities for
industrial experiences are available; graduate students are required to teach
and must participate in a short course on ethical aspects of scientific
research.
