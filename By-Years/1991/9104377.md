This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Identification of transcription factors involved in
regulation of gene expression by light" is to be carried out in the laboratory
of Dr. Gloria Coruzzi at Rockefeller University. The applicant, who has received
a strong training in plant biology, will focus on studies on the regulation of
gene expression in tobacco during her fellowship tenure. The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to increase the number of outstanding
young investigators in plant biology.
