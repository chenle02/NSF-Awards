This award, made in the Organic Dynamics Program, will provide continued support
for the research of Dr. Philip Shevlin at Auburn University on the reactions of
atomic carbon and related high-energy intermediates such methylidynes, carbenes
and nitrenes. Many of these high energy intermediates have reactivities and
specificities different from those prepared by traditional routes. Specifically,
Dr. Shevlin will focus on the reactions of atomic carbon with cycloalkenes,
N-substituted pyrroles, imidazoles, substituted furans, and cyclopentadienes. In
each case, the mechanism of product formation will be studied and reactive
intermediates isolated. Atomic carbon and small carbon molecules have been
observed to grow into large caged fullerene-like clusters, providing additional
impetus for understanding the reactivity of atomic carbon and the reactive
intermediates that can be derived from it.
