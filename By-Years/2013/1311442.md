Through an integrative study of DNA sequences and morphological features,
including the use of high-resolution computer tomography, we will study the
adaptations to terrestrial and arboreal lifestyles in a large group of
amphibians - the worldwide-distributed narrow-mouthed frogs (Microhylidae).
Microhylids are not entirely restricted to the water for breeding, and many
groups have completely abandoned the need of water for reproduction. Examination
of anatomical adaptations related to this transition (aquatic to terrestrial
breeding) in these frogs can help us understand the evolution of terrestriality
in vertebrates as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results and data associated with
this research will be broadly disseminated for both the scientific community and
general public through a variety of outlets (scientific journals, newspapers,
internet). Curriculum material will be developed together with the Department of
Education the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) as part of the Science
Research Mentoring and the Research Experience for Undergrads program at the
AMNH, introducing high school and undergrad students to moderns research topics
and techniques.
