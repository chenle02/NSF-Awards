9320558 Sun This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program
in support of the research of Professor Ya-Ping Sun. The theme of the research
is the identification and characterization of C60 and C70 clusters in solid-like
states, solution and supercritical fluids. The solution studies will focus on
the excited state properties of the fullerenes, especially the discrepancy
between experimental and calculated transition probabilities for both C60 and
C70. A mechanism in which emissions from thermally populated low-lying excited
states are assumed will be evaluated by temperature and solvent-dependent
investigations. Because of low solubilities of the fullerenes in common
solvents, supercritical fluids will be used in the solvent-dependent studies.
The introduction of supercritical fluids into fullerene research will also
identify solvent systems in which variable solvent environments can be created
for studies of solvent effects on electron and charge-transfer reactions of
fullerenes. Research on the photophysics of fullerenes and fullerene clusters
will advance our general understanding of the excited-state behavior of pi-
conjugated molecules and polymers and will impact emerging technologies such as
pi-conjugated polymer-based light-emitting diodes.
