Jim Metzner Productions Inc, in collaboration with ETCOM and National
Geographic, is requesting support for the production of "Pulse of the
Planet/Pulso del Planeta" radio programs and an educational website that present
current research questions, techniques, and findings in earth system science.
The goal of the project is to introduce Earth as a dynamic, complex, global
system and to convey basic concepts of systems and the elements of scale, change
and interconnection on our planet. "Pulse of the Planet" reaches over one
million listeners daily on over 300 public and commercial stations worldwide.
The 300 new programs produced in English will be adapted and co-produced in
Spanish by ETCOM for broadcast with its 106 radio affiliates. Each radio segment
will be supported and extended on the National Geographic Online website with
news commissioned to accompany the radio programs. The NGO feature will also
include an audio program archive, links to NationalGeographic.com guides,
related stories, photo galleries, maps and links for additional listener
research. Learning Experience Design Research will conduct formative and
summative evaluation services in English and
Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
