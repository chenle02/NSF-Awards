The proposal seeks funds to partially cover publication costs and travel
expenses for student participants to the conference entitled, "International
Conference on Model Integration across Disparate Scales in Complex Turbulent
Flow Simulation (ICMIDS)", to be held at The Pennsylvania State University, June
15-17, 2015. This specialized symposium will be attended by world leaders in the
area of multi-scale turbulence simulation. The symposium emphasis will be on new
research ideas, methods, and directions. It will also foster cross-fertilization
of ideas among researchers and collaboration in these areas.

The research to be presented in this Symposium can lead to improved
understanding of a number of problems affecting the energy, biomedical, defense,
and environmental sciences that have come to depend on complex turbulent flow
phenomena. The meeting topics include 1) Modeling the interfaces between surface
viscous layers and outer turbulent flow regions in wall-bounded turbulent flows,
2) Fundamental distinctions among "RANS-like," "URANS-like," and "LES-like"
models, 3) The physics of forced non-stationary nonequilibrium high Reynolds
number boundary layer flows, 4) Simulation of meso-micro scale couplings in
geophysical turbulent flows, 5) Surface flux models (momentum, heat, etc.) when
the surface viscous layer(s) cannot be resolved or do not exist due to
roughness, 6) Modeling the interactions between large-scale unsteady spatially
varying turbulent environments and small-scale high Reynolds number boundaries,
7) Interactions between the ocean surface and internal waves, 8) Transport and
mixing in highly anisotropic stratified turbulence, 9) Turbulent fluxes of
biogeochemical constituents, 10) Field and laboratory experiments on the
couplings among complex nonstationary disparate turbulence scales.
