ABSTRACT

This award is for partial support of the Midwestern Several Complex Variables
Meeting to be held at Ann Arbor, MI on December 3-5, 1999. The regional Several
Complex Variables Conferences play a crucial role for a large number of the
research groups at Midwestern universities. This conference focuses on
Pluripotential Theory - one of the central topics in modern complex function
theory in several variables. The conference features several internationally
known leaders in the field and accordingly will attract a large number of
graduate students and young researchers from the American universities. Most of
the requested support will enable them to attend the conference. The event
should be of significant benefit to a broader mathematical community.
