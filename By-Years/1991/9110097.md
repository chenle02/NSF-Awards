This award is a Research Planning Grant. The goal of the work is to test,
develop, and select suitable computational methods capable of describing
accurately the collision induced absorption spectra of pairs of anisotropic
molecules. Two molecular systems, N2-CH4 and CO2-CO2, will be selected for their
significance in planetary sciences and because of the availability of reliable
laboratory measurements. The physical processes responsible for the observed
spectra of these molecules must be identified first. Next computational methods
will be tested. Reliable, yet efficient and economical methods of computing the
collision induced absorption spectra must be selected. Once this objective is
reached such spectra may be modeled with the accuracy required by the
astrophysical applications. Dr. Borysow plans to develop an on- going
cooperation and an active participation in the utilization of her computational
results in research in planetary sciences.
