This research is concerned with developing the mathematical theory of control of
partial differential equations and hereditary systems appropriate for
applications to large elastic structures. This work will clarify a number of
issues associated with active control of large aerospace structures such as
space antennas and platforms and wings of high performance aircraft. Since the
aerospace structures under consideration are spatially distributed, they are
inherently infinite dimensional. As such, their proper modeling and analysis
requires partial differential equation techniques. This research seeks to
develop control strategies by direct studies of various appropriate infinite
dimensional models. It is a broadbased program, ranging from theoretical studies
of distributed and delayed controllers to practical construction of numerical
algorithms for feedback stabilization of vibration, flutter, and rigidity.
