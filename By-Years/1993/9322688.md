9322688 COWART ABSTRACT This SGER project will gather data on judged sentence
acceptability relating to the "that"-trace phenomenon. Thee populations will be
sampled: two groups of university undergraduates and one group of elderly
informants. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that the "that"-trace
phenomenon can be precisely characterized in each of the three target
populations, and that there are statistically reliable differences among those
populations. If the project is successful, it will be followed up by a regular
project proposal to NSF. ***
