Modern technology aims for a massively and diversely connected world populated
by a seamless network of intelligent, dynamically distributed systems engaged in
a shared interaction with the physical world and each other through unreliable
sensors, actuators, and noisy communication channels. Classical information
theory, while it has long served as an enabler of high speed, long-distance
communication for point-to-point, delay-tolerant communication systems using
coding over long blocks of symbols, lacks ready solutions to the new challenges
of the era of massive, dynamic connectivity. Evolving networks are rather delay
sensitive, so coding over long blocks of observed data will not be feasible.
Information exchanges frequently seek to maximizing payoff, rather than simply
recover the information sent, and are often event-triggered, prompting new
mathematical models and tools to gain insights into jointly optimal
sensing/coding/control strategies for these systems. The project will also offer
undergraduate research opportunities in conjunction with Caltech's Summer
Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program, alongside outreach activities
to middle and high school students via Caltech's Center for Teaching, Learning
and Outreach, in order to encourage future scientists and
engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance the state of
the art in understanding the fundamental trade-offs between communication and
performance in dynamical systems. The project will draw upon the tools from both
information theory and control theory to achieve its objectives, which are (1)
to establish the fundamental information-theoretic trade-offs in delay-
constrained causal source coding for dynamical systems under a distortion
constraint; (2) to elucidate the information-theoretic trade-offs of control
over noisy channels and propose new coding schemes with theoretical performance
guarantees; and (3) to gain insight into jointly optimal sampling and coding
strategies for tracking and control.
