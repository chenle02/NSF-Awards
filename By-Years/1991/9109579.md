This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Program is made to
Dr. Marcetta Y. Darensbourg of the Chemistry Department, Texas A&amp;M
University, for fundamental work on the chemistry of transition metal complexes
containing both hydrogen and sulfur-containing ligands. The goal of the research
is to find direct evidence for some of the individual steps in S-H, C-S and C-H
activation by nickel, iron, and cobalt. Specifically Darensbourg plans to
investigate the mechanism of four types of reactions: metal hydrides with
organosulfur reagents; dihydrogen release from hydrido-thiolate complexes of
iron and nickel; oxidation-reduction of sulfur-bound nickel complexes with
various ligand environments; and transition metal promoted heterolysis of metal-
proximate C-H bonds. In the studies of sulfur-bound nickel complexes, dependence
of the oxidation potential and of the oxidative addition of hydrogen on the
presence of sulfur and phosphorus ligands will be investigated. %%% The results
of these experiments are relevant to the action of hydrogenase enzymes in
methanogenic bacteria and heterogeneous hydrodesulfurization catalysts, in which
reaction mechanisms involving simultaneous bonding of sulfur and hydrogen have
been proposed.
