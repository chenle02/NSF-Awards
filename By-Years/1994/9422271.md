9422271 Kauppila The focus of this project is to investigate the scattering of
positrons by atoms and molecules to obtain fundamental information concerning
the interaction of antimatter with matter. Topics to be studied include the
differential cross section for positron scattering from rare gases and methane,
scattering from hydrogen and alkali-metal atoms and positronium formation. ***
