This project will contribute to the field of automatic planning by developing
methods to determine what planner works well under various sets of conditions.
It will construct a metaplanner that will be able to test performance of
existing and hybridized planners on a suite of domains, especially more
realistic domains than have been used commonly before. Based on the results of
initial studies, predictive models of planner performance will be developed that
translate problem and domain features to estimates of how much time would be
needed by a given planner to solve the problem. The models, in turn, will be
operationalized in the metaplanner. There are three steps to the work: 1)
collect and develop applications and realistic domains to assemble a challenging
benchmark set of problems; 2) modeling the performance of several state of the
art planners, and 3) developing a metaplanner which is directed by the models to
select a planner to solve problems in a particular domain.

Planning underlies any complex human endeavor, from organizing a busy life to
operating a large airline or testing large software systems. In each case,
people need to track an enormous number of details, marshal resources and ensure
that actions necessary to achieve their goals can be taken in a timely matter.
However, automated planning has had little effect on how planning is actually
accomplished. This research seeks to improve that situation through new methods
to decide which planner is appropriate for a given task. The metaplanner can be
used by both people learning about planning and new application developers who
may not know which planner would be best for their application.
