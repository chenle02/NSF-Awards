This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program, and it is a study of the publics and politics of theater in the early
Soviet Union. In the 1920s, the Soviet government sought to use theater as an
instrument of ideological indoctrination, at the same time that Russian
dramatists were experimenting relatively freely with a range of new approaches
to drama that were influential around the world. Therefore, this research
project will contribute both to an understanding of the role of the arts under
dictatorship and to the sociology of cultural innovation. Primary data
collection at archives in Moscow and St. Petersburg will greatly strengthen the
information available from American sources about this crucially important phase
in twentieth-century culture and political transformation. %%% This research
will provide insights for the rapidly growing area of sociology that examines
the production of culture, and a deep understanding of the radical
transformations that produced the Soviet Union will be valuable for
comprehending the equally massive changes in the wake of its disintegration. In
addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
