Abstract: 0353767&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program in oceanography at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), located in Woods Hole, MA. The program will
support ten to thirteen students during a twelve-week summer research program
each summer. The budget includes support for student stipends, housing, travel
and some research expenses. Funds for this program will be matched from various
sources allowing WHOI to offer fellowships to a total of twenty to twenty-five
students each year. The program will include independent research projects by
the students, participation in a lecture series, and field trips. It will
conclude with student oral presentations and written reports. Students will be
encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed journals and participate in national
conferences following the summer research program. &lt;br/&gt;
