Real-world social events provide a convenient and intuitive way to organize
social media content for individuals. Current approaches to event detection from
social media: assume that the events to be monitored (and their social media
signatures) are known a priori; focus largely on text data and fail to take
advantage of other forms of media e.g., images.

Against this background, this project explores a novel approach to discovering
spontaneous, a priori unspecified, social events through joint Bayesian non
parametric modeling of multi-modal data (including text and images) and using
the events thus discovered to foster new social links. The resulting tools for
event discovery will be tested in an application involving discovery of wild
animal disease outbreaks from twitter text messages and images posted by
individuals.

The project brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers with
expertise in image analysis, text mining, and machine learning to advance the
state of the art in detection of spontaneous, a priori unspecified events (as
they emerge) from social media data. It is expected to yield new scalable
nonparametric Bayesian approaches to joint modeling of image and text data, and
more generally multi-modal social media data. The resulting tools could
potentially transform the way in which people use social media data by
empowering them to discover and participate in real world events even as they
emerge.
