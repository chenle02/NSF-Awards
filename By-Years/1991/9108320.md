The proposed research will analyze the ethnographic context of legal proceedings
involving Yup'ik natives in Western Alaska, focussing on discourse strategies
and their interpretations in relation to trial outcomes. Communicative
processes, including translation/interpretation and the use of legal narratives
etc., are hypothesized as strongly influencing courtroom interactions and
possibly trial outcomes. Although informal observations suggest this, the
hypothesis has never been tested, and the complex range of strategies used in
testimony and questioning has neither been documented nor analyzed. The three
PIs, a cultural anthropologist, a trial lawyer and a legal interpreter, propose
to spend eight weeks studying public record tapes, conducting interviews, and
observing trials in session. Subsequent discourse analysis will provide a basis
for the testing of the hypothesis.
