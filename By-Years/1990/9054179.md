Two workshops for groups of 18 faculty are being conducted in the area of
Fourier analysis and its applications. Participants are being drawn from several
disciplines: mathematics, physics, chemistry, electrical engineering; each of
the disciplines included makes extensive use of Fourier analysis and an
interdisciplinary seminar held as part of each workshop will focus on various
modern applications of Fourier analysis that can be understood by
undergraduates. The lecture notes and exercise sets developed by the
participants will help the participants introduce corresponding courses in their
home institutions or to enrich and modernize sections of existing courses
already in place within the curriculum.
