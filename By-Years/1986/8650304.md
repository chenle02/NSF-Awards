The areas of plant and animal biotechnology utilize living organisms or their
components in both basic and applied research and also in industrial processes.
In response to the vast potential offered by this field, the Biology Department
at the State University of New York- College at Oneonta has developed a
Biotechnology Study Option for undergraduates. The key course in this study
option is a one-semester interdisciplinary course entitled Biotechnology. This
course provides students with an introduction to the basic techniques of
biotechnology and the theory behind them. In order to accomplish this, a plant
cell biologist, a microbiologist, a geneticist, and a biochemist team-teach the
course, providing the necessary background to students' lectures, laboratories,
and demonstrations. The NSF award enables this department to purchase two major
instruments needed to launch the program -- a cell fusion system and a tabletop
ultracentrifuge.
