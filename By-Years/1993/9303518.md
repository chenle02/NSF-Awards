9303518 Reynolds This research examines the fundamental mechanisms governing
precipitate morphology in metal alloys. The measurement of growth ledge
nucleation kinetics as a function of interphase boundary orientation provides
necessary information to unify two current theories for the development of
precipitate morphology: the general theory for precipitate morphology, which
relates precipitate shape to boundary mobilities, and the invariant line theory,
which predicts precipitate orientation relationships, growth directions, and
habit planes from the crystallography of the phases involved. Experimental
observation of the misfit dislocation structures at precipitate/matrix
boundaries during growth in a nickel-chromium alloy provides information on
mechanisms by which partially coherent boundaries migrate in solids. %%% The
long term benefit of the research is understanding of the physical processes
responsible for microstructural evolution, which guides improvement in
commercial metal alloys. ***
