This award will support student and postdoctoral researcher travel grants to
attend and participate in the Conference: "Extremophiles 2004: 5th International
Conference on Extremeophiles" sponsored by the American Society of Microbiology.
The conference will be in Cambridge, MD on September 19-23, 2004, and is
organized by Dr. Frank Robb of the University of Maryland. The goals of the
conference are: i) to provide a forum to assess progress in the biology,
genomics, and systematics of microorganisms from extreme environments, including
high and low temperature, high pressure, high salt, extreme pH, and desiccation;
ii) to understand Archaeal model systems for eukaryotic transcriptional DNA
replication/repair and translation; iii) to maintain an interest in structural
genomics and proteomics that are growth areas in the field. Session topics will
include: Origins/Exobiology/Ecology; Industrial/Biotechnology; Gene Expression;
Structural Biology/Enzymology; Physiology and Metabolism; DNA Replication
Genetics and Genomics.
