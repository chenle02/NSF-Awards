9454413 Hamner The collaboration between the UCLA Marine Science Center and the
Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is designed to create a cadre of 160
teachers (grades 5-12) trained to change and strengthen science instruction
throughout the system using a marine science model. This model has been
developed over a period of three years and was funded by NSF. This model (i.e.,
Marine Science Teacher Education Program: M-STEP) enhances the science skills of
teachers in a classroom and ocean-b program that emphasizes a marine thematic
integrative science approach to Science education. The ocean sciences are
interdisciplinary so that they taught as an integrated, problem solving, hands
on curriculum using the common theme of the marine environment. Experiences in
the Leadership In Marine Science Program (LIMS) will develop in teachers the
skills necessary to conduct classroom, laboratory and field research in marine
sciences with their students. They will also be effective leaders in peer
training. Because of LAUSD's new cluster organization of schools, these teachers
will impact four school clusters consisting of elementary, middle, and senior
high schools with about a total of 35,000 students. The program is aimed at
systemic change through this integrative and thematic approach to science
curriculum organization. It is designed not only to change the way that science
is delivered in these clusters, but it is also focused on attracting young
minority students into universities and into the sciences. It provides and
presents a vehicle for further professionalization of teachers by offering new
science content, leadership skills development, collaborative peer teaching
training, and the improvement of what is taught and how it is delivered in the
classroom of the LAUSD. LIMS teachers will provide the first cluster-based
science dissemination programs for LAUSD.
