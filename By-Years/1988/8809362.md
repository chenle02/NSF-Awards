One of the most dramatic changes in developing countries during the last twenty
years has been the steady growth of food grain production. Some have celebrated
this "green revolution" as the best hope for development in the Third World.
Others have criticized it as aggravating inequalities and neglecting needed
industrialization. This study examines the consequences of this agricultural
growth on several dimensions of social stratification: landlessness, women's
labor force participation, changes for minorities, literacy, urbanization, and
growth of the service sector. The proposed research involves the study of
changes across 300 districts within India, using panel data collected at three
points in time -- 1961, 1971, and 1981. India provides an especially favorable
research environment because agricultural growth has varied greatly across
regions withing India, and because India's sophisticated statistical system has
produced some of the best data available anywhere.
