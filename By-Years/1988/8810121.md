This research will study the occurrence and structure of singularities of
several evolution equations, particularly cases of the nonlinear Schrodinger
equation which arise in nonlinear optics. It will also extend existing work to
focusing phenomena in related equations of nonlinear optics that represent more
complete physical modelling. Numerical work will be based on dynamic rescaling
methods. This work should provide insight into many physical phenomena
associated with nonlinearities. It may have practical applications in the field
of optics.
