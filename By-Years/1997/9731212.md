9731212 Levin This cooperative research award supports Jon Levin, Ivan Sellin,
and students from their group at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville to
collaborate with Dr. Henrik Cederquist of the Physics Department at Stockholm
University, Sweden. When an atomic ion in an excited state collides with a
neutral atom, the resulting change of state of the incoming ion can be radiated
away as a photon, or transferred to the neutral atom causing it to ionize
(Penning radiation). The U.S. group has developed an experimental technique that
can, for the first time, separate the radiative and non-radiative contributions
to the total cross section for quenching of the excited ion. This new technique
can measure branching rations and partial rates. The Swedish group, which has
world-class expertise in this area, will participate in extending the
experiments to include several species of atom and molecule not yet used as
targets.
