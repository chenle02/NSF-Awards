9601715 Pingitore This grant provides $111,126 as partial support of the costs
of acquiring an X-ray microfluorescence (XRMF) spectrometer. This instrument is
comparable to an energy dispersive XRF but has a very narrow collimated X-ray
beam which allows non- destructive elemental analyses of geological and
archaeological samples at relatively high spatial resolutions (~ 30 microns).
Although this instrument is also comparable to an electron microprobe (EMP) in
many of its capabilities, the XRMF can handle much larger samples and little to
no sample preparation is required making XRMF analyses relatively simple to
learn and therefore amenable to undergraduate student involvement. This
instrument will be used for a variety of interdisciplinary research topics at
this largest Hispanic-majority institution in the U.S. including, non-
destructive compositional analyses of rare archaeological artifacts such as
pottery shards and bone as indicators of source material locations and thus
settlement patterns and dietary habits of ancient civilizations, analyses of the
Sr/Ca ratio in growth banded corals as proxies for paleo sea surface
temperatures and the analyses of plant tissues for toxic metals in environmental
studies. ***
