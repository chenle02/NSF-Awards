In recent work it has been suggested that many of the unusual and attractive
properties of supercritical fluids (SCF's), including enhanced solubilities may
be explained by solvent and entrainer clustering around the solute that result
in local densities and concentrations that are greater than the bulk. It is
proposed in a three part program to take advantage of this clustering in
reactions and crystallization processes: First, to experimentally determine the
effect on the reaction rate of operating in the region near the critical point
where entrainers cluster around the solute, which would increase local reactant
concentrations: Next, to determine the effect of varying upstream conditions on
the characteristics of solid particles formed from the expansion of SCF
solutions: And, finally, to develop a chemical/physical theory equation of state
to describe SCF phase equilibrium with entrainers present, as encountered in the
above two processes, as well as in simple extractions. The overall results of
this work will be better use of the unique microscopic properties SCF solvents
for reactions and crystallization processes, as well as a more realistically-
based and reliable thermodynamic model upon which to design these processes.
