A new category of physics problems suitable for intermediate-level
undergraduate physics courses will be developed and published. These problems
are to be derived from current or recent work of physicists actively engaged in
research. They are to exhibit new, interesting, or particularly insightful
applications of undergraduate physics to problems, phenomena, or results of
contemporary physics research. They will be published first in the American
Journal of Physics under the title of "New Problems" and then subsequently in a
loose-leaf format as a resource for teaching undergraduate physics.
