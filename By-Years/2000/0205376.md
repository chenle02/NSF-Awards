Securing our nation's computing and networking infrastructure against damage due
to malicious attacks or spontaneous faults is a problem of paramount importance.
This project aims to contribute to this mission&lt;br/&gt;by developing novel
techniques and tools based on model checking and program analysis for
vulnerability analysis: the problem of identifying and monitoring weaknesses in
computer systems that can be exploited to compromise system security. A major
expected outcome of the project is a set of tools for determining the
consistency and safety of computer system configurationss, such as those
specified by firewall rules&lt;br/&gt;and domain type rules.&lt;br/&gt;
