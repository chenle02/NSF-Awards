This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled " A structural investigation of
macromolecular complexes determining mating-type in yeast using X-ray
crystallography." The objective is to determine the 3-D structure of the
MATa1/MCM1/DNA complex in Saccharomyces cerevesiae and to identify the role of
the chameleon sequence in the previously determined structure of this complex.
The methods used here are site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography.
The structural information is expected to identify general principles about
protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions that are involved in the
combinatorial control of gene expression.
