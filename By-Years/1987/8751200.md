Experiments will be developed to illustrate the use of laser techniques in
demonstrating and understanding chemical principles. Emphasis will be placed on
the use of a helium-neon laser source which is inexpensive, safe, and readily
available. These experiments are being designed for use in the classroom or for
lecture demonstrations or for use by highly motivated high school students or
beginning undergraduate chemistry students. Although the use of lasers to
demonstrate optical phenomena is fairly well advanced, their counterpart in
chemical applications remains in a highly primitive state, even though laser
techniques are revolutionizing chemical research. Funds will allow for the
exploration of suitable laser chemistry experiments for the secondary school and
beginning undergraduate curriculum. Simple, "hands-on" experiments will be
produced for student use under the supervision and guidance of a teacher. For
the most part, the science curricula of the secondary schools is in serious need
of revision. This project shows the way to bringing new technologies into the
secondary school chemistry program and provides a model for similar action in
biology and physics programs. This project will also provide useful and current
experiments for use by talented and motivated students.
