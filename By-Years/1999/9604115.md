9604115 Giovannoni Dr. Giovannoni treats ripening of the tomato fruit as a
developmental program - in contrast to most of other analyses in which the
tomato fruit is studied as an example of plant senescence. Some ethylene-
insensitive tomato mutants, indeed, indicate that the senescence-specific
hormone ethylene can be modulated in a developmental fashion. His group has
isolated from tomato genes homologous to components of the ethylene signal
transduction pathway detected in other plants. In combination with his mutant
collection and the detection of fruit-specific transcripts that do not respond
to ethylene but are under other developmental control, the project develops. It
includes the characterization and transgenic manipulation of the CTR1 ethylene
signal transduction modulator as one aspect. Secondly, constitutive ethylene
responding mutants are characterized physiologically and with respect to the
expression of developmentally-regulated transcripts. Finally, non-ethylene
responsive, developmentally induced transcripts will be functionally
characterized. The work is expected to provide an integrative view of different
gene expression programs regulating fruit ripening in general.
