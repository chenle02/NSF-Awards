This award will support research on annually-laminated lake sediments (varves)
to provide detailed records of past climate from the Great Lakes region of the
United States over the past 12,000 years. Such varved sediment records can prove
a treasure trove of information critical to addressing issues of drought
frequency and abrupt climate change in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
constructing continuous oxygen isotope time series of Holocene climate
variability for lead dated sediment records from individual lake sites, the
investigators will evaluate climatic controls on oxygen isotope records with
existing regional instrumental records of temperature, precipitation amount, and
dominant atmospheric circulation patterns. By focusing on high-resolution oxygen
isotope analyses across discrete Holocene climatic events, the researchers will
establish the characteristic and rate of past natural climate
variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
