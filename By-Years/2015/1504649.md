In this project the investigators address the need to provide introductory
physics students with effective problem-solving instruction by developing a web-
based coaching system. This system goes beyond currently available educational
tools in its potential to help students become better problem solvers as well as
to be adapted by instructors teaching a wide range of students. This could be
very significant for students for whom standard instruction is insufficient.
Because of the reproducible fine-grained problem-solving instruction delivered
by the coaches, the proposed work can contribute to the knowledge base on how to
design effective problem-solving instruction, whether or not this instruction is
computer-based. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key features of the system, called
Customizable Computer Coaches for Physics Online (C3PO), are that they (1)
provide students with coaching on the generalizable non-linear decision-making
processes that are critical to expert-like problem-solving while the students
practice solving problems, and (2) provide instructors with the ability to
customize the problems, guidance, and feedback given to students. The
investigators will collaborate with five physics instructors from diverse post-
secondary institutions to develop C3PO coaches and revise the underlying
software. The instructors will work with the project team, building coaches and
integrating the system into their own classes, while gathering data to assess
the feasibility, usability, usefulness, and potential educational impact of the
coaches. This data will then be used to develop and prepare the C3PO system for
large-scale dissemination in a continuous cycle of improvement. Since a logical
expert-like framework for approaching novel problems in a systematic way, is
important to all STEM fields, this project contributes to the development of a
well-prepared STEM workforce of the future. It has the potential to spawn
similar efforts in other STEM fields and across multiple disciplines.
