Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this
collaborative project are to improve post-calculus students' learning of
probability and statistics and to provide students with better preparation for
their future careers in mathematics and statistics, mathematics education, and
computer science. These objectives are being achieved by focusing on active and
cooperative learning, visualization of concepts, and use of simulations in post-
calculus introductory probability and statistics courses at the University of
Alabama - Huntsville and Middle Tennessee State University via the adaptation
and implementation of two recently developed National Science Foundation funded
materials. The materials are (a) A Data-Oriented, Active Learning, Post-Calculus
Introduction to Statistical Concepts, Methods, and Theory (DUE-9950476) and the
(b) Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics (DUE-9652870). Project
activities include faculty enhancement at the institutions, the respective
institutional adaptation and implementation (A&amp;I) of the materials, the
evaluation of the A&amp;I of the materials, and the assessment of students
learning while using the materials. The University of Alabama Huntsville is
providing the evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;
