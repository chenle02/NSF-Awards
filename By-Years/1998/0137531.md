&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ectomycorrhizae are symbioses between
many important forest trees such as Douglas-fir and so called ectomycorrhizal
fungi. The symbiosis is mutually beneficial to both partners, and neither can
survive without the other. The trees provide carbohydrates to the fungi while
the fungi facilitate nutrient uptake for the trees. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are
taxonomically much more diverse than their tree hosts, but it remains largely
unclear whether the different species of fungi differ in the functions they
fulfill for the tree hosts and the forest ecosystem or whether they are
"functionally redundant". In addition to trees and fungi, bacteria have also
been shown to live in close association with ectomycorrhizae, but have rarely
been investigated, and it remains unclear whether and how they affect the
functioning of the symbiosis. As a first step in assessing the potential
influence of bacterial populations on the functional diversity of
ectomycorrhizal fungi, the author of this proposal will study how bacterial
diversity is structured between different species of fungi and different
individuals within a species. Methods will be developed to measure the genetic
diversity of bacteria directly from mycorrhizae thus avoiding the bias
introduced by bacterial cultivation in the laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;By
incorporating bacteria into the functional equation, this research will take the
science of ectomycorrhizal ecology into a whole new direction.&lt;br/&gt;
