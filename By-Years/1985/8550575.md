The Red Mountain Museum of Birmingham Alabama will offer an academic- year, in-
service, instructional program for teachers of 9th grade physical science. The
Museum will be the site of this project and will simulate the classroom and the
type of laboratory facilities found in the schools. The program is intended to
reduce the anxiety of the teacher, raise self-confidence, and improve laboratory
skills, subject matter competence, and mathematical skills. The Education
Department of Red Mountain Museum, all certified teachers, have designed this
project based on a teacher survey so that participants will meet once a week for
two-and one-half hours during the academic year. The time will be split between
lecture and hands-on activities that will directly prepare the teachers for the
activities prescribed by the new syllabus for physical science. An excellent
evaluation component of the project provides for the observation of each
participating teacher at least four times during the school year. Evaluative
instruments will assess the laboratory work of the teachers and of their
students as well as their attitudes toward science.
