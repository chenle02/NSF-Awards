COSEPUP proposal for core support, Oct. 3, 1990 This two year award to the
Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP) would support the
Committee's core functions in performing a wide range of studies on major issues
in science and technology policy by calling together panels of experts.
Membership of COSEPUP and of its panels is of the highest quality. The proposal
is the third of multi-year requests from COSEPUP to the National Science
Foundation. COSEPUP has served for thirty years as a source of high level advice
to science advisors and other senior government officials. The current proposal
describes the intention of the Committee to continue to perform S&amp;T policy
studies at the broadest levels of analysis. While predicting which issues will
be taken up by COSEPUP are difficult to predict, the following are offered as
candidates: conflict of interest, science advice, government decision-making for
research, technology and trade policy, and technology transfer and world
security. COSEPUP studies make important contributions to the understanding of
major S&amp;T policy issues, including issues of central concern to NSF. This
award will allow COSEPUP to continue this work.
