Abstract K. Supernant The proposed research is an investigation of how the
dynein motor complex functions in embryonic and somatic cells. The investigator
will isolated and characterize extragenic enhancers and suppressors of the
dominant "glued" gene and will purify mRNP-dynein-microtubule complexes from
Drosophila embryos. Genetic knockout experiments will be conducted to test the
role of cytoplasmic dynein. This work will be performed in association with Dr.
Thomas Hays at the University of Minnesota. %%% Molecular motors serve to move
components within cells much like a outboard motor on a boat moves the boat
through the water. The applicant will employ genetic approaches possible in the
fruit fly Drosophila to understand how the motor works. ***
