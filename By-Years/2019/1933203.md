Topography influences stress in the Earthâ€™s crust and the pattern of deformation
that arises during mountain building. Because the material properties of rocks
near the surface of the Earth depend on their burial and exhumation history, in
collisional mountain belts feedbacks may exist between the burial history of
rocks in the subsurface, their strength at the surface, and topography. However,
few field data exist to evaluate the strength of such feedbacks between surface
and deep-Earth processes. This project will address this knowledge gap by
quantifying the tectonic origin and geomorphic implications of variations in
rock material properties across the Taiwan Central Range. In addition, this
project will facilitate international collaboration between US and Taiwanese
scientists through paired field expeditions and a student exchange program,
leveraging new and existing research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To
explore relationships among burial and exhumation history, rock strength, and
topography, this project will collect and integrate a paired dataset of
structural and geomorphic observations. Existing and new measurements of erosion
rates and thermal and deformation history will constrain patterns in burial and
exhumation. Field surveys of river corridors assisted by small unmanned aerial
vehicles will facilitate characterization of how rock properties influence river
incision and hillslope-channel coupling at high resolution (centimeter-scale)
and large spatial extent (kilometer-scale). Repeat surveys will enable high-
resolution analysis of river response to individual storms. Data from this
project will serve as a baseline for quantifying landscape response to future
extreme events and help to address hazards associated with landslides, floods,
and sedimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
