ABSTRACT OPP-9729575 WALSH, JOHN UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS The project will utilize
ice thickness measurements taken from submarines from 1977 - 1992 in the
vicinity of the North Pole to analyze whether variations in ice dynamics or
thermodynamics account for the observed changes in ice thickness that have
occurred. The investigator will tune the dynamic and thermodynamic models to
reduce the difference produced by the models from the observed thickness changes
in the submarine data. The analysis of the actual vs. predicted ice thickness
will allow examination of whether dynamic or thermodynamic parameters in the
models have a greater influence on the changes from observed thickness. The
results are critical to understanding the driving force behind changes in ice
thickness. If the mechanism most responsible is thermodynamics, then the
potential for global climate change to have an effect on ice thickness may be
predicted with the thermodynamic models using temperature changes for the Arctic
predicted from increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
