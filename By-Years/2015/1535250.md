This project assesses competing theories regarding the beneficiaries of judicial
decisionmaking, via a cross-national examination of the claimants who have
benefited from free expression decisions issued by a variety of courts around
the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will fund a multi-site, collaborative
collection of qualitative and quantitative data on approximately 2,000
constitutional or quasi-constitutional free expression decisions issued by the
European Court of Human Rights and European Court of Justice; 10-12 leading
national high courts, drawn from all regions of the constitutional world; and
the 50 US state high courts. The research team will assemble a statistical
dataset that will enable large-N analysis of those decisions with regard to
types of speech claimant, nature of speech suppression, and patterns of judicial
votes. The team will also assemble a documentary data collection for a subset of
the cases, consisting of the published judicial decisions themselves and/or
English-language summaries of those decisions, together with related primary
source documents. This qualitative data collection will enable small- and
medium-N analysis of the relevant decisions by members of the research team and
other scholars. Data analysis will assess the political beneficiaries of rights-
protecting judicial decisions across five commonly recurring categories of free
speech disputes.
