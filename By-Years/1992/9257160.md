This young investigator proposes to study fluid-rock interactions in crustal
rocks by integrating fluid flow, petrologic, and geochemical modelling with
carefully selected field case studies. Metal speciation and mineral solubility
in supercritical chloride solutions will be determined from experiment and
theory. This work will be done at the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
Wisconsin.
