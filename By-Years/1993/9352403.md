A network of X-terminals and workstations linked to Zephyr satellite data
receiving systems allow the interactive display and analysis of weather data in
classroom activities. Both historical data ('Weather Disk' CD-ROM) and current
daily weather data (UNIDATA channel) are available. Specific activities include
review of the daily weather maps, as well as synoptic and dynamic weather
elements. Also, vertical temperature profiles, isopleth mapping, evolution of
weather patterns, and statistical forecast evaluation is quickly obtained
through the use of the graphics workstations. This project also allows teaching
of a new Honors section focusing on modeling. This gives students a better
understanding of atmospheric science, weather analysis, and forecasting. They
also investigate specific phenomena using historical data.
