Xenoliths from the southwestern U.S. will be analyzed to study the compositional
and thermal evolution of mantle lithosphere and the relationships between mantle
properties and crustal tectonics. Characterization of textures and compositional
gradients will be combined with electron microprobe and PIXE analysis of thin
sections and with isotopic analysis of mineral separates. Xenoliths from the
Grand Canyon field on the Colorado Plateau will be studied in most detail.
Compositions and thermal histories of the samples will be compared to those of
xenoliths from the Basin and Range province, to learn how crustal uplift and
extension are related to mantle dynamics. Textures and Sr- Nd systematics in the
Grand Canyon xenoliths are unusual, and they will be characterized to understand
metasomatic processes that may be subduction-related. A large collection from
the Navajo field in the central Plateau has been recently acquired, and choice
samples will be analyzed to determine depth and timing of mantle hydration and
eclogite-facies recrystallization. In all parts of the study, particular effort
will be made to elucidate transport processes and rates of mineral equilibration
in the mantle, by careful analyses of gradients and by numerical simulations.
