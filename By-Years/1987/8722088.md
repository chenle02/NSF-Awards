This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research of Dr. Edward Clennan, University of Wyoming. The work focuses on
reactions of singlet oxygen. This form of oxygen is an excited or energetic one.
A number of biological processes related to aging are thought to involve singlet
oxygen and a fundamental understanding of its reaction chemistry is, thus,
closely linked to important biological problems. Mechanistic studies of the
reactions of singlet oxygen with electron rich dienes and with sulfides will be
studied. The synthesis of substrates to probe singlet oxygen reactions for
electron transfer and anchimeric assistance effects will be undertaken. The
effect of solvent, temperature, and additives on product distributions formed in
the reactions of these substrates with singlet oxygen will be examined. Low
temperature NMR will be utilized to detect intermediates and the emission of
singlet oxygen at 1200nm will be monitored in the presence of these substrates
in order to obtain important kinetic information. Intramolecular trapping of
singlet oxygen intermediates will be pursued with sulfoxide trapping groups.
Intramolecular trapping has the advantage that symmetry information on the
intermediate can be ascertained. The effect of substitutents on the trapping
ability of the sulfoxide groups will be carefully examined.
