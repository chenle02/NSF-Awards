Project Summary Incomplete contract theory is gradually becoming accepted as a
useful way to understand the nature of organizations. This project continues my
work in this area. The project includes four main topics. First, I investigate
why parties typically contract bilaterally, rather than multilaterally, and what
determines who contracts with whom. For example, if someone wants a house built,
they often will sign a contract with a general contractor, who in turn will
contract with a plumber, an electrician, etc. Why is this preferable to
contracting directly with the plumber and electrician? The second topic is a
continuation of my work on entrepreneurial debt contracting. So far my
theoretical analysis has focused on a two-period relationship between an
entrepreneur and an investor, although I have generalized the analysis to many
periods, when there is perfect certainty. In the current project I carry out a
generalization to the case of many periods where there is uncertainty. I also
include a role for equity. In the third topic, I continue my work on boundaries
between public and private organizations. In my work so far, I have developed a
theoretical analysis of the choice between public and private ownership and
applied the analysis to understand the case for prison privatization. In the
current project I extend the analysis to education and health care. An important
new intellectual issue that arises is the role of competition between providers
in determining the choice between public and private ownership. Finally, I
conduct a theoretical analysis of the cooperative form. Most commercial
organizations are owned and controlled by people who do not work in them or
consume their product. Nonetheless, there are some important exceptions: for
instance, in the service sector, partnerships or worker cooperatives are quite
common; e.g., take the case of law firms. My work is an attempt to understand
better the costs and benefits of cooperatives, and why cooperatives are so
uncommon in the manufacturing sector.
