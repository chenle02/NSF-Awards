This project is responding to urgent needs to graduate increased numbers of
engineers by developing and evaluating an online calculus course for engineering
students. Calculus is a critical course in the success of engineering students,
and success rates need to be improved for this course.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also producing new knowledge concerning
the effectiveness of online learning forums as instructional interventions in
engineering education. It is creating and disseminating usage guidelines to
promote widespread use of online learning forums throughout STEM education,
including K-12 and undergraduate settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
supporting a national need to rapidly increase opportunities for
underrepresented student groups (geographically dispersed rural residents,
working professionals, and women) to pursue engineering degrees via distance
education. The numbers of nontraditional students now participating in distance
engineering programs necessitates innovative instructional interventions to
support them within these challenging new learning environments.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In sum, this project is seeking to 1) improve engineering student
academic achievement in calculus, 2) increase engineering student interest in
learning calculus and improving students' attitudes toward pursuing an
engineering career, and 3) broaden the use of online learning forums throughout
STEM education.
