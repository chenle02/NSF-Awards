This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
design concept and demonstrate the feasibility of a continuous process to
produce low-cost silicon wafers for solar cells. The approach is to cool a
molten bath of silicon from the top to be below its melting point, producing a
thin silicon sheet directly from the molten silicon bath. This technique allows
the monocrystalline or highly textured silicon sheets to be continuously
produced. A liquid or solid layer will be used to support the silicon and ensure
uniformity.

The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to
significantly reduce the cost of silicon wafers for solar cells. Today, the cost
of silicon wafers is about 45% of the total cost of a complete solar panel. This
process is expected to reduce the cost of silicon wafer by 40-65%, and thus,
greatly reduce overall cost per watt of electricity generated from solar cells.
