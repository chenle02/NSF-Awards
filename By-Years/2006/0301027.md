epitope detection reagents for field effect devices

First a selection of "modern" antibody-based and peptide aptamer molecular
reagents to recognize determinants (epitopes) expressed on toxins and organisms
that simulate biological weapons is made. Next a selection of molecules that
bind to an inert component of Bacillus anthracis toxin, the so-called
"Protective antigen" and that bind to the surface of spores of the gram-positive
organism Bacillus subtilis, which simulate spores of Bacillus anthracis is made.
These recognition molecules and simulated biological agents to fabrication
group, the Manalis group at the MIT Media Lab, which has recently devised and
fabricated field effect devices that can detect surface effects such as binding,
by changes in device capacitance. Collaboration with the Manalis group is
ongoing to couple these novel molecules to their devices and to learn to use the
resulting detectors to detect simulated biological warfare agents.
