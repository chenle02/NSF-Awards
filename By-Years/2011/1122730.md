This research identifies how institutional features of local government shape
the implementation of environmental sustainability plans and initiatives. While
decision makers increasingly recognize the importance of local sustainability
initiatives, environmental degradation continues due to a slow uptake of
sustainable practices. To generate new and useful knowledge about this
implementation gap, the research team analyzes local planning institutions and
practices through a large scale survey of local urban and regional planners and
managers as well as by case studies. The study involves an international
comparison of planning and development institutions in the U.S. and New Zealand.
As New Zealand achieves the highest environmental performance among the free
market economies, this comparison generates knowledge and innovative solutions
that are relevant in the U.S. and internationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this project is to provide an in-depth understanding of barriers to the
successful implementation of local sustainability plans and initiatives as well
as ways in which local public institutions can be transformed to remove these
barriers. The findings help to inform the uptake of sustainability strategies in
practice and are relevant to other spheres of local governance, such as
budgeting, infrastructure planning, and hazard mitigation.
