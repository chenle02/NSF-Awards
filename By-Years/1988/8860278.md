A strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens has been developed which shows inhibition of
Pythium ultimum, Fusarium, Thielaviopsis basicola and other pathogenic fungi by
producing a novel antibiotic, fusaromycin A. Both P. ultimum and T. basucika are
important components of the seedling disease complex of cotton. The goal of this
proposal is to understand the genetic and biochemical basis of this inhibition
as a means to developing an improved microbial fungicide for this crop. The
immediate objective is to isolate the genomic regions which carry the antibiotic
biosynthetic genes by complementation with chemical mutants which have lost
fungal inhibition activity. This will permit the assessment of the level of
genetic complexity of the biosynthetic pathway. The research will open the way
to the development of improved bacterial fungicides to control soil-borne fungi
pathogenic to plants.
