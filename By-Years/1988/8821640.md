This research focuses on the feasibility of using parallel link manipulators
for high speed, high precision six axis positioning applications such as mirror
pointing, surface finishing, machining, and robotic manipulation. A first phase
research effort has successfully demonstrated that the Stewart Platform type of
parallel link manipulator is feasible and has significant advantages over
conventional serial link mechanisms. The current phase of research, comprising
seven tasks, addresses the building of a prototype machine tool for finishing
operations on aircraft turbine engine blades. The first research task evaluates
the benefits of the "moving bearing point" platform design and determines
whether it or the conventional platform concept should be adopted for further
study. The "moving bearing point" design is one in which the actuator supplying
force does not move as the platform moves. Task two involves building a
functioning machine capable of performing the operations required for jet engine
blade finishing. Task three calls for implementing the feedforward controller
developed in the first phase of research. Task four focuses on experimentally
measuring system performance and optimizing the controller design. Task five
activity will test the system developed in the previous tasks and assess its
ability to perform the finishing operations on aircraft turbine engine blades.
Task six extends the system testing to other types of parts. Task seven examines
another platform modification which involves the use of piezoelectric elements
to achieve high precision, high frequency motion. The intent is to follow up
phase two work with a phase three effort oriented toward producing commercial
versions of the system developed in phase two. The impact of this work will be
on the machine tool industry where innovative concepts which can reduce costs
and improve quality are clearly needed.
