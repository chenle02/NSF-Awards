This award supports a US contribution to a collaborative project with Swedish
geologists to evaluate the geochronology of the Richarddalen Group of
northwestern Svalbard. These rocks have recently yielded "Pan African" aged
zircons (620-660 million years old) that are enigmatic because there is little
other evidence in the Arctic or Scandinavian Caledonides to rock-forming or
metamorphic/deformational events of this age. Detailed geochronologic studies
based on field and micro-structural study, and high-precision U-Pb methods will
be used to directly date metamorphic and deformational fabrics.
Lead-207/Lead-206 ages will be measured by direct evaporation of single zircon
grains to test for the presence of older (inherited) components, thereby further
constraining the interpretation of existing zircon ages. These new data will
permit a direct assessment of whether the isotopic ages reflect protolith,
metamorphic or deformational, or mixed ages, and the significance of these rocks
to global tectonic reconstructions in the Neoproterozoic.
