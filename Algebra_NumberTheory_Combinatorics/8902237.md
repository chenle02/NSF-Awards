This award supports the research in the representations of Lie groups by
Professor John S.P. Wang of Purdue University. Dr. Wang's project is to work on
a conjecture relating Zuckerman modules of a semisimple connected Lie group to
the L2 cohomology of the quotient of the group by a well-chosen discrete
subgroup. Professor Wang's earlier work has already provided evidence of the
truth of this conjecture in many cases, and his results will be of importance
not only in the general theory of Lie Groups but also in the more special field
of automorphic functions. Group theory began in the early nineteenth century as
a description of operations that might be done successively, and also undone, as
a ninety-degree clockwise rotation is undone by the ninety-degree
counterclockwise rotation. Lie groups were developed in the late part of that
century by the path breaking Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, who was
interested in the most fundamental questions concerning differential equations.
Now, one hundred years later, group theory pervades modern mathematics, and the
utility of Lie groups in many branches of mathematics, as well as in physics,
has continued undiminished.
