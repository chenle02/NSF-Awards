This is a project to continue work on the geochemical analyses of samples
obtained during ALVIN expedition to Sumisu Rift, the site of an incipient back-
arc basin, and the Kasuga cross chain. Analyses will contribute to understanding
of basalt differentiation during back-arc rifting, rhyolite formation, and
mantle sources. %%% A fundamental problem in geology is to understand how
processes operate over time and how geological systems evolve. Since geological
processes are generally much too slow to observe in real time one has to examine
systems in various states of evolution and try to piece together the process.
Back-arc basins are an important feature to understand in the overall process of
seafloor evolution. It is important to carry out work such as proposed by Gill
on an incipient basin.
