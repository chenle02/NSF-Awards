This award provides support for the 2023 Spectra Survey of Mathematics
Conference (SSMC) to be held at the University of Kentucky in Lexington,
Kentucky on May 20-21, 2023. The purpose of the conference is to promote a safe
environment for young LGBTQ+ mathematicians. Such a conference will allow
students to establish meaningful connections at early stages of their careers,
which will positively impact inclusiveness in the future. SSMC will further
serve as a stepping stone for young researchers to discuss the creation of
similar events in the future. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To promote
interdisciplinary research, the conference will be open to every topic of
mathematics, including, for example algebra, combinatorics, numerical analysis,
topology, and partial differential equations. There will be three guest speakers
for this conference: Dr. Seth Sullivant (North Carolina State University), Dr.
Mary Lynn Reed (Rochester Institute of Technology) and Dr. Alexander Hoover
(Cleveland State University). Participants will also be given the opportunity to
give twenty minute talks about their recent research accomplishments. These
talks will facilitate collaboration between participants and allow young
researchers to learn about a variety of prominent research areas in mathematics.
