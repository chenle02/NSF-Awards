The purpose of the Tennessee Technological University project is threefold: (1)
to encourage female engineering students to enroll in graduate school and
continue their studies until they have attained the Ph.D. degree; (2) to assist
such students to understand the expectations of graduate education and fully
develop their potential in school and beyond; and (3) to encourage the students
to consider careers as engineering educators. Special encouragement and support
of the students will be provided by the project director and two specially
selected outstanding engineering faculty members (mentors) in addition to the
support provided by each student's major professor. The director and mentors
will recruit the students, will meet regularly with them, will monitor their
progress, and will offer help and guidance relative to the students' personal
and career development.
