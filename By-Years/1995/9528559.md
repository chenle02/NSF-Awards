Abstract 9528559 Morse This project, which is a renewal of an ongoing effort,
makes use of the ice sheet at South Pole to build a large detector of very high
energy astrophysical neutrinos. The detector is being constructed between 1,400
and 2,100 meters below the surface by melting holes into the ice with a hot
water drill and then freezing in long stings of widely space photomultiplier
tubes. On the rare occasions when very penetrating upward going neutrinos, which
have passed through the bulk of the Earth, interact in the ice, producing
charged particles, the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA),
detects the resulting flash of light, from which the energy and direction of
flight of the original neutrino can be deduced. The present detector has eight
string in place, and this award will provide the manpower necessary to expand
AMANDA to 20 strings and to analyze the resulting data. AMANDA is a
collaboration of the University of Wisconsin (this award), the Universities of
California at Berkeley and Irvine, the Universities of Stockholm and Uppsula
(Sweden), and DESY (Germany). The institutions other than Wisconsin are funded
through different channels. The hardware for the new equipment has already been
provided for by a FY95 NSF Academic Research Infrastructure award and by the
foreign funding agencies. ***
