Rehabilitation of retaining walls is becoming a common practice, but it is a
difficult engineering problem. The difficulty stems from the fact that there are
numerous possible options for rehabilitation or replacement because of the
nature of the soil characteristics. Costs could vary considerably depending upon
the type of rehabilitation. This project will investigate the concept of
incorporating the knowledge from many experts into a format which will enable
designers to arrive at an economical solution with respect to the type of
rehabilitation method used.
