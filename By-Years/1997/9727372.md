The focus of this research will be to stabilize carbenes and radical pairs at
room temperature which are afforded no particular intramolecular steric or
electronic stabilization. The methodology relies on the use of
1,3,6-trisulphonated pyrenes (TSPs) incorporated into potassium sulfate single
crystals. Single crystal optical and EPR studies of TSPs will be applied to the
understanding of two problems in chemistry: (1) the mechanism of room
temperature phosphorescence, an (2) the deleterious population of triplet states
in single crystal dye lasers. With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Bart E. Kahr of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington. Professor Kahr will
focus his work on developing a method for the matrix isolation of of oriented,
reactive/metastable organic molecules in inert single salt crystals at room
temperature.
