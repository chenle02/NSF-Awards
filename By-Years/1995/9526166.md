9526166 Scott This grant supports travel for invited speakers and student
presenters for the symposium on Micromechanics of Advanced Materials, to be held
at the TMS-AIME Meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, October 5-9, 1995. The objective of
this symposium is to bring together internationally distinguished material
scientists of different expertise to provide a forum for discussion of important
advances in micromechanics of high technology materials. The program is
attached, which consists of 39 invited papers and 46 contributed papers. The
broad spectrum and high-caliber of invited speakers covers the interrelation
between the micro and macromechanics of fracture in advanced materials, such as
intermetallics, composites, polymer-based composites, and amorphous materials.
Fatigue and fracture and crack growth modeling are considered. %%% This
symposium accomplishes two things: It provides a comprehensive understanding of
the essential roles of micromechanics of defects, specifically, dislocations,
cracks and etc., on mechanical behavior of advanced materials, and it serves as
a guideline for the future materials research direction. The symposium will
bring together a classic proceedings volume for the materials research community
to use. ***
