The time-dependent Schr`dinger equation for atoms and quantum dots in strong
femtosecond laser field is solved using a novel basis set selection technique.
The objective is to study the effects of electron correlation on the dynamical
properties of these systems. The research is partially supported by the Division
of Physics, the Division of Materials Science and Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities of the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate.
