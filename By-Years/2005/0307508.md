AST-0307508 Schombert This project is a narrow band, continuum color survey of
the red and blue populations in distant clusters of galaxies, using a specially
designed filter system to resolve age and metallicity effects and distinguish
the mean star formation rates in the cluster blue population. This enables a
two-pronged attack on the question of the color evolution of cluster galaxies.
Following the passive evolution of the red population allows an estimate of the
time of galaxy assembly, while isolating two blue components, by segregating a
starburst contribution, will resolve their epoch of formation. Combined with
existing emission line, kinematic, and morphological work, this research will
provide a complete picture of galaxy evolution in clusters for the past eight
billion years. Observational cosmology is a popular subfield of study at the
undergraduate level, as well as providing a philosophical framework for society
as a whole, and this work will contribute to its understanding. ***
