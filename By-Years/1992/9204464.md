An REU Site will be initiated, to focus on training and research in theoretical
atomic and molecular physics. The Site will be held at the Los Alamos Campus of
the University of New Mexico, in conjunction with the Los Alamos National
Laboratory. This Site is unique among those in physics in concentrating on
theoretical research. It will help correct the current lack of those receiving
advanced training in theoretical A&M physics. The resources of LANL will be
available to the attendees at this Site.
