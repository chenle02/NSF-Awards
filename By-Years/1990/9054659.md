A CD-ROM is to be produced with materials which will give all physics teachers
access to a large collection of information useful to their teaching physics.
The materials will include tricks-of-the-trade, demonstration examples,
laboratory experiment suggestions, scientific equipment catalogues, textbook
publishers, physics lesson plans, reprints of articles on teaching, articles
about significant concepts, etc. The source of the material will be Physics
Teacher Resource Agents, AAPT, earlier commissions on college physics, out-of-
print classics, commercial supply houses, etc. The materials will be screened by
a panel of teachers. The CD-ROM will be evaluated by teachers of varying
abilities. A software package will be developed so that the information can be
retrieved by both expert and novice teachers and also by students. Extensive
workshops to acquaint teachers with the use of the Tool-Kit are planned.
