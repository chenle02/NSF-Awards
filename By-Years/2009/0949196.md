The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc.
(CUAHSI) has been involved in the development of Water Data Services (WDS)
through the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information Systems (HIS) project. The vision for
WDS is to bring together the nation's (and, potentially, the earth's) water data
in a federated system of servers linked using a services-oriented architecture.
CUAHSI WDS is used by both academic researchers and by government data providers
at both the Federal and State levels. &lt;br/&gt;A critical challenge in
achieving this vision is understanding and reconciling structural and semantic
differences across publishers of hydrologic data. The HIS project achieved
interoperability between different data repositories by developing a common
relational schema (Observations Data Model, ODM V1.1), an XML schema for
exchanging hydrologic observations (Water Markup Language, WaterML V1.0), and a
prototype ontology (V1.0) of hydrologic concepts that is used for data discovery
purposes. Experience has shown that the prototypes for WaterML and the ontology
are in need of further development. The prototype ontology provided semantic
mediation among measured properties, but as this ontology was applied to more
diverse data holdings, it became apparent that i) semantic heterogeneity
continued to exist at various levels, including sampled media, sampling
environment, chemical speciation, and units, that ii) the ontology needs to
cover a wider range of parameters (such as those from the EPA Substance Registry
System), and that iii) the development of semantic knowledge needs to be put on
a much broader community base. WaterML has proven to be of great utility as a
standardized way for transferring water information, but needs to be moved
through a formalized standardization process. &lt;br/&gt;This project will
address the underlying semantic problem through the development of a more
comprehensive, extensible ontology that harmonizes the more generic information
model contained within ODM with those from various existing federal information
sources. This includes the development of a community process for an evolving
hydrologic ontology. In addition, WaterML, which has been adopted by USGS and
NCDC, will be extended to reflect this more generic information model. The
project will contribute to forming an international standard. The fundamental
goal of the project is the organization of hydrologic concepts in a way that
allows publishers to describe their data unambiguously and helps users to
discover data easily yet with a precise understanding of the properties measured
and their context.
