A computer laboratory designed to supplement instruction in the social sciences
is being created. The students are being exposed to the statistical and other
quantitative data analysis techniques applicable in their major. The students
are being given opportunities or hands-on experience in class as well as in
independent studies computer-based research experiences. With the use of the
Micro Vax II in a networking arrangement as well as SPSSX and BMDP Statistics
software the students are expanding their experience in computer-based analysis.
The mini- computer is being used in advanced statistics classes as well as with
large data sets in political science, economics, and sociology. Since many of
the students continue on to graduate school there is a need for increasing the
statistical and other quantitative skills as well as the ability to generate
such data on the computers.
