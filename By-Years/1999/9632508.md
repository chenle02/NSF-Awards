*** 9632508 Preuss This project focuses on reconstruction following the January
17, 1995 earthquake that struck Kobe, Japan. The magnitude of this disaster was
such that the reconstruction process is extremely complex, and there are many
lessons to be learned in almost every aspect of earthquake response, recovery
and reconstruction. The study will give primary attention to physical
reconstruction from a multi-disciplinary perspective (urban planning,
architecture and urban design, and engineering) and will compare and contrast
the Kobe reconstruction experience with recent experience and practice in the
United States. Three basic levels of reconstruction will be investigated: (1)
replacement of individual buildings on the same site, (2) replacement of groups
of buildings on the same site within the existing general street pattern
(residential tracts), and (3) replanning and replacement of neighborhoods
involving changes in street alignment and creation of different spatial layouts
(new town complexes).***
