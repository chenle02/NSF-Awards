This award, to one of the leading young woman observational astronomers, is for
studies of star formation efficiencies in young spiral galaxies. State of the
art instrumentation will be used to make observations of the distribution of
ionized and molecular gas in nearby galaxies, to measure radical gradients in
interstellar gas in molecular form. These investigations will help to clarify
our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
