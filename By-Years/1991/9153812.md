The Norman Howard School Demonstration Project seeks funds for a three-year
program to enhance 90 middle school mathematics teachers to respond to the needs
of learning disabled (LD) students who are mainstreamed in regular mathematics
classes. The project will a) develop alternative instructional strategies that
support learning disabled students' mathematics learning and embed these
strategies in field tested exemplary geometry and algebra units; (b) implement
three model teacher enhancement programs for middle school mathematics teachers
from the Greater Rochester area; and (c) develop a "package" containing
materials and suggestions to organize similar programs nationwide. In addition
to the Norman Howard staff, nine core teachers from four middle school sites
will be members of the staff team and will be responsible for developing and
field-testing materials to be used in the enhancement phase of the project. The
mathematical focus of the project will be introductory algebra and geometry
while the instructional focus will be on construction of knowledge, use of
manipulative and cooperative learning. Each teacher participant will be part of
one of three enhancement models: an intensive summer institute followed by year-
long experiences involving classroom experimentation; a series of ten workshops
throughout the Fall semester of the school year; and a series of ten revised
workshops through the Spring semester of the school year. Norman Howard School,
University of Rochester and participating school district cost-sharing accounts
for 32% of the NSF budget. This project fills an important need, that of
developing materials for and enhancing middle school mathematics teachers in
instructional strategies in mathematics for LD students integrated into
mainstream mathematics classes.
