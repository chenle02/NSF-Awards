III-9362167 Eltron Research Inc. James H. White ABSTRACT Solid electrolyte
membranes of ammonium/hydronium SYMBOL 98 \f "Symbol" -alumina and hydronium
SYMBOL 98 \f "Symbol" -alumina doped with divalent transition metal ions will be
fabricated. An electrochemical reactor utilizing the new membranes is to be
constructed and tested for the oxidation of butane to isobutylene. Isobutylene
is an important intermediate for the industrial synthesis of a fuel additive.
New methods for the preparation and isolation of isobutylene are needed to help
meet the automotive needs of the public while meeting federal regulatory
requirements. rconducting unproven visiometer zeolite zeolites zirconia
