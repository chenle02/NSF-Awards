A basic property of sensory systems is the opponent, center-surround
organization of individual receptive fields of neurons. This organization
results from the convergence of inputs from separate sensory cells, some of
which contribute excitation, and others contribute inhibition. A single sensory
cell in the leech synapses with a motoneuron involved in a simple reflex. This
sensory cell generates an opponent receptive field in the motor neuron by means
of conduction block and an inhibitory interneuron. Experiments being conducted
under this award use electrophysiological recording and stimulation, marking of
cells with intracellular tracers, laser microsurgery and electron microscopy to
characterize the distribution and nature of synaptic contacts involved in the
reflex connection and to analyze integration of those inputs by postsynaptic
neurons. These experiments should reveal activity-dependent mechanisms that
influence qualitative properties of the mechanosensory receptive field and the
reflex connections of which it is a part. They will also help understand how
postsynaptic cells such as motor neurons integrate sensory signals to reach
threshold for firing action potentials and provide insight into the mechanisms
by which cell geometry, particularly axonal and dendritic branching, influence
neural signalling.
