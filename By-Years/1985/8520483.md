Research will be conducted on changes in adsorptive properties of granular
activated carbon used in treatment of water that are a consequence of microbial
growth on the granules and which may adversely or beneficially affect the
ability of the carbon to perform the function for which the process was
designed. Results of this research are likely to be applied toward improvement
of engineering design of water and wastewatertreatment processes that are
dependent upon the use of carbon beds for removal of pollutants from water and
wastewater.
