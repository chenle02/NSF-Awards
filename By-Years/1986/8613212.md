This is a combined experimental and theoretical research effort to study
transport phenomena of polymer solutions in microporous media. In all
experiments, well-characterized porous membranes and polymeric molecules are
used so that results will be amenable to theoretical analysis. the theoretical
aspects of this research focus on relating a microscopic description of polymer
dynamics to the observable macroscopic phenomena. Models are sought that allow
interpretation of the experimental results in terms of molecular characteristics
of the polymer molecules. Of primary interest is the extent to which molecular
deformation caused by solvent flow and confining boundaries (pore wall) affects
transport of polymers in porous media.
