The proposed research is an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms that
regulate the transcription of specific gene sets in time and space in animal
development. To achieve this goal it will be necessary to trace the regulatory
hierarchy that connects the activation of tissue specific structural genes to
the moment of fertilization. The sea urchin embryo will be employed as an
experimental system. Regulatory proteins that create and maintain a
histospecific program of gene transcription in development will be purified and
their genes cloned and characterized. Specifically, Dr. Calzone will purify and
clone the gene for sequence specific DNA binding proteins that are essential to
control a lineage specific program of differential gene transcription in the
early sea urchin embryo. He will identify the essential nucleotides in the site
of binding of key spatial control factors of a differentially transcribed gene.
He will also describe the molecular mechanisms by which two recently identified
negatively acting factors that regulate lineage specific transcription in the
sea urchin embryo inhibit the effect of positive acting factors on transcription
initiation. %%% An understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which specific
gene sets are selected for differential transcription in time and space in the
early embryo is essential for an understanding of how the fertilized egg
develops into a multicellular adult organism.
