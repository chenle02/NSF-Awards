Flying insects face a barrage of foreign particles such as dust and pollen,
which threaten to coat the insect's eyes and antennae, thus limiting their
sensing abilities. This project plans to elucidate a novel aerodynamic mechanism
by which insects keep these sensory organs clean. This project will be performed
in collaboration with Dr. Isao Shimoyama at the University of Tokyo. The
innovative airflow measuring techniques developed by Dr. Shimoyama's lab will
determine the optimal bristle array geometry for reducing airborne particle
deposition. The findings could lead to bio-inspired designs for dust-controlling
lenses, sensors, and solar panels.

The compound eye of many species of insects is covered by an array of short
bristles, or setae, evenly spaced between the eye's individual lenses. These
setae are believed to resist incoming particle-laden flows to reduce deposition
onto the ocular surface. Experiments will be conducted using an insect eye mimic
with a micro-scale wind velocity probe to quantify the aerodynamics of various
bristle array geometries and determine the most effective at minimizing airflow
penetration. Preliminary experiments and numerical simulation have shown that
arrayed setae can reduce airflow at the eye surface by upwards of 90 percent.
While the presence of setae arrays on insect compound eyes has been known for
quite some time, there hasn't been a study analyzing the effect of bristles on
airborne particle deposition. The aim of this work is to identify setae as a new
type of "filter," by which they guide airflows to reduce deposition into
targeted areas. As a result they require little to no maintenance and are simple
to install, making them ripe for applications. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in
collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
