This project concerns complexity theoretic aspects of numeric and algebraic
computation. One topic is problem solving using approximate data, as occurs if
the actual data must be either approximated through experimentation or rounded
for computation. Attempts will be made to lay some foundations for a complexity
theory which incorporates approximate data, in contrast to traditional
complexity theory where exact rational data is required. Some emphasis will be
given to devising efficient algorithms for solving certain problems using
approximate data, most notably linear programming problems. Another topic is
computational real semi-algebraic geometry, e.g., quantifier elimination methods
for the first order theory of the reals. Attention will be given to a few well-
known open problems in this area as well as to the common ground between it and
numeric computation. This common ground is a natural place to build a general
theory of condition numbers as well as to study extensions of standard problems
in numeric computation such as solution approximation.
