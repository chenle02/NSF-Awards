In this project, scientists at the University of Rhode Island will study
circulation and dynamical properties of the North Atlantic Central Waters in the
Newfoundland Basin. A large scale, incoherent array of isopycnal RAFOS (Inverse
SOund Fixing And Ranging) floats will be deployed to study intergyre exchange,
particle dispersion, and mixing processes. A numerical modeling component will
aid dynamical and thermodynamical interpretation of the observations.
