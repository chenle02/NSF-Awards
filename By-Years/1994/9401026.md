9401026 Hida This award funds the continuing research of Professor Haruzo Hida
in modular forms. Professor Hida hopes to construct a theory of modular forms
over non-real fields that parallels the theory over totally real fields. The
theory over totally real fields is richer because one can bring powerful
geometric methods into the study. This is research in the field of number
theory. Number theory is basically the study of whole numbers. The research done
under this award studies properties of the whole numbers by encoding them into
functions called modular forms. Number theory is among the oldest fields of
mathematics, yet it has always played an important role in choosing directions
for the rest of the subject. Within the last half century, the study of whole
numbers has become doubly important as the theory has been used to develop new
algorithms for computer science and to construct new error correcting codes for
electronics.
