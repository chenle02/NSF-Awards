MCB97-27725 MORAN As the bacterium Bacillus subtilis differentiates from the
vegetative form into a dormant endospore, complex morphological and
physiological changes occur which require the sequential expression of many
genes. During the process, new RNA polymerase sigma subunits appear
(oF,oE,oG,ok), displacing one another in a sequential cascade and conferring on
the RNA polymerase a changing specificity for the recognition of different
classes of promoters. This mechanism of altering transcriptional specificity is
a fundamental element in the regulation of sporulation gene expression. However,
during sporulation ancillary transcription factors regulate the use of promoters
by RNA polymerase containing the sporulation-induced sigma factors. These
ancillary transcription factors provide an opportunity to use mutational
analysis to study their interaction with the sporulation-induced RNA
polymerases. In this project the study of a DNA binding protein (GerE) that
functions during sporulation is expected to yield novel insights into the
mechanism of this regulator, which is representative of an important class of
transcriptional factors found in most bacteria. GerE is a small, 72 amino acid
DNA binding protein that is required for activation of several ok - dependent
promoters during the late stage of sporulation. The amino acid sequence of GerE
is homologous to the -35 binding region of RNA polymerase sigma factors, and the
DNA-binding region of a family of two-component type response regulators
including DegU, ComA, FixJ, and BvgA, and the transcriptional activator MalT.
There is no structural information on this important class of transcriptional
activators. However, the small size of GerE makes it a good candidate for
structural analysis. This research we will use genetic and biochemical
approaches to test the hypothesis that GerE interacts directly with ok at some
promoters and with other subunits of ok RNA polymerase at other promoters to
stimulate transcription. These st udies will complement studies of collaborators
in which NMR techniques will be used to determine the structure of GerE.
