General Relativity stands as the fundamental theory of gravity, governing the
behavior of astrophysical phenomena ranging from the birth of the universe to
the fate of stars. Central to this theory are the Einstein equations, which
determine the structure of spacetime. Notably, the existence of black holes,
captivating the public's imagination, remains one of the most remarkable
predictions of General Relativity. While Astrophysics has provided compelling
observational evidence of black holes through the detection of their
gravitational waves (LIGO collaboration), a fundamental question persists: "What
lies within the interior of a black hole?" This project supports a research
program based on the mathematical study of the Einstein equations, which will
significantly contribute to our understanding of the interior of black holes
within the framework of General Relativity. The work of the project is expected
to have broad implications, not only in Astrophysics but also in our exploration
of the fundamental nature of gravity. The project provides research training
opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2020 Physics Nobel
Prize of Roger Penrose, attributed to his 1965 singularity theorem, recently
highlighted the importance of the interiors of black holes within General
Relativity. These enigmatic regions not only hold immense astrophysical interest
but also bear relevance to profound theoretical questions such as the Strong
Cosmic Censorship conjecture, which affirms the deterministic character of
General Relativity. This project is aimed at the mathematical analysis of the
Einstein equations within the interior of black holes, with the ultimate
objective of providing a rigorous proof of the elusive Strong Cosmic Censorship
Conjecture within the context of gravitational collapse, the process giving rise
to black holes. By conducting a series of projects building up on spherically
symmetric models, this research endeavor significantly contributes towards this
goal and, more broadly, advances our understanding of the mechanisms governing
the formation and stability of singularities within General
Relativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
