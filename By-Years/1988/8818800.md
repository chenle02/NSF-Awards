This research seeks a better understanding of the fundamental physics underlying
transport and related physical processes in disordered media. To this end, the
research will address the range of transport phenomena that arise from different
types of disorder such as random substitutional (percolation) disorder,
spatially correlated disorder and macroscopic heterogeneities. The particular
focus will be on the nature of the probability distributions associated with
transport in these media.
