The Noyce Teacher-Leaders for Western Kansas project is developing STEM teachers
for rural communities. STEM teachers in a rural western Kansas school are
frequently considered the science and mathematics expert in both the school
system and the community. Therefore, the project is not only developing quality
STEM teachers who are providing needed services to small size communities, such
as teaching AP or distance courses, but also developing quality leaders for
communities. Through a dual degree program, in addition to completing the
requirements for a STEM major at Fort Hays State University (FHSU), the Noyce
Teacher-Leaders also complete an education degree, allowing these students to be
highly qualified teachers within their discipline. They are being prepared to
teach in a rural setting, teach Advanced Placement courses, and deliver distance
education. Noyce Teacher-Leaders are also engaged in field experiences in rural
high-needs districts. The project provides critically needed support for 18
future STEM teachers during their junior and senior years and resources to
recruit freshmen and sophomore STEM students through participation in informal
summer science and mathematics camps (6 each in summers 1-4). Mentoring and
professional development opportunities support Noyce Teacher-Leaders in remote
rural areas. The project offers a model for recruitment, retention and
preparation of STEM teachers working in rural districts. The model has broad
impact on the region because with good teacher-leaders comes the reward of a new
generation of students with interests in STEM fields. The major intellectual
merit is in the model for identifying and developing critical thinking skills,
attributes, and characteristics for STEM educators in high needs rural districts
and a model for building sustainable partnerships over a large geographic
region.
