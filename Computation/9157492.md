Shelley will work on obtaining a deeper understanding of prototypical phenomena
in fluid mechanics, including study of vortex stretching and reconnection, and
new numerical methods. Fluid dynamics is an important area of research in
mathematics, with applications to a wide variety of problems in science and
engineering.
