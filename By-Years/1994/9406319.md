Funds are provided for development of a unique device for the simultaneous
application of uniaxial stress and hydrostatic pressure to semiconductor and
high-temperature superconductors. Using the Boundary Element Method, the device
is calculated to withstand 1.4 GPa hydrostatic pressure and 1 GPa uniaxial
stress with a safety factor of 1.5. High-pressure experiments are important for
the study of high-temperature superconductors, and for the testing of
theoretical models to acquire clues for the improvement of the compounds. The
application of an external stress to a semiconductor is also significant due to
the modification of the band structure. Currently, enormous effort is being
expended in order to engineer the band structure of semiconductors for improved
electronic and optoelectronic devices. The device to be developed in this work
will be used in the investigation of laser diodes owing to the commercial
importance of this area.
