This work aims at producing a series of case studies of the appropriation of
advanced technology into the everyday classroom practices of teachers. We will
follow a collection of teachers-- who range from technology-sophisticated and
professionally innovative, to completely computer-naive -- as they learn about
and seek to incorporate a flexible, advanced technology, the Boxer system, into
their day-to-day teaching. The case studies will be interpretive and synthetic,
organized around themes that emerge as important in the practice of these
teachers and in the processes of change. Each study will involve a "stratified
analysis" including: teachers' values and learning goals, the repeatable
patterns they use in classrooms (activity structures), the skills both teachers
and students need to reproduce such patterns, and the kind of learning that
results. The forms of these case studies will be: (1) extended narrative
analysis charting facilitory patterns and critical barriers; and (2) richly
annotated video tapes of classroom practice. We will incorporate student
teachers as apprentice researches in studying effective new forms of instruction
based on the availability of advanced technology.
