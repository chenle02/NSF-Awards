The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase II project is
to develop a microbial starter culture that allows beverage manufacturers to
produce a low-sugar, shelf-stable, nonalcoholic fermented beverage. This solves
urgent challenges with existing products (e.g. kombucha, which is high in sugar
and requires refrigerated distribution) and enables beverage manufacturers to
replace unhealthy and artificially produced sodas ($40B+ market) with fermented
and naturally produced versions. In addition, this proposal will develop
underlying capacities to design new microbial communities (consortia of multiple
microbes) that can work together and perform better than state-of-the-art single
strains. This technology has important applications across food manufacturing,
but also in other disparate verticals, such as manufacturing, agriculture,
pharmaceuticals, waste remediation and more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project will continue the technical development and commercialize a novel
starter culture that can be used to produce a shelf-stable, low sugar fermented
beverages. A large biobank of food-borne microbial strains will be generated and
screened utilizing next-generation metagenomic and metabolomic approaches. Novel
microbial community compositions will be assembled, tested and refined from a
large design space, relying on new ecological design and statistical approaches.
The communities will be optimized for taste, flavor and fermentation speed and
resilience. Final starter culture candidates will be advanced and validated in
successively larger fermentation scales, and the ultimately output of this work
will be a novel lyophilized microbial starter culture product line that will be
supplied and licensed to commercial beverage
manufacturers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
