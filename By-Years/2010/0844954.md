This SGER project will conduct basic theoretical and empirical work in control
of continuous backbone "continuum" robot manipulators. The key goal of the
project is to demonstrate, in hardware, practical control of continuum robot
manipulation. Continuum structures have the potential to transform the nature of
many robot applications. However, deployment of these robots is not yet
practical, in large part due to difficulties in applying conventional robot
control techniques. The proposed one year exploratory research is intended to
lay the foundations for wider continuum robot research and application by
establishing the practical ability of new techniques to successfully control
continuum robots. We will design and implement a series of novel continuum robot
controllers, taking into account the effects of the compliance built into these
systems. The controllers will be tested using a unique hardware test bed at
Clemson University featuring the OctArm series of continuum robot arms. We will
implement all the developed controllers on the OctArm hardware, and test across
a wide variety of trajectories and manipulation tasks.
