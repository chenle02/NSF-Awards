This award is for the support of an instrument development project at the
Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. A
laser resonance ionization source mass spectrometer is being developed for the
purpose of measuring Os isotopic ratios and Re and Os concentrations in natural
samples via the isotope dilution method. Currently, the laser ionization of Re
and Os takes place in an atom cloud above the sample that is produced by pulsed
tantalum filament heating. The relatively slow thermal pulse of the filament
compared to the short duration of the pulsed laser causes premature depletion of
the atom cloud and limits the ultimate accuracy of the instrument. The goal of
this project is to improve the ion source system by incorporating a pulsed
sputtering gun to replace the thermal source.
