This project will bring an average of 20 middle, secondary and community
college teachers to Washington State University for a little more than six weeks
during the summer. During this time the teachers will be totally engaged in a
research project of the mentor engineering faculty. The aim of the project is to
make teachers more aware of the nature of engineering and to incorporate some
teaching modules into their classrooms based on their research experience. There
will be substantial follow-up of the research experience with visits by the
mentor faculty to the participants classroom during the year as well as the
participants return to the University to present papers on the experience with
their teaching modules. The project will directly engage approximately 60
teachers directly in the three years of the project. The cost share is 37.4% of
Foundation support.
