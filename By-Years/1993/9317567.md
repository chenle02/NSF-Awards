9317567 Evans Star Formation and Molecular Clouds. The primary goals of this
project are improved understanding of star formation and molecular clouds. The
project is a three-year collaborative program, focused on submillimeter
observations at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, but includes observations
at other wavelengths and directly related efforts in modeling and
instrumentation. Areas of investigation range from small molecular clouds and
small cores in larger clouds, to large scale maps of spectral lines of atoms and
molecules, to studies of star formation and molecular clouds on a galactic
scale.
