Keyser This project involves investigations of selected aspects of the dynamics
of extratropical baroclinic wave regimes, all of which will contribute to a
better understanding of the process of extratropical cyclogenesis. The research
will consist of both diagnostic and numerical modeling studies. Three principal
activities to be undertaken are (1) analyses of ageostrophic circulations in the
vicinity of upper level jet streaks and frontal zones, (2) a study of the nature
of upper level precursors of cyclogenesis and the applicability of vortex
dynamics, and (3) a study of the dynamics and evolution of atmospheric jet
streaks using a hierarchy of numerical models. The principal investigator's view
of jet streak dynamics, in particular, is quite different from the conventional
view and, if shown to be correct, would radically change the atmospheric
sciences community's understanding of jets. This research is important in
improving understanding of the development of midlatitude storms. ***
