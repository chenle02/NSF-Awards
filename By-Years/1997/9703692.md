9703692 Wunderlich The present research is designed to investigate the smallest
level of molecular aggregation, that of the nanophase (one or more dimensions is
the order of magnitude of 10-9 meter, i.e., 10-100 times the atomic diameter).
In nanophase polymers a single macromolecule participates in many phases,
resulting in unique properties which ultimately lead to new materials and
applications. The molecular mechanisms governing crystallization-melting,
vitrification devitrification, ordering-disordering, annealing and deformation
are to be studied with a combination of techniques. The details of structure and
dynamics, as expressed by the unit cell, micro and nanophase sizes, orientation,
strain, defects, and relaxation phenomena are to be studied by X-ray
diffraction, neutron scattering, electron and atomic force microscopy, and solid
state NMR. On the same samples overall properties are to be checked with the
newly developed temperature-modulated calorimetry (TMC) and other thermal
analyses. %%% The significance of the work lies in the enormous multiplicity of
the polymer molecules which are available for the production of new materials.
By clarifying the connection between structure properties, and processing,
advances in the development of modern polymers are expected. ***
