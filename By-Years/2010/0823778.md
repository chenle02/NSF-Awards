Objective We will create a new generation of superconducting nanowire single-
photon detectors (SNSPDs) with widths below 50 nm, thus improving dramatically
on demonstrated detector efficiency at both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths.
We will develop and test narrower wires by using improved nanofabrication and
low-temperature characterization. We will simultaneously develop improved
understanding of the superconductive nanowire device physics to enable further
advances in nanowire-photodetector technology.

Intellectual Merit Superconducting nanowires are an interesting physical system
for studying quantum mechanical, thermodynamic and electromagnetic interactions.
Structures at the widths that will be explored in this work will provide new
insights as the quantum mechanical wavefunction of the superconducting charge
carriers is restricted from two, toward just one dimension. Additionally, this
work will stress the limits of nanofabrication, requiring large-area structures
to be developed with tens-of-nanometer widths and line-width uniformity of a
few-nanometers. This work will also provide near- and mid-infrared single-photon
detectors, and even photon-number-resolving detectors, with exquisite timing
resolution that will advance research in quantum optics, remote sensing and
astronomy.

Broader Impacts Development of SNSPDs with increased efficiencies, both in the
near- and mid-infrared, will provide sensors for applications ranging from
astronomy to environmental monitoring. Also, this work will provide valuable
educational opportunities in nanofabrication, nano-optics, and solid-state
physics to graduate students and undergraduates in the classroom and in the
laboratory. Finally, this project will create an opportunity for the general
public to learn about one of the important applications of nanotechnology
through a public lecture.
