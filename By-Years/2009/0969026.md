Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys

0969031 Colorado School of Mines; Michael Kaufman 0969026 University of North
Texas; Srinivasan Srivilliputhur The Center for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural
Alloys will focus on the physical metallurgy of non-ferrous alloys (alloying and
processing effects on microstructure, properties and performance) and on the
industries that develop, manufacture, and use these alloys. Colorado School of
Mines (CSM) and the University of North Texas (UNT) are collaborating to
establish the proposed center, with CSM as the lead institution.

The proposed Center aims to establish the industrial support, operational
mechanisms, and a prospective research portfolio for a viable research Center
that will conduct critical basic and applied physical metallurgy research of
direct relevance to the industries that develop, manufacture and use advanced
non-ferrous structural alloys. The PIs are proposing the following topical
areas: solidification and casting, lightweight alloys (Al, Mg and Ti), high
performance alloys (superalloys), and high production alloys. The PIs will
insure that students have the opportunity to work on state-of-the-art projects
and be mentored by both experimental and modeling experts. CSM and UNT plan to
use the NSF planning grant fund to hold a meeting with prospective industrial
partners to establish the proposed Center's organizational framework, and to
establish research projects of greatest relevance.

The proposed Center has the potential to improve sustainability and
profitability of US manufacturing by developing advanced non-ferrous alloys that
could reduce energy consumption and pollution in the manufacturing of these
alloys. The research would also improve the competitiveness of US manufacturers.
The PIs will insure that both undergraduate and graduate students receive
appropriate education and training to become well grounded in the fundamental
principles of physical metallurgy. The Center plans to provide research
opportunities to qualified students from underrepresented groups, and to hiring
researchers (from the minority groups) at the faculty level that might expand
the Center activities. The proposed Center will showcase its activities and
invite high school students from the local community to emphasize to them the
role of structural materials in the world around them.
