Measurements of convective heat transfer are often very difficult to make. In
certain situations, it is easier to measure the rate of mass transfer and then
to convert the results to heat transfer by using the analogy between the two
processes. One of the most oft-used mass transfer techniques is the sublimation
of naphthalene. In the past, the degree of sublimation has been measured by
using a stylus-type instrument to measure the contour of the subliming surface.
The present proposal is directed toward the investigation of the use of optical
techniques, specifically holographic interferometry, to measure the surface
contour. If successful, greater accuracy will result and, even of greater
importance, surface shapes will be able to be dealt with which were beyond the
capabilities of stylus-type instruments.
