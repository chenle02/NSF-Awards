The economics of Cloud Computing Cloud Computing impels a fundamental shift in
how data services are deployed and delivered, enabling flexible, dynamic
outsourcing while reducing capital cost commitments for hardware and software.
However, cloud computing also deprives customers of direct control over the
systems that manage their data, raising security and privacy concerns. This
research develops the means to provide secure and privacy-assured data service
outsourcing that is usable, scalable, and meets performance goals, through: (1)
an encrypted cloud data service, including fuzzy and ranked keyword search with
strong privacy-assurance for large numbers of users and files, (2) scalable and
owner-controlled cloud data sharing service with fine-grained data access
enforcement and scalability, and (3) privacy-preserving secure cloud storage
auditing that maintains strong guarantees of storage correctness. Enabling
secure and privacy-assured data service outsourcing is fundamental to the
success of cloud computing deployment. This project also develops curricula and
teaches and supervises students. Materials of this project will be made
available online as tutorials, software packages, and publications of general
interest.
