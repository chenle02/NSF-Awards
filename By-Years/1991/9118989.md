Morphology dependent stimulated Raman scattering, MDSRS, is new nonlinear laser
Raman technique that has been used to measure the chemical composition of
laboratory generated aerosol particles. As the equipment associated with MDSRS
is compact and rugged it may be possible to use MDSRS for in situ monitoring of
tropo- and stratospheric aerosol chemical content. MDSRS is a new technique
though and as such several aspects of the signal generation, i.e. the nonlinear
gain process, are not clearly understood. The main focus of this research is the
development of MDSRS into a full scale analytic technique. Experiments will be
conducted to examine the influence of aerosol size and composition, excitation
wavelength, and illumination geometry on MDSRS signal size. The results of these
experiments will allow ion of determination of the feasibility of using this new
technique for in situ studies of aerosol composition and heterogeneous chemical
processes.
