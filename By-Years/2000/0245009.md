The PI's propose to conduct research on theoretical&lt;br/&gt;heavy ion physics.
The emphasis of this proposal is reaction dynamics over a&lt;br/&gt;range of
beam energies, from intermediate ( &gt; 10 AMeV) to ultra-
relativistic&lt;br/&gt;(100 AGeV). Particular attention is paid to theory that
is relevant to exper-&lt;br/&gt;iments at the NSCL, GSI, CERN-SPS, and RHIC. The
co-PIs have a long&lt;br/&gt;tradition of collaborating with experimental groups
in the US and abroad,&lt;br/&gt;and they will continue to do
so.&lt;br/&gt;Thematically, themain emphasis lies on the investigation of
correlations&lt;br/&gt;between emitted particles, as well as phase transitions
in heavy ion reactions&lt;br/&gt;at different energy regimes. An important
component of this proposal is the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical support for the future
Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) program&lt;br/&gt;and its connection to nuclear
astrophysics. Since the RIA construction was&lt;br/&gt;identifed as the highest
priority in theNSAC long-range plan, it is impera-&lt;br/&gt;tive to deepen the
theoretical underpinning for this feld.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed topics are of
present interest to the investigators in light&lt;br/&gt;of the present
experimental situation. A traditional strength of the investi-&lt;br/&gt;gators
is the ability to adapt their research directions to new
experimental&lt;br/&gt;fndings, and it can be predicted that this will continue
during the proposed&lt;br/&gt;grant period.&lt;br/&gt;Almost all of the funds
proposed will be spent for salaries for two gradu-&lt;br/&gt;ate students and
one post-doctoral associate. In year one, there is a request&lt;br/&gt;for some
computer support. This is justifed, because almost all
proposed&lt;br/&gt;research makes extensive use of numerical work.
