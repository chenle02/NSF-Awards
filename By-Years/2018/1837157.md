This award will support the participation of students, postdoctoral scientists,
and early career faculty in the symposium titled "Multiscale Modeling of Soft
Materials and Interfaces" that will be held as a part of the Materials Research
Society Fall 2018 meeting in Boston, MA. The symposium will focus on recent
scientific advances in the theory and simulation of these materials, that
encompass colloids, gels, foams, polymers, suspensions, and bioinspired
materials. These materials are critical to technologies that include drug
delivery, energy storage devices, coatings, and oil recovery. The symposium will
include distinguished invited speakers from industry, academia, and national
laboratories and contributed talks and posters by students and early career
scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is timely in terms of the
technical impact and translation to applications, due to recent advances in
modeling methods and theory and recent rapid advances in high performance
computing. The symposium will disseminate the latest advances in the field while
simultaneously informing and recruiting the next generation of scientists and
broadening the participation of under-represented groups in materials science
research. Encouraging the participation of young investigators will help fill a
national need to train a future work force in soft matter design and will
provide a unique opportunity for young investigators to interact with leading
researchers and industrial practitioners in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
