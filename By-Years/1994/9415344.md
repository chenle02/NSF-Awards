9415344 Eagar ABSTRACT Manufacturing Internship Enhancement as Outreach to Small
and Medium Enterprises The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will expand
its Leaders for Manufacturing (LFM) Program to include internships in small and
medium manufacturers. Built completely on private-sector resources, LFM is well
known as an innovative program and one of the most important benchmarks in the
field. However, it has been limited mostly to large firms due to the cost of
implementing some of the unique features of the program. With TRP funding, small
and medium firms will be able to participate with benefit to both students and
member firms. The program draws active participation from both the Management
and Engineering Schools in stressing the practical aspects of manufacturing
while taking into account fundamental principles. ***
