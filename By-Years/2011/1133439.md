Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photosynthetic microalgae have considerable promise
as biological catalyst for the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into lipid-
rich biomass which can serve as a feedstock for biodiesel production. A major
barrier for converting microalgae to biodiesel on a large scale is the need to
dry the algae and extract the oil components. The proposed research will develop
the scientific and engineering knowledge to convert algal biomass directly to
biodiesel in its natural wet state through a two step process without the need
for drying or extraction. The first step is a mild hydrothermal carbonization
treatment that hydrolyzes the intracellular lipids into fatty acids and
coalesces them into easy-to-filter solids. The second step is biodiesel
synthesis through noncatalytic and catalytic approaches, including the
uncatalyzed esterification of the lipids in the wet hydrolysis solids with
supercritical ethanol, or the metal-triflate-catalyzed esterification of the
lipids in the wet hydrolysis solids with subcritical ethanol. The reaction
pathways and kinetics of each step will be elucidated to assess how the process
variables (temperature, concentrations, time, etc.) influence the biodiesel
product yields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed activities are designed to provide educational opportunities for
students within the context of the proposed research. Undergraduate students,
particularly women and underrepresented minorities, will be recruited through
the Marian Sarah Parker Scholars Program and Summer Research Opportunity Program
at the University of Michigan to conduct research on algal biodiesel in
collaboration with the PhD student who will be trained as part of this project.
Renewable energy concepts will be incorporated into a sophomore level
Sustainable Engineering course offered though the College of Engineering at the
University of Michigan.
