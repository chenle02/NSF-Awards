When a lens and it's focal length are extremely small, all aberrations scale
with the size of the lens and at some point become ignorable. For highest
resolution it is desirable to have a deep ultraviolet and high numerical
aperture lens. Conventional lens making methods have proved inadequate for
providing diffraction limited deep UV lenses which are reproducible enough to be
used in metrology applications in the semiconductor industry. Microlenses as
proposed here have the following advantages: Extremely reproducible; deep
ultraviolet and large numerical apertures are possible; they have no polished
curved surfaces they are potentially diffraction limited; and they are
relatively broad band although they are made from only one type of glass (fused
silica, UV grade). Applications include semiconductor metrology and inspection;
biological and medical microscopy; and fiber optic coupling.
