ABSTRACT ESI 94-50258 Robert Moses The Algebra Project, Inc. Cambridge, MA
Middle School Mathematics Literacy Project Over the past several years, the
Algebra Project, Inc. has been developing a set of inquiry-oriented, experience-
based middle school materials designed to prepare minority youngsters to enter,
and successfully complete, a college track mathematics program in high school.
The Algebra Project materials, designed to be used as a supplement to other
middle school curricula, are currently being implemented in a number of (mainly
urban) sites around the United States. The present project involves both
implementation and evaluation activities at just one set of sites in
Mississippi, primarily in the Spring Semester 1994. The project targets some 32
schools, including a few schools in Jackson, as well as many isolated rural
schools in the Delta. Project staff supports the implementation efforts of the
78 teachers by periodic workshops, meetings, and class visitations, as well as
the development of a broad-based community support system that includes school
administrators, parents, and community leaders. Concurrent with the
implementation efforts, a national panel of 6 evaluation experts is conducting
an intensive short-term evaluation study to look at the Algebra Project
materials themselves, as well as the Mississippi Delta implementation model--
with a view to determining the replicability of this model. Non-NSF
contributions to this project are 10% of the NSF contribution.
