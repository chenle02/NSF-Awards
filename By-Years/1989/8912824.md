This project intends to provide an important framework for major genetic
restructuring of central carbon metabolism in E. coli for the purpose of
increasing synthesis of valuable products. This project also plans to contribute
to new monitoring and analysis methods of general utility in studying cell
response to environmental or genetic manipulation. The specific overall
objective of this project is to reduce acetate formation during aerobic growth
of E. coli by genetic modification of carbon flow. This is to be done by: -
Identifying metabolic signals which are candidates for directing carbon flow
towards acetate. - Identifying proteins associated with responses at the genetic
level to environments which trigger acetate production. - Evaluating overall
glucose consumption, growth and acetate formation kinetics and stoichiometry
under conditions which result in acetate production. - Characterizing in detail
several existing genetic constructs which possess or which are likely to exhibit
altered acetate production metabolism. - Identifying and mapping new genetic
alterations which enhance growth in acetate-producing environments.
