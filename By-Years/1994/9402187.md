9402187 Khalil It is proposed to conduct research on the design of robust output
feedback control of a class of nonlinear systems. The class of systems to be
considered is the class of input-output linearizable systems, which arise in
many applications such as robotics manipulators, aircraft control, and electric
machines. The design procedure starts with the design of a robust state feedback
control followed by the design of a robust observer to recover robustness
achieved with state feedback. The performance of such observers are usually
hindered by difficulties due to measurement noise and excessively large
transient response. A recent result by the principal investigator has show that,
for the special case of fully linearizable systems, the undesirable transient
behavior can be eliminated by designing the feedback control to be globally
bounded. This proposal aims at developing a comprehensive theory for the design
of globally bounded output feedback controllers. Problems to be investigated
include tracking, disturbance rejection, servomechanisms, robustness, comparison
of various state estimation schemes, and study of the effect of measurement
noise. ***
