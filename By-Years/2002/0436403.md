lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on
the analysis of the properties of solutions for both linear and
nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;Schrodinger equations and on the analysis of ground states
and evolution in the models of Skyrme and Faddeev. The principal investigator
will continue his study of the exact and&lt;br/&gt;approximate fundamental
solutions for time-dependent Schrodinger equations on noncompact and compact
manifolds, with special emphasis on estimates relevant for nonlinear
problems.&lt;br/&gt;For the models of Skyrme and Faddeev, he will study the
existence of ground states and their regularity. Also, he will study the Cauchy
problem for these models. The PI will extend the&lt;br/&gt;techniques developed
recently in connection with wave maps and Schrodinger maps to these more
complicated sigma-models. In addition, he will initiate computational analysis
of the&lt;br/&gt;ground states and the Cauchy problem in the case when the base
manifold is compact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Schrodinger equation is the basic
equation of quantum physics. The properties of its solutions for different
physical systems and environments are of great importance&lt;br/&gt;to our
understanding of quantum phenomena. On the other hand, to describe and better
understand elementary particles, physicists design various mathematical models,
or field theories. Of special interest are the models that use subtle
topological invariants.&lt;br/&gt;The models of Skyrme and Faddeev are examples
of such models. Their analysis poses challenging mathematical problems on the
intersection of the theory of partial differential equations and
geometry/topology and may bring new physical insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
