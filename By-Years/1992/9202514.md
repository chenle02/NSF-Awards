Knox College requests funding for a new scanning electron microscope (SEM) to
replace our 14-year-old model that does not meet the current research needs of
the faculty, and for which parts are getting scarce. L. Dybas, principal
investigator, will use the SEM for her studies on sipunculan immunology,
focussing on the structure and function of sipunculan coelomocytes; on the
responses of sipunculans to elevated temperature (heat shock), wounding and
regeneration; and for taxonomic and morphologic studies in her research on
ptiliid beetles. M. Brodl, in his studies on the heat shock response in barley
aleurone layers, will use the SEM to characterize the response of the
endoplasmic reticulum during heat shock, recovery, and thermotolerance. The
response in barley is a model system for comparing responses in other plants,
invertebrates and higher animals. B. Kooser will use the SEM in his spin label
investigations sing chemically modified silica. EPR spectra display behavioral
changes as the silica surface is modified. SEM observations of the altered
silica are essential to confirm the surface modification. The SEM will also be
integral to an introductory project-based course in electron microscopy. A
research-level SEM will permit students to obtain publication- quality data
either on their own or as co- researchers with faculty.
