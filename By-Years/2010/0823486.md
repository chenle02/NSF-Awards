This project will investigate the application of helium-4 in corals as a
geochemical proxy to reconstruct high-resolution atmospheric dust loading and
precipitation patterns in the tropical Atlantic and Red Sea. The primary
objectives of this research will be to extend the record of Sahel dust export
over the Atlantic back to the early-part of the 19th century, to elucidate dust
transport processes by comparing the proxy record of dust obtained in corals
from across the Atlantic Ocean basin, and to reconstruct a 300 years dust flux
record from the Sahara and Sahel region at sub-decadal resolution. Reconstructed
dust flux data will be used as a benchmark for model simulation verification in
order to better predict future dust emission form the Sahara and Sahel regions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts include research on an important
societal issue related to global warming/change. This project will involve
undergraduate students during the research phase of the work. &lt;br/&gt;
