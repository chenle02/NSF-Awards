9724184 Gealt This is an award to provide support for instrumentation to conduct
collaborative research on metal release from biologically mediated sulfide
minerals, metal separation/recovery from wastewater, metals in drinking water
and metal transport and effects on bioprocesses in natural water. The proposal
leading to this award was submitted in accord with the NSF Instrument
Development and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 97-24, Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program. The research being conducted on the transport and
fate of metal contaminants of water addresses a topic that has been
significantly displaced by emphasis on organic contaminants of water. Results of
the collaboration between investigators that is likely to be enhanced through
use of this instrumentation is expected to improve our understanding of dominant
processes that control the fate of metals in natural systems as an important
step in management of the quality of environmental resources. ***
