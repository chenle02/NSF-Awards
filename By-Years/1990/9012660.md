High power radio waves directed to the upper atmosphere and ionosphere can
produce major perturbations in composition, produce optical emissions and create
additional radio waves at various frequencies. In the past one experiment
produced ultra low frequency waves as detected by a sensitive receiver near by.
This result has been difficult to repeat. This project by the original
investigator is to repeat the experiment using new equipment to try to validate
the earlier results.
