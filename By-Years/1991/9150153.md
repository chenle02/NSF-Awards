A three-year project, Science Experiences and Resources for Informal Education
Settings (SERIES), involves collaboration between the 4-H Youth Development
Program, practicing scientists, science education centers, and community service
agencies to provide community-based science experiences for youth. Goals for
national dissemination of the SERIES project are: 1) Increase the quality and
quantity of science experiences for youth as leaders and as learners; 2) For
youth to actively experience how science concepts and processes relate to their
everyday lives; 3) Provide opportunities for youth to take positive leadership
roles in their homes and communities; and 4) Provide opportunities for youth to
investigate educational and career possibilities in science and technology
through a scientist mentor relationship. SERIES builds upon the materials, and
instructional/coaching model successfully developed and tested during the
Califronia SERIES Project. National dissemination by 4-H assures SERIES
availability to the 5,100,000 youth currently enrolled in 4-H. Expected outcomes
of SERIES are: 1) Refine and produce final versions in English and Spanish of
four SERIES community service science units; 2) Develop two new units; 3)
Development of an "inquiry coaching" module for adult volunteers; 4) Develop and
asses apprentice-like mentoring experiences for SERIES teens to work directly
with scientists; and 5) Establish four SERIES regional dissemination centers,
working collaboratively with 4-H, science centers and other youth serving
agencies to provide national dissemination of the SERIES program model to 28
states.
