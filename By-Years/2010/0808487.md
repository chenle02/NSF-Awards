Characteristics of species can influence their exposure to environmental
contaminants which, in turn, can impact their immune function and susceptibility
to infectious diseases. This study will examine two temperate bat species,
Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis lucifugus, which differ in diet and foraging
habitat, and compare them with respect to mercury tissue concentration, stable
isotope concentration, immune function, and stress physiology. Comparisons also
will be made between sites with different mercury concentrations. Results should
contribute to a better understanding of the effects of mercury on mammalian
health, and determine whether mercury is an important factor affecting the
health and conservation status of bat species. Bats may be particularly useful
indicator species for assessing mercury contamination because of their
relatively long life spans, high metabolic rates, wide geographic ranges, and
trophic status. If mercury causes a decrease in immune function, it may also
increase susceptibility to infection by pathogens such as rabies. Broader
impacts of this project include training of a doctoral student and a likely
increase in understanding of ecological and environmental influences affecting
emerging infectious diseases in bats and humans alike.
