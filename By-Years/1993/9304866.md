Chromosomes of eukaryotes have regions of differing compaction termed
heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatin has a high density of
repetitious DNA, few genes and little transcription. Active genes, most of which
are found in the euchromatin, are inactivated if they are removed to
heterochromatic regions. This effect, called position effect variegation (PEV),
has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. There is
evidence that the telomeric regions at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are
specialized heterochromatic-like domains. The project proposed uses telomeric
PEV in Drosophila to investigate telomeric chromatin by identification of
telomeric non- histone proteins and telomeric DNA sequences which bind those
proteins. A white eye color gene flanked by telomeric sequences will be
integrated at non-telomeric locations and the expression of that gene with and
without the telomeric sequences will be compared. A second approach will be to
localize the DNA sequences necessary and/or sufficient to bind HP1, a protein
characterized in other laboratories, which is implicated in chromatin
condensation. %%% The primary objective of this project is to identify telomeric
proteins and the DNA sequences to which they bind, but the resulting data will
also be relevant to the broader question of how gene expression is regulated by
chromosome condensation. Such a mechanism is thought to be critical to normal
development of eukaryotic organisms.
