9514575 MANDLER This research will examine the development of conceptual thought
in infancy and early childhood. Until recently there has been little
experimental work on this topic, but it has been assumed that infants first form
concepts about concrete objects, such as dogs, chairs, and cars, and only later
develop broader concepts of animals, furniture, and vehicles. However, prior
research from Mandler's laboratory indicates that the broader concepts actually
precede the more specific ones. For example, 6-month-olds can see the difference
between dogs and cats but conceptually they treat them both as the same kind of
thing. This research will extend these findings to show how infants from 9 to 15
months form their first inductive generalizations about the characteristics of
animals, vehicles, and other classes, for example, how they determine what kind
of objects eat and what kind of objects get ridden. Several recently-devised
techniques will be used to study these issues. One technique is to measure how
infants categorize little models of real-world objects. Another technique is to
see whether infants are more willing to imitate appropriate behavior on these
objects (such as giving a dog a drink) than inappropriate behavior (giving a car
a drink). The research will also study early comprehension of object labels, to
see how broadly or narrowly infants interpret their meaning. The overall goal of
the research is to provide a systematic body of knowledge about the preverbal
foundations of concept formation and thought and its relation to early language
acquisition and preschool learning. ***
