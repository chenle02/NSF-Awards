CI Days Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As science research has changed from the
individual in the lab to research groups distributed across multiple
institutions, Cyberinfrastructure (CI) has become an important component to
enable these groups to work together. The CI Days program will help campuses
create an event to bring the campus together to understand the campus CI needs,
resources that are available, and to start planning for the further development
of CI on campus. The campus event will include all players in the CI picture
including faculty, IT personnel, librarians, and administrators. Campus
participants will have the opportunity to create connections with others on
campus as well as with those from other institutions and organizations. Through
understanding of the complete CI system and the responsibilities of all
involved, the campus can build cohesive CI resources that tie into the global CI
environment. Post-event activities will foster planning and implementation of
the total campus CI environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of CI
Days will come from the documentation of activities and methodologies for campus
CI coordination and planning that can be used by other campuses as they address
CI issues. Intellectual Merits of CI Days include analysis and reporting on
barriers and unmet needs in CI as discovered during the event which will help
the R&amp;E community understand issues and areas of work needed to improve the
overall CI environment and better serve researchers.
