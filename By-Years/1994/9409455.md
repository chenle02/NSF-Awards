9409455 Hubbell This proposal is on research to develop biomaterials for tissue
engineering of the peripheral nerve. These biomaterials are comprised of fibrin
gels containing synthetic matrix attachment peptides to provide both neuro-
conductive and neuro-inductive stimuli in order to enhance nerve regeneration.
This research has three specific aims which are: (1) to characterize the
stability of the immobilization of the peptides incorporated into fibrin; (2) to
determine the bioactivity of the incorporated peptides; and (3) to examine the
effect of peptide incorporation on in vivo peripheral nerve generation. This
research could have impact on the treatment of human neurological disease. ***
