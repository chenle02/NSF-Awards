This award supports the continued development, assessment, and dissemination of
Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILT) and peer-instruction tools for
advanced undergraduate courses. QuILTs and peer instruction tools are based upon
a field-tested cognitive-apprenticeship model of learning and emphasize
modeling, coaching, and scaffolding. The following features make them
particularly suited for the challenging task of teaching quantum physics: (1)
They are based upon research in physics education and pay particular attention
to cognitive issues. (2) They consistently keep students actively engaged in the
learning process by asking them to predict what should happen in a particular
situation and then providing appropriate feedback. (3) They employ visualization
tools to help students build physical intuition about quantum processes. (4)
They attempt to bridge the gap between the abstract quantitative formalism of
quantum mechanics and the qualitative understanding necessary to explain and
predict diverse physical phenomena. (5) They are based on systematic
investigations of difficulties students have in learning various concepts in
quantum physics. (6) Many of the tools can be used in class by the instructors
as supplements to lectures or outside of the class as homework or as self-study
tool by students. (7) They consist of self-sufficient modular units that can be
used in any order that is convenient. To aid instructors, the concept-based and
problem-based QuILTs and peer-instruction tools will be keyed with most of the
common textbooks.
