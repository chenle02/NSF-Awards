A model has been developed which describes the transient performance (which is
more realistic than assuming steady state performance) of large-scale assembly
systems. This model has computer run times which are low and affordable (CPU
cost of $1.00, for example), compared with prohibitive costs for simulation runs
($700, for example). The model is based on two assumptions, which were partially
verified in the preceding work. One purpose of this research is to complete the
verification. If this can be done, the result should be a planning process to
guide the system designer in developing and evaluating alternative designs; a
quantitative procedure to assure effective material management; and a
descriptive model that quantifies all relevant trade-offs in test/rework
strategies. The approach involves four tasks. First is development of the
mathematics required to manipulate the model and to reduce errors resulting from
approximations. Second is generation of a computer program that can apply the
model for both description and prescription. Third will be evaluation of the
tools in actual production situations. Fourth will be dissemination of the
results, including making the computer program available in usable form.
