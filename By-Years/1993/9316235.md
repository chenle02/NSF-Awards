9316235 Platz The Workshop on Physical Organic Chemistry, an annual conference
for the discussion of topics that span from biorganic chemistry to gas-phase
reactions, will be convened for the next three years. Although the range of
topics is wide, all have the methodology used by physical organic chemists.
Attendance will be limited to about twenty persons, all of whom present informal
talks on new, unpublished results. Conferences will be held at remote sites in
order to minimize distractions and encourage informal discussion. Strong efforts
will be made, as in the past, to include minorities and females. In keeping with
past tradition, there will be a large number of younger investigators along with
some senior investigators. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program
supports the continuing meeting of Workshops on Physical Organic Chemistry,
which is organized by Professor Matthew S. Platz at Ohio State University. These
workshops will provide opportunities for the generation of new ideas, to
facilitate collaborate, and to introduce young investigators to their senior
peers. The number of attendees and location of the meetings are designed to
facilitate these goals. The workshop also benefits the Organic Dynamics Program
by identifying imaginative research projects and young investigators that will
strengthen the Program as new awardees and reviewers. ***
