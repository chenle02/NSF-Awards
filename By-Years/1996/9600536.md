Abstract 9600536 Tyson The cell division cycle is the periodic repetition of a
sequence of events, including DNA synthesis, mitosis and cytokinesis, that
transform a single cell into two daughter cells. Control of the sequence and
timing of these events is complex. The major events are triggered by cyclin-
dependent kinases, a family of enzymes whose activity depends on binding to the
cyclin proteins, phosphorylation and binding to inhibitory proteins. So far
characterization of this regulatory system has been reductionistic; breaking the
nnetwork into parts and examining how they interact. This project will develop
mathematical methods by which the parts can be put back together into a model of
an intact, functional regulatory system. By comparing the behavior of the model
to experimental observations, the credibility of the model can be judged. The
goal is to develop realistic models of cell cycle control in frog embryos, yeast
cells and mammalian cells. The experimental tools to dissect this control system
are well developed, but the theoretical tools necessary to put the pieces
together are still largely untested and underappreciated by cell biologists.
This projects aims at developing appropriate mathematical tools, applying them
to current data, and communicating the power of modeling the to the experimental
community. ***
