9509295 9521429 Brodie Brodie A critical element of many theories of
evolutionary change is the idea that there is a "cost" to adaptation: increased
adaptation in one trait necessarily restricts the potential for increased
adaptation of some other traits. One way that costs of adaptation, or
evolutionary tradeoffs, are thought to arise is through coevolutionary
interactions. Predator-prey systems that represent many generations of
reciprocal selection are ideal situations to test this explanation for the
evolution of tradeoffs. Only one natural predator-prey system has provided
population level evidence of increased ability to exploit prey evolving as a
result of antipredator adaptations in the prey. Newts of the genus Taricha occur
along the west coast of the United States and produce the neurotoxin
tetrodotoxin (TTX), which is one of the most potent nerve toxins known. The only
known predators resistant to this toxin are Thamnophis sirtalis that occur with,
and feed on, the newts. Snake populations differ markedly in their resistance to
TTX, and within resistant populations there is preliminary evidence suggesting
that decreased locomotor performance accompanies increased resistance to TTX.
This system provides an exceptional opportunity to study the costs of adaptation
associated with arms race coevolution. This research will examine potential
costs of adaptation in resistant and nonresistant populations of garter snakes.
Locomotor performance and TTX resistance will be studied in each population, and
the correlation between these traits will be used to assess tradeoffs. A
phylogeny describing the evolutionary relationships between populations will be
constructed and used to examine the historical evolution of both resistance and
the tradeoff between resistance and performance. This approach will allow tests
of alternative explanations for the evolution of tradeoffs. Examining the
evolution of resistance to TTX is a first step to understanding how organisms
survive in th e face of widespread and dangerous natural toxins.
