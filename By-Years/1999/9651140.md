The project's main objective is to give students in the Microscale Organic
Laboratory experience with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer so
as to better prepare them for careers as scientists and/or science teachers. The
diverse student population that will benefit from the project includes over 30%
Black and Hispanic students and over 60% female students. In the Microscale
Organic Laboratory, the spectrometer will be used by students week after week to
analyze products and characterize unknowns. This will give them concrete
reinforcement of lecture topics related to infrared spectroscopy. Interested
students will analyze byproducts of the reactions they run, and will be asked to
adapt a synthetic route found in the literature to the microscale level. Among
other ways, the impact of the project will be evaluated by monitoring student
progress throughout their post community college education. The emergence of
microscale chemistry over the past decade has led to a regular feature on the
subject in the Journal of Chemical Education. This is an excellent forum where
successes from the project, such as new or adapted microscale techniques, will
be disseminated to the scientific community.
