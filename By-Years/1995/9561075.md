This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the fabrication of a high temperature, high pressure sensor for measuring
contact stresses between moving surfaces. Wear due to friction and high contact
stresses is a major factor in the design and analysis of mechanical components
such as gears and bearings. Due to the uncertain nature of the real area of
contact between surfaces, there is no recourse but to use models to predict
these contact stresses. Numerous analytical models are used to predict surface
stresses occurring at various locations. However, actual verification of these
models is difficult due to a lack of accurate experimental data since there are
no sensors capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 900oK and pressures
on the order of many GPa. Furthermore, these sensors must be capable of making a
point contact without interfering with the contact motions. Although many types
of sensors are available on the market, none of these can measure the required
parameters in situ. Phase I will develop a novel non-invasive sensor capable of
withstanding these temperature and pressure extremes while delivering accurate
real-time data. Phase II would concentrate on the optimization of structure-
property-performance of this sensor and fabrication of a production prototype
that can be used in a wide variety of applications. Stress and strain sensors
have a multitude of commercial applications. Some of them include use in
automobile and industrial gears, monitoring cutting forces in cutting and
machine tools, smart sensors for aircraft engines and power generator turbines,
smart sensors for in-situ monitoring of lubrication needs to extend life of
automotive engines and associated components, and in analytical instrumentation
in research laboratories.
