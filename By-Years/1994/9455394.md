Paul, MN 551051750 Course and Curriculum Chemistry Title: Improving Student
Instrumentation Skills With Pre- and Post- lab Computer Simulations Proper use
of instruments is integral to the physical and life sciences, yet many students
never become confident or even comfortable operators because of limits on
laboratory time and instrument availability. To introduce principles and
procedures before laboratory exercises and to reinforce key experimental ideas
after laboratories, a series of interactive computer simulations of laboratory
devices and accompanying text materials will be developed. These simulations
allow students to explore instrument concepts at their own pace, alone or in
groups. Using an icon-based simulation engine/environment which embodies a block
diagram approach, realistic and sophisticated simulations (with on-line help,
text and graphical output, and animation) can be created much more rapidly than
those written in higher-level languages and can be easily tailored to specific
courses and audiences. The exercises promote logical thinking, active learning,
and the formulation and testing of hypotheses.
