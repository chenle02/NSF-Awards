Many emerging quantum information technologies require access to some form of
quantum entanglement in order to operate. Understanding what is needed and what
is possible to achieve with these technologies is frustrated by the large number
of types of multiparticle entanglement that could be produced. The role of
multiparticle quantum entanglement as a resource and the proliferation of
entanglement types with increasing particle numbers motivate a program of
classification. A good classification scheme provides a framework for
understanding properties of and relationships among quantum states, puts
interesting states in a context, and introduces concepts that allow explanation
and interpretation of new findings. The goal of this research is to produce such
a classification scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a
framework and a language in which to articulate the needs and resources of
quantum information processing tasks, and will therefore be of use to
researchers trying to make these tasks a reality. A second broader impact of
this project is direct influence on the scientific careers of promising young
students. Undergraduates will participate as research assistants who will carry
out computational experiments, write computer code to generate examples and test
hypotheses, and prove special cases of broad conjectures. Engagement in research
teaches the process of intellectual inquiry and discovery in a way that
classroom work alone cannot achieve. This project will strengthen the research
environment at Lebanon Valley College by supporting students in research
activities including presentations at scientific meetings and publications in
scientific journals.
