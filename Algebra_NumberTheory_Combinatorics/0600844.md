The investigator proposes to explore in depth questions about the behaviour of
the reductions modulo primes of abelian varieties and Drinfeld modules by means
of analytic methods. Her motivation comes from conjectures formulated by S. Lang
and H. Trotter (in the context of elliptic curves) in 1976, which, in turn, are
related to classical open questions about prime numbers. The investigator's main
research projects turn out to be related to a number of central problems in
arithmetic geometry and analytic number theory. A coherent formulation of the
main questions emerging from these projects, together with approaches and
results towards their resolution, will contribute to the advancement of higher-
dimensional analytic methods and their impact on arithmetic geometry.

This is research in the field of number theory. The central objects of study in
number theory are, basically, prime numbers and Diophantine equations. The
research done under this award concerns properties of prime numbers with
additional interesting properties coming from geometric contexts. Apart from the
intrinsic interest in these objects, their study has become even more appealing
over the past years thanks to practical implications for cryptography and coding
theory.
