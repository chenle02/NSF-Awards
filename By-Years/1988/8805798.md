The purpose of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers from a
variety of different disciplines (including computer science, economics and
organization theory) that can contribute to the creation of "coordination
theory"--a body of principles about how to coordinate the activities of separate
actors. One of the intriguing aspects of this interdisciplinary approach is the
possibility of exploiting parallels between: (a)coordinating groups of people;
(b) coordinating groups of computer processors or program modules, and: (c)
coordinating hybrid groups that include both people and computers. The primary
activity at this workshop is to explore these issues in more depth, focussing on
specific research papers. The workshop will be held February 17-19, 1988 at
MIT's Endicott House conference center in Dedham, Massachusetts. A major outcome
of the workshop is expected to be an agenda for research and possible funding
for this new area.
