Life-cycle engineering design addresses not only the functional requirement of
a product, but its life-cycle values such as manufacturability, serviceability,
reliability, and recyclability. The goal is to establish a systematic
methodology to maximize the users' life-cycle values and minimize cost at the
early stages of design. This research will allow a long range development of
broad and fundamental techniques and methods to support life-cycle design. These
methods and techniques will be developed/verified through examples provided by
industry projects.
