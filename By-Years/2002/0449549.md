This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Bert Chandler at Trinity University to
prepare supported bimetallic nanoparticles using dendrimer mediated encapsulated
synthetic techniques to control the particle size and composition. Fundamental
studies of metal nanoparticle compositions that are relevant to catalysis and
hydrogen energy systems will be undertaken. Polyamidoamine dendrimers will be
used to template and stabilize nanoparticles in solution. Dendrimer encapsulated
nanoparticles will be prepared by a two step chemical reduction process in order
to control nanoparticle composition. Catalytic activity will be used as a method
to probe the surface properties of the bimetallic nanoparticles. Undergraduate
students will be integrated into the research project and will help develop
instructional plans for related laboratory experiments. Exposure of students to
nanotechnology and heterogeneous catalysis early in their chemical training will
have a positive effect on workforce preparation.

Research in bimetallic nanoparticles contributes to the technology base for
industrial processes using heterogeneous catalysts. This project moves from
sophisticated dendrimer synthesis with macromolecular building blocks to the
control of metal particle distribution in derived nanoparticles.
