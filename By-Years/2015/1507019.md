In the general area of probability theory, an increasingly important role has
been played in recent years by systems in which random effects are observed in
the spatial structure rather than in (or in addition to) the behavior as a
function of time (as in models of equity prices). Some of these models, such as
percolation, have arisen separately in multiple contexts, such as fluid flow in
porous media (which is relevant for example to modelling of pollutant dispersion
in aquifers), polymer structure, and other parts of materials science. There are
also connections to combinatorial optimization (as in the minimal spanning tree
problem, which is a variant of the classical travelling salesman problem of
designing optimal routings) and thus to various parts of theoretical computer
science. This research project concerns the mathematical phenomena that occur in
several representative examples of such stochastic systems with interesting
spatial structure. One particular issue of study in the spanning tree problem is
when an optimal route can go very far away from its starting and ending points
-- a phenomenon known to experienced air travelers who want to optimize ticket
price.

The work under this grant is in the general area of probability theory, with
special emphasis on a number of stochastic models with interesting spatial
structure. One specific topic is first-passage percolation based on
d-dimensional Poisson point processes, with particular emphasis on nonexistence
of doubly infinite geodesics. A second focus is on the classic problem of
proving absence of an infinite cluster for intermediate dimensional critical
Bernoulli percolation; a related problem concerns the number of trees in the
minimal spanning forest and its dependence on spatial dimension. A third part of
the project is to prove exponential decay of correlations in the recently
constructed near-critical scaling limit of the two-dimensional Ising model.
Finally, a fourth topic is the construction of scaling limits of voter model
variants such as the q-state Potts model (in one space dimension) by using
marked special space-time points of the Brownian web and net.
