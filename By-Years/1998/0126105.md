Physics (13) The Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy has added a laboratory
component to its Modern Physics course and moved some experiments from the
Experimental Physics Laboratory course to the&lt;br/&gt;Modern Physics course. A
capstone research project has also been added for senior physics
majors.&lt;br/&gt;As part of these course modifications, the department is
adding high-energy&lt;br/&gt;electron diffraction (RHEED) equipment to be used
by undergraduate students in a wide variety of&lt;br/&gt;experiments.
Experiments adapt and draw from undergraduate labs on diffraction and on
research techniques using RHEED to make measurements on
materials.&lt;br/&gt;Students who work with the electron diffraction equipment
&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate for themselves the wave-like behavior of electrons and
also gain valuable hands-on&lt;br/&gt;experience using particles as a probe of
the structure of matter. Other more advanced topics that are &lt;br/&gt;covered
include the concepts of diffraction and reciprocal space, surface symmetry and
order,&lt;br/&gt;and structural differences between amorphous and crystalline
solids.&lt;br/&gt;The diffraction equipment complement the real space imaging
capabilities of two&lt;br/&gt;scanning probe microscopes already owned by the
department. Together the electron diffraction&lt;br/&gt;and scanning probe
microscopy experiments make a powerful combination that enable
&lt;br/&gt;students to gain a deeper understanding of important fundamental
physical ideas like diffraction,&lt;br/&gt;tunneling, and the wave-like nature
of matter. Laboratory manuals and supporting materials&lt;br/&gt;developed under
this project are shared at regional meetings of the AAPT in addition to
being&lt;br/&gt;posted on web sites. Results stemming from undergraduate
research is published&lt;br/&gt;separately in appropriate peer-reviewed journals
and presented at scientific meetings.
