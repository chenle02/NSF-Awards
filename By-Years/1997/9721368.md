Compilers today are severely limited because they are static, basic optimization
decisions solely on knowledge provable at compile time. In particular, compilers
produce only a single optimized version of a computation. Thus, each
optimization is performed conservatively- i.e., only when it is guaranteed to be
safe (and expected to be profitable) for all possible inputs and control flow
paths taken through a program. This project will develop a new, more dynamic
model of optimization called predicated optimization, whereby the compiler
strategically transforms some code segments optimistically, producing multiple
versions of a computation with each version's execution guarded by a run-time
test guaranteeing safety (or suggesting profitability) of the optimizations
applied. Predicated optimization offers several advantages: (1) it can enable
optimizations only valid for some inputs to a program; (2) it can enable
optimizations valid for all inputs, but where compile-time analysis to prove
safety is infeasible; (3) it can enable optimizations only valid for certain
control flow paths taken through a program; and, (4) it can determine
profitability of an optimization that either depends on values from the run-time
environment or is too complex to access statically. This project will develop a
general approach to predicated optimization and apply this approach to improve
the effectiveness of automatic parallelization.
