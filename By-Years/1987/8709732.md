Plasmas are extremely rich in the physics they exhibit due to collective
motions associated with the long range of the electric and magnetic forces
between their particles. In addition the motions are often nonlinear and
turbulent making analytic treatment of their behavior of limited use. Computer
modeling of plasmas has proved itself a powerful tool for studying and
understanding the physics of plasmas. This program is aimed at the development
of computer codes to accurately model plasmas and to their application in
understanding the physics observed in natural plasmas (ionospheric, space and
astrophysical plasmas) and in man-made plasmas (laboratory plasmas and plasmas
in various applications as accelerators, radiation sources, fusion devices,
etc.).
