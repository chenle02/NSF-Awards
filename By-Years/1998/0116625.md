The Principal Investigators will acquire dedicated instrumentation for
computational research in structural biology, material science, and
environmental/marine sciences. The investigators also lead the undergraduate
&amp; graduate computational science curricula at UNC-Chapel Hill, which will
benefit from the proposed instrumentation. The proposed equipment includes
clusters of linux workstations, two 16-processor beowulf-class machines for
parallel programming development and education, and a next generation mid-sized
shared memory machine|a 48 processor SGI Origin 3000. These three components
will be integrated using campus optical fiber, and shared file and processing
systems, with consistent configuration and portability across the six
departments (Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Sciences and
Engineering, Marine Science, Mathematics, Statistics) and the Institute for
Marine Sciences (IMS). High-end production work will continue to be accomplished
at the nearby North Carolina Supercomputing Center, which include a tera op IBM
SP system with 180 nodes and 720 processors. The proposed instrumentation, along
with the NCSC facility, will yield a high-performance computational environment
for the interdisciplinary computational science research and education program
at UNC-CH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
