9452148 Narten This project aims to improve the productivity of computer science
programmers and improve the quality of the software they produce. We are
creating a computer laboratory in which closed laboratory sessions teach
students how to use flexible, general-purpose tools. Instead of focusing on
specialized tools (e.g., CASE tools for software engineering), we examine tools
useful in a wide variety of contexts, including the emacs text editor, make,
awk, the command shell, and multiple windows. Using and studying powerful tools
make students more productive software developers and allow them the benefits of
making software adaptable, customizable, and reusable. Weekly laboratory
sessions will be added to the three freshman and sophomore introductory computer
science courses required of all CS majors and minors. In conjunction With the
lab, we refocus the emphasis in grading student programming assignments to
provide students with more detailed feedback on the design and structure of
their programs. Our goal is to teach students good programming techniques at the
time they are first learning how to program and are picking up programming
habits that they carry with them throughout their careers. The novel ideas in
this proposal include having all freshman CS students learn and use general
tools starting with their first course, reinforcing the use of those tools in
the three consecutive courses required of all CS majors, and having students
revise and resubmit the programs they submit for credit.
