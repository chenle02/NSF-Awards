The advent of new sensing and tracking technologies and expansive use of social
networks detailing every walk of life have generated enormous new datasets. The
difficulty in dealing with new datasets arises from not only the sheer volume
but also the speed required for the analysis and the complex and heterogeneous
nature of the data. Underlying these challenges is the need for suitable
representations of the data that facilitate efficient computation and are
sufficiently compact for storage and communication. This project aims to address
fundamental gaps in our understanding of these representations (so-called
sketches) and develops both new data representations and new algorithms for
massive datasets in a holistic fashion. The project builds on techniques from a
wide variety of areas including mathematical analysis, information theory,
coding theory, combinatorics, and optimization, and enriches the deep
connections among them. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained and
equipped with technical tools to work in these areas. The PI and the students
involved in the project will also distill new findings into general audience
surveys and give talks at workshops in different technical areas for broadest
possible dissemination of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
study sketching algorithms by focusing on three main thrusts:(a) Study time
complexity of sketches in streaming algorithms in both upper and lower
bounds.(b) Develop new forms of sketches for distributed environments. The
project focuses on sketching for submodular functions, a popular model for
machine learning, computer vision, economics, etc. Problems in these
applications are modeled as submodular maximization subject to various types of
constraints. (c) Study space complexity of linear sketches in sparse recovery
with respect to different recovery guarantees.
