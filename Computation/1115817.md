This project involves the development of advanced computational methods for
solving genuine nonlinear eigenvalue problems. In this project, skillful
combination of Kublanovskaya's nonlinear QR algorithm with modern rank-revealing
and structure-preserving techniques for small and medium size dense problems
enhances the capabilities of new methods. A novel trimmed linearization via Pade
rational approximation extends the enhancements for solving large but sparse
problems. The investigators seek to develop a systematic and unified treatment
of the relevant mathematical theory, and produce numerical methods and software
tools for the genuine nonlinear eigenvalue problems. In addition to advancing
research in nonlinear eigenvalue problems, the project provides training for
graduate students in computational mathematics and interdisciplinary research
tools.

Eigenvalue problems are ubiquitous in computational science and engineering,
where they arise in the study of dynamics of structures, simulation of
nanostructured photovoltaic conversion materials to advance energy science, and
many other scenarios. Eigenvalues explain a wide range of physical phenomena
such as vibrations and frequencies, (in)stabilities of dynamical systems, and
energy excitation states of electrons and molecules. Many eigenvalue problems
occur naturally in nonlinear form. In this project, the investigators study the
underlying nonlinear problems without relying on linearization approximations.
The promise of substantially improved methods for computing solutions of
nonlinear eigenvalue problems, brings immediate benefits to a wide range of
practical applications.
