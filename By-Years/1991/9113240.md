The PI plans to extend an existing wintertime database of physical and chemical
properties of cloud droplet populations at Storm Peak Laboratory Specifically,
data will be collected far a two week period during December - January of 1991 -
1992 and 1992 - 1993, cloud droplet populations will be classified as maritime,
continental, or "mixed" using concentration and diameter as criteria, back
trajectories will be computed to determine the geographic location of SPL air
parcels 48 hours prior to cloud sampling, and cloud water chemical analysis will
be used to distinguish between droplet populations primarily formed on marine
sulfate, crustal sulfate, or pollution sulfate. Additionally, complimentary
aerosol measurements will be taken in clear conditions, and a 1 - D adiabatic
cloud model will be used to determine a probable original CCN spectrum. Trends
in total droplet concentration and mean diameter will also be determined using
existing data with data collected as part of the proposed research.
