The goal of this project is to provide a modular flexible manufacturing system
for teaching instrumentation fundamentals at the undergraduate technology level.
The project provides students with access to modern automated instrumentation
and control schemes and "hands-on" experience with controllers, sensors,
adaptive control concepts, integrated computer controls, real-time control, and
demonstrates the advantages of multitasking. The experience gained through this
laboratory allows Mechanical Engineering Technology graduates to make an
immediate contribution to the manufacturing industry. The award is being matched
by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
