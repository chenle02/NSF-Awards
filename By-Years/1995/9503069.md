9503069 Hain Hain intends to continue his study of the topology of moduli spaces
of curves using Hodge theory. In particular, he is very interested in computing
the second homology of the Torelli group, and understanding the subgroup of the
Torelli group, which is the kernel of the Johnson homomorphism. With Jun Yang,
he intends to try to construct a locally integrable cocycle on GL_4(C), using
the fourth classical polylogarithm, which represents the fourth Borel regulator.
Finally, he intends to extend certain constructions in the theory of Vassiliev
invariants from genus 0 to positive genus. Symmetry is an important and central
theme in twentieth century mathematics. One of the most natural sets of
symmetries is the set of symmeteries of the surface of a donut with g holes.
Although such groups of symmeteries have been studied for almost 100 years,
there are a large number of central unresolved problems. Hain intends to work on
several of these during the next three years. His results have potential
applications to modern particle physics and to certain branches of number theory
and algebraic geometry, the study of solutions of polynomial equations. Hain has
a second major project. This is the study of classical polylogarithms. These
functions were defined 200 years ago by Spence, an English mathematician, and
are generalizations of the well-known logarithm function so important throughout
the sciences and economics. Polylogarithms have started to appear recently in
physics and number theory. It is important to establish their basic properties.
