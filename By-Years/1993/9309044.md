9309044 Paris The Principal Investigator is addressing the estimation of the
most likely state sequence of a discrete-time finite-state Markov process with
unknown parameters observed in independent noise. A maximum likelihood criterion
over both the input sequence and the parameters is introduced for estimating the
state sequence without using an embedded training sequence. Asymptotically, this
estimator is expected to be close to the maximum-likelihood sequence estimator
with completely known parameters. To facilitate the search for the most likely
state sequence, the investigator is introducing computationally simple
algorithms which are guaranteed to converge. Besides developing the underlying
theory and algorithms, the research is focussing on applications to digital
mobile radio communication systems. The award provides support for three years.
