In her thesis, the PI pioneered the study of the dynamics of rational maps
having a nontrivial automorphism, that is maps for which conjugating by some
nontrivial linear fractional transformation preserves not just the dynamics of
the map but the map itself (its coefficients when written as a rational
function, say). Since most rational maps have no automorphisms, this might be
considered a dynamical version of complex multiplication. The intellectual merit
of the proposed project lies in the PI's plan to create a theory of dynamical
complex multiplication, with the goal of developing enough machinery that a
proof of a Conjecture of Morton and Silverman for this family of maps is within
reach.

Broader impacts of the work emerge from education and outreach activities, with
a focus on gender equity issues and supporting women in research mathematics.
Proposed activities include: (1) mentoring women in mathematics at the
University of Hawaii and thus broadening participation of underrepresented
groups; (2) establishing the Math Teachers' Circle of Hawaii; and (3) continuing
the University of Hawaii Mathematics Department's Distinguished Lecture Series.
