This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award project is in the
general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the subfield of
nonlinear reaction processes. During the twelve month period beginning 1 July
1988, Professor Larter will carry out research in the area of nonlinear
dynamics, specifically a theoretical investigation into the oscillatory behavior
of the peroxidase-oxidase reaction to determine if that system exhibits
dynamical instability known as chemical chaos and, if so, to define the
conditions under which this phenomenon is observed. By analyzing the complex
oscillatory behavior of the peroxidase- oxidase reaction, Dr. Larter will seek
to discover not only the origin of chaotic behavior in that particular system
but also a general understanding of chaos in chemical oscillators. This Career
Advancement Award will enable Dr. Larter to broaden her research activities and
to establish a viable, independent investigative program that addresses the
impact of spatial nonuniformities on chemical processes. The results of this
research should be broadly important in the chemical sciences and could also
find application in a number of other fields including solid state physics,
meteorology, and even economics.
