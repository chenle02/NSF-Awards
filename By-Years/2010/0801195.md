The problems to be investigated are in the area of the theory of Lie groups and
their discrete subgroups. One of the main objectives is to continue the program
of establishing a homogeneous space approach as a powerful tool in number
theory. Special attention will be given to the problem of "effectivization" in
Oppenheim conjecture and its quantitative generalizations. It is also proposed
to continue to study recurrence properties of random walks on Lie groups and
their discrete subgroups on homogeneous spaces, manifolds and general metric
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of Lie groups and their discrete
subgroups is one of the central fields in mathematics. During the last few
decades, it was realized that some aspects of the theory can be applied to solve
certain problems in number theory and related topics, which could not be tackled
by other methods. This proposal is related to rigidity theory that studies
phenomena when rather weak data about geometric and mathematical objects
determines completely or almost completely the structure of those objects.
