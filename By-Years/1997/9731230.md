9731230 Thompson This work consists of a coordinated experimental and
theoretical investigation of the shaping of microscopic and macroscopic noise in
spontaneously initiated Stokes Raman Scattering in optical fibers. A major focus
of the investigation will be the interplay of quantum initiation noise and
amplified pump noise that arises in higher-order Stokes generation. A strong
coupling between the experimental and theoretical work will provide insight into
how macroscopic and microscopic noise sources act together to determine the
statistical properties of the output of a nonlinear optical system.
