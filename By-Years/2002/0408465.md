Chuang-kang Shih (9985041)

This project, a five year CAREER grant, involves the training, research and
educational activities of a junior PI from the University of Illinois. Dr. Shih
will receive training an anthropological demography at the University of
California, Berkeley, as well as in mathematics and statistics at UIUC, and will
then undertake a research project on the Moso, a duolocal matrilineal group in
southwest China. The Moso are demographically interesting because the live in
matrilineal households that do not contain any conjugal subunits. The Moso have
maintained extremely low fertility rates, appearing to contradict the
demographic transition theory that contends that "traditional" populations
experience high fertility, which then declines with modernization. The research
will serve as a test of that theory and will involve a comparative study of
family systems and their demographic implications of the Moso as well as three
other (culturally different) ethnic groups that live in the Moso area. During
the research component, Dr. Shih will train both undergraduate and graduate
students in anthropological and demographic methods.
