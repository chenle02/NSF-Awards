ATM 95-28201 ABSTRACT ALAN ROBOCK UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND TITLE: "CLIMATE EFFECTS
OF VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS" This is a three year grant to investigate the global
climate effects of volcanic eruptions with the help of the best data that are
available and state of the art modeling. Some of the tasks to be accomplished
are 1) Building the data base using direct observations of recent eruptions and
indirect observations like ice core records of the past eruptions, 2) simulation
of climate effects with state of the art models. Volcanic effects are important
forcings of global climate change. This project strives to give quantitative
estimate of the volcanic eruptions effect.
