The objective of this workshop is to convene multi-disciplinary experts from
utilities, private industry, academia, non-profits, and federal transportation,
environmental and public health authorities to systematically address the
interconnections between sub-systems of the Urban Infrastructure Grid and to
identify potential pathways for cascading catastrophic failures and their
impacts beyond the Grid. The group will develop a vision and roadmap towards a
systems-based framework that can support standardized and integrated monitoring,
analysis, control and management of the Urban Infrastructure Grid, and outline
application case studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is targeted to
advance a clearer understanding of the complexity of urban infrastructure
systems and develop a vision and a roadmap towards their sustainable management
for improved environmental sustainability and human health. A spectrum of
dissemination strategies will continue the conversation in the community,
seeking to excite interest in participation in potential case studies, and
produce scalable, actionable information for stakeholders globally. Two
workshop-related sessions will be organized around this topic: the first at the
Annual Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in December of 2019; and
the second at the American Water Resources Association's 2020 Spring Specialty
Workshop titled AWRA Geospatial Water Technology Workshop: Complex systems.
