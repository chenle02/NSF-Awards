This award is in support of a workshop being held to bring together all
investigators with seismic-reflection data (all types) and drill core data from
the Antarctic continental margin. The purpose is to study global processes (e.g.
changes in sea level, Antarctic glaciation, bottom-water currents, etc.) that
are recorded in offshore Cenozoic sedimentary sequences proximal to Antarctica.
The workshop is also intended to promote international cooperation in this and
future offshore seismic studies, and to identify critical areas for offshore
geologic sampling.
