Research will concentrate on the synthesis of data from continent-continent
collision zones, specifically the Swiss Alps and the Norwegian Caledonides. This
will be based on the opportunity to compare these orogenic belts at different
levels of exposure. This work will be carried out by the PIs, two graduate
students, and two people each from the University of Bergen, ETH-Zurich, and one
from the University of Bern. Interpretation will include both vertical-incidence
and wide- angle reflection data and will start with analysis of recording and
processing effects on the data. Final interpretation will be based on a
combination of migration and 2-D and 3-D modeling. Wide-angle data will be
inverted for 1-D and 2-D velocity structure, and this will be a major aspect of
the interpretation.
