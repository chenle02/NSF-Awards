Research in elementary particle physics will include studies of several aspects
of quantum field theory in 3 + 1 dimensional space-time, especially theories
with a supersymmetry between boson and fermion constituents of matter.
Properties of the superconformal algebra and its central charges, possible
c-theorems, chiral anomalies, and the non-perturbative structure of
supersymmetric theories will be studied. The viewpoint to be taken emphasizes
the role of space-time correlation functions. Quantum field theory is the major
theoretical framework for the interpretation of experiments in elementary
particle physics, and supersymmetry is widely considered necessary to extend our
understanding beyond the level of today's standard model. The problems to be
studied relate both to fundamental and phenomenological aspects of the subject.
