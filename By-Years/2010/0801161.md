Engineering - Materials Science (57)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
developing Smart Vibration Platforms (SVP) for distribution and utilization at
several diverse types of institutions and undergraduate degree programs. The SVP
is being utilized to teach mechanical engineering dynamics concepts such as
damping and structural vibration controls. The "Smart" part of the platform is
based on the utilization of two smart materials: a shape memory alloy, which
changes stiffness with temperature, and a magneto-rheological fluid, which
provides adjustable damping based on use of an
electromagnet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SVP is a creative and easy to use
device, and is advancing student knowledge and understanding by helping students
experiment with smart materials, vibrations, and controls. This project is
developing and deploying SVPs at six different institutions and extending its
implementation to civil, electrical, and materials engineering as well as
engineering technology courses. Using the SVP as a tool, the PIs are creating
innovative teaching materials, including demonstrations, hands-on experiments,
course modules, and new courses.
