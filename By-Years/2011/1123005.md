This award will partially support a three-day meeting of U.S. principal
investigators funded to conduct ocean acidification research. It is designed to
build capacity within the ocean acidification research community, to advance
scientific research on ocean acidification as efficiently as possible, and to
clarify the scientific frontiers within ocean acidification research. The
invitees include approximately 20% early-career scientists and 30% women. The
specific goals of the meeting are (1) Strengthen scientific collaborations and
minimize duplication of efforts; (2) Build capacity for improving ocean
acidification research; (3) Identify short- and long-term research goals; (4)
Promote effective data management; (5) Enhance communication with the public;
and (6) Solicit feedback from the scientific community to guide future
activities. The meeting includes a mix of plenary talks reviewing state-of-the-
art knowledge on 5 themes of ocean acidification research; synthesis
presentations and panel discussions considering how present research efforts fit
together; breakout sessions discussing overarching challenges in ocean
acidification research; poster sessions; and plenary discussions concerning
future directions in ocean acidification research.
