The Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
is requesting funds for the purchase of picosecond laser equipment and ancillary
electronic and optical devices. These acquisitions will supplememt present
research capabilities for a multiplicity of programs requiring picosecond time
resolution, for example, transient absorption, dynamics of photo-driven events
and characterization of nonlinear optical properties of materials. Included in
the research proposed with this equipment are: 1) Light induced electron and
energy transfer in transition metal complexes. 2) Directed electron and energy
transfer in peptide assemblies. 3) Electron transfer rates in polymeric
solvents: slow solvent dipoles. 4) Glasses of polymeric layered ultra-structure
for optimum nonlinear optical responses. 5) Characterization of short-lived
unsaturated organometallic complexes using transient absorption spectroscopy. 6)
Multiphoton ionizationn via short lived Rydberg states and real time dynamics in
weakly bound complexes. The system will be available to all members of the UNC
scientific community. The instruments requested will all be conjoined with
picosecond equipment assembled in the Department's Laser Laboratory, a multiuser
facility operating since 1975. %%% Picosecond laser spectroscopy is a method for
studying the very rapid ( 1/1,000,000,000,000 of a second) molecular processes
that occur in chemical reactions and chemical dynamics. Such studies give one
accurate information about the step-by-step details of how a chemical reaction
proceeds and often give information about how a chemical process can be altered
in order to give different products or make a given process more efficient.
