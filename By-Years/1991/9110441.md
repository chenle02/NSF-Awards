This research is on modeling faulty neural networks using a fault polynomial
representation to facilitate the creation of a Markov model. The initial method
has the capability of analyzing neural networks with about twelve neurons. This
research extends the technique to allow the analysis of a neural network with
several hundred neurons. Other related research objectives include studying
different fault models, fault analysis accuracy, related disciplines for
analysis techniques, dynamic behavior measurements, other neuron models,
learning, and different neural network architectures. Digital computer
techniques are used to compute and verify the results. This research allows the
faulty behavior of neural networks to be analyzed. It provides a motivation for
implementing neural networks with a large numbers of neurons. It also models
some aspects of the dynamic behavior of such neural networks.
