The dynamics of the landward intrusion of the Kuroshio current into the East
China sea and the lateral mixing induced by such intrusion will be studied with
a high-resolution regional ocean circulation primitive equation model. The
specification of the open boundary conditions and the treatement of the steep
coastal topography are the major challenges of this study.
