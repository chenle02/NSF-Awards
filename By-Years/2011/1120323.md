Hydrolyzable tannins are a group of plant polyphenolic compounds that act as
chemical defenses against microbes, insects and vertebrate herbivores.
Hydrolyzable tannins also impact soil nutrient dynamics and affect the
germination, growth and development of other plant species. Besides imparting
astringent taste sensations, hydrolyzable tannins also enhance the nutritional
quality of plant foods due to their antioxidant, anticancer and cardioprotective
activities. Despite these important functions that hydrolyzable tannins play in
plants and humans, large and significant gaps remain in our understanding of the
molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying hydrolyzable tannin biosynthesis
in plants. This project will investigate the key enzymatic steps leading to
hydrolyzable tannin biosynthesis using strawberry and pomegranate as model
systems. Cloning of hydrolyzable tannin biosynthetic genes will facilitate
modification of plant composition for improved protein utilization in forage
crops. Underpinning hydrolyzable tannin biogenesis will also broaden our
understanding of plant defense mechanisms, as well as plant-soil and plant-plant
(allelopathic) interactions.

Broader Impacts In addition to the scientific impacts, various aspects of the
research will be used to provide multidisciplinary training opportunities,
encompassing molecular biology, biochemistry, and cell biology, to high school,
undergraduate, and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars. The educational
activities at the undergraduate level will be focused on three areas: providing
research opportunities to new UC Davis transfer students, promoting career
access among women and underrepresented minority students, and retaining
students from low-income families. Another major focus of the educational
activities is to prepare graduate students and postdoctoral scholars for their
future independent careers in science. An outreach program is currently being
developed to expose high school students to research activities and
biotechnological applications through internships in the PI's laboratory.
