Study of the processes by which surface carbon is transported into the deep
Earth is key to understanding modern volatiles recycling and longer-term Earth
degassing and atmosphere evolution. Although subduction is considered the
primary means by which carbon is returned to the mantle, little is known
regarding the efficiency of this process and the chemical forms of this deeply
subducted carbon (presumably as carbonate and as reduced carbon, the latter
representing organic matter). Through geologic time, changes in the return of
deeply subducted carbon to the atmosphere, via volcanic eruptions, could have
led to significant change in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere and
thus change in global surface temperatures. Anthropogenic (human) carbon dioxide
additions to the atmosphere, largely due to burning of fossil fuels, are
superimposed on these longer-timeframe, "natural" variations in atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentration related in part to subduction zone inputs and
volcanic outputs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine the subduction
pathway for carbon via field studies of high- and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic
rocks, providing valuable field-based "ground truthing" of recent theoretical
and experimental studies of carbon cycling. This study will represent a first
step in more fully characterizing the forearc-to-subarc metamorphic carbon flux
in key lithologies (sedimentary, mafic, and ultramafic rocks) thought to convey
carbon to depths beneath volcanic fronts and greater. Work will mostly be
concentrated on localities in the French and Italian Alps allowing examination
of ophiolitic rocks and related seafloor sediments metamorphosed over a wide
range of high-pressure (HP)/ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) conditions. For each
lithology and locality, field observations, petrologic study, and stable isotope
analyses will focus on identifying any decarbonation that was experienced,
relating these observations from study of the rocks with theoretical assessments
of devolatilization history.
