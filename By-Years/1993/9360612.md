9360612 LaConti This is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation
Research Solicitation. A low-cost, efficient, stable composite steel anode
structure is explored that should be especially useful in synthetic
electroorganic processes where system selectivity is a major concern and anode
deterioration affects product quality and yield. A composite electrode structure
consisting of an impervious and stable base-metal oxide coating on steel should
be very stable and should also have enhanced electrocatalytic activity for
oxygen evolution. In this effort, selections of materials and deposition
parameters for the composite anode are addressed. In the commercial
electrohydrodimerization process for production of adiponitrile (precursor to
nylon), corrosion of the presently used mild steel anodes results in unwanted
side products and parasitic hydrogen production at the cathode, thus decreasing
yield and increasing power consumption. This product is designed to correct this
deficiency. It should also be applicable in other electrochemical organic
syntheses.
