This proposal will exploit a capability never before available in astronomy: a
pair of robotic spectrographs on 2m telescopes specifically designed to study
supernovae, capable of routinely observing targets within minutes to hours of
discovery. The average lag between discovery and spectroscopic typing for
supernovae is a week to 10 days, making their early behavior largely a mystery.
FLOYDS will reduce this lag by an order of magnitude and make some currently
exotic probes of supernova progenitors routine. The core effort is to (1)
determine an immediate spectroscopic type and redshift of every new supernova
discovered with a nondetection within the past week, and (2) obtain high signal-
to-noise spectra of supernovae every few days for a subset of the most
interesting 150 (100 SNe Ia / 50 core-collapse) targets. With this data we will
statistically limit the progenitor channels of SNe Ia but studying unburned
material, study shock breakout in core-collapse supernovae, and target faint-
fast transients whose origin remains
unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire supernova community will
benefit from this proposal, as all supernovae with a nondetection within a week
will be typed within a day or two, and the redshifts and types will be announced
immediately for public SNe. This will allow earlier lightcurves, spectra, and
follow-up from the X-ray to the IR. Most spectra will be made public after one
year, but some data will be made public immediately. We will advertise the more
photogenic supernovae to our schools program to encourage students to image the
supernovae with the LCOGT network (providing real science data), and we will
provide associated curricula and textbook materials through SpaceBook, the
online textbook at LCOGT.net. LCOGT software and telescope and instrument plans
will be made public.
