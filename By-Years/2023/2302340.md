This award supports three Southeastern Number Theory Meetings. In mid-September
of 2023, the first meeting will take place at Wofford College in Spartanburg,
SC. Clemson University in Clemson, SC, will host the second meeting on the first
weekend of December 2023. The third meeting is planned for April 2024, at the
Armstrong Campus of Georgia Southern University. The meetings consist of
participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including
analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms.
The topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the
Southeast. Each meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally
recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by
mathematicians at all levels, including undergraduate and graduate students, and
junior and senior faculty. Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give
the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the
contributed talks.

A primary goal of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is to provide members
of the number theory community in the Southeast with an opportunity to learn
about new and significant research in number theory and to disseminate their own
research. Students and early-career researchers in the community particularly
benefit from the meetings. The meetings strengthen their knowledge base, expose
their work to a wider audience, and give them insightful input and feedback from
other participants. Funding from the NSF allows the organizers to achieve their
goals at a low cost to individual participants. These meetings integrate
regional mathematicians who may have little or no funds for professional travel
into the research community. The organizers will continue efforts to attract a
demographically diverse participant base, including women and racial and ethnic
minorities. Further information on these meetings including the locations,
dates, lists of speakers, lists of participants, and registration information
will be linked to the conference home pages as it becomes available:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
