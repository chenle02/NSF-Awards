The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to rapidly screen for binocular vision
disorders that impact over 20% of the general population. Unlike simple vision
problems that can be corrected for with glasses, binocular vision disorders take
longer to treat, and are typically underdiagnosed. Childhood diagnosis of these
vision disorders is correlated with attention disorders and poor performance in
school, so early detection and treatment is vital to student success.The
proposed project advances development of a virtual reality system for diagnosis
of vision problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a virtual reality screening
platform for a variety of binocular vision disorders. It will take advantage of
eye-tracking technology to precisely measure the eye movements of the wearer in
response to specifically designed visual stimuli. Software will rapidly and
automatically quantify recorded eye movements and correlate them to real-world
values, which optometrists can use to make meaningful diagnostic decisions. The
technology described in this proposal will be tested on many users to verify its
ability to screen for a wide variety of disorders in a diverse
population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
