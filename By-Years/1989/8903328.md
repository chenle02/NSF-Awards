Primary emphasis of this mathematical work will be directed at three problem
areas: nonlinear transport equations, regularity theory in the calculus of
variations, and geometric properties for motion hypersurfaces by mean curvature.
All, in one way or another, are concerned with nonlinear problems in analysis.
Nonlinear transport is modeled by relatively simple partial differential
equations (e.g. scalar conservation laws or the porous medium equation). The
goal here is to use the newer concept of viscosity solution and expand its role
from spaces metrized by maximum norms to the Lebesgue space of integrable
functions, in an effort to understand solutions. The key is the introduction of
weak solutions of differential operators satisfying an accretive condition, with
the expectation that an interpretation of non-smooth solutions will result. A
long-term goal of this work is that of analyzing the hydrodynamical limit of
stochastic interacting particle systems. A second line of research concerns the
question of partial regularity for vector-valued problems in the calculus of
variations - in particular, for problems of nonlinear elasticity. The basic
issue here is that of performing variations within the constraint which requires
that the determinant of the differential be positive. Work will proceed first
with more tractable questions involving minimizers of convex integrands for
mappings between manifolds. Considerable activity is presently under way
investigating geometric problems of motion by mean curvature. The associated
partial differential equations, which give the motion of level sets (of a
manifold) moving normally at a velocity proportional to the mean curvature, may
have solutions with singularities. The first concern of this work will be to
show that the level sets are smooth except possibly for negligible singular
sets.
