With the tremendous growth of sensitive and security-critical processing on
embedded and pervasive platforms, the threat model for secure electronics is
expanding from software into hardware. A wide range of fault attacks, based on
physical manipulation of the electronics operating environment, is now available
to the adversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major outcome of this project is
FAME, a collection of hardware techniques for microprocessor architectures to
detect these fault injection attacks, and to mitigate fault analysis through an
appropriate response in software. The FAME processor is developed both as an
architecture concept as well as a chip prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FAME
processor uses fault countermeasures that combine fault detection in
microprocessor hardware with fault response in the software application. The
fault detection in hardware uses static (design-time) and dynamic (runtime)
techniques for in-situ fault detection. These fault-detecting hardware
extensions are optimized for power and cost, and they can be enabled from the
software application. This flexibility allows FAME to support non-critical
applications at full microprocessor performance, while still offering full fault
countermeasures for security-critical applications. The FAME processor chip
demonstrates these techniques, as well as novel forms of fault analysis that are
investigated in tandem with the development of FAME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
impacts of this project are safer, more trustworthy microprocessors that are
aware of their physical environment and the threats it poses to their internal
processing. Such microprocessors offer the basis for cyber-security applications
that can handle both logical as well as physical threats.
