This project will address the development of catalysts for the stereoselective
formation of C-C bonds using nitroalkanes. The ease of deprotonation adjacent to
nitroalkanes along with their facile conversion to other functionality such as
amines and ketones makes them attractive targets for reaction control.
Organocatalysts have been developed that achieve asymmetric conjugate addition
of nitroalkanes with a variety of substrates, presumably through non-covalent
stabilization of the anionic intermediates. Catalyst design continues through
investigation of additional scaffolds that are complementary to nitroalkane
structure as well as expanding the scope of applicable nitroalkanes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Professor Linton of the Department of
Chemistry at Bowdoin College. Professor Linton's research efforts revolve around
the development of molecular catalysts that control the reactions of
nitroalkanes. Since stereoselective syntheses are required for numerous
pharmaceutical and biological substrates, these catalysts have broad
applicability to a wide variety of relevant target molecules. Additionally this
approach uses environmentally friendly organocatalysts that can perform these
reactions with minimal use of reagents and minimal production of waste.
