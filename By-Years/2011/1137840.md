The objective of this project is to help support student attendance at the ACM-
SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) in Kyoto, Japan to be held on
January 17-19, 2012. SODA is the premier conference that covers research in
algorithmic aspects of combinatorics, discrete mathematics, and computer science
and their applications in the sciences and business. Research on algorithms is
one of the most important and active areas in computing. Algorithmic questions
pervade business, technology, and science and their study continues to be a
major research topic. SODA produces one of the most widely read proceedings in
algorithms.

Many of the students who have papers accepted at the conference may not be able
to obtain sufficient support from their home institutions. Attendance is
particularly valuable for students who are just starting out and are more likely
to profit from direct NSF support. By providing it, the NSF will be able to help
nurture a new generation of researchers in this key area.
