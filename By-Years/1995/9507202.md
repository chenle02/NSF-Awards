9507202 Fletcher To study the reaction mechanism which governs the 3he(d,p)4He
reaction at very low energies, we will design, construct, and test a proton
polarimeter which we will use to measure relevant polarization transfer
coefficients. The device will be designed and built at SUNY-Geneseo, and tested
using unpolarized beams from the Geneseo 2-MV Van de Graaff accelerator. The
polarization measurements will be made using the atomic beam polarized ion
source at Triangle Universities Nuclear Lab, in collaboration with researchers
from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Undergraduates students from
Geneseo will be involved in all phases of the project, from polarimeter design
to analysis of the data. The result of this project will be the first
measurements of polarization transfer in the 3He(d,p)4He reaction near the 3/2+
resonance. These data will be useful in understanding the 3He(d,p)4He reaction
and in evaluation the importance of different reaction mechanisms below the
resonance energy. ***
