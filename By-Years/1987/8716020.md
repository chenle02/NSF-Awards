The tectonic evolution of West antarctica and its relationship to East
antarctica is the most fundamental tectonic problem of the Antarctic continent.
It bears on global plate interaction, paleocirculation in the Southern Ocean,
paleoenvironment, and paleobiogeography as well as being fundamental to the
development of the continent itself. The joint United State-United Kingdom West
Antarctic Tectonics project (1983-88) has shed considerable light on the
tectonic evolution of the Weddell Sea region. A tripartite United States- New
Zealand-United Kingdom program of study in Marie Byrd Land is planned to
complete our understanding of the tectonic evolution of the southern rim of the
Pacific Ocean basin. It will involve field and laboratory investigations
designed to elucidate the structure and evolution of the Marie Byrd Land crustal
block and its relationship to other West Antarctic crustal blocks, the east
study involves structural, paleomagnetic and geochronologic investigations
bearing particularly on the pre-Cenozoic development and Marie Byrd Land.
