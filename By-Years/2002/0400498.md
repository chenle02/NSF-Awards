Many basic questions in graph and hypergraph theory can be phrased as packing
problems. We say that n-vertex graphs G_1, G_2, ... G_k pack if there is an edge
disjoint placement of all these graphs into the complete K_n graph . More
generally, n-vertex r-uniform hypergraphs pack if there exists an edge disjoint
placement ofall these graphs into the complete r-uniform hypergraph K^r_n.
Various classical combinatorial problems can be modeled as packing problems. For
example, the problem of existence of a spanning cycle in an n-vertex graph G is
the question whether the n-cycle packs with the complement G . Another example
of a packing problem is the graph coloring problem: A graph G is k-colorable if
and only if packs with a graph that is the union of k cliques. Other important
packing topics are also subgraph existence problems, Ramsey-type problems, and
Turan-type problems. In particular, we consider equitable colorings, Ramsey-type
problems, minimum size problems, graph colorings, and k-ordered Hamiltonian
graphs. Certainly, it is harder to pack dense graphs than sparse ones.
Nevertheless, many (hyper)graph packing problems remain important and
interesting for sparse (hyper)graphs. A natural measure of sparseness is the
maximum degree of a graph. Another natural measure is the maximum average degree
over all of its subgraphs. We plan to study what restrictions on sparseness of
(hyper)graphs imply that they pack. In addition to the general packing problem,
we consider packings of graphs in special families where less sparseness is
needed.
