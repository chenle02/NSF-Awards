Professor Xia proposes to continue his investigation of dynamics
of&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian systems. One of the most important problems in
Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems is whether orbits in typical systems are
stable. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will address these problems, with
research topics such as&lt;br/&gt;Aubry-Mather theory, Arnold diffusions,
chaotic behaviors and Newtonian&lt;br/&gt;$n$-body problem. The ultimate goal is
to show that typical near integrable&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonians in higher dimensions
are topologically unstable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research concerns
the stability problems in Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;dyanmics. Hamiltonian dynamical
systems model many systems arising&lt;br/&gt;from classical mechanics, celestial
mechanics and physics. These&lt;br/&gt;problems has a long history, going back
to Poincare and Birkhoff. A&lt;br/&gt;typical question one often asks is the
following: Is our solar system&lt;br/&gt;stable? One of our goals is to find an
answer to this and a large&lt;br/&gt;class of related questions. With recent
progresses in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;modern dynamical systems, we understand
much better the chaotic nature&lt;br/&gt;of typical systems. However, the
stability problem remains open except&lt;br/&gt;in some special cases and it is
one of the most important areas of&lt;br/&gt;study, from both theoretical point
of view and wide applications it&lt;br/&gt;finds in various physical
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
