The Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium commemorates the mathematical legacy
of&lt;br/&gt;Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers. The core of this legacy lies in
the&lt;br/&gt;fields of geometric function theory, Teichmuller theory,
hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, and partial differential equations. However,
their work&lt;br/&gt;has impacted and created interactions with many other
fields, such as algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, mathematical physics, dynamics,
geometric group theory,&lt;br/&gt;number theory and topology. The last several
years have been a&lt;br/&gt;period of intense activity and progress in the
field. Recent&lt;br/&gt;progress includes the solutions of Thurston's Ending
Lamination&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, the Bers-Sullivan-Thurston Density Conjecture,
and Marden's&lt;br/&gt;Tameness Conjecture, the determination of the spherical
Bloch constant,&lt;br/&gt;a proof of the conformal invariance of percolation, a
proof of the&lt;br/&gt;quasi-isometric rigidity of mapping class groups and the
discovery of&lt;br/&gt;the relationship between Weil-Petersson Geometry and the
Witten-Kontsevich&lt;br/&gt;conjecture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colloquium will
serve as a venue for the dissemination of these&lt;br/&gt;results and the
consideration of future directions in the field.&lt;br/&gt;Twelve plenary
lectures will be given by leaders in the field.&lt;br/&gt;Smaller workshops will
provide an excellent opportunity for young&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians to
disseminate their work and to interact with other&lt;br/&gt;young
mathematicians, as well as the established researchers in the field.&lt;br/&gt;
