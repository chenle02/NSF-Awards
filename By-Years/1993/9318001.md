Funds are requested for the purchase of an imaging plate area detector system in
order to measure x-ray diffraction data from biological macromolecular crystals.
This system would directly support the research of 3 major investigators and 4
minor investigators. These investigators have immediate data collection needs
for 26 different existing crystal forms of 11 proteins and complexes. Since
these crystals include protein kinases, protein phosphatases, DNA methylases,
DNA endonucleaes, a calcium binding protein involved in neurite extension, a
zinc amidohydrolase, and an enzyme involved in the control of glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis, the elucidation of these crystal structures will advance the
knowledge of the DNA methylation, protein phosphorylation, mammalian
development, control of cell growth, gene expression, and cell differentiation
and provide insights into the basic mechanism of the human afflictions of
cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Most of these crystals require the
large active area, high dynamic range and/or low noise that the imaging plate
area detector diffractometer provides, In addition, the equipment will be used
in teaching an advanced course in macromolecular crystallography offered each
October at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and in training selected
undergraduates in structural biology during the summer. The new instrument will
let us continue to give outstanding training to students in our advanced
teaching program.
