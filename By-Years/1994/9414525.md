9414525 Sehitoglu This research is primarily an experimental effort to further
the understanding of stress- and strain-induced phase transformations under high
pressures and cyclic loading in alloy steels. Pressure loading permits isolation
of hydrostatic stress and principle stress effects on transformations and
produces homogeneous stress fields allowing unambiguous interpretation of stress
and strain effects. Cyclic loading modifies the internal structure and will
generate different transformation behavior compared to unidirectional loading.
The development of constitutive models based on a verified by well characterized
experimental results is a very high priority in the Mechanics and Materials
Program. Therefore, the experimental study of phase changes contained in this
proposal is very important for establishing the data base that is required
before the foundation for a strong theoretical component can be established. The
proposed work will advance both the micro- and mechanical understanding of phase
transformations in material systems. ***
