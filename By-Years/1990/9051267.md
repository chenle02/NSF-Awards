The department is purchasing a scanning electron microscope, a critical-point
dryer and sputter-coater for SEM preparation, and a research quality multi-
functional light microscope equipped for brightfield, phase-contrast, epi-
fluorescence and DIC optics and for photomicrography. This new equipment is
being integrated with present equipment to 1. develop and upgrade hands-on
courses in light and electron microscopy, 2. improve the existing laboratories
in Developmental Biology, Cell Biology, Experimental Genetics, Recombinant DNA,
Histology, and Immunology courses, and 3. provide new equipment for
undergraduate research projects. It is expected that the experiences will
enhance the students' ability to think critically, give them opportunities to
design experiments using the modern instruments, and can stimulate students to
go on to careers in science. The university will contribute an amount equal to
the award.
