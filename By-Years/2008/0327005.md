This U.S.-Polish-Czech workshop on modeling interactions in biomolecules will
bring together students and researchers from the United States, the Czech
Republic and Poland to discuss current methods of computational chemistry and
their application to biological systems. The co-organizers of the workshop are
Dr. Jerzy Leszczynski from Jackson State University, Jaroslaw Burda from Charles
University in the Czech Republic and Waclaw Sokalski from Wroclaw University of
Technology in Poland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed meeting will focus on a
rapidly developing interdisciplinary field: molecular modeling which is the
linking of computational chemistry, molecular biology, biophysics, solid state
physics, and molecular graphics. The main objective of the meeting is to
establish an interdisciplinary forum where leading experts representing recently
emerging methodologies will meet with scientists interested in their
applications in biological and material sciences. A large group of minority
students and post-docs will be invited to makes presentations at this workshop
and the HBCU representatives will benefit from interactions with foreign
colleagues, leading to new scientific collaborations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
is a timely meeting on a rapidly progressing field of research in computational
chemistry that also contains an aspect of student training, as this is not an
area traditionally taught in the graduate school curriculum. This project also
fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S.
and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
