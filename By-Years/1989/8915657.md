This special award will give graduate student Valeria Moore additional
flexibility in pursuing her graduate studies and research initiation in
sociology. The award will permit this student to attend several national
professional meetings and to collect data relevant to her Master's Thesis
project. The subject of the latter is the classroom experiences of minority and
women faculty, particular those in which their teaching is subjected to
inappropriate challenges to their professiorial authority. This award grows out
of a special directorate level program to enhance the graduate education of
previous applicants of minority fellowship programs receiving honorable mention
ratings. This award should strengthen minority research participation in
sociology.
