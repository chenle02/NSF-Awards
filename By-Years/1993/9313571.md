The concurrent volcanic activities of Mt. Mayon and Mt. Pinatubo in the island
of Luzon, Philippines, offer a rare opportunity to compare and contrast the
petrology and mantle source signature of the East and West Philippine volcanic
arcs. Mt. Mayon belongs to the East Arc wherein volcanism is associated with the
subduction underneath Luzon of the Philippine Sea Plate with thin pelagic
sediment cover whereas Mt. Pinatubo belongs to the West Arc wherein volcanism is
the result of the eastward subduction of the South China Sea Plate with moderate
terrigenous sediment cover. We propose a combined field and laboratory
investigation of volcanic rocks from Mt. Pinatubo and Mt. Mayon. In the field,
we will map and try to collect representative samples from the oldest to the
youngest eruptive products of both volcanoes. In the lab, samples collected will
be analyzed for their petrography, mineralogy, bulk major and trace element
chemistry, and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions. The proposed investigation
is a collaborative effort among workers from the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography, United State Geological Survey and Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology.
