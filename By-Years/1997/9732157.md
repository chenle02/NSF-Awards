*** 9732157 Heller Undergraduate students studying physics will participate in a
10 week summer research experience in the School of Physics and Astronomy of the
University of Minnesota. Applications will be solicited through colleges and
universities throughout the country, with special attention given to schools
with large minority enrollment. The program coordinators will work with each
participant to select an appropriate research mentor and research project, and
will monitor the participants' progress throughout the program period.
Participants will live together in a campus dormitory. They will take part in
seminars about opportunities in the field and in round-table discussions of
their research. Several social activities will be organized, giving the
participants an opportunity to get to know one another better, and to meet
others from the other undergraduate summer research programs at the University
of Minnesota. ***
