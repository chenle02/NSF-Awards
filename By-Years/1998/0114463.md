This is a planning grant to develop a research plan to explicitly test the
comparative effectiveness of an instructional approach that teaches phoneme
manipulation versus and alternative approach emphasizing general pre-literacy
skills. The project outcomes will provide systematic experimental data
addressing the specific types of phoneme awareness instruction that could be
effective in teaching disadvantaged preschool children the reading skills that
will best prepare them for later academic success. The project will be based in
Boston Head Start programs. &lt;br/&gt;
