Most solar flares are classified as impulsive, having hard X-ray spectra that
become relatively more energetic (or 'harden') as fluxes increase, and 'soften'
as fluxes decline. Conversely, hard X-ray spectra associated with energetic
interplanetary protons progressively 'harden' as fluxes decline. Although
coronal mass ejection-associated shocks may produce the majority of
interplanetary protons, moderate numbers of high energy protons are also
produced by progressively hardening flares; in fact, progressively hardening
flares and coronal mass ejections often occur simultaneously. Thus, the
investigator will focus on this progressively hardening flare to optimize proton
prediction algorithms for both hard X-rays and microwaves. In addition, he
pursues a collaboration for modeling the particle acceleration site with a
particularly well-observed event, and new observations of hardening flares with
a new hard X-ray spectrometer.
