9314179 WELLS The controversy surrounding iron limitation of phytoplankton in
the open ocean and its potential role in regulating global climate, both in the
present and past, has highlighted how little is known about the speciation and
biological availability of iron in seawater. Several new methodologies have been
developed recently that improve our ability to measure total iron concentrations
in "dissolved" and particulate fractions of seawater, however, none address
specifically the speciation of iron or its availability to phytoplankton. There
is a tremendous need to gather together chemists with theoretical and analytical
expertise in iron chemistry and biologists with expertise in the algal
physiological aspects of iron to: 1) establish the current level of
understanding of iron chemistry and the algal uptake of iron, 2) identify the
specific needs and research goals. A small international workshop comprised of
both young and senior scientists to address this need will be convened. The
objective of the workshop will be to foster cross-disciplinary debate and
studies towards developing the analytical tools needed to better define the role
of iron in marine biogeochemical cycles and in the global system.
