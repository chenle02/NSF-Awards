This project continues work on the development of a theoretical model of the
coupled atmosphere-ocean system forced externally by solar insolation. The model
is to be used to determine meridional variation of the Earth's climate. The
energy balance in the model will be achieved, not by invoking the second law of
thermodynamics which is only applicable to an isolated system, but by maximizing
the internal entropy production rate. The proposed theory represents a logical
extension to include dynamics into a one-dimensional climate model, taking into
account the mechanical and thermal forcing of the ocean to reduce the model
state to a few fluid masses. The integration of thermodynamics and dynamics into
a single theoretical framework is expected to advance our understanding of the
observed climate.

The proposed theory, if successfully applied, would be of considerable value to
the climate community, especially in its potential for application to long-term
prediction of climate behavior. If the theory proves untenable, the work will be
valuable in exposing its shortcomings.
