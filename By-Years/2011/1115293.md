This study focuses on problems from polynomial&lt;br/&gt;optimization and convex
algebraic geometry. The latter is a new&lt;br/&gt;research area that concerns
convex sets and convex hulls of sets that&lt;br/&gt;are described algebraically
and arise in optimization. The key tool is the use of efficient algorithms in
semidefinite programming, a branch of convex optimization that is used in
polynomial optimization. The&lt;br/&gt;first set of questions studies the
general phenomenon of when a given&lt;br/&gt;convex body is the linear
projection of a slice (by an affine plane)&lt;br/&gt;of a closed convex cone.
This phenomena is central to all&lt;br/&gt;lift-and-project methods for discrete
and polynomial optimization. This study&lt;br/&gt;provides a uniform view of all
lift-and-project&lt;br/&gt;methods via new notions of cone factorizations of
certain operators&lt;br/&gt;associated to the convex body. The investigator and
collaborators have&lt;br/&gt;recently constructed a new hierarchy of convex
relaxations for&lt;br/&gt;algebraic sets called theta bodies. Various open
questions about these&lt;br/&gt;bodies are posed. The methods&lt;br/&gt;from
polynomial optimization and convex algebraic geometry can be applied to
problems&lt;br/&gt;from computer vision. Here the application is primarily to
object reconstruction from&lt;br/&gt;images taken by multiple
cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work of the PI with her collaborators
improvies our understanding of the algebraic and geometric&lt;br/&gt;structures
that underlie optimization problems that involve&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. Such
problems have a wide array of applications and admit&lt;br/&gt;methods from both
the algebraic and analytic sides of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. This research
considers both improvements in our understanding of the theoretical aspects of
polynomial optimization, and the application of these methods to problems in
computer vision.
