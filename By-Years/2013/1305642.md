The objective of this program is an integrated research and educational effort
in the area of polarization induced transport in all-polymer field-effect
transistors (FETs). The goals of the research are to elucidate the role of long-
range polaronic interaction in ferroelectric-based FETs, to study plasmonic
effects on transport by combining light scattering and transient photocurrent
spectroscopy, and the development of experimental methodologies for strain
mapping in pressure sensing devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit is in the development of a universal model for temperature-dependent FET
mobility incorporating the effect of Fr√∂hlich polarons. The research activities
involve development of polymer FETs with solution processable polar and non-
polar polymer dielectrics along with a new series of push-pull-type donor-
acceptor polymers. Combining surface-enhanced Raman scattering with photocurrent
spectroscopy will provide a diagnostic tool to visualize transport using surface
plasmons. The development of flexible pressure sensing devices based on organic
FETs in conjunction with ferroelectric dielectrics is likely to have a
transformative impact on technology via the feasibility of tactile electronic
surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are on the science and
technology of pressure sensing devices and multi-discipline education and
outreach. The participation of high school students in a new summer program -
Fielding Science - with projects on inkjet printing techniques to be further
developed by undergraduate students in an Advanced Laboratory course, will
advance the area of flexible electronic surfaces. Public lectures on flexible
electronics will be delivered by the PI and graduate students participating in
the program as part of an existing Saturday Morning Science series.
