9714848 Giles This twelve month project helps to support 150 teachers
participating in the SuperComputing '97 conference including special sessions
and workshops specifically intended for educators. The conference theme is "the
exploration of the many possible roles of high performance networking and
computing in lifelong education in the 21st century." This year's program
broadens the participants beyond teachers to include students, administrators
and community (technology) leaders, with a particular emphasis on minority
participation; offers fora on computational science; funds teachers; and
supports a teacher booth. The emphasis on computation science is grounded in the
classroom context, and the PIs seek to generate dialog on how these tools and
techniques can contribute to the implementation of the national science and
mathematics standards. In total 150 teachers, 20 students, 20 school
administrators, and 10 community technology leaders are participating,
approximately 50 of whom are from the conference area, San Jose. Cost sharing is
8%. NSF's funding covers one-half the participants. Substantial corporate
contributions are expected to cover the rest, approximately 100, of the
participants.
