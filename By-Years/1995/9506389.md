9506389 AveLallement This field-based study of the tectonically active area of
Attu island in the Aleutian volcanic arc will collect detailed data on recently
active brittle fault populations. The goal is to determine how to known oblique
convergence across the Aleutian arc is partitioned into strike slip, thrust and
extensional faults. The results of this study will significantly improve our
understanding of oblique collisional orogens, and will aid in the understanding
of active plate-boundary tectonic processes.
