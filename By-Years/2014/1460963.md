The University of Delaware will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site located at the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment (CEOE) campus
in Lewes, DE. The program supports 10 students who conduct independent research
projects during a 10-week summer program that includes seminars in marine
sciences, field trips and a series of workshops. Science seminars cover a wide
range of marine science topics, and workshops focus on professional development
issues such as analyzing complex data sets, how to write scientific papers, life
in graduate school, and career paths in marine sciences. At the end of the
summer, interns present their results during a mini-symposium and write up their
results in the form of a regular scientific paper.
