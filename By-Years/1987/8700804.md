An accretionary prism is formed in an island arc by the accumulation of
sediments scraped off from the downgoing plate where two plates converge.
Structurally, such prisms are very complex and their evolution is not fully
understood. In a previously NSF funded research project, Dr. Ladd and his
coworkers successfully surveyed and imaged the Barbados accretionary wedge by
using modern and sophisticated seismic methods utilizing two ships. In this
award, Dr. Ladd and his colleagues will continue seismic interpretation of this
excellent data set and will perform detailed analysis to obtain more information
about seismic velocities in the accretionary prism. The seismic velocities will
provide information on density and porosity of the prism which, in turn, will
reveal lithologies of the sediments composing the prism and the direction of the
fluid flow within the accreted prism. These are some of the fundamental
questions in the evolution of an accretionary prism and answering these
questions will help us in understanding the plate tectonic processes. The
project will be supported at $100,018 for 12 months in FY87.
