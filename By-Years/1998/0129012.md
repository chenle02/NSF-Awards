Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0129012&lt;br/&gt;P. Van Tassel, Wayne State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed workshop is conceived
as one of the answers to the NSF's "Grand Challenge in Nanoscale Science and
Engineering". It will assess the recent advances (and promise) in the creation
and usage of devices and materials of nanometric dimensions. It will be hosted
as part of the 2001 annual meeting of the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers in Reno NV, with a goal to maximize the exposure of the traditional
engineer attendees to the new field of nanotechnology. To achieve this
objective, it is proposed to: 1. Invite six leading experts to discuss their
views of the research directions most likely to dominate the next ten years. A
forum will follow these presentations. 2. Encourage the participation of young
promising researchers by having each of the six experts nominate two of them. In
summary, this workshop, and its panel discussions, should be an effective device
to stimulate collective "brainstorms" among a large number of interested
participants. It will also provide an incentive for younger scientists' and
industrial scientists' participation. &lt;br/&gt;
