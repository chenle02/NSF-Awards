Scientists from developing countries will participate in a series of scientific
planning meetings and workshops during the last nine months of 1988 under the
sponsorship of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR). Their
participation will permit increased interaction between these scientists and
colleagues from the U.S. and other major countries sponsoring basic research.
The meetings involved will include those of various SCOR working groups,
including those dealing with oceanic carbon dioxide measurement technology and
experimental ecosystems, and SCOR standing committees on climate change and
global ocean fluxes. This increased interaction will foster increased
cooperation in joint research projects in the areas identified and others as
well.
