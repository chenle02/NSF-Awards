The purpose of this proposal is to study synthesis of the chlorophyll isocyclic
ring. The proposal specifically seeks to understand the cyclization of Mg-
protoporphyrin mono-methyl ester. The enzymological system catalyzing this
reaction has two components, one soluble and one membrane-bound. This research
will seek to isolate and characterize the soluble component. The aims are the
research are to elucidate as far as possible the synthesis of (divinyl)
protochlorophyllide at the level of enzyme mechanism, to purify the soluble
protein component of the system and thus open the way for analysis of the
problem by molecular biology.//
