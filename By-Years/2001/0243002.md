The Near-Infrared Camera and Fabry-Perot Spectrometer (NIC-FPS) uses a cooled
Fabry-Perot etalon and will achieve extremely high spectral resolution
(fractional bandwidth of 0.01%). The capabilities of this instrument will allow
observations of emission lines from astronomical objects that fall between
terrestrial OH airglow line emissions. The NIC-FPS instrument on the ARC 3.5-m
telescope at Apache Point Observatory will provide significant improvements in
sensitivity compared with greater fractional bandwidth instruments on larger
telescopes. The present award is for the purchase of narrow-band filters that
will be used as spectral order sorters, and for the acquisition of a new
controller for the Fabry-Perot etalon. NIC-FPS will be used to study gaseous
outflows associated with newly formed stars, highly evolved stars, supernovae,
and galaxies. The project involves graduate student participation in the
construction and commissioning phases. Both undergraduate and graduate student
observing projects will be supported.
