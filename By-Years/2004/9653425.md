The American Physiology Society (APS), in collaboration with the National
Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) and the Human Anatomy and Physiology
Society (HAPS), are fostering improvement of undergraduate life sciences
education by supporting the formation of collaborative working relationships
among life sciences faculty at 2- and 4-year colleges (including community
colleges), physiology research faculty, and physiology teaching faculty.
Specifically, the project is promoting the creation of ongoing working
relationships among triads of faculty from the three groups noted above through
research and curriculum development experiences, and computer networks; and
promoting the adoption of national reforms for undergraduate content and
effective pedagogical techniques among undergraduate faculty through curricular
materials and in service activities developed collaboratively by these triads.
The project is promoting the establishment of long-term collegial relationships
that benefit all members. Initially, the 2- and 4-year college faculty members
work with a physiology research faculty member on a summer research experience,
attend sessions on effective pedagogy during a summer institute at the HAPS
annual meeting and, subsequently, work with the other members of the triad to
collaboratively develop new curricular materials for the undergraduate life
sciences classroom. Interested triads will then go on to develop and conduct a
local professional development workshop for life sciences faculty in their
geographic area. Curricular materials developed during the project will be
field-tested, edited, and published by NABT. The project is designed to allow
the continuation of these activities as a part of the long-term activities of
the APS Education Office.
