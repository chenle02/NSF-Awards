Abstract

Long lived greenhouse gas (GHG; CO2, CH4, N2O, some CFCs) emissions play a
critical role in regulating the Earth's climate. Urban environments increasingly
lie at the core of many major environmental issues including climate change.
Much of the human induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted globally originate in
or nearby cities. How do you measure the carbon balance of a mega-city? Society
must be able to understand and predict the distribution of emitted GHGs within
the urban atmosphere in order to assess the validity of emissions inventories,
and the efficacy of any emission reduction programs. Uncertainties in self-
reported 'bottom up' GHG emission inventories, derived from activity use data
and generalized conversion factors, are often larger than emission reduction
goals [IPCC, 2006; NRC, 2010]. This shortcoming can potentially be addressed by
top-down (inverse) modeling that uses GHG measurements in the atmosphere,
coupled with transport modeling and a priori flux constraints, to quantify
source emissions.

This project, centered on observation and modeling of carbon fluxes in the
Boston urban dome, has potentially broad impact, including: 1) use and
refinement of the WRF-STILT model (which couples a research weather forecasting
model with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model) to connect atmospheric
(observation) with surface fluxes in large cities; 2) Regional and potentially
worldwide applications of the model to verify regulatory, cap and trade and even
global treaty needs; 3) Education of students and the public. Project data,
results, and software will continue to be made publicly available during the
proposed research.
