Program Summary: The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to
acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of
oceanographic data. This proposal from Bermuda Biological Station (BBS) Research
Institute requests funding for equipment that will be used to support NSF-funded
research cruises aboard the R/V WEATHERBIRD II, a vessel that is owned and
operated by the Institute.
