Professors Enflo and Lomonosov will explore a number of areas of analysis
including: (1) problems in number theory involving bounds on number theoretic
sums, (2) non-linear problems in Banach spaces including the relationship
between homeomorphisms and isomorphisms of Banach spaces, and (3) the invariant
subspace problem. The problems which Professors Enflo and Lomonosov will study
are extremely diverse. Perhaps the most important is their joint project on the
invariant subspace problem. In a finite dimensional space, every linear operator
(matrix) has an eigenvector and thus multiples of this vector form an invariant
subspace. This is no longer true in infinite dimensions but remains true in
important special cases. The principal investigators will study to what extent
certain classes of operators have nontrivial invariant subspaces in special but
important infinite dimensional spaces.
