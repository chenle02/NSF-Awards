This award provides funds for a 2-day workshop to be held at the University of
Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography in the Fall/Winter 2015-2016. This
workshop will bring together science community stakeholders, video recording
experts, and data managers and metadata specialists to develop consensus and
best practices for video and complementary metadata to help move the community
toward the common goal of broad public access to distributed video content for
scientific research and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Video imagery is
an integral part of underwater operations conducted with ROVs, HOVs, and AUVs.
These data are critical for sampling, exploration, and observation activities
during seafloor operations and are key records for immediate post-dive and post-
cruise research by the shipboard participants. Video archives have the potential
to provide broad significant scientific benefits long after data acquisition and
have tremendous potential for engaging the public in exciting ocean science
research. To achieve this potential, significant challenges must be addressed
that will allow video archives to become accessible and include sufficient
metadata to allow users to access the content relevant to their needs.
