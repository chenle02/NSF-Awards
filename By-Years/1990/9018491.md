The high pressure polymorph of quartz, coesite, has been reported from
metamorphic rocks in three mountain belts, and indicates subduction to depths in
excess of 100km followed by return to the earth's surface. This project will
focus on the occurrence of coesite in the Dabie Mountains of east central China,
within a presumed suture zone between the Yangtze and Sino-Korean cratons. Major
aims are to date the parent rock, the age of high pressure metamorphism and the
time of collision of the cratons. The work also includes additional study of
coesite-bearing eclogitic rocks within the Dora Maira massif in Italy and
comparisons to the China occurrence. Results will provide the basis for a better
understanding of the relationship between subduction processes and the timing of
ultra-high pressure meta- morphism.
