Chimpanzees are well known to be our closest non-human relatives, but the
surprising extent to which they share cognitive abilities with human beings is
still being discovered. Drs. Boysen and Berntson are investigating the numerical
competence of chimpanzees. Their studies should contribute to our understanding
of the similarities and differences in cognitive capabilities across species and
toward clarifying those processes that may support numerical skills in non-human
primates. Besides these contributions to basic scientific knowledge, these
studies may yield sharper tests for and understanding of numerical competence in
children and, more generally, provide a better understanding of non-verbal
intelligence. Thus, the present project may provide insights into the cognitive
abilities of language-impaired or otherwise developmentally-challenged children.
Experiments will examine the manipulation of numerical symbols, the emergence of
counting skills, and the representational nature of number symbols. Training
methods previously developed will be extended to increase the range and
functional significance of number use by three young-adult chimpanzees, and to
examine features of summation and subtraction using arrays containing both
symbols and objects. The emergence of counting skills will also be examined in
an adult and an infant chimpanzee, including an analysis of ability to recognize
the position within the series from 1 to 7 of two quantities (3, 6) that have
not previously been paired with arrays of objects. The contribution of abstract
symbol use will be further examined in a study of food sharing that employs
Arabic numerals and arrays of objects in a social, cooperative context. A final
study will investigate the chimpanzees' formation of equivalence sets among
categories of numerical stimuli.
