Recently, there has been an increased interest within the machine learning and
signal processing communities in kernel methods because they offer an attractive
alternative to design nonlinear systems for the demanding current applications
of information processing. Recursive state estimation and in particular the
Kalman filter, would benefit from such an effort because there are many
important applications in aerospace, automotive, surveillance, and medical
fields that are intrinsically nonlinear, and the current nonlinear models have
drawbacks. This proposal will study the feasibility of a (nonlinear) mapping to
a linear functional space (a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space) to implement
there the Kalman filter equations and achieve performance commensurate with
nonlinear models. One of the difficulties of this approach that will be
investigated is the growing memory requirements that will be dealt with novel
sparsification criteria and algorithms based on information theory. The approach
will be tested in the design of brain machine interfaces to help quadraplegics
and also in automotive engine control for which there are data available and
benchmarks. Two graduate students will be working on this important topic.
