Future computing systems will allow computations to be performed simultaneously
with massive parallelization. However, current practices in scientific
simulations cannot utilize the maximum potential of these machines. This is
fundamentally due to the need for data synchronization across computing cores,
which may cause up to 80% idling of the machines, and there is a need for new
methods to overcome this inefficiency.

This research is to develop a new framework for high performance computing where
synchronization across the processing elements is relaxed. This will eliminate
the overhead associated with extreme parallelism and potentially lay the
foundation for simulations at scale. The framework is based on asynchronous
model of computation for high performance computing to better utilize future
systems. The price to pay for asynchrony is poor predictability of the code,
resulting in uncertainty in the calculations. The central theme of this project
is to accurately quantify this induced uncertainty and develop techniques to
mitigate it. Specific research thrusts include: i) study of numerical stability,
consistency and accuracy of widely used numerical algorithms, in the context of
fluid-flow, under asynchronous conditions; ii) development of new schemes which
can maintain its accuracy under asynchronous conditions; iii) determination of
efficient implementations of the resulting algorithms on current and future
systems. These research goals are addressed in a dynamical systems framework.
The behavior of asynchronous numerical algorithms is modeled as Markov jump
systems. Issues related to consistency, numerical stability and error control is
addressed by using tools for analysis and design of Markov jump systems.
