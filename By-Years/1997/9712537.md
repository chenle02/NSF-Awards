9712537 Schneider This six month project supports the planning process for 200
schools from districts and Urban Systemic Initiatives in seven regions to take
the first critical steps in implementing standards- based, articulated programs.
Included are schools from Texas (El Paso), Arizona (Phoenix), California
(Fresno, Los Angeles, San Jose) and Colorado (Fort Collins, Colorado Springs).
Teams of high schools and feeder middle schools are identified who are:
committed to 7th-12 grade science reforms; ready toi implement NSF-supported
curricula that are aligned with standards; and willing to work together to
assess their needs and carry out school-site developed implementation plans. The
project works with teachers, administrators, parents and other stakeholders in
each region as they undertake these activities. A model for scaling-up science
reform nationally will be documented. Cost sharing is 42%
