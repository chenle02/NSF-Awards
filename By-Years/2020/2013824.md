Autonomous systems in general and self-driving cars in particular, hold the
promise to be one of the most disruptive technologies emerging in recent years.
However, the safety and resilience of these systems, if not proactively
addressed, will pose a significant threat potentially impairing our relationship
with these technologies and may lead to a societal rejection of adopting them
permanently. This project seeks to address such concerns by equipping autonomous
systems with an additional layer of intelligence allowing them to be resilient-
by-cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses resilience for
autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS) by integrating concepts from game
theory, formal methods, and controls. Our proposed approach includes: (i) a
principled framework for formally reasoning about cognitive CPS; that is, given
a set of strategies captured in a formal language (e.g., temporal logic), the
proposed framework builds on ideas from evolutionary game theory to understand
which strategies lead to the best fit when operating in adversarial environments
(ii) On-the-fly, correct-by-design feedback controller synthesis that executes
the chosen strategy while satisfying physical constraints imposed by the micro-
dynamics of the underlying CPS (iii) a data-driven strategy-mining approach that
addresses the fundamental problem of designing the library of strategies from
human demonstrations. We will illustrate our approach over key applications
including self-driving cars and autonomous drone swarms. Our educational plan
engages not only graduate students but also high school and undergraduate
students. It also reaches out to engineers and the lay public, by providing open
source implementations of our algorithms making them available both to industry
and independent developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
