This research will continue to examine axonal pathfinding in the developing
wing of Drosophila by (1) identifying the ionic basis of the physiological
difference by studying the neurons in a series of putative channel mutants; (2)
by looking for the expression of the corresponding genes in the neurons using a
variety of molecular probes given to us by the labs who have cloned the genes;
(3) by testing the hypothesis that developmentally important hormones form the
causal link between time of development, physiological behavior and choice of
central pathway by growing the developing wings in vitro and manipulating the
levels of 20-hydroxyecdysone and juvenile hormone. (4) Hormone manipulating
results in a change in the number of cells that bind anti-HRP, the usual agent
for identifying nerve cells in insects. In order to assess whether all the cells
that develop under these conditions are neurons, the P.I. will apply multiple
criteria of neural identity.
