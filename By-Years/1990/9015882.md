The project examines the flow of simple, oligomeric and polymeric fluids inside
perfectly straight and parallel, ultra-narrow pores. Under these conditions,
flow cannot be described in terms of macroscopic (continuum) hydrodynamics, and
its features are quite sensitive to the molecular structure of the fluid and of
the solid surface. Molecular simulation is closely coordinated with state-of-
the-art characterization of the micropores and pressure drop-flow rate
measurements. The microporous media consist of etched sheets of mica with
diameters of 60 > or more. The shape of the micropores and the exposed atomic
groups on the pore surfaces are determined by SEM and atomic force microscopy.
The research aims at clarifying the effects of confinenement- induced
inhomogeneities on flow, the role of solid/fluid interactions on the dynamic
fluid structure and mobility, and the importance of molecular architecture. The
research results impact on flow of oil in porous rocks, magnetic data- storage
discs lubrication, membrane permeability and selectivity, and melt fracturing
during capillary extrusion.
