A comprehensive security architecture is proposed that uses language-based
mechanisms to eliminate errors due to circumvention of type safety, be they
intentional or erroneous, and that additionally uses security policy mechanisms
to contain malicious behavior. This approach extends techniques previously
applied to mobile code and is based on a combination of a) mechanically
verifying the absence of such errors in any software before it is run, using
code representations that can be checked for such errors or that rule out errors
in the first place, and b) monitoring executing software for malicious
activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed system consists of multiple layers,
each of which is secured by the layer below it, the lowest of which can be
provided in tamper-resistant hardware. Key to the solution is to provide a typed
hardware abstraction layer (THAL) that enables the construction of a type-safe
system "from the ground up", all the way down to the tamper-proof hardware.
Hence, the goal is to build a practical system about which we can make security
guarantees from the hardware up, and not just "from the operating system
up".&lt;br/&gt;
