This project awards 20 scholarships each semester and provides multiple support
services to promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement in STEM
technology disciplines by eligible students. The four target disciplines are
Engineering, Information, Networking, and Multimedia Technologies. Awardee
benefits include: mentoring by STEM technology faculty, academic/career
advising, a one-day summer career preparation experience, a seminar series
featuring a luncheon guest speaker from partnering 4-year institutions, industry
or a former awardee; networking opportunities with employers and prior awardees,
individual learning plans, and optional internships. In addition, awardees can
take up to 20% of their scholarship with them when they transfer to a 4-year
partnering institution.
