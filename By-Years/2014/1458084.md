Plate rifting at oceanic spreading centers occurs through a combination of
faulting and injection of magma, both of which relieve built-up stress
associated with global tectonic forces. At times faulting can dominate, leading
to sustained slip along a single plane for over a million years. Seafloor formed
during such periods of 'detachment faulting' differs from the typical, linear
volcanic hills that are ubiquitous on the seafloor. Instead domal features, with
up to a few km seafloor relief, develop as initially deep rock is unroofed by
relative motion across the fault. This study aims to show how detachment faults
behave seismically- where small earthquakes occur with depth along the fault and
how that activity varies laterally. New insights gained in this study could be
applicable to other regions where extensional tectonic stress and magmatism
occur, such as parts of the U.S. Basin and Range province. This study is jointly
supported by the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program and the International
Science and Engineering section of NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of
microseismicity data recorded during 6-month deployments of ocean bottom
seismometers at 13째N and 26째N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge will be conducted in
order to elucidate fault activity at young oceanic core complexes. The 13째N work
is one component of broader UK-French-US collaborative project; the 26째N effort
focuses on earthquakes intermediate in size between events that were previously
studied; new results will focus in detail on crust shallower than 3 km for the
first time. The seismicity patterns of these two areas, that both host oceanic
core complexes, will be compared. Documentation of the distribution of
earthquakes, and possibly some focal mechanisms, aims to assess how detachment
faults behave in 3-D and what the implications might be in terms of fault
strength and spatial/temporal evolution.
