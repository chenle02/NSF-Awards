Professor Zuckerman will investigate the role of noncompact Lie groups as
internal symmetry groups of chiral models in physics. The Lorentz group of
Minkowski space-time is a basic example in Zuckerman's theory. Thus the
distinction between geometrical and internal symmetries becomes somewhat blurred
in this work. This blurring may be relevant to applications of chiral models and
noncompact groups to quantum gravity in two and three dimensions. Symmetry
principles have played an essential role in quantum mechanics and quantum field
theory almost from the inception of these branches of physics. A quantum system
may have geometrical symmetries - inherited from the background space-time
continuum - and or internal symmetries - related to additional degrees of
freedom. Professor Zuckerman will investigate the basic mathematics of these
symmetries.
