With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is
cofunded by Chemistry, Professor Thomas Gunnoe from University of Virginia and
colleagues Michal Sabat and Cameron Mura will acquire an X-ray diffractometer.
The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all
levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthetic studies including catalysis,
(b) biomaterials, (c) organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis, (d)
photophysics, (e) organic materials, and (f) surface
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies
described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic
chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an
integral part of teaching as well as research.
