Parents in every society know that young children need to be socialized
according to norms and conventions. The transmission process usually begins when
children begin to walk and talk. Psychologists believe that if parents convey
their expectations for behavior with reason, sensitivity, and love, children are
likely to comply with demands. Psychologists also know that during the early
years, children increasingly go along with parent expectations for behavior, and
even assume responsibility for their own acts when alone. The ability to act
according to parent and social demands is often labeled self-regulation. By the
preschool years, children are expected to be able to accept standards and to
monitor their own behavior accordingly. Despite the importance of self-
regulation for childen's socialization, few details are known about its early
developmental course. In addition, little is known of the nature of conditions
that help or hinder self-regulation's growth. This research will attempt to fill
this gap. Specifically, this developmentally focused study will address the
following: What kinds of self-regulation do young children, who are in the
second through fourth years of life, show? What general level of development has
to be obtained before children consistently comply with requests? What cognitive
processes are associated with the child's ability to show self-regulation? How
do parents modify their behavior to take into account child capability? What
particular situations or events interfere with children's ability to regulate
their own behavior. At the conclusion of the research, we will know more about
how caregivers assist the child's learning of social conventions, how children
engage in the social tasks and demands placed before them and how they regulate
their own behavior, and which particular situations are particularly challenging
for young children.
