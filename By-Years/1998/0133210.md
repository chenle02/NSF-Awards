This proposal describes a symbiosis of research and education which blends
mechanics and control in a way that advances the state and applicability of
nonlinear control theory while offering unique opportunities to educate
engineers by appealing to their earliest fascinations. The research integrates
recently developed energy methods for controlling mechanical systems with
empirical models of viscous fluid forces in order to control ocean and
atmospheric vehicles using internal actuators. Educational activities complement
this research and cultivate excitement for learning and discovery among
students, and prospective students, through real-world engineering challenges
involving vehicle dynamics and control and creative design. The research adapts
energy-shaping control strategies to stabilize and maneuver vehicles using
internal rotors or moving masses, focusing on the "case study" of an underwater
vehicle. By incorporating viscous effects into the control design process, one
may use them to advantage through clever modulation of a vehicle's internal
shape. Research objectives include characterizing the effect of non-conservative
forces on systems controlled using energy-shaping feedback, developing control
strategies for internally actuated vehicles which exploit viscous effects,
extending these strategies to vehicles with conventional actuators, and
evaluating controller performance with an experimental underwater vehicle.
Internal actuators promise to significantly enhance the efficiency, reliability,
and performance envelope of underwater vehicles, moving them closer toward their
inevitable role as workhorses for ocean science, offshore industry, and the
military. Other areas where the resulting theory could be applied include
internally or conventionally actuated ocean surface vessels, lighter-than-air
vehicles, aircraft, low-orbit or re-entering spacecraft, and more general
mechanical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
