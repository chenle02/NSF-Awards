This award will provide funds to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduate Site at Oklahoma State University. The program will include ten
participant projects, all concerned with the general problem of improving green
plant performance through enhancement of growth conditions. The enhancement
methods to be studied will involve a variety of approaches from the fields of
plant physiology and structure, plant pathology, ecology and biochemistry. A
brief orientation will be concerned with philosophy of research, plant
productivity, growth limiting conditions and how they may be circumvented,
literature survey, report writing and presentations of results. Post program
follow-up efforts will include presentation of results to biology and science
clubs in participants' home schools, state collegiate academies of science and
publication in appropriate journals.
