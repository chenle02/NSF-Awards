Unsolicited phone calls, also known as robocalls, are one of the most pervasive
and visible network security problems in the United States. Despite the sincere
efforts of telephone providers, regulators, legislators, and technologists,
there are virtually no consistently effective countermeasures. The projectâ€™s
novelties are in creating technical solutions that will empower regulators and
providers to stop robocalling at scale. The project's broader significance and
importance lie in dramatically improving the security and trustworthiness of the
telephone network and, in so doing, restoring the telephone network as a useful
communications medium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this work is to end the
scourge of unsolicited phone calls by creating new techniques to detect abusive
actors, restore trust in telephony by positively authenticating all phone calls,
and prevent compromises of Internet voice infrastructure that would enable
robocall abuse. The principal methodologies include developing threat
intelligence, designing secure and privacy-preserving protocols, conducting
Internet-scale measurement, and call audio analysis. This project is also
developing public information campaigns, operator and regulator training, and
telephone security content for network security
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
