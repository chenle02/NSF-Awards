The theories of bargaining and markets, key theories within game theory and
mathematical economics, suffer from a serious shortcoming -- other than a few
isolated results, they are essentially non-algorithmic. With the advent of the
Internet, totally new and highly successful markets have been defined and
launched by Internet companies such as Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, MSN and Ebay, and
bargaining has emerged as a mechanism of choice in some Internet transactions,
such as those made by priceline.com and iOffer.com. Motivated by these
developments, much work has been done in the last decade on developing
algorithms for markets and bargaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
extend this work along several exciting directions: attacking open problems
remaining in the efficient computation of market equilibria such as Fisher's
model with piecewise-linear, concave utilities; extending bargaining algorithms
to more general utility functions, such as piecewise-linear, concave utilities;
developing an algorithm for the Adwords problem that achieves 1 - o(1) expected
competitive ratio in the stochastic setting, and at the same time, a 1 - 1/e
ratio in the worst case; developing models of bargaining that incorporate
constraints such as timing or incentive compatibility, thus making them more
suitable for use on the Internet; developing further our understanding of game-
theoretic properties of bargaining and markets; and developing further the
primal-dual paradigm for the combinatorial solution of nonlinear convex
programs, in particular, in the setting of approximation
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase our understanding of
the interactions and complex interdependencies of information systems, markets
and social systems. It will enable and support efficient massive distributed
systems. This project will provide algorithms for and insights into the
computational aspects of markets and transactions on the Internet, thereby
helping make their operation more efficient. Hence, this project is expected to
contribute advances in science and engineering, as well as to promote economic
prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;
