This project is an investigation of heat transfer processes in very small
channels with the goal of developing highly compact, high performance heat
exchangers (heat transfer rates on the order of 105W/m2K, are feasible).
Microfabrication techniques developed in the micro-electronic industry permit
the fabrication of small size, high precision channels in silicon or other
suitable materials. The proposed dimensions of the channels will range from a
few microns to fractions of a millimeter in width and depth. The proposed
lengths of the channel will be restricted to approximately 1-2 centimeters in
the initial stages of the study. Large numbers of channels can be accommodated
in extremely small volumes. Planar photolithographic technology provides a
method for fabricating extremely complicated fins and extended surfaces suited
to optimizing the heat transfer process. The proposed heat exchangers should be
able to provide efficient heat transmission between two fluids or from a single
fluid to the ambient. Other advantages of the proposed heat exchangers, aside
from efficiency, are their very small mass, low inventory of working liquids,
small supporting structures, low cost, and vibration-free character. This type
of heat exchanger represents a class of thermal elements that have not been
previously studied in the dimensional regime being considered here, suggesting
that a fundamental inquiry into heat exchange in this mesoscale regime is
desirable from a purely scientific viewpoint. The proposed research is
interdisciplinary in nature as it addresses simultaneously heat transfer,
materials, sensor elements for monitoring the heat transfer processes, and
microfabrication issues.
