An undergraduate laboratory for robotics, computer-vision and automated
manufacturing is established. The laboratory will serve senior-level
undergraduate students in electrical engineering, computer science and
mechanical engineering. The laboratory will provide practical experience for
reinforcing the scientific and engineering principles learned in an
undergraduate lecture courses in robots and manufacturing. The laboratory will
consist of five experimental setups in a room of 900 sq. ft. Each setup contains
a desk-top robot arm, a desk-top computer, and a computer-vision system.
Additionally, an automated milling machine is available. Each student will
perform experiments with the robot arm and the milling machine. The student will
be required to develop software to control the robot to perform various tasks
with the aid of vision feedback, to measure robot characteristics, and to
demonstrate principles learned in the lecture classes. Each student will program
and translate a CAM program to cause the milling machine to manufacture an
object.
