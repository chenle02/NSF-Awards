9618711 Tomanek The North Dakota Science Teacher Enhancement Program (ND-STEP)
involves 20 teachers per year in a 14-month program of research and inservice
activities, at one of North Dakota's research universities. During each of
4-years 10-pairs of middle and high- school science teachers from North Dakota
and Minnesota will participate in ND-STEP. Each pair will work with one
scientist. The 6-week summer research experience is complemented by completion
of a graduate course on inquiry teaching and attendance at four full-day
sessions during the academic year where the focus is on implementation of action
plans and teaching by inquiry. Teachers may earn seven graduate credit hours for
the summer activities and 2-Continuing Education credits for the academic year
sessions. In years 2-4 a small group of "master" teachers will be selected as
ND-STEP Adjunct Faculty. Their preparation includes working with NSF supported
curriculum materials such as SEPUP, ChemCom, A Private Universe, etc. They will
conduct science seminars for their peers about the research they've done and
lead inservice sessions on the NRC Science Standards and inquiry teaching. An
ND- STEP Steering Committee will meet twice a year to guide the project.
