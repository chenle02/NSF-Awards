9305060 Stixrude The PI's will investigate the physics of the core's most
abundant constituent, iron, at high pressures and temperatures, including its
sub-solidus phase relations, the thermo-elasticity of its solid and liquid
phases, dynamic properties of the melt and the iron melting curve. The
properties of face-centered cubic, hexagonal close packed and body centered
cubic crystalline structures are investigated with first principles solutions of
Schrodinger's Equation based on density functional theory. They will construct
parametric model Hamiltonians to represent the theoretical results and use this
model in molecular dynamics simulations of the equation of state, structure and
viscosity of liquid iron. The model Hamiltonian will also be used in high
pressure cluster simulations of iron melting. The aim of the project is to
predict and provide a firm theoretical basis for a discussion of the temperature
distribution in the core, the composition of the solid inner core and liquid
outer core and the crystal structure of the inner core. ***
