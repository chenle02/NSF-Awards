Dr. Flagan has proposed to investigate the synthesis of high quality ceramic
powders using two approaches: vapor precursor routes in which seed particle are
grown by a combination of vapor and cluster deposition, and electrospray to
produce fine droplets of liquid precursors. The experimental and modeling
research will focus on the densification of agglomerate particles, particle
growth by cluster deposition, and scale-up techniques of seeded aerosol reactors
and electrosprays. Aerosol formation by vapor deposition and electrospray,
sintering of agglomerate, and corresponding scale-up techniques are critical
issues for the production of ceramic powders with engineered structures and
properties.
