Seinfeld 9307603 Gas-to-particle conversion is a ubiquitous process in the
atmosphere, understanding the detailed chemistry and physics of which will allow
one to predict the effects of primary gaseous and particulate emissions on
airborne particulate matter composition and size. This comprehensive research
program determine the mechanisms of secondary organic aerosols formation in the
atmosphere for a number of important anthropogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons.
Experiments in a 1000 liter indoor reactor will be used to probe gas-phase
photooxidation mechanisms. A 4 m3 outdoor smog chamber will be used to generate
organic aerosols for molecular speciation analysis by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry, while the 60 m3 outdoor smog chamber will be employed to study the
integrated gas-phased and gas-to-particle conversion dynamics. Vapor pressures
of individual secondary organic aerosol constituents and of the aerosol
generated by hydrocarbon photooxidation will be determined with the tandem
differential mobility analyzer (TDMA). Information from the individual
experiments studies will be integrated in the data analysis phase. Gas-phase
photooxidation mechanisms will be formulated and aerosol physics models will be
developed based on the concentration dynamics, molecular speciation, and the
physical properties deduced from the TDMA studies.
