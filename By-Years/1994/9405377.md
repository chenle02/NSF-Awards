9405377 deDoncker Numerical integration has many applications in various areas
of science and engineering. Computationally intensive multiple integrals arise
in areas such as atomic and nuclear physics, statistics and the analysis of
sensory data. This project involves the design, analysis and development of a
set of coarse grain parallel and distributed algorithms for multivariate
numerical integration. The main focus is on adaptive integration strategies
layered over a system for distributed queue management. Implementations are
targeted to loosely coupled systems. Adaptive integration is used as the main
tool for integrals over regions of low to moderate dimension. The queue
management incorporates the insertion and deletion of subregions (tasks) into
and from the distributed task pool while retaining balanced or approximately
balanced loads in the local queues. It will be adapted to the problem as well as
the types of processors and the speed of communications in the loosely coupled
system. For low dimensionality special attention will be paid to the use of
(near) optimal degree rules and techniques dedicated to the treatment of
specific integration problems such as singularities or particular weight
functions. Number theoretic methods will be included for high dimensions,
irregular regions or erratic function behavior. ***
