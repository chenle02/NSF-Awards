This project investigates combined visual and haptic (touch) interfaces to
display multi-dimensional data generated by computer models of physical systems.
The focus is on data features that are difficult to convey visually, such as
scalar data which fills volumes, vector fields, and tensor fields. First, tests
are conducted to better understand the perception of haptic rendering elements:
virtual surfaces and constraints, forces and torques, and mechanical impedances.
Second, new haptic rendering modes are developed which can convey multi-
dimensional data via combinations of haptic rendering elements. These modes are
tested using representative visualization problems in fluid dynamics,
electromagnetics, and solid mechanics. Third, visualization puzzles are
developed which quantify the perceptual added value of haptic rendering modes.
Both cooperative and complementary visual/haptic rendering are explored. The
project seeks to discover synergistic rendering modes which produce
understanding more easily than visual rendering alone. An improved visual/haptic
interface enables intuitive debugging of computer models, efficient
visualization of modeling results, and improved physical understanding. Such a
capability benefits the conduct of scientific research in many fields, the
design and analysis of engineered systems, and the education of future
scientists and engineers.
