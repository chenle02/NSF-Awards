This is a proposal to purchase an optical microscope and a cryostat for
histological sectioning for use at the Whitney Marine Laboratory of the
University of Florida. This equipment is particularly intended for
immunocytochemical studies of development, secretion and signaling in marine
animals. These studies employ of a variety of modern cell and molecular
biological techniques, but since any findings must, ultimately, be evaluated
with respect to the cellular or intracellular localization of the processes in
question, the use of techniques for localizing specific molecules has become
increasingly important. This group of investigators requests funds to acquire
(1) a new cryostat to replace a very heavily used but aging unit whose operation
is very inefficient and time consuming and (2) a research grade compound
microscope which hitherto has not been available at the laboratory. These units
will be housed in a central histology/microscopy facility that is currently
being built.
