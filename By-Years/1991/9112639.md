A dye laser system will be purchased to support fundamental investigations of
Diesel combustion and emission formation processes being conducted in two unique
experimental facilities -an optically accessible, DI Diesel engine and a high
pressure, chemical flow reactor. An Engine Company, NSF, and the Department of
Energy are sponsoring research on the evolution of soot and NO within the
combustion chamber of a specially constructed Diesel engine; this research uses
laser- based, planar imaging of soot and NO. The objective of the study is to
obtain an improved understanding of the processes so that in-cylinder strategies
can be developed to simultaneously reduce NOx and particulate emissions. To
complement the engine research on Diesel combustion, a high pressure, chemical
flow reactor is being used to study the effects of pressure on the chemistry of
hydrocarbon auto- ignition related to Diesel cold starting and knock. In
addition to the measurement of stable products, important radical species will
be determined by fluorescence or adsorption techniques. This research is
motivated by the needs of Diesel engine manufacturers who cannot meet the NOx
and particulate emissions standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency
for 1994 without the use of particulate traps which will adversely affect engine
reliability and fuel economy.
