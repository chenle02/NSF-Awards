The mathematical study of 3-dimensional spaces goes back to the work of
Poincar(e. Because classical physics describes our universe to be a
3-dimensional space, the classification of 3-dimensional spaces is an important
mathematical endeavor, since it may have ramifications for the global structure
of our universe. One of the most broad and interesting classes of 3-dimensional
spaces are "hyperbolic manifolds", which are described by discrete groups of two
by two complex matrices. These groups can have manifestations as higher-
dimensional matrices, which the PI plans to explore. The importance for the
study of 3-dimensional spaces may stem from the study of "bundles" over the
spaces, which attach vector data to each point in the 3-dimensional space. The
PI plans to investigate the moduli of such bundles, both in terms of dimension,
and number of components (which structures can be deformed to each other). The
project plans to take advantage of recent advances in the understanding of
3-dimensional hyperbolic spaces discovered by the PI and others. There may be
ramifications for the algorithmic classification of 3-dimensional spaces and
their invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes several
avenues of study regarding representations of 3-manifold groups. The PI will
investigate the profinite completions of hyperbolic 3-manifold groups. In
particular, the PI will explore which information about a 3-manifold may be
extracted from the finite quotients of its fundamental group, including
hyperbolic volume and rank. The PI proposes to investigate the dimension of the
space of faithful irreducible representations as the dimension of the
representations increases. The PI plans to use right-angled Artin groups and
embeddings of 3-manifolds into them to investigate this question. A related
question is to investigate the growth of the number of volumes of n-dimensional
representations of hyperbolic 3-manifold groups as n increases. Finally, the PI
will investigate twisted-homology of hyperbolic taut sutured 3-manifolds. In
particular, the PI would like to find criteria for when they are twisted
SL(2,C)-homology products, motivated by the problem of determining when twisted
SL(2,C) Alexander polynomials detect the Seifert genus (or more generally
Thurston norm).
