This CAREER activity concentrates on a scientific project that focuses on the
search for a small violation of Bose-Einstein statistics for photons. This
violation is manifest in the appearance of rare absorption events in a two-
photon atomic transition. The particular transition chosen for the search is the
absorption of two equal-frequency photons from the J=0 ground state to the J=1
state of ytterbium. It is estimated that this atomic-based test could provide a
ten orders of magnitude better limit than the current upper limit of the Bose-
Einstein statistics violation provided by the two-gamma decay of the Z-boson.
The educational component of the proposal involves considerable contributions to
the teaching of upper-level physics courses plus a cross-disciplinary activity
that introduces graphical programming language elements in the upper division
courses.
