This award supports a mineralogic, petrologic, and geochronologic study of the
high-grade metamorphic rocks of Central Queen Land, a portion of the East
Antarctic Precambrian shield. Field work will be done during the 1989-1990
austral season. The Principal Investigator has been designated the U.S. exchange
scientist with the Soviet Antarctic Expedition. Research will focus on the
metasediments: the pressure-temperature conditions of the different events and
fluid conditions of metamorphism, in particular, the role of CO2 in granulite-
facies metamorphism. Geochronologic studies should provide information on
geologic history of the high-grade metamorphic rocks prior to emplacement of
pegamite and granite 600 million years ago, so that central Queen Maud Land can
be correlated not only with other parts of the East Antarctic Shield, but also
with southern Africa.
