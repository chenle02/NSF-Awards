This is an award to provide support for conduct of an international symposium on
processes governing the movement and fate of contaminants in the subsurface
environment at Stanford University from July 24 to 26, 1989. The purpose of the
symposium is to bring together engineers and scientists who are at the forefront
of groundwater research to assess the current state of knowledge and identify
research needs. Symposium topics have been made very specific so that the
participants can direct their attention to some of the most important aspects of
this difficult problem. Subsurface contamination is one of the major current
environmental problems and enormous expenditures are being made to solve this
complex problem in the face of limited knowledge regarding processes that
determine the manner by which pollutions are diffused and dispersed in
groundwater aquifers. Results of this conference are expected to be utilized in
planning of responsive measures and in identifying research needs. This
conference is also being supported by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
