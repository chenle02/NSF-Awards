The P.I. will study problems in the area of nonlinear control and differential
games. A major focus of the research on differential games will be on
Stackelberg solutions in feedback form, and on Nash equilibrium solutions in
infinite time horizon. Here the main goal is to extend the theory available in
linear-quadratic case, studying more general nonlinear models with robustness
properties. A second main area of research is the control of set-valued
evolutions. Models will be considered where the growth of a set can be
influenced by a distributed control, or restrained by constructing barriers in
real time. In particular, the P.I. and a collaborator will study in which cases
the set can be rendered uniformly bounded for all times, and which are the
optimal confinement strategies.

The primary motivation for the research on differential games comes from
economics. In a typical model that will be considered, the leading player--say,
a government, or a central bank--announces its policy in advance, while a
subordinate player--say, a private company--chooses its strategy as a best
reply, in order to maximize its own profit. If the policy to be implemented
makes reference to specific parameters that will be observed in the future, such
as inflation or unemployment rates, determining the optimal choice for the
leading player leads to challenging mathematical problems. These will be
investigated within the present research. As a further direction, the study of
dynamic blocking problems is motivated by models describing the spatial
spreading of a forest fire, or of a chemical contamination. The optimal
allocation of resources, in the containment effort, poses novel mathematical
questions which will also be addressed by the present project.
