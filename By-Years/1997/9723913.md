Evans 9723913 Anthropogenic activity is having a dramatic impact on ecosystem
nitrogen dynamics. Nitrogen is the element that most often limits growth, and
species-specific responses to changes in nitrogen dynamics can alter species
composition and decrease biodiversity. Natural variation of stable isotopes of
nitrogen ('5N; IN) can provide new insights into dynamics of plant nitrogen use.
The forms of nitrogen absorbed by plants have very different isotopic
compositions (FIN), so plant of N may be a powerful tool to quantify acquisition
of nitrogen from different sources. A common assumption is that foliar oven
depends solely on the own of the nitrogen source, but it is now apparent that
variation in foliar 6~sN can also result from physiological processes within the
plant. This study will provide a mechanistic understanding of the factors that
control plant own and outlines a physiologically-based model that can be used to
quantify absorption of nitrogen from different sources. The significance of the
proposed research is that a mechanistic understanding of the factors controlling
plant 6~sN in combination with a physiologicallybased model will provide a tool
to quantify acquisition of nitrogen from different sources within the
environment, enabling us to increase our fundamental understanding of plant
nitrogen dynamics.
