This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a
state-of-the-art three-dimensional flow measurement system to enhance Purdue
Northwest's capacity to conduct fundamental research and foster
multidisciplinary research collaborations, including those with regional
industries. The award will give faculty and more than 50 undergraduate and
graduate students-- particularly female and first-generation university
students-- access to state-of-the art instrumentation. The research will provide
new knowledge leading to advances in renewable energy, regenerative medicine and
the development of micro air vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation
will serve as a catalyst for fundamental research on complex flows. Flow
phenomena are fundamental to a range of important multidisciplinary research
problems including turbulence, bio-fluid mechanics, and wind energy. These
phenomena are naturally three-dimensional with complexities that previous flow
measurement techniques, such as digital PIV, were unable to resolve. The
instrumentation's particle tracking capabilities allow complex three-dimensional
flow to be measured and characterized with high spatial resolution and accuracy.
This will enable the researchers to gain a new understanding of three-
dimensional fundamental flow physics, such as the lift generation/augmentation
mechanisms in flapping flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
