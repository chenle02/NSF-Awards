James Howell Hunt IOS-0819807 SGER: Microarray analysis of caste ontogeny in a
social insect

The interplay of environment and development shapes individuals and animal
societies. The starting point, however, is in the genes. New tools of molecular
biology are giving new insights into roles played by each factor: genes,
environment, and development; and how they relate to one another in shaping the
natural world. Social insects, including pest ants and termites, pose special
challenges to understanding. Thus, it is both timely and important to take
advantage of new molecular biology technologies to identify specific genes that
are affected by the environment as they regulate the development of a social
insect colony. A simple insect society is more suitable for experimental
molecular biology than are large colonies of fire ants or termites. The
objective of the research, therefore, is to employ a new molecular tool, a
microarray of genes, to identify specific genes in a paper wasp species that are
affected by the environment as they regulate the development of workers and
reproductives in the wasp colony. An important broader impact of the research is
that the results should be widely applicable to ants, bees, and termites,
including economically important species such as pest ants and endangered
pollinators such as bumble bees. As an additional broader impact, undergraduate
students will be given training and experience in several levels of biological
research (behavior, ecology, molecular biology), and these students will go on
to advanced training and careers in conservation, ecology, or biomedicine. To
learn the molecular basis of development in a colony of social insects can be
the gateway to new and deeper understanding of the interplay of genes,
environment, and development, and it can also give us new research tools for
future investigations for both control and protection of some of the world's
most ecologically important insects.
