This proposal provides support for an innovative education symposium at the 2013
Materials Research Society Spring Meeting in San Franciso, CA entitled "Towards
a lab to classroom Initiative". Participants in this symposium will discuss
challenges associated with bringing in sync the development of new research
methodologies and an accelerated pace of new materials discoveries with slower
evolving textbooks and curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, President Obama
announced the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) and this program specifically
champions the development of materials through the collaboration of
computational science and experimental design. The marriage of these two
requires researchers with cross-disciplinary skills, and this educational
symposium 2013 Materials Research Society Spring Meeting in San Franciso will
explore new methods for the training of future scientists and engineers for the
MGI.
