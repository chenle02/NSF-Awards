This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase equipment for
upgrading the computational facility for geochemistry research in the Department
of Geology and Geophysics at Yale University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed. The upgrade will consist in adding
computer memory, disk space, and improving the graphics capability of the
existing system. The upgraded system will be used primarily in research projects
such as the quantum mechanical study of silicates, molecular dynamics of glasses
and melts, Monte Carlo simulations of crystal growth and dissolution, molecular
studies of heterogeneous kinetics (including adsorption and mineral
dissolution), and modeling of fluid flow and chemical reactions in sedimentary
basins.
