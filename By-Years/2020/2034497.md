This I-Corps project is based on deep learning algorithms developed using data
from patients with sleep disorders and other neurological conditions. We created
a unique deep neural network, composed of both a convolutional and recurrent
modules, and trained the model on a unique set of 10,000 clinical
polysomnography (PSG) results, the world's largest collection of clinical PSGs
assembled to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential
of this I-Corps project revolves around its simplicity and accuracy. The benefit
for patients is to enable them and their family members to perform accurate home
testing with comfort. Meanwhile, physicians would receive real time diagnostic
information about their patients, leading to earlier treatment. For insurance
providers and hospitals, costs are drastically reduced as outcomes improve and
fewer resources and staff are required. Apart from the healthcare industry, our
project would also translate well into the general population, where wearables
and health tracking devices are becoming commonplace. Being able to review the
framework of one's sleep, with an accurate depiction of multiple characteristics
including sleep staging, appeals to the consumer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
