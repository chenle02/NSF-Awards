With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry at Colorado State University will acquire an X-ray diffractometer with
CCD detector and low-temperature system. The research to be supported by this
X-ray instrumentation covers a broad range of organic, inorganic,
organometallic, and materials chemistry. The new X-ray diffraction system will
serve the structural needs of six major users and eight other users at Colorado
State University and at least eight other academic researchers in the
Colorado/Wyoming region. The instrumentation will impact the research of well
over 100 undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows; support
the hands-on instruction and training in diffraction-based structural chemistry
provided by existing courses at Colorado State and regional institutions; and
support the ability to provide demonstrations of X-ray diffraction methods to
visitors, high school chemistry groups, and K-12 teachers (through Colorado
State's Center for Science, Mathematics, and Technology
Education).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
Such structural studies have a large impact in a number of areas, especially in
the synthesis of important organic and inorganic chemicals and in understanding
chemical interactions with biomolecules.&lt;br/&gt;
