Proposal #: 0341734 TITLE: Verification of Security Run-Time Verification
Systems PI: Karl N Levitt CoPI: Raju Pandey

Through runtime verification (RTV) a system's behavior is checked against a
specification. Almost always, specifications are easier to create and are more
efficient in execution than code, thus making RTV an appealing approach to
determine if a system is performing as expected. This project addresses new
aspects of RTV: (1) to detect security incidents using the technique of
specification-based intrusion detection originally developed at UC Davis, (2) to
check that response measures taken to mitigate an attack in progress and to
effect recovery perform as expected, (3) to use automated formal methods (i.e.,
ACL2) to verify the specifications for RTV with respect to overall security
policies, (policies will be developed for Unix privileged programs and for
numerous network protocols), (4) to seek a general approach to RTV that unifies
security and fault tolerance, and (5) to use the NASA test-bed to run
experiments on an RTV (security attacks and natural faults) to identify
components of the specifications that are needed in practice and to develop
metrics for the effectiveness of RTVs, e.g., false positive and false negative
rates.
