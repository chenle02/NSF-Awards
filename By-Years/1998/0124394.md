The proposal plans to connect Gallaudet to MAX and then to the Abilene Network
to enhance research into quality of service at a national level with experiments
focused on improving the delivery of sign language and captioned video over the
Internet. The proposed connectivity will more closely connect researchers at
Gallaudet University to their current collaborators at other universities and
will enable Gallaudet researchers to expand their efforts to move the
applications they are developing beyond the edge of their campus. Although the
research described in the proposal is not standard or traditional, it may
contribute significantly to improving applications which will improve
accessibility to the Internet.
