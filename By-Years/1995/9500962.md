Curtis Greene and Lynne Butler will continue their research into problems in
algebraic and enumerative combinatorics, with special emphasis on the role of
discrete structures such as posets, lattices, and tableaux in the representation
theory of classical groups and corresponding problems for symmetric functions.
Greene will focus on the combinatorics and representation theory underlying
certain families of symmetric functions which have non-commutative analogues.
Butler will continue her work on Hall polynomials, investigate the order
analogues of face lattices of some regular polytopes, and study combinatorial
properties of Macdonald's two-variable Kostka functions. This research is in the
general area of Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods
to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of
discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example,
the design of large networks, such as thus occurring in telephone systems, and
the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects,
and this makes use of combinatorial research.
