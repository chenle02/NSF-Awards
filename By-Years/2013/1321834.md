The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international
organization in the field of natural language processing and computational
linguistics. The ACL's annual conference is the major international conference
in this field. This project is to subsidize travel, conference and housing
expenses of students selected to participate in the ACL Student Research
Workshop, which will take place during the main ACL conference on August 4-9,
2013 in Sofia, Bulgaria. The Student Research Workshop accepts papers in two
categories: thesis/research proposal and general research papers. The
thesis/research proposal can have only one author who must be a student. The
research papers can have multiple authors, with the first author being a
student. The workshop is organized and run by students.

The Student Research Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next
generation of natural language processing researchers to enter the research
community. It allows the students in the field to take an important step towards
becoming professional computational linguists by receiving critical feedback on
their work from experts outside of their dissertation committee, and by making
contacts with other students and senior researchers in their field. The students
who are involved in running and reviewing for the student workshop also gain
valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the
researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The ACL Student
Research Workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled
and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing community.
