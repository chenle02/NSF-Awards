The Museum of Northern Arizona has a unique collection of Navajo rugs and
blankets that document a continuum of change in the technological development of
Navajo weaving from its Pueblo, Spanish, and Anglo- American influenced roots to
its present regional styles. This is one of the best documented collections in
the country. It is a collection that is extensively used by scholars who are
interested in material culture. Large organic materials such as textiles require
special storage favilities. The Museum of Northern Arizona, due to a lack of
space and proper shelving has been forced to fold and stack their textiles,
causing damage to the objects and making them inaccesible for research. The
Museum requires new storage sheving to roll their collection and halt the
deterioration. The storage equipment chosen for this project will retard insect
infestation, protect the textiles from dust, prevent damage to the fibers from
stress due to creases, and redtard photodegr- adation. This equipment will also
make the textiles more accessible to researchers. The collections at the Museum
of Northern Arizona are important for cintinued research in anthropology. Theyt
have great scientific value and the improgvements in storage will sitmulat
additonal research.//
