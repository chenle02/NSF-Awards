0101595&lt;br/&gt;Findley&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Miami's
Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences provides instrumentation to
improve the shared-use scientific instrumentation available to researchers using
the four research ships operated by University of Miami and the Harbor Branch
Oceanographic Institution. These four vessels, R/Vs Seward Johnson, Seward
Johnson II, Edwin Link and Walton Smith, are all operated as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The specific
instrumentation supported by this award includes a variety of environmental
sensors, replacement shipboard computers and related tape and disk storage, and
water sampling bottles. These improvements will be of substantial advantage to
marine scientists using the ships in their research during 2001 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
