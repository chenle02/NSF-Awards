ABSTRACT CTS 95-28845 WALLACE MARYLAND This proposal seeks to understand the
physics of turbulent energy dissipation in the atmospheric surface layer,
especially near the ground. The unique abilities of a 12-sensor hot-wire probe
to measure the velocity vector and the velocity gradient tensor components in
the surface layer will be exploited. From these measurements, the turbulent
dissipation rate can be calculated using conditional analysis and joint
probability density analysis. These measurements can significantly aid in the
ability to model turbulence by two-equation modeling and Large Eddy Simulation.
