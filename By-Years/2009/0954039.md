Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have the potential to monitor the physical world
at an unprecedented spatio-temporal scale. Recently, WSNs have been deployed for
many emerging performance-critical applications such as monitoring important
infrastructures (power grid and bridges) and detecting natural hazards
(volcanoes and earthquakes). However, deeply integrated with the physical world,
WSNs often suffer from significant performance variations caused by
uncertainties including environmental noise, dynamics of physical phenomena, and
network deployment inaccuracy.

This project develops a principled network design and analysis approach to
performance assurance of WSNs. In contrast to existing heuristics-based
solutions, this approach adopts data fusion, an advanced information processing
scheme, to enable sensors to efficiently collaborate in delivering predictable
network performance. This project has four aims: 1) A framework for analyzing
spatio-temporal sensing performance based on established data fusion models. The
analysis captures fundamental relationship between spatio-temporal coverage
defined by event detection and false alarm probabilities, fusion models, network
density, and physical uncertainties including noise and deployment inaccuracy.
2) Data fusion schemes that exploit mobile sensors to reconfigure the capability
of a network in response to physical dynamics. 3) A unified fusion and
communication architecture abstraction that allows developers to implement and
optimize network protocols using group-level primitives. 4) A model-driven
medium access control protocol that can achieve predictable throughput and delay
in collaborative data processing.

This project will have impact in numerous critical applications that require
stringent sensing and communication performance. The results of this project
will be integrated into outreach activities, curriculum development, and student
mentoring.
