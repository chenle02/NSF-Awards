0139490&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program proposal requests support for Dr.
Richard N. Abbott, Appalachian State University, Boone, NC, to conduct a
research of an unusual metamorphic rock called Alpine-type spinel-garnet
peridotite, recently discovered by the PI in the Cuevas River in the Caribbean
nation of the Dominican Republic. Dr. Abbott will be collaborating with
Engineers P.V. Chavez, and V. Silva, Direccion de Mineria (bureau of
mines/geological survey),Santo Domingo, and Dr. Ivan Tavares, Universidad
Autonoma de Santo Domingo. The principal objectives of the research are to
determine and map the relationship between this rock and others in the same
unit; find the source of the boulders, and analyze the samples in the
laboratory. Understanding these unusual rocks will help to refine the current
model of the origin of the islands of the Greater Antilles in the broader
context of the origin of the Caribbean basin. Identifying the geological sources
of these peridotite boulders will provide fundamental first order on the
tectonic processes that have occurred in this part of the Caribbean. Dominicans
will participate in the project through the government's quadrangle mapping
program and will benefit from the resulting geologic map that will be useful for
the development and management of their natural resource. &lt;br/&gt;
