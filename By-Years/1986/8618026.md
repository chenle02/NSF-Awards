The primary objective of this U.S. Yugoslav cooperative research project between
Radoslav Adzic of the University of Belgrade's Institute of Electrochemistry and
Ernest Yeager of Case Western Reserve University's Department of Chemistry is to
investigate the electrocatalytic effects and reactions on surfaces modified by
foreign metal adatoms. Through these joint experiments and observations, the
investigators propose to predict the catalytic properties of electrodes. Such
research could have important applications in electrochemical energy conversion
and metal deposition. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board
on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint fund
consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The
U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State and no NSF
funds are involved. The grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and
made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Funds include travel for U.S.
scientists to Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'
living expenses in the U.S.
