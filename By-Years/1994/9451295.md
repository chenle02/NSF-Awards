9451295 Martin A compact (15 day) intensive (7.5 hour/day) laboratory-based
course in Biotechniques extends the undergraduates' understanding of
biotechnology. The course is team taught by three faculty with expertise in each
of the areas emphasized in the course: 1) cell and tissue culture and applied
immunology; 2) PCR and recombinant DNA; and 3) protein purification and enzyme
assay. The course complements previous courses in molecular biology by: 1)
utilizing and reinforcing concepts established in Genetics and Cell Physiology,
2) giving students a realistic and significant laboratory experience, and 3)
extending the students' exposure to key methods in biotechnology.
