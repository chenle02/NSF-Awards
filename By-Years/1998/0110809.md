Foxtail millet is a minor grain consumed by people in some parts of Asia, and is
thus of potential value to Third-World agriculture. This project studies the
genome of foxtail millet to determine how similar it is to its relative corn,
and also to determine similarities to wild grasses. A genome map will be
developed by studying the offspring of crosses between foxtail millet and its
wild ancestor, green millet. One such cross has&lt;br/&gt;already been done by
scientists at the John Innes Centre (JIC) in Norwich, England; they have used
genes from millet and from rice to determine the structure of the millet genome.
Using their plant material, several regions of the millet genome were identified
that control the size and shape of the seed head, which influences the amount of
grain produced. The specific goals in this project are to: 1. Locate genes from
corn in the plants from the JIC. This will allow determination of which corn
genes also function in millet, based on map position. 2. Place developmentally
important genes on the JIC map to determine if they map to any of the regions
known to affect the structure of the seed head. If they map to the same region,
it will not prove that they control seed head development, but if they map
elsewhere, then they can be excluded as candidates. 3. Make another cross
between the two millet species to create a second, larger set of plants, to
replicate the experiment. 4. Begin development of near-isogenic lines from our
plants and the JIC plants, to verify the results of the mapping studies. The
characterstics that distinguish green millet and foxtail millet are not unusual
for grass species. They are mostly quantitative changes in the relatives sizes
and numbers of parts, the sorts of changes that distinguish most species of
grasses. This study will thus help understand the genes in foxtail millet, but
will also provide a glimpse of the genetic basis of plant
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
