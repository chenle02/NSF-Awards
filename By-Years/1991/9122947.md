This award is for support of a two year study to test a preliminary
magnetostratigraphic correlation which was developed for Strand Fjord, Axel
Heiberg Island, N.W.T., Canada. In addition to extending the section to younger
(Eocene) and older (Campaign- Maastrichtian) sediments, an in-depth
lithostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic study will be made of a laminated
lagoonal sequence at Strand Fjord. This sequence affords a nearly unique
opportunity to obtain a Late Cretaceous polar paleoclimate record of annual
variability that also extends into the Milankovitch frequency band.
