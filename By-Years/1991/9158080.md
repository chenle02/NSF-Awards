The proposed research involves nonlinear optical laser methods developed to
obtain information about structure, reactions and dynamics at molecular
surfaces. A new surface circular dichroism spectroscopy is described. Studies
will focus on chemical reactions of ozone-depleting chlorocompounds at the ice-
vapor interface, and on the mechanism of antifreeze activity of some proteins at
the ice/water interface.
