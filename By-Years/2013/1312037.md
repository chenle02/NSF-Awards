This award provides support for the U.S. annual dues to four, separate
International Geoscience Unions that are part of the International Council for
Science (ICSU): International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG),
International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), International Union of Soil
Sciences (IUSS), and International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA). This
award also provides support for the U.S. National committees (USNC) to each of
these Unions. The role of the USNC's is to facilitate participation of American
scientists in the activities of the international unions, engage the U.S.
community in advancing geosciences in the U.S. and abroad; establish strong
links to and foster communications with the respective international unions;
exercise U.S. leadership in these unions; develop a globally aware U.S.
geoscience community that collaborates internationally; and support the
development of early-career U.S. geoscientists.
