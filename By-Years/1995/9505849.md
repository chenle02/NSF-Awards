9505849 Martin A winter-time meteorological phenomenon known as an inverted
trough has been shown to be associated with extreme weather events such as heavy
snow with high winds. To date, however, there has been little study of inverted
troughs. The goal of this research is to investigate the mesoscale structure,
evolution and precipitation distribution associated with inverted troughs. This
research will be accomplished by using detailed data sets acquired during the
already completed Stormscale Operational and Research Meteorology-Fronts
Experiment, Systems Test (STORM-FEST) field program, along with an advanced
mesoscale numerical model. By adding to the current understanding of the
processes responsible for the production of mesoscale precipitation bands in the
Northern Great Plains winter cyclones, the results of this research will help to
improve short-term weather forecasting in the region. ***
