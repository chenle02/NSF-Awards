The Annual Meeting of the Association for Education Communications and
Technology (AECT) provides a forum for interchange of ideas around designing
technological support for learning and training. Its Early Career Symposia
provide an avenue for early career scholars to receive mentoring from
established researchers.

The 2012 Annual Meeting has the theme, "Learning in an Age of Globalization,"
and mentors for the Early Career Symposium are among the leaders in this area
and, more generally, instructional and educational technology. This project
supports travel for advanced graduate students and new faculty from U.S.
universities to attend the Annual Meeting and Early Career Symposium. Sessions
during the Symposium are designed to help collaborators imagine forward-looking
and viable technology-oriented research agendas, identify the types of
collaborators who complement their strengths, and identify the funding agencies
and programs that might support their work. An important goal of the Symposium
is to add to the community of researchers interested in ways that technology can
transform teaching and learning.

This activity supports the mission of NSF to train more advanced professionals
in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. This conference is one
among many that researchers in the cyberlearning community regularly attend.
Mentors come from the AECT community as well as from the learning sciences
community.
