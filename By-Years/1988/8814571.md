This three year research program will investigate the physical mechanisms that
(a) give rise to a major mode of low frequency near-global climate variability
and (b) are responsible for the evolutionary atmospheric features that allow
successful short-term (seasonal to inter-annual) climate prediction. The primary
data base for this analysis will be a 16-year simulation of the general
circulation model from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting
which was forced by observed global sea surface temperatures. The knowledge
gained from (a) and (b) will be used to construct a highly parameterized
numerical model of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system that may be capable, in
certain instances, of making successful ultra long-range climate forecasts. This
work is important because it will enhance our understanding of interannual
climate variations associated with El Nino and the Southern Oscillation
phenomenon.
