This award will support an observational program to compare various techniques
for the determination of ages in several nearby star clusters. Currently, a
number of different techniques are used for cluster ages, and they each suffer
from various random and systematic errors that limit their use for finding
absolute (as opposed to relative) ages. This group will investigate the accuracy
and size of errors for four different techniques: (1) comparison of stellar data
against theoretical models, (2) the mass-dependence of lithium abundances, (3)
the decline of rotation rates with time, and (4) the relation between age and
magnetic activity. The goal is to assess the accuracy of each technique and
understand how to translate ages from one technique to the age scale from the
others.

Improvements in the accuracy of stellar ages should have broad implications for
understanding the history of stellar populations and the evolution of our Milky
Way Galaxy. This project will provide many research opportunities for
undergraduate students, especially through an ongoing partnership with Fisk
College. The data from this project will also be used as calibrating data for
future telescope surveys.
