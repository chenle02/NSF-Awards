ABSTRACT This EAGER proposal is aimed at the development of an adjuvant intra-
operative therapeutic method that will address several critical needs for
treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as well as other
cancer types to ensure clean surgical margins, prevent tumor recurrence, improve
patients survival rates, and enhance their quality of life. This goal will be
achieved through a novel plasmonic nanobubble (PNB) approach that combines
intra-cellular application of four clinical modalities: encapsulated drugs
(Doxil), gold nanoparticles (colloidal gold), near-infrared laser pulses of low
energy, and X-rays. This method is referred to as quadrapeutics. The translation
into clinical practice will be achieved through the folowing objectives: 1)
Optimization of the PNB generation and detection methods in vivo and validation
of the use of PNBs for the intra-operative diagnosis of MRD in mice. 2) Adopt
the PNB and quadrapeutic methods for intraoperative adjuvant therapy of
microscopic residual disease in unresectable HNSCC tumors in a mice model.
