This award funds a project to investigate the utility of peatland in eastern
North America as archives of climate information. The researchers will conduct
multi-proxy paleoclimate studies in peatland areas located in the Canadian
Maritime provinces, northern Minnesota, and southwest Ontario. Stable isotope
studies will examine the unique hydrology of ombrotrophic peatlands and further
understand late Holocene climate variability based on tree-rings and pollen.
Most tree-ring records from the region extend only a few centuries and pollen
sequences record responses to climate change but often lag and/or mask abrupt
changes. The researchers aim to develop high-resolution and climate-sensitive
datasets from peatlands to document climate variability during the past 3,000
years in the region.

The research will help quantify regional responses of forest ecosystems to
climate change and support interdisciplinary training for a post-doctoral
researcher and several undergraduate students.
