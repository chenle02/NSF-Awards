This SGER project will examine the feasibility of generating ice in the
decompression region of a supersonic jet, followed by a supersonic ice-blasting
abrasion for the removal of paint and corrosion from a broad variety of
industrial structures. This approach will replace sand blasting abrasion, which
has significant environmental and economic drawbacks. The ability to generate at
the desired location ice crystals of appropriate size for abrasive purposes has
to be demonstrated. Various abrasive particles, that become residue immediately
after abrasion, are replaced by water that is available at almost any location.
A simplified analytical model for flow and heat transfer around small particles
entrained by a supersonic jet indicates that water droplets will be formed. The
proposed experiments will test the model assumptions, identify other related
phenomena, and finally test the feasibility of the approach. This exploratory
research is relevant to environmentally benign manufacturing (e.g. abrasive
blasting of nuclear power facilities or coated mills) and to maintaining the
civil infrastructure (e.g. cleaning of the lead-based paints from bridges, large
structures and equipment, as well as toxic sandblasting storage).
