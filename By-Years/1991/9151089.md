The Department of Geology is purchasing a semi-automated x-ray diffraction unit
to teach modern x-ray diffraction techniques in the undergraduate geology
curriculum. Students are using the technique to study crystal structures and
mineralogy, introductory mineralogy and petrology courses, and in advanced
courses in optical mineralogy, petrography, glacial and Quaternary geology,
sedimentary petrology, archaeological geology, and economic geology. The
diffractometer is also being used by undergraduates in independent research
projects.
