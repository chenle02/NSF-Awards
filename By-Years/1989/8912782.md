U.S. society has adopted and adapted scientific techniques for purposes of
social control of risk. These techniques incorporate numerous, and potentially
large, uncertainties. They also serve numerous, different social goals--
scientific accuracy, social acceptability, the need for timely decisions,
consistency over time, fairness to the parties concerned, protection of public
health and environments, etc.--although most commentators have emphasized only
the aim of scientific accuracy. The law has developed a number of evidentiary
procedures to guide decision making under uncertainty and to serve the many
social goals a legal system has. Using aspects of the law as a model, this
interdisciplinary team aims to design evidentiary rules for carcinogen risk
assessment that can help to reduce some of the uncertainties and serve better
some of the social goals of risk assessment. The research involves determining
which evidentiary rules used in legal proceedings might be adapted for use in
carcinogen risk assessments and examining the impact their adoption might have
on the social goals of these assessments. During this phase, research will focus
on serving the goals of scientific accuracy and expeditiousness, which may
conflict, and on developing procedures that can serve other goals of risk
assessment and adjudicate conflicting goals and evidentiary procedures. Results
will be disseminated in presentations and via appropriate scholarly and public
policy journals. This approach offers a broader perspective on risk assessment.
It recognizes the substantial uncertainties inherent in it, provides a
comprehensive way of coping with them and offers some wider alternatives for
thinking about the process. This project involves a collaboration between a
biochemist/pharmacologist, statistician, environmental engineer, resource
economist and legal philosopher. The topic is very important; the research team,
well qualified; institutional support is good. Results are likely to be of high
quality and broadly disseminated. Support is therefore recommended.
