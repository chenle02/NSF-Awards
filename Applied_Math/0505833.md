Title: Electromagnetic Resonance in Periodic Structures

The subject is motivated by the abundance of analytical problems generated by
interesting phenomena of scattering and resonance of electromagnetic fields,
which comprise a set of basic tools for the design of photo-electronic devices.
The driving phenomenon is the existence of photonic frequency stop-bands for
periodically structured materials, called photonic crystals, which is the source
of the richness of their resonant behavior. One of the salient problems of
current interest is anomalous transmission of source fields through periodic
slabs near resonant frequencies, corresponding to weakly leaky guided slab
modes. The project addresses the mathematics of this and related problems on
several fronts: We use the complex-analytic theory of boundary-integral
operators to obtain asymptotic formulas for the structure of transmission
anomalies near non-robust slab modes; we pursue a development of the spectral
theory for general open systems, such as leaky slabs, based on the concept of
the unique conservative extension of a dissipative system; and we investigate
the existence theory of modes and optimization of the associated resonant
phenomena, as well as efficient numerical schemes for their simulation.
Collaborators include S. Venakides, A. Figotin, D. Volkov, R. Lipton, and O.
Bruno.

Because of their capacity to block electromagnetic waves at selected frequencies
and to trap energy, photonic crystals have become a subject of intense research
in recent decades. Applications include high-efficiency lasers and filters,
waveguides, and directional antennas. Engineering of these devices relies on
precise tuning of resonant frequencies, transmission-vs.-frequency profiles, and
the interaction of open electromagnetic resonators with their surrounding
medium. This project aims to set the theoretical framework of these resonant
phenomena on a solid mathematical footing. The central theme is the frequency-
response theory of open resonators, which provides the framework for the guiding
of light and other radiation by structures, precise computation of the
interaction of guided energy with applied sources, and optimization of resonant
properties. Numerical computations and experimental results from the literature
will guide the theoretical investigations. The project involves an undergraduate
student and a graduate student as research assistants. The undergraduate has
been assisting the PI in numerical simulations and will be part of a
collaboration with the computational electromagnetics group at Cal Tech. The
graduate student will pursue her Ph.D. on the subject of resonant scattering by
periodic pillars.
