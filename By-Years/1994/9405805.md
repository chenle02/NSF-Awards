9405805 Craig This award provides 75% of the funds required for the acquisition
of a microscope system for use with transmitted and reflected light to be used
in the rare gas isotope laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the
University of California, San Diego. The University is committed to providing
the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The microscope system is
mainly to be used by researchers working with fluid, glass, and crystalline
inclusions trapped in samples of basaltic rocks that have been extruded from the
Earth's mantle. The microscope is needed for the location and identification of
these small inclusions prior to extraction of the rare gases (argon, helium, and
neodymium) for isotopic analysis. The researchers at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography are using the isotopic content of the rare gases brought up from
the mantle to understand the geochemical evolution of the mantle. ***
