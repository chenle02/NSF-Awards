PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will unite science education
researchers and education policy researchers in the common task of exploring
approaches for identifying, analyzing and addressing shared problems in order to
catalyze research in the area of science education policy. The focus of the
proposed conference will be on two major policy issues: &lt;br/&gt;--Models of
teacher preparation and their impact on policies regarding &lt;br/&gt;teacher
certification and professional development, and&lt;br/&gt;--Articulating common
standards--fewer, clearer, higher--for both generalist science education and
career-oriented science education.&lt;br/&gt;About 40 experienced, influential
science educations researchers and education policy researchers will be invited
to this conference, along with about 10 promising, new science education
researchers. The conference will be organized not only to provide fruitful
discussions about the science education policy research that exists, but to
maximize opportunities to develop productive collaborations for the science
education policy research that is needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although science
education research has been relatively effective in developing theories of
science teaching, learning, and assessment and in studying how these theories
play out in classrooms, the effects on science education is small in scale, and
there has been little influence on policymaking. On the other hand, while
general education policy research may address more directly the reform
challenges faced by policymakers, schools, and school systems, such research
rarely addresses issues of specific concern to science teaching and learning.
This conference will bring together policy actors, policy analysts, scientists,
and science educators. The discussion among these four expert groups should lead
to collaborations that build the capacity for the improvement of science
education through informed policy.
