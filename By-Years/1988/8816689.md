This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase a mass
spectrometer. The instrument will be installed, operated and maintained in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Rochester. The University
will provide the remaining funds required for the purchase of the mass
spectrometer. The new equipment is needed for research projects in the
Department of Geological Sciences and will be capable of measuring the isotopic
compositions of the rare gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe in geological samples. As a
class of geologic tracers, the rare gases are able to provide constraints on
past processes due to their lack of chemical reactivity and highly mobile
behavior. The isotopic composition of the rare gases will be applied to studies
of the evolution of mid-ocean ridges and oceanic volcanic islands, the origin of
methane in natural gases and the rate of groundwater flow in shallow aquifers.
