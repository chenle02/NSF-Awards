The study of the rational numbers and their generalizations (number fields) has
occupied mathematicians for thousands of years, and today is the principal
object of algebraic number theory. In the past century, giant leaps of
understanding have been made by exploring the analogy between number fields and
function fields in positive characteristic. In this latter setting, arithmetic
becomes geometry and vice versa, allowing the techniques, tools, and intuitions
from one to be applied with great effect to the other, leading to new and
important insights, results, and conjectures. The research of the PI will
continue and develop this tradition in new directions. Additionally, the PI will
leverage his administrative role as Associate Head for Undergraduate Programs at
the University of Arizona to collect and analyze data on student challenges, and
devise strategies to increase student success in the mathematical sciences.

The project will continue to develop a new analogue of Iwasawa theory for
function fields by investigating the structure and growth of the p-divisible
groups of the Jacobians associated to a pro-p branched Galois tower of curves
over a finite field of characteristic p. These p-divisible groups break up into
three pieces: an etale part, a multiplicative part, and a local-local part. In
previous work, the PI proved under very general hypotheses that the etale and
multiplicative parts exhibit regular and predictable behavior in any such tower.
While the local-local part can in many ways be as wild as the imagination
allows, the PI and his collaborators have recently formulated several
conjectures which posit striking regularity and predictability, and have proved
some fundamental instances of these conjectures by leveraging ideas and tools
from Dwork theory. The project will continue this research by adapting these
methods to handle more general situations, aiming to prove the conjectures in
full.
