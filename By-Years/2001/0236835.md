A novel nano-device-a bipolar thin-film transistor (B-TFT) that is composed of
nanocrystalline silicon (nano-Si)-will be investigated. This kind of device
could open windows of opportunity for future nano-electronic and -optoelectronic
devices and circuits on low-temperature substrates. We plan to carry out this
research through the following steps: 1) to design the new transistor and
fabrication processes, 2) to investigate advanced low-temperature PECVD
processes for intrinsic, p-, and n-type nano-Si films for B-TFT, and 3) to
fabricate and to characterize the complete nano-Si B-TFTs. The highest process
temperature will be 250 C. We will explore the performance-limiting factors of
B-TFT with respect to variations of the nano-Si properties. This project will
include the PI, one graduate student, and one undergraduate student.
Participating students will be exposed to interdisciplinary educational
opportunity in nano-Si materials, low temperature transistor processes, and
semiconductor characterization.
