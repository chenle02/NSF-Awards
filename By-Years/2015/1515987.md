This program will develop a 2-dimensional map of the ionosphere of Mars using a
combination of numerical models and MARSIS radar sounder measurements. The
results will be used to explore the relationship between the structure of the
ionosphere and crustal magnetic anomalies.

In terms of broader impacts, the work will train a female postdoctoral
researcher of underrepresented ethnicity, a graduate student, and a succession
of undergraduate students. It will stimulate comparative work involving Earth's
auroral ionosphere, which will encourage the transfer of ideas and methods
between terrestrial and planetary disciplines.
