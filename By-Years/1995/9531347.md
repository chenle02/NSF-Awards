Dr. Lon Knight and other members of the Chemistry Department at Furman
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. The REU students are joined by 20 additional undergraduate
researchers and visiting faculty members from regional colleges to form a
vibrant research community with a strong record of co-publication.
