This award will provide support for three years for the Valley Geometry
Seminar, an activity of Five Colleges, Inc.; the organizers of the seminar
include faculty from Amherst College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The activity focuses on a weekly
series of lectures given by local speakers or experts from other colleges and
universities; visits will last from one day to one week. During some semesters,
the seminar will center on a single topic; one miniconference will be held each
year. Topics for the seminars and miniconferences may include string theory,
minimal surfaces, intersection homology, partial differential equations and
Riemannian geometry, Teichmuller theory, and mixed Hodge theory. The main goal
of this activity is to enhance the research atmosphere in the Five College area
and to encourage the research activities of the seminar participants.
