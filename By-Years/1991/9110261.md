SIMD (Single Instruction stream, Multiple Data stream) and VLIW (Very Long
Instruction Word) architectures have been successful as targets for
parallelizing compilers in large part because they resolve synchronizations
statically, at compile-time, yielding zero run-time cost for synchronization
between processes. However, since SIMD and VLIW machines support only a single
control flow thread, they cannot execute distinct loops, conditional statements,
subroutine calls, nor even variable-time-instructions in parallel. Hence, much
program parallelism must be ignored, and the resulting serialization of code can
dramatically reduce speedup and efficiency. Recently, a new architecture called
barrier MIMD (Multiple Instruction stream, Multiple Data stream) architectures
has been introduced as a new parallel MIMD architecture that can retain the
static scheduling advantages of SIMD and VLIW, but also execute in parallel
almost any programming language construct. The result is that a far larger
amount of program parallelism can be exploited by a parallelizing compiler and
efficiently executed on a barrier MIMD. The objective of this project is to
improve and advance the compiler technology capable of exploiting barrier MIMD
hardware. Instruction and data memory hardware designs which exploit static,
compile-time knowledge to dramatically increase barrier MIMD performance will
also be investigated.
