Daily life relies increasingly on the smooth operation of a class of industries
in which accident probabilities are low, but any one accident can result in
extensive human and ecological destruction. These industries include, for
instance, oil and chemical processing, nuclear power production, waste
management, and aviation and other transportation modes. Safe operation requires
appropriate action and reaction when anomalies occur, when standardization does
not provide the answer, and when gaps appear between the patterned responses of
a closed system and the social and cultural dynamics of its use. Post-accident
analyses reveal that to understand how to design a safe technology is not the
same as understanding what is required to operate it safely. Other kinds of
knowledge in addition to algorithms or mathematical analyses are needed for
operators and managers to create and maintain safe conditions, such as
sociological and cultural analyses of work systems, communication patterns, and
organizational structures. Integrating 'hard' and 'soft' knowledge is
particularly challenging in these industries. This project undertakes an
examination and analysis of the semantics and rhetorics of the discourses of
technical experts and of social and behavioral scientists in order to improve
approaches to safe operations. Technical materials derive from the nuclear power
industry, drawing on field notes, industry documents, interviews, workshop
notes, and incident reports. Social science materials consist of accident
investigation reports and studies of high hazard industries. The materials are
analyzed for differences in their characterization of evidence and attitudes
towards types of knowledge, presentation of claims and justifications,
interpretation of various kinds of data, and the intersection of technical and
everyday discourses. The study will propose criteria to improve mutual
understanding. Technical experts and scholars will comment on interim results.
Dissemination plans include articles and presentations at professional and
industry meetings.
