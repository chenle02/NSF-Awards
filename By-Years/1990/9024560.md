The high polar latitudes are amongst the most sensitive to climatic changes. In
the summer of 1991 an international team of three ice-breakers will depart on a
70 day expedition to explore and sample the largely unknown eastern sector of
the central Arctic. This award will support the collection of upwards of 90
sediment cores to provide the scientific community with the first major
collection of core materials from the interior of this ocean basin. In addition,
the type of materials to be collected (i.e. boxcores, giant gravity cores, and
large diameter piston cores) are designed to overcome the poor coretop recovery
and very narrow core diameter limitations present in the existing cores. This
research will focus on Arctic Ocean sediments deposited during the last 25,000
years to address questions of the temporal and geographic variability in the
stable isotopic signature of Arctic surface waters and the response of the
central Arctic Ocean to mid-Holocene warming (i.e. Hypsithermal). This work will
also help to define the extent and disintegration pattern of the late
Weichselian Ice Sheets in the Eurasian Arctic.
