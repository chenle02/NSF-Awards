9353996 Bayer The project provides funds for four workshop sessions to introduce
participants to the use of "real world chemistry" in their laboratory courses.
An existing set of experiments - familiar to and preferred by individual
instructors - are placed into a real-world context appropriate for the local
community. Students become "chemist employees" in the laboratory of a local
organization or industry and work on these experiments reformulated as current
projects of that organization's laboratory. The "transformation process"
describes how science teachers without real-world experience can search out
chemists in their local area and extract useful scenarios that can be added to
existing introductory experiments. The process has provided an enthusiastic
response from students and motivation for further consideration of a science
career. ***
