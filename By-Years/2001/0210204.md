This award supports a U.S.-South Africa planning meeting for an international
social science workshop to foster collaborative research and education. The
planning meeting will take place in Pretoria, South Africa in January 2002.
Seven U.S. participants in the planning group wish to establish a more coherent
and better coordinated international social science agenda, including a focus on
research, education, and training. If successful, the goal is to expand the
collaboration to include other countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and South
America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizer of the planning meeting, Willie
Pearson, Jr. of Georgia Tech, will work with his counterpart in South Africa,
Tyron Pretorius of the University of the Western Cape. An organizing committee
will be comprised of an equal number of representatives from the U.S. and South
Africa. Over the course of five days, the group will determine appropriate
location, time, and topics for a workshop to be held in late 2002 or early
2003.. While in South Africa, the group plans to meet with members of the
academic (primarily social science faculty), business, and government funding
communities. This will allow for the discussion to be placed in a broader
societal context as it relates to policies and practices that address issues of
innovation, economic development, social welfare and workforce development.
These discussions will serve a vital function by permitting the committee
members to gain a deeper understanding of the most significant social science
related issues in South Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning meeting will
serve as the beginning of a dialogue (both electronic and verbal) among the
organizing committee members. The end product of the planning meeting will be a
workshop. The resulting collaboration and partnerships will enhance discovery
and understanding between the U.S. and South Africa while promoting teaching,
training, access to higher education, and curriculum reform.
