This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Reproduction of hermaphroditic
leeches: investment in both male and female sexual roles, mating strategies, and
parental care." Many invertebrates are hermaphroditic, capable of mating in both
sexual roles, but little is known about their mating strategies. This research
uses Helobdella stagnalis (a leech that broods its young) and investigates how
hermaphrodites split their reproductive resources between the male versus female
role (sex allocation); how they obtain mates and fertilize eggs (sexual
selection); and their parental care abilities.
