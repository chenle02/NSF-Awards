Reed College will establish a spectroscopy laboratory so that undergraduate
physics majors can employ the powerful techniques of Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy in laboratories at the senior, junior, and sophomore levels. The
flexible, research level Bruker lFS 113V spectrometer will provide the equipment
necessary for senior physics majors to complete their required thesis in at
least two fields of solid state spectroscopy: transmission measurements on
nucleic acids and reflection measurements on high temperature superconductors.
The instrument will also be used for experiments in the Advanced Laboratory and
for demonstrations and limited hands-on experience in the sophomore laboratory.
The instrument will provide excellent preparation of Reed physics majors for
graduate work in experimental physics. In particular, the spectrometer will
provide students with the opportunity to undertake advanced experiments and
research projects, leading to talks at professional meetings. On a broader
scale, this project will establish a serious undergraduate experimental physics
program on the Reed campus.
