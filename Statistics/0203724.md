This research involves development of model selection procedures for linear and
generalized linear mixed models. The focus of this research will be on studying
asymptotic properties and finite sample performance of the procedures, which
will include comparisons to commonly used ad hoc methods. The research will also
develop applications of the selection methodology to selecting factors in
longitudinal data, genetic screening of genes related to quantitative traits of
interest, and to model selection in small area estimation problems from surveys.
In addition, the methods developed will be made accessible through the
development of freely available software. The research will also improve work
recently completed by the investigators where the conditions for consistent
factor selection in linear mixed models were established. These improvements
will include developing a more efficient method for linear mixed model
selection, and studying some adaptive procedures.

Linear and generalized linear mixed models are important classes of models which
allow relaxation of standard assumptions like independence or homogeneity of
variances of observations, and take into account more complicated data
structures in quite general ways. Typical applications include repeated
measurements made on a patient over time or screening of candidate genes that
might be related to a quantitative trait of interest. Selecting which factors
should or should not be in the model can be of importance for model inference
and predictions, yet little if anything has been developed to formally study
this problem. This research attempts to fill this important gap in the field of
developing new procedures for correct factor selection from a theoretical
perspective, and evaluating real-world performance via extensive simulations.
Another important component of this research is to apply it in a variety of
real-world settings including longitudinal data, genetic screening, and small
area estimation in survey sampling.
