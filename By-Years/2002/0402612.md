This project is a collaboration involving a 4-year school, two community
colleges (Illinois Central College and Richland Community College), and an
instrumentation company (National Instruments). The project is improving the
competency of technology students with virtual instrumentation and data
acquisition systems by developing and teaching courses using this technology.
These courses are preparing students for measuring and analyzing real world data
using virtual instruments. The award provides the necessary hardware and
software and the project trains community college faculty members in the use of
the software. The project team, with the help of an experienced evaluator, is
determining how the use of virtual instrumentation affects student learning. The
project team plans to describe their educational materials and evaluation
results in presentations at various conferences, in the education journals, and
on websites, both at the educational institutions and the instrumentation
company.
