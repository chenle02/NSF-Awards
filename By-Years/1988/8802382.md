Mass communications systems are growing rapidly in developing countries.
Because of the expense, radio has become an increasingly important information
source in rural and poor areas. It is important, therefore, to understand how
postcolonial societies are using and integrating this advanced technological
mode of communication with indigenous modes of expression. This project
addresses the relationship between mass media, language, and social identify in
Kitwe, Zambia. The researcher will examine the role of radio in shaping
Zambians'conceptions of themselves and their changing society. She will also see
how popular Bemba and English radio talk shows and dramas vary in the way they
address contemporary social issues. By situating mass communication forms in
their ethnographic, historical, and linguistic contexts, this project will
illuminate the interactive nature of mass communications in a changing society.
