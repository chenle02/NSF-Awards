This research examines probability limits over classes of sets and functions.
Empirical measures can be applied to sets or to functions to define empirical
processes. Earlier results in empirical process theory established that
convergence in distribution to a Gaussian holds uniformly for certain classes of
sets and functions. This research seeks to find larger classes of sets for which
statistical functionals are differentiable and therefore can be approximated by
a process with this convergence property, plus a remainder of lower order.
