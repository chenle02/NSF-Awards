This project is expanding and strengthening undergraduate offerings in animal
behavior and behavioral ecology through the purchase of equipment that makes it
possible to quantify aspects of what has been largely a descriptive field. It
facilitates expansion of the range of techniques introduced and used in the
laboratory exercises of the Animal Behavior course, and increases the diversity
and sophistication of independent study and/or senior thesis projects available
to students interested in these areas. The students use the event recorders to
document sequences and temporal patterning of behavior. Tape recorders, a
sonagraph and a sonogram digitizer are allowing students to record and analyze
vacalization in detail -- critical elements in understanding territoriality,
breeding behavior and other aspects of animal interaction. A motion analyzer
makes possible detailed examination of locomotion, stimulus-response sequences,
and related phenomena.
