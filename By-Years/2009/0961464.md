This study will conduct paleomagnetic analyses of equatorial Pacific sediment
cores spanning the Eocene through the Pleistocene collected during IODP
expeditions 320 and 321. Using high resolution U-channel measurements, this
project will produce a high resolution magnetostratigraphic record that could
serve as a very important chronostratigraphic tool. The project will address
five objectives: 1) refine the shipboard magnetostratigraphies, 2) generate
continuous geomagnetic intensity and directional paleosecular variation records,
3) generate environmental magnetic records, 4) improve the Cenezoic geologic
timescale, and 5) improve our understanding of the Pacific apparent polar
wander.

Broader impacts: The project would support undergraduate and/or graduate
students at the universities of all four PIs. The project also effectively
capitalizes on a large investment previously made in an IODP expedition and
further enhances the collaborations and exchange of information between several
international members of the expedition and the IODP community. By developing
such an important chronological tool that helps refine the geologic timescale
and improves the geomagnetic intensity record, the project significantly impacts
the earth sciences.
