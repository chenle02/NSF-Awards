Dr. Spence is an NSF Young Investigator whose research interests lie in
theoretical and experimental aspects of magnetospheric physics. He will
participate in the energetic particle experiment aboard the Central European
Satellite for Advanced Research. Further, he plans to investigate emerging
solid-state device processing and technologies and develop a novel medium and
energetic particle detection system suitable for future spaceflight
applications. As an NYI, he will also devote considerable effort to teaching.
