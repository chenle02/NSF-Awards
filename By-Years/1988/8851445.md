Augustana College will purchase an audio fast Fourier analysis system, a digital
sampling synthesizer, and a Macintosh II microcomputer system with allociated
software. This equipment will be used to improve instruction in physics courses
for majors and non-majors by allowing students to carry out experiments in the
synthesis and analysis of sound. Physics students will use the equipment in an
advanced laboratory course, while non-majors (including special education and
speech therapy students) will use the equipment in introductory physics
laboratories, and in a special course on the analysis and synthesis of sound.
Augustana College will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
