This grant aims to improve the design and operation of surgical delivery systems
(SDSs). There are four primary research goals. First, develop new models and
methodologies for determining the optimal investment and configuration of
surgical resources under uncertainty. Second, construct advance scheduling
systems that allocate surgeries in a multi-OR setting. Third, develop robust
real-time scheduling systems that consider the impact of unanticipated events on
initial schedules. Fourth, develop a sophisticated discrete-event simulation
model to evaluate the models described above, and compare them to existing
policies. The broader impacts of this project will affect all Americans by
improving the efficiency of a critical part of the health-care delivery system.
ORs account for more than 40 percent of a hospital's revenues, and preliminary
research indicates that these scarce resources are not being optimally deployed.
Faster access to care will directly improve patient outcomes, and more efficient
allocation of ORs will reduce health care costs, and permit health care
providers to focus on other activities.
