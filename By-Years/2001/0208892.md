Conditional branches are expensive. Branches require a
significant&lt;br/&gt;percentage of the execution cycles since they occur
frequently and can&lt;br/&gt;cause pipeline stalls. In addition, branches result
in forks in the&lt;br/&gt;control flow, which can prevent other code-improving
transformations&lt;br/&gt;from being applied. We plan to develop path profile-
based techniques&lt;br/&gt;for replacing the execution of a set of two or more
branches with a&lt;br/&gt;single branch on a conventional scalar processor. We
propose to&lt;br/&gt;improve performance by merging the conditions of two or
more branches&lt;br/&gt;into a single condition. Previous approaches have
accomplished&lt;br/&gt;such merging of conditions that have either only involved
a single&lt;br/&gt;variable or have required special hardware to merge
multiple&lt;br/&gt;conditions together. Techniques will be developed to produce
a merged&lt;br/&gt;condition involving multiple variables that can be used to
bypass the&lt;br/&gt;code testing the original set of conditions on a
conventional processor.&lt;br/&gt;Merging conditions may be very good fit for
run-time optimization&lt;br/&gt;systems, which optimize frequently executed
paths during the execution&lt;br/&gt;of a program.&lt;br/&gt;
