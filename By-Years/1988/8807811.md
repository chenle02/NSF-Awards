The Northwest Coast ethnological collection at the Burke Museum, University of
Washington, is one of the best documented systematic anthropological collections
in the country. Due to its size and quality, the collection is used extensively
by anthropological researchers. However, the existing inadequate storage
facilities have hampered effective use of the collections. To remedy this
problem the curators will renovate their storage facility, complete an
inventory, and computerize information on the collections. These measures will
protect these irreplaceable collections from deterioration and theft. They will
also insure an increase in accessibility thereby stimulating additional
scientific research.
