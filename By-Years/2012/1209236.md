This action funds Michael Makoto Yoshizawa of the University of California,
Santa Barbara to conduct a research project, entitled "Developing a criterion
for the structural complexity of a 3-dimensional space" during the summer of
2012 at Nara Women's University in Nara, Nara Prefecture, Japan. The host
scientist is Professor Tsuyoshi Kobayashi.

This research project aims to improve the understanding of the structure of
3-manifolds, which are spaces with the property that any inhabitants would
perceive their surroundings as 3-dimensional. Thus, 3-manifolds are of interest
due to their resemblance to our own universe. One tool in studying 3-manifolds
is a Heegaard splitting, which is a method of decomposing a 3-manifold into two
simpler pieces. Understanding properties of the Heegaard splitting, such as its
distance (a measure of the splitting's complexity), can yield insight about the
original 3-manifold. This research focuses on developing a new criterion to
identify higher distance Heegaard splittings.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
