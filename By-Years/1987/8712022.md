This grant, in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program, provides
support for development and application of an approximate quantum-mechanical
method for predicting the structures and energies of molecules that are too
large to be treated accurately. Professor Dewar's previous work has been of
immense practical utility in providing theoretical guidance to experimental
organic chemists, and the present project is designed to extend that utility to
molecules containing the biologically important elements phosphorus, sulfur, and
various metal atoms. Specifically, Professor Dewar's previous work has led to
the development of parametric ("semiempirical") quantum mechanical models
(MINDO/3, MNDO, AM1) which are unique in providing results of useful accuracy
for large organic molecules at reasonable cost in computing time. The present
work utilizes improvements in computers to develop a method for treating
electron repulsion and core-electron attraction integrals analytically. This
method is expected not only to be generally superior to AM1 but also extendable
to higher valence states, P(V) being of major interest in biochemistry, and to
transition metals.
