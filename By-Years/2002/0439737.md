This SGER explores reliable patient monitoring through the use of patient-worn
sensors and associated ad-hoc wireless networks. Patient devices offer a unique
environment to investigate, where the receivers are health care providers
requiring reliable and timely delivery of sensor data in various topologies and
across various distances. The PI will investigate wireless network design,
routing and multicast protocols supporting delivery of patient data, and
performance evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;
