Thorne 9417371 Theoretical research will be conducted at the interface between
general relativity theory and astrophysics studying the generation of
gravitational waves by astrophysical objects. A minor additional effort will
study non-gravitational wave aspects of black holes and neutron stars. The
gravitational-wave research will be focused on waves detectable by LIGO (the
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) to identify what wave-
generation computations are needed for LIGO. Of special concern will be the
waves produced in the last ~10 minutes of the life of a binary system made up
from neutron stars or black holes. During these 10 minutes the two bodies spiral
inward, producing approximately 10,000 wave cycles that carry detailed
information about the bodies' orbit, masses, and spins. During the last few
milliseconds the bodies violently coalesce, producing waves that carry
information about the equation of state of nuclear matter in the neutron star
case and about the nonlinear dynamics of space-time curvature in the black hole
case. The resulting waveforms must be computed to high accuracy for use as
theoretical templates in analyzing LIGO data. ***
