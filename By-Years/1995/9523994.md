DMS 9523994 LUECKING This proposal asks for participant support costs for
graduate students and younger researchers to attend the 20th conference of the
University of Arkansas Annual Lecture Series in the Mathematical Sciences. This
conference will bring together researchers in the areas of Banach space theory
and harmonic analysis. Both of these fields are funded by NSF and several of the
main speakers are NSF grantees. The University of Arkansas mathematics
department is taking an active role with volunteer faculty support and financial
support.
