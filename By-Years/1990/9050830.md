This award provides funds to the Biology Department at Texas A &amp; M
University for upgrading instrumentation for an existing course, Principles of
Microscopy. This is an innovative course, covering developments in light
microscopy and digitized image analysis, and emphasizing image recording. The
course will help prepare advanced undergraduate students for careers which use
modern optics and image analysis. Instruments to be purchased include video and
35 mm cameras, computers and software for image analysis, and accessories for
upgrading existing microscopes. The improvements will also benefit students in
other upper division courses, senior honors students executing special projects
and will improve instruction in freshman honors biology. The developments will
enhance the research skills of undergraduates, thereby encouraging them to
pursue graduate education. The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal
sources.
