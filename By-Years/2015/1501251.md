The manufacturing industry has progressed beyond traditional subtractive
processes. Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are emerging as key enabling
practices for modern design and end product development and are revolutionizing
the manufacturing process. The advancement of 3D printing or AM, in both
consumer and commercial markets, is highly dependent upon innovations that
improve printer capabilities, speed, and materials. As new materials are
developed and 3D printers are increasingly capable of utilizing multiple
materials, it is imperative that technicians understand these materials'
properties both individually and as they are combined during the AM process. To
address this gap in the convergence of additive manufacturing and materials, the
Technician Education in Additive Manufacturing and Materials (TEAMM) project
will forge a new collaborative network of public and private sector stakeholders
to address the identification and adaption of skills standards to keep pace with
advances in research and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TEAMM will serve as a
catalyst to engage an international network of stakeholders to ensure that
technician education meets industry standards and needs. TEAMM will improve
access to instructional tools and curriculum modules that keep pace with the
rapid rate of innovation and industry adoption of new and existing materials in
the additive manufacturing and materials processes. Through social networking,
TEAMM will improve education and establish network communications, collaboration
and dissemination in a sustainable manner. TEAMM will support the education and
development of new subject matter experts through professional development and
access to network collaborators. The network will enable subject matter experts
to customize instructional tools and resources to directly respond to and
support the advancement of regional economies, further advancing this technology
through a skilled and educated technician workforce.
