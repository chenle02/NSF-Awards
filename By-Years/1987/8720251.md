This study will involve theoretical modelling of fluid circulation and ore-
forming reactions in the MIssissippi Valley type deposits of southeast Missouri.
The strengths primarily focus on combined expertise of the PIs and their
application of fluid-flow models to well studied mineral deposits. The models
will attempt to integrate constraints from hydrology, tectonics, basin
structure, timing of flow and mineralization, and mechanisms for sulfide mineral
precipitation. Ultimately, the relative role of these factors on ore formation
will be assessed. The long-term benefits will include improvements in techniques
for integrating diverse information to more realistically model ore formation
processes.
