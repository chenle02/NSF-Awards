9724772&lt;br/&gt;Ferreira&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year award will support
participation of eleven US researchers in a symposium to be held in Sintra,
Portugal, June 1-4. The US organizer is Gloria Ferreira of the University of
South Florida. The Portuguese organizers are Jose J.G. Moura and Ricardo Franco
of the University of Lisbon. The symposium will be supported on the European
side by the Luso-American Foundation. The goal of the symposium is to bring
together scientists from differing disciplines, and different countries within
Western Europe, who are working on structural, functional, and molecular
regulatory mechanisms of iron metabolism. The symposium is an opportunity to
develop international approaches to problems of the rapidly developing field of
inorganic biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
