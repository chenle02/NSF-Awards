The Robert Noyce Teaching Fellowship project at California State University-
Bakersfield (CSUB) is designed to address a pressing need evolving from the
misalignment of traditional baccalaureate programs and California's subject
matter requirements (requiring more science breadth preparation) for teachers. A
credential track within an MS in Science Education has been developed to address
this problem. It provides science breadth, pedagogy and credential coursework
for individuals with existing science degrees and represents a novel approach to
recruiting and training science teachers by targeting enhanced preparation
specifically towards individuals for whom teaching was not an initial career
choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Four main aspects of the
program are being studied: Recruitment, Retention, Preparation and Teacher
Quality. An evaluation of effectiveness is undertaken by comparing
characteristics of the Noyce Fellows with science teachers prepared in
traditional credential programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts are
realized as the program can potentially serve as a model in California and
nationwide for programs aiming to increase the pool of science teachers by
attracting individuals from non-teaching backgrounds and enhancing the science
breadth and pedagogy preparation of these individuals compared to both
traditional and existing alternative routes to the credential. The Noyce
Fellowship program at CSU Bakersfield is serving ten Teaching Fellows in two
cohorts, impacting approximately 5,400 students.
