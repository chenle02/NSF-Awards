Project GEO provides a support network, requisite concepts, and curriculum
materials so that middle grade teachers from six rural northern Vermont
communities will improve their teaching of earth science. The project addresses
the special needs of this group of teachers, many of whom lack training in
science and who, due to location, have limited opportunities for professional
development. Participating teachers will attend a graduate-level Earth
Science/Curriculum Development workshop which will provide earth science
concepts, hands-on activities, field trips, and instructional techniques.
Particiapnts will receive: (1) a general rock and mineral collection; (2)
regionally-specific rock and mineral specimens; (3) local geologic and
topographic maps and field trip guides; (4) field collecting equipment; (5)
Earth Science Handbook; and (6) Curriculum Guide, all locally developed by the
staff of the project. Lecture, discussion, laboratory work and field trips will
be scheduled throughout the workshop. Principals will join teachers for the
orientation and the first two days of instruction so that they will be familiar
with the material covered. This involvement by principals should facilitate the
curricular changes that will result as a consequence of this program and provide
the administrative support for the development of a good earth science course
complete with laboratory activities and field trips. During the year following
the course, teachers will receive three follow-up visits at their schools from
thje Project GEO Support Network. This Network consists of Johnsons State
College faculty in Science and Education, VT Department of Education, State
Geologist's Office, VT Natural Resources Council, VT Geological Society and VT
Institute of Natural Science. Reunion conferences in the winter and spring will
allow participants to share their experiences and provide feedback.
