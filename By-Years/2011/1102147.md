Research Objectives and Approaches:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
research is to create the first spherical induction motor with unlimited
rotation and to characterize its performance, principally for use as a spherical
robot wheel. The outcome offers reduced mechanical complexity and higher
performance when compared with traditional mechanical methods. The approach
concentrates on the inductance principle, depending heavily on material
characterization, 3D magnetic simulation, solid modeling, electronic circuit
design, and real-time software development, keeping in mind the primary
application to dynamically stable single-wheel robots.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
develops a spherical induction motor permitting direct torque generation and
rotation about arbitrary axes with a minimum of mechanical friction or backlash.
The results provide an exemplar for a new class of motor, permitting
quantitative comparisons with more traditional solutions. The successful outcome
simplifies mechanics, improves performance, and lowers the cost of dynamically
stable single-wheel mobile robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research investigates important issues in the
technology of direct drive spherical actuation which are likely to be generally
applicable. The research enhances what is already a new and different approach
to mobile robot locomotion, furthering the strong public interest in dynamically
stable mobile robots around the world. Besides research experiences for students
working on the project, course work offered by two different departments at
Carnegie Mellon University is enhanced, exposing students to issues of
electromagnetic design, manufacturing, and characterization. The outreach
activities expose high school students to hands-on research. There is strong
international collaboration with Tohoku Gakuin University in Japan.
