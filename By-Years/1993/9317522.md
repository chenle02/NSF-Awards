9317522 Christensen The Southern Sierra Nevada Continental Dynamics Project
(SSCDP) involves multidisciplinary traverses across and along the Sierra Nevada
Range in order to ascertain the structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath
this terrane. The objectives of this research are to resolve the cause of uplift
of the Sierra Nevada cordillera and the relationship of this terrane to the
adjoining Death Valley extensional province and the southern San Joaquin Basin.
Complimentary to these goals, this project involves a collaborative effort to
characterize the physical properties of systematically collected samples along
these traverses. These data will make a significant contribution to constraining
seismic models proposed as a result of remote sensing methods and will directly
complement the ongoing petrographic analysis of the variable lithologies extant
in this region. ***
