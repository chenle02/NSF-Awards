Computational photography refers broadly to sensing strategies and algorithmic
techniques that enhance or extend the capabilities of digital photography.
Representative techniques include high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, flash-
noflash imaging, panoramic stitching, and refocusable photography. Although
interest in computational photography has steadily increased among graphics and
vision researchers, progress has been hampered by the lack of a portable,
programmable camera platform with enough image quality and computing power to be
used outside the laboratory, i.e. for everyday photography. Similarly, courses
in computational photography are offered in dozens of universities nationwide.
However, none of these courses provide students with a camera on which they can
implement the algorithms currently being published in the literature.

To address these two problems, we are building an open-source camera platform
(called Frankencamera) that is portable, self-powered, connected to the
Internet, and accommodates SLR-quality lenses and sensors. We also describe a
software architecture based on Linux, and an API with bindings for C++, that
permits control and synchronization of camera functions at the microsecond time
scale. Our API includes pre-capture functions like metering and focusing, an
image post-processing pipeline, a user interface toolkit for the viewfinder, and
support for current and future I/O devices. Our plan is to distribute this
platform at minimal cost to researchers and university instructors nationwide,
using the computational photography courses they already teach as a natural
distribution vehicle. Instructors will apply to us to be part of this outreach
program, and a standing committee will evaluate these applications. Our long-
term goal is to spur creation of a community of photographer-programmers who
write plug-ins and apps for cameras.
