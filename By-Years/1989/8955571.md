The University of Texas-Austin will initiate a 9-week residential Young
Scholars project for 50 students in grades ll-l2 in life science. Project
activities will include research participation in the life sciences and
biochemistry broadly defined to also include related fields as nutrition,
exercise physiology, physiological psychology, and some earth sciences
(paleontology). Special advanced coursework in the mornings of the first five
weeks with research participation in the afternoons. The last four weeks involve
full-time research participation with seminars in the evening. Coursework
includes selected topics in modern cellular, molecular, evolutionary and
developmental biology and biochemistry; readings and discussions of great
experiments in biology and biochemistry; and guest lectures by research
scientists. Research involves the student as a junior member of a team engaged
in on-going research, sometimes on a joint project, and sometimes on an
independent facet of a problem. At the program's end participants submit a
written paper and give oral or poster presentation on their research at a two-
day simulated professional meeting. Follow-up activities will include presenting
their research to their classmates, doing independent study and research, if
possible by continuing the work done in the program and studying science career
information.
