We propose to initiate a research program to study the development of science
process skills, through the identification and description of these skills as
they manifest themselves in the actual work carried out by children in
elementary classroom settings. Insufficient research exists about how science
procedural knowledge develops: how children learn to observe, measure, predict,
devise experiments, etc. and how these skills develop with maturation and
growth, especially in the social context of classrooms. Although these skills
are part of many science curricula and appear in state guidelines and scope and
sequence charts, they are seldom described developmentally. The proposed
research will examine the emergence of these skills in classrooms through the
analysis of observational data already collected and from observations in actual
classroom settings. The ultimate purpose of this research is to make available a
wider knowledge base to improve elementary science assessment.
