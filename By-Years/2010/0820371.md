The University of North Carolina, Charlotte is awarded a grant to develop a
community resource for collating large-scale genomic datasets within an
interactive desktop environment. The project responds to the need for flexible,
high-interactive software tools that can deal with the complexity of large
genomic data and will include features such as a Quickload repository for large-
scale data distribution, a distributed annotation Server for incremental data
access, and an integrated genome browser for visualization. Programming tools
and tutorials will enable users to build new applications on top of this desktop
platform. The system will incorporate enhancements to existing components such
as improved query capability, data documentation, and novel visualization
techniques.

The visualization system is designed to offer a more interactive experience that
will maximize understanding of genomic data among a greater number of
researchers and will inspire new trans-disciplinary questions and research
opportunities. Educational tools and internship programs in bioinformatics and
computational biology carried out by this project will increase awareness and
knowledge of computational biology and plants and will introduce more students
to the process and joys of scientific research.
