This CAREER award integrates a research plan that advances the fundamentals of
engineering design methods with an innovative educational plan that includes
strong outreach to the K-12 community. Robust design is a set of techniques for
systematically exposing designs to adverse conditions and seeking designs with
improved reliability. At present, the principal theoretical foundation of robust
design is statistical Design of Experiments. The current foundations are well
suited for efficiently constructing models in the presence of experimental
error. However, in many engineering scenarios, the goal is not model building
per se, but efficient improvement of the artifact and/or efficient learning by
the experimenter. Therefore, this project seeks new theoretical foundations for
robust design including models of engineering systems, models of the environment
in which experiments are conducted, and models of the experimenters' learning
and adaptation. This project also seeks to develop and validate new robust
design methods and test them in authentic applications via partnerships with
industry.

This research holds potential for direct, near-term impact on corporate product
development processes and training programs. The research will also directly
influence the education of professionals who will lead major engineering
projects and quality improvement programs within the next five years. In
addition, the project includes outreach through children's educational
television. Working with WBGH, the award winning producers of ZOOM and Nova, we
will develop a children's TV program about engineering design. The program will
feature kids engaged in engineering - designing systems, planning and
interpreting experiments, and building hardware. Through this outreach effort,
young people will be exposed to the philosophy behind the research - experiment
frequently, induce failures, and adapt quickly.
