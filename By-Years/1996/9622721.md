Abstract BECHTOLD, J. AST-9622721 These funds will be used to build the
Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) Advanced Echelle Spectrograph, know an
MAESTRO.The MMT is a 6.5 meter aperture telescope. On its completion it will be
the third largest telescope in the world. MAESTRO incorporates a number of in
novations which result in high throughput and large wavelength. It will cover
the visible and nearby infrared and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum (3056
Angstroms to 1,100 Angstroms) in a single exposure with a resolution of 100,000.
The focal plane will be made up of an array of six 2048 X 4096 element CCD's.
The grating will consist of two 52 l/mm replica units each of which is 40 cm
long. The beam will be cross-dispersed with two large fused-silica prisms.
