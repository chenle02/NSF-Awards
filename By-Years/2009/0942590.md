This project is developing a new unit operations laboratory with an emphasis on
bioenergy for use in the undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum at the
University of Washington. This is being accomplished by developing laboratory
facilities and experimental modules based on the complete cycle of bio-butanol
production. The laboratory modules being developed address topics in
fermentation, separation for water recycling, solvent purification, control of
emissions, and heat exchange. The laboratory is also the central focus of a new
course in bio-fuel production. The laboratory and the course are utilizing
modern pedagogies including team based learning and project based learning. The
project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both
qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an experienced
independent evaluator. The evaluation plan includes a comparison between a
traditional chemical engineering course taught at the University of Puerto Rico
Mayaguez (UPRM) and the new course at the University of Washington on student
learning. The results of this study are informing how the laboratory can be best
integrated into the curriculum at UPRM and be used with students from
underrepresented groups. The projects results are being disseminated through
conferences and journal publications and the NSF sponsored National STEM
Distributed Learning education resource database.
