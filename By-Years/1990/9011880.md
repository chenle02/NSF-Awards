Support is requested to develop an Advanced Light Microscopy Facility (ALMF).
The nine major users and two minor users are currently using epi-fluorescence
microscopy to investigate a wide range of basic problems in cell and molecular
biology. The video analysis system will provide the ability to view cells and
subcellular components using differential interference contrast video-enhanced-
contrast microscopy (VEC). This will bring a new perspective to studies of cell
movement, cell-cell association, cell-substrate association, and subcellular
fractionation. This system will also provide facilities for quantitative
analysis of fluorescence intensity, morphometric analysis, and 3D
reconstruction. Programs for training in advanced techniques of light microscopy
for both users and their students are an integral part of the ALMF. The facility
will provide video transmission to classrooms for teaching and seminars and it
will connect to campus and national networks for transmission of digitized
images.
