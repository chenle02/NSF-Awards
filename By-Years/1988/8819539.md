This action funds an International Conference on Ribosomes to be held at Glacier
National Park in Montana from August 7 to 11, 1989. This conference is a
continuation of a series of three previous conferences held in the United States
and several others sponsored by the European Molecular Biology Organization
(EMBO) in the last two decades. The last major conference was held in Port
Aransas, Texas in April of 1985. Ribosomes are part of the cell's machinary for
making proteins. Work on ribosomes has intensified in recent years as molecular
techniques have been applied to the problems of structure, function and genetics
of ribosomes. It is important for those working with ribosomes to meet
periodically to review the status of the field and share new results. This
conference will perform this function.
