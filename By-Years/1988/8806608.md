This award is partial funding for the purchase of various optical equipment for
use in the study of particle behavior in combustion environments. Specific
studies will include particle formation in diffusion flames, use of
electrostatically generated sprays for combustion, particle deposition on walls
from combustion gases, and the use of thermophoresis for in-situ measurements of
local gas temperature. The information obtained will be useful for understanding
combustion processes which result in particle formation. Both useful
applications such as powder synthesis and undesired side effects such as ash
formation in coal combustion will be better understood and thereby, hopefully,
more fully controlled.
