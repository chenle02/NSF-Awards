9403591 Virkar The principal objective of this work is to examine the role of
aliovalent dopants on the kinetics of phase transformation in ceramics. A study
of the kinetics of diffusional phase transformations in ceramics with emphasis
on dopants and/or atmosphere, is important for several reasons: 1) determination
of phase equilibria; 2) kinetic stabilization of the desired phase; 3)
morphology of phase separation and 4) phase transformation theories. Research is
proposed on two types of systems; oxides with one cation sublattice or two
cation sublattices. By controlling the transformation and degree of order, it
may be possible to tailor the diffused phase transition and the dielectric
response in materials like potassium tantalate niobate and lead scandium
tantalate. %%% A theoretical and experimental study of interdiffusion with
emphasis on dopants is proposed. The ability to control the diffusion
coefficient through defect chemistry has both scientific and practical
implications. ***
