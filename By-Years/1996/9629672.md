This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry and in the Atmospheric Chemistry Program of the Division
of Atmospheric Sciences, focusses on the development of an instrument and
methodology for real time chemical analysis of size-selected particles in the
0.5 - 100 nanometer diameter range. The instrument to be developed couples an
ion trap with a reflecting-field time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Professor
Murray V. Johnston and his students in the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Delaware will construct this instrument and apply it to problems
in nucleation, atmospheric chemistry, smog dynamics, combustion, and other areas
of small particle science. There presently are no methods for doing chemical
analyses on very small particles that are sorted according to size. This
project, led by Professor Murray V. Johnston and his research group at the
University of Delaware, focusses on building an instrument that couples an ion
trap with a reflecting- field time-of-flight mass spectrometer so that such
analyses can be done. This instrument will be used to solve problems in many
areas of small particle science including atmospheric chemistry, smog dynamics,
nucleation, and combustion.
