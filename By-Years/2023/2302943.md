This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on research-driven
discovery, development, translation, and commercialization of sustainable
manufacturing technologies essential for both production and products. The
project fills a vital gap in the nation's ecosystem for problem-solving
research, manufacturing output, robust supply chain management, livable wage
jobs and opportunity structures, and socio-environmental stewardship. Northeast
Ohio was the nation's manufacturing powerhouse, but poorly aligned institutions
and unsustainable manufacturing practices have left a legacy of disinvestment,
inequity, and environmental hazards across the region's 18 urban, suburban, and
rural counties. The region of service extends across Northeast Ohio to create a
robust network of industry, government entities, community groups, and leading
research and academic institutions committed to problem-solving use-inspired
research, innovation, technology translation, and workforce development. Led by
Case Western Reserve University, the project's leadership includes Greater
Cleveland Partnership, Team NEO, MAGNET, JumpStart, City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga
County, Cleveland State University, Cleveland Water Alliance, Northeast Ohio
Hispanic Center for Economic Development, and Urban League of Greater Cleveland.

The award efforts will focus on the creation of a robust, cooperative, aligned,
and equitable framework for the substantial elevation of discovery and adoption
of solutions in energy science, electrochemistry, green steel and chip
production, carbon capture, storage/sequestration, and utilization, as well as
alternatives to petroleum-based plastics, packaging, and biodegradable
byproducts. We seek to reduce embodied energy, energy, and water usage,
greenhouse emissions, all while transitioning to material circularity and
sustainable energy, including process electrification. Robust and equitable job
and opportunity structure creations are fundamental and woven into every
activity. The planning effort will be driven through four integrated
workstreams: Technology Innovation (problem-solving use-inspired research),
Technology Adoption (translation, commercialization, adoption, Workforce and
Talent Development (pathways, programs, pipelines), and Intentional Leadership
and Governance (equity-focused leadership and governance). This award will
prepare the region for an NSF Engine and an equitable and vibrant ecosystem that
catalyzes innovation, accelerates sustainable technologies' translation, and
develops a broader, more diverse workforce.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
