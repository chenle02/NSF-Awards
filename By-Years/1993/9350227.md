9350227 Goldstein As a Presidential Faculty Fellow award, this proposal consists
of two parts. 1) The teaching plan involves the development of interdisciplinary
undergraduate and graduate courses in nonlinear dynamics and chaos, in
hydrodynamics and pattern formation and in the physics of biological and
colloidal systems. 2) The research plan involves seemingly diverse classes of
problems ranging from pattern formation to topological transitions to protein
folding with particular emphasis on their dynamical aspects. The PI proposes to
look for unifying concepts such as the role of variational principles and
conservation laws and for an understanding of how energetics, kinetics and
topological and geometrical constraints are linked, in describing the dynamics
of patterns and shapes. %%% The PI proposes to start several undergraduate and
graduate classes at Princeton in the general area of chaos and unstable
dynamics, of pattern formation in liquid systems and of the physics of
biological systems. His research plan is to look for general unifying principles
governing the dynamics of how things - be they coils of DNA or vortices in
superconductors or fingers of one liquid displacing another - change shape. His
interest lies at the heart of the competition between the driving force
(energetics and kinetics) to change shape and the constraints that geometry puts
upon that change. ***
