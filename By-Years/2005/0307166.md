ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS 0307166- H Bercovici (Indiana
Univ)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer plans to study free harmonic analysis in
the sense of determining regularity properties of free convolutions; free
convolutions of measures &lt;br/&gt;seem to exhibit greater regularity than
their classical counterparts. He also plans to investigate limit distributions
of free processes, particularly &lt;br/&gt;those arising in the mutliplicative
theory. The proposer also will look at &lt;br/&gt;related problems in operator
theory, particularly at the behavior of &lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues of sums of
selfadjoint elements of a von Neumann algebra, and the &lt;br/&gt;relationship
of these questions with Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. &lt;br/&gt;Other
problems in operator theory will include the classification of families
&lt;br/&gt;of isometries on a Hilbert space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
in this proposal is aimed first of all at increasing the
&lt;br/&gt;understanding of questions arising in current work in the fields of
operator &lt;br/&gt;algebras and operator theory. The proposer has in the past
investigated connections between operators and control theory, and the results
in his &lt;br/&gt;proposed work may again have connections with more applied
areas. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, some of the proposed interpolation problems
arose from &lt;br/&gt;questions in control theory, and free probability theory
does have &lt;br/&gt;connections with physics. The proposer will involve
graduate students in his &lt;br/&gt;work, thus continuing to contribute to the
training of a new generation of &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians. He will also
participate in the training of postdoctoral &lt;br/&gt;associates, thus
contributing to a successful VIGRE program at Indiana
&lt;br/&gt;University.&lt;br/&gt;
