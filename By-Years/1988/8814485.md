They propose experimental investigations of wavenumber selection processes and
phase dynamics in nonlinear dissipative systems driven far from equilibrium.
Their work will concentrate on the rotating Couette-Taylor system with and
without axial flow, but some of it will also involve Rayleigh-Benard convection.
They expect the experiments to have a bearing on the general problem of pattern
formation and the evolution of non-periodic phenomena in systems of significant
spatial extent.
