A research program carried out by scientists at the University of Florida and
the Institute in collaboration with the Institute of Applied Physics of the
Russian Academy of Sciences to investigate how high power laser beams can
distort precision optical components in gravitational wave detectors through
absorption and heating. Methods will be developed for remotely measuring optical
path distortions on the order of one billionth of a meter. In addition, novel
methods for isolating back-propagating high power laser beams will be developed
to prevent interactions with sensitive, phase-stabilized lasers. This research
will play a major role in facilitating the operation of ground-based
gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave
Observatory (LIGO). The detection of gravitational waves by large-scale high
power laser-based interferometers will open a new window on the universe through
the detection of cataclysmic astrophysical phenomena such as black hole-neutron
star collisions. To enhance the sensitivity of future interferometers, highly
sensitive measurement techniques such as those developed here are crucial for
sensing the operational state of these interferometers, the most sensitive
instruments ever constructed.
