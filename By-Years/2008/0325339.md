Title: Information Assurance Education Simulation

This ITR medium award provides support to create tools that provide hands-on
training in information assurance. The research will provide an environment
through simulation that presents a user with avatars needed to construct and
manage an information system. This solution, being prototyped at the United
States Military Academy (USMA), addresses the lack of hands-on training by
building an information assurance simulation that integrates all the
complexities involved in maintaining an information system infrastructure and
making it widely available to educational facilities. These complexities include
hardware configuration, service requirements, "sizing" the system to the correct
capacity, system administrative support, and security configuration.

This simulation-based pedagogical application allows users to construct
networks, impose policies, and manage system administrators. After constructing
a network, the user can run a series of scenarios against the network and watch
as the network fails or succeeds based on network load or security attacks. This
simulation allows the user to explore the interrelationships between people,
procedures, hardware, software, and data and how each of these factors impacts
on network design and security.

The intellectual merit of the project is centered on the strong research and
educational focus of the project. The research crosses the boundaries of
disciplines by offering a robust tool for teaching and understanding the
fundamentals of construction, management, and security of computer networks. The
concept of implementing a network simulation toolset will allow closed-lab
experimentation with information assurance issues at a variety of institutions
across the nation. The resulting system should provide a platform for enhancing
education in many disciplines and settings. The project has a sound evaluation
plan that clearly should demonstrate the educational as well as technological
benefits of the research to multiple audiences.

The broader impact of this project is in providing wide-spread, cost-effective
distribution of tools that address an area of national need. This should allow
educational institutions with modest facilities and limited expertise to have
access to a scalable tool for information assurance education. The scalability
and scenario management provided in the simulation allow a wide range of
educational institutions to productively incorporate the tools into their
curriculum.

The emphasis in this project is information assurance aspects of networks
through a client-controlled environment for learning without extensive
engineering prerequisites. The complete simulation combines all facets of
building and managing an information system, creating a seamless application
that provides an integrated, engaging, challenging, and competitive information
assurance learning environment.
