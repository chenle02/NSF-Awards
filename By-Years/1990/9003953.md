It is proposed to exploit a destructive bridge test for the advancement of
analytical modeling and nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures.
Collaborating researchers from the University of Cincinnati and Wiss, Janney,
Elstner Associates, Inc. will design, conduct and document the test as a
benchmark experiment for validating and calibrating RC bridge analytical finite-
element modeling and analysis. Instrumentation will be designed and installed to
measure local and global responses to serve this purpose. Information will be
documented, archived and disseminated to permit analytical model generation and
response simulation by analytical researchers. The test will provide a unique
opportunity to identify unknown and/or unmeasured phenomena influencing advanced
limit-state responses of aged and deteriorated constructed facilities so that
these may be analytically simulated. The principal investigators from WJE and UC
are respectively the vice-chairman and a member of the standing joint ASCE-ACI
Committee on Finite Element Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Structures.
