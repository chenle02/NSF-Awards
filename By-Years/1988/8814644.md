We propose herein a program of basic study on a variety of topics in discrete
optimization. The models considered derive from integer programming problems of
broad applicability in operations research, computer science and many areas of
the natural, engineering, mathematical and social sciences. The apparent
computational intractibility of the most general such models is well-known; thus
highly structured combinatorial optimization models are the focus of the
proposed research. The models to be studied are frequently directly applicable
to real-world problems and in other instances serve as components in solution
methodology for more general models. Furthermore, algorithmic insight gained
from study of such highly structured models is often a useful guide in the
design of heuristic solution procedures of general applicability. We propose two
major research projects. First, a duality model is proposed as a unifying
framework for investigating duality properties of linear subspaces, polyhedral
cones, rational geometric lattices and certain classes of integer programming
problems. Second, study of several specific combinatorial packing and covering
models is proposed as a means to guide further research on problems related to
supply- demand networks, production scheduling, stock cutting, two-terminal cut
packing, branchings and vertex packing.
