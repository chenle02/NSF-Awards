The goal of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is the synthesis and characterization of organometallic
compounds containing transition elements in previously unknown, extremely low
oxidation states. Building on the recent synthesis of carbonyl and
organophosphine compounds containing zerovalent titanium, zirconium and hafnium,
prepared by reduction of metal halides with sodium napthenide, the synthesis of
the first examples of metal carbonyls of scandium, yttrium and 4f block elements
will be attempted. A significant component of the research will be to determine
the factors which are important in the synthesis and stabilization of zero and
subvalent carbonyls of the group 4 and 4f block elements. The use of potential
acceptor ligands other than carbon monoxide, such as alkenes, alkynes,
conjugated dienes and dinitrogen, will be examined also to assess more fully the
potential of low-valent early transition elements in chemical synthesis. This
project is expected to provide powerful new reagents for chemical synthesis, and
to provide new routes to materials which previously could be prepared only in
small amounts by metal atom vapor syntheses.
