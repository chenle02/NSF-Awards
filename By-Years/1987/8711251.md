This ocean sciences instrumentation development project involves constructing a
seagoing pumping system to obtain continuous vertical profiles of nutrients and
dissolved gases to depths of 600 meters. The system is based on a successful
prototype that uses a relatively small diameter hose and a bottom-mounted vane
pump. Tests on the system's flow characteristics indicate that there is minimal
signal smearing from mixing and the performance is thought to be superior to
water sampling bottles for obtaining dissolved gas samples. System improvements
to be completed involve fabrication of a combined cable to encompass the hose,
power line, data transmission line, and a strength-member. Modifications to a
traction winch to handle the special cable will also be undertaken. Work will
also be undertaken to develop special colorimetric dissolved oxygen and hydrogen
sulfide analysis methods to better enable the collection of continuous data in
and near oxic/anoxic interfaces. The pumping system will be especially useful on
an expedition to the Black Sea scheduled in the next year.
