One of the fundamental problems in statistical data analysis is to learn the
relationship between the samples of a dependent variable (e.g., the malignancy
of a tumor) and the samples of predictor variables (e.g., the expression data of
genes). This problem was relatively easy in the data-starved world of
yesteryears. Our inability to observe too many variables meant that a single
sample had dimensions in the tens or hundreds. Times have changed. We now live
in a data-rich world. DNA microarrays, for example, can provide us with the
expression data for hundreds of thousands of genes (predictors) per tissue
sample. This is just one of the countless examples in modern statistics where a
single sample comprises thousands or billions of predictors, while there are
only hundreds or thousands of samples available for analysis. Computational and
analytical tools developed in the 20th century, however, were not designed to
work in such high-dimensional settings. The challenge then is developing new
sets of computationally efficient methods that analyze the high-dimensional data
in an optimal manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the challenge
of high-dimensional data analysis within the context of linear models by
developing low-complexity inference methods based on marginal correlations of
predictors with the response variable. One of the distinguishing features of
this research is its emphasis on mathematical characterization of the
performance of developed methods in the most general of terms. This is
accomplished by drawing connections with the literature on finite frame theory.
Because of the fairly general nature of this research, it significantly advances
the state-of-the-art in inference problems arising in myriad areas, such as
genomics, tumor classification, network monitoring and computer tomography. In
addition, the frame-theoretic focus of this research lays the foundations for
future cross-fertilization of ideas between statistical inference and frame
theory.
