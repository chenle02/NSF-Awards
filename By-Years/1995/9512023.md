The PIs propose to develop a methodological tool for ranking risks. Since the
society has a limited ability to reduce all risks, there is an obvious benefit
in prioritizing the risks that must be confronted. The tool to be developed will
include both public values and experts ratings as components of the risk
assessment technique. The ranking process will involve categorization of the
risks and identification of the attributes upon which the risks will be
evaluated. Each group of assessors will both perform reductionistic and
impressionistic ranking procedures in order to minimize the influence of
procedural and framing effects on the assessment of risk. The PIs will also
conduct a series of studies to help determine whether the procedure they develop
will yield reproducible results.
