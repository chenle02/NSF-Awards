9452792 Bartlett This three year project will develop curricular materials based
on the use of Landsat Thematic Mapper data as a learning tool for students in
grades 5-12. As part of "Forest Watch," the students will be involved in
environmental monitoring activities, ranging from hands-on assessment of local
tree species to evaluating the Landsat data for their own hometown. The
curriculum, which will be written by scientists and teachers, will include
activities that integrate field- and laboratory-based studies of the health of
the white pine tree, a known bioindicator of tropospheric ozone exposure. These
materials will be evaluated and disseminated through a series of collaborative
educative workshops involving the grades 5-12 teachers, their students, and
university scientists in a regional environmental monitoring research effort.
The effort includes authentic problem-solving and data gathering activities such
as ground truthing, laboratory analysis of branch and foliar samples from the
white pine, and the processing, analysis and display of Landsat data of each
school area. This grant will be administered by the Institute for the Study of
Earth, Oceans and Space (EOS) at the University of New Hampshire in conjunction
with WGBH, public television in Boston.
