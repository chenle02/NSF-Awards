The primary objectives of this seminar, which is being organized by Dr. Andrew
Isserman of West Virginia University and Dr. Kiril Mishev, President of the
National Committee of Bulgarian Geographers, are to examine selected
geographical aspects of regional economic development and environmental
management and to establish frameworks and professional relationships for future
research communication and cooperation between the two countries. The seminar
fulfills the program objective of promoting promising opportunities for long-
term scientific cooperation between the areas of strong mutual interest and
competence to discuss current research projects and priorities and to identify
potential topics for fruitful cooperative research projects. This seminar will
be the first meeting between U.S. and Bulgarian geographers and furthermore
opens up U.S.-Bulgarian scientific cooperation under this program to an
important new field, for the first time in the social sciences.
