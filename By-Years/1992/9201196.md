This award is to support the Yale Gravitational Physics Group under the
direction of Professor V. Moncrief in their studies in theoretical general
relativity and relativistic astrophysics. These studies are directed toward the
application of rigorous mathematical techniques for the solution of physically
significant astrophysical problems.
