Information Retrieval (IR) research involves computer programs to organize,
classify, retrieve, evaluate, and display databases and search results. The IR
field has a long history of rigorous evaluation in narrowly defined test
environments. However, the current trend is toward more realistic test
environments with larger databases, more sophisticated search engines, and
evaluation of the human-system contribution to the search process. The focus of
this workshop is to begin development of a toolkit of programs, environments,
and tasks to be made widely available to researchers. The goal of the toolkit is
to provide a more uniform basis for comparison of research by different groups
and under different circumstances. Workshop presentations are devoted to
identifying the available tools, their limitations, and the needs of current and
future research. Reports from smaller working groups are to be integrated into a
plan that will guide toolkit development in the near future. Furter information
about the workshop and the workshop reports is available at
