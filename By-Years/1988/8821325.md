This proposal addresses the question of option generation and how people make
use of available information to solve problems and formulate decision
strategies. The proposed project will use protocol analysis to trace subjects'
decision making processes and then will use this information to test hypotheses
about knowledge activation that are considered to be important for future
developments in decision support systems. The project is expected to yield both
general insights, concerning the effect of task characteristics on problem
solving, and applied insights, concerning the mental modelling and strategy
formulation processes used by managers. These topics are of interest to a large
body of researchers because of their linkages to the study of cognitive
processes and because of their practical implications for the development of
improved computer-based decision support systems.
