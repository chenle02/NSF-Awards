9522840 Ji An integrated study for the design, placement, and control of
platform, manipulators is carried out. The concept of vertex space approach is
extended to architectures of platform manipulators other than the Stewart type.
The effects of dimensions on vertex spaces and workspaces are analyzed. A
variety of placement strategies are considered and optimization techniques are
developed. An operational space control system is designed that bypasses the
complex forward kinematics with passive joint sensing. An experiment platform
manipulator is built to verify and enhance the analytical study and graphic
simulation. The research results provide a rational tool for synthesis,
placement optimization, and operational space control of platform
manipulators.***
