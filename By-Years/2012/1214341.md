This project involves the use of techniques of string theory and quantum field
theory to understand quantum properties of gravity and properties of systems
near phase transitions. In recent years, physicists have discovered an intimate
relationship between quantum gravity as described by string theory and
conventional quantum systems. This relationship has been used to understand many
equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of rather complicated systems near
phase transitions, like superconductors or colliding heavy ions at high
temperature, using methods of string theory. The present proposal involves novel
methods which will shed light on properties of these systems far from
equilibrium. At the same time, the proposal aims to develop a deeper
understanding of the quantum aspects of gravity by relating such aspects to
systems which can be investigated using conventional methods of quantum
mechanics. In a parallel direction, powerful methods of supersymmetry will be
used to classify phase transitions and their related universal behavior.

The broader impacts of this project include the training of graduate students
and postdocs in cutting-edge research techniques and preparing them for research
careers. The investigators will give lectures and seminars on their research
which are open to all, and will incorporate ideas gleaned from their research
activities in the courses they teach. The investigators will also continue their
work to modernize the University of Kentucky's physics curriculum and to bring
its students into contact with frontier research in these subjects.
