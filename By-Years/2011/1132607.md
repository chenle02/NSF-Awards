The 2011 Society for In Vitro Biology (SIVB) Conference will be held in Raleigh,
North Carolina, June 4 - 8, 2011. The conference will provide a venue for
presenting the science, novel technologies and advances of in vitro biology for
both plants and animals. As such, the meeting provides an outstanding
opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to meet and interact with
scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas, and to begin to
establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their
careers. Funding provided by NSF will broaden participation by defraying the
costs of participation for students and postdoctoral associates with specific
emphasis on women and those from underrepresented groups.
