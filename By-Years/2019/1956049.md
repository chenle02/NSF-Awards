The goal of this project is to understand the origin of stochasticity in
deterministic systems, with particular attention to extended systems that can be
used to model transport phenomena in physical and biological systems and to
systems whose evolution laws change with time. The principal investigator will
use tools from probability and geometry in order to develop methods to predict
the statistical behavior of complicated systems. The project provides training
for graduate students, and a significant portion of the research will be done in
collaboration with graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other early-
career mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of four
parts:&lt;br/&gt;(I) The rate of convergence in the Central Limit
Theorem;&lt;br/&gt;(II) Dynamics of systems preserving infinite
measure;&lt;br/&gt;(III) Flexibility of statistical properties;
and&lt;br/&gt;(IV) Transport of random media.&lt;br/&gt;The unifying theme of
the project is the interplay between dynamics and probability. Probabilistic
techniques, such as refined limit theorems and coupling, are used to the study
of deterministic systems, and dynamical methods including spectral properties of
transfer operators and renormalization dynamics on the space of lattices are
used to handle probabilistic questions. Results obtained in parts (I) and (II)
will be applied in parts (III) and (IV) of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
