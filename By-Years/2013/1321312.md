A request is made by the University of Washington to fund additional and
replacement instrumentation for the R/V Thompson, a 274? general purpose, global
class research vessel, and R/V Barnes, a 66-foot coastal research vessel, both
operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
research fleet. These platforms provide facilities for conducting oceanographic
research funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
The instrumentation they propose to acquire will provide operational flexibility
to projects that are embarked upon both vessels, will address some deficiencies
noted during the fall 2011 NSF vessel inspections, and will increase their
capacity to do useful science and data collection during transits between funded
cruises.. In order of priority, they propose to purchase the following:
Magnetometer cable upgrade from SIO/STS $18,607 Magnetometer SDSL data uplink
from WHOI $16,425 $35,032

Broader Impacts The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion
two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
