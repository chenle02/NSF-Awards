This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist studying the
historical background and political consequences of change in the highlands of
Papua New Guinea. The project will compare two areas differing in their
experience with economic development: Mount Hagen and Lake Kopiago. The study
will examine the impact on group violence of the recent introduction of guns
(replacing spears and bows and arrows), as well as the recent emergence of young
group leaders called "hero-criminals". Police records will be examined for
patterns of disputes and violence, and intensive interviews will document the
growing uncertainty about expectations of other people's actions. This research
will add a valuable example to the roster of cases on the violent effects of
economic development on tribal people. It is important to understand the local
causes of violence in order to understand the patterns of violent reaction to
development occurring in the world, so that political leaders can design
programs to ameliorate these troubles.
