Over a four-year period 108 scholarships are being awarding to academically
talented, but financially disadvantaged students majoring in computer science
related programs and engineering technologies. One-year Scholarships are awarded
to cohorts of eighteen freshman students in years one, two and three. Provided
academic and financial eligibility is maintained these students will be awarded
a second one-year scholarship enabling them to complete their two-year courses
of study leading to an Associates degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project goals
include:&lt;br/&gt;1) Increasing the participation of low-income, academically
talented students in CSEMS careers, especially those of underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;2) Retaining these students to degree completion by providing
a comprehensive student support system consisting of counselors, faculty, tutors
as needed, and consultants from industry, as well as opportunities outside the
classroom to enhance their learning.&lt;br/&gt;3) Creating new partnerships and
strengthening existing ones with business and industry and K-12 institutions to
assist in recruitment, retention, and employment.&lt;br/&gt;
