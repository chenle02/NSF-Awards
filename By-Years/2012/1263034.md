This award supports the establishment of a summer REU Site in astronomical
research and instrumentation at Texas A&amp;M University. The REU program will
be offered annually to eight qualified applicants, who will work closely with
mentors on projects related to basic research as well as the development,
testing, and integration of state-of-the art astronomical instrumentation. The
Site will leverage Texas A&amp;M's institutional memberships with large scale
observational collaborations, such as the Giant Magellan Telescope, the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment
Survey, and the Dark Energy Survey. The overall aim is to train young scientists
and engineers in the fields of modern observational astronomy and
instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students will use data obtained
with modern instrumentation developed at Texas A&amp;M and will have the
opportunity to participate in the design of future instrumentation projects,
providing them with hands-on experience applicable to multiple career paths in
academia or industry. The Site will make a special effort to recruit women and
minority students, as well as to reach out to students at smaller schools in
Texas and across the country who may not yet have had access to cutting-edge
astronomical instrumentation facilities.
