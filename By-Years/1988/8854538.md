The objective for this project is to provide educational experiences for
chemical engineering students that will enhance the development of innovative
and creative skills. Interactive computer modules and open- ended problems are
being developed for use with each of the core (required) courses in the chemical
engineering program. The modules and open-ended problems will complement the
normal engineering course examples and homework problems and are expected to
provide frequent opportunities for the students to practice the divergent
thinking skills needed for the practice of engineering and yet leave enough time
for learning the necessary engineering fundamentals. It is expected that the
added motivation for learning fundamentals provided by the modules and the open-
ended problems will be such that the engineering fundamentals are covered as
fully as before. The institution has commited matching funds that are
approximately one- third of the funds requested from NSF for this project.
