The major goal of this research proposal is to generate new information on the
biogenesis of a plant peroxisome, the glyoxysome, which is pivotally involved in
storage lipid metabolism during the critical heterotrophic growth phase of
economically - important oilseeds. The main emphasis is on deciphering the
mechanisms responsible for targeting and importing membrane phospholipids and
enzyme proteins into glyoxysomes in maturing and germinated cotton seeds.
Understanding organelle biogenesis (integral to intracellular compartmentation)
is an essential part of ultimately comprehending the complexities of cellular
metabolism. Formation of glyoxysomes will be analyzed by electron microscopy
coupled with immunocytochemistry of enzymes to visualize images in thin sections
of developing cotyledons. Phospholipid composition of organelle membranes will
be quantitated by Iatrascan TLC/FID, and the subcellular site of phospholipid
synthesizing enzymes will be determined from radioactive labeling assays of
fractions prepared by density - gradient centrifugation. In vivo (protoplasts)
and in vitro (translation products from Poly A+ mRNA) systems will be
established to experimentally evaluate critical requirements for import of
isocitrate lyase, catalase, and malate synthase into peroxisomes isolated from
cotton and other species. Recombinant DNA experiments will be initiated wherein
a lambda gt10 library will be sequenced and those with full length open reading
frames will be subcloned into vectors for establishing an in vitro
transcription/translation system designed to assess molecular modifications on
the import of proteins. The timing and appearance of gene transcripts in
maturing seeds will be determined with cloned DNA probes to document apparent
translation control(s) of enzyme synthesis in maturing seeds.***
