The focus of this research is to explore the role of mineral and metal ion
catalysis in prebiotic chemistry by examining RNA oligomer synthesis from
activated RNA monomers. These studies will provide insight into the possible
role of montmorillonite catalysis in the selective prebiotic synthesis of RNA.
Specific areas to be addressed include the possibility of homochiral selection,
the rapid formation of long RNA oligomers, sequence and regioselectivity in
montmorillonite-catalysed RNA synthesis, and enhanced catalysis by RNA-modified
montmorillonites.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. James P. Ferris of the Department of Chemistry at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Professor Ferris will focus his work on
exploring the role of catalysis in prebiotic synthesis. The experiments, if
successful, will provide a major advance in the understanding of life on Earth.
The findings of this work will be of great interest to both the scientific
community and to the general public as well.
