9322249 Pitts The Center for Undergraduate Research in Virtual Systems
Development at Trinity University provides a unique opportunity for outstanding
young undergraduate scholars to participate in a research experience in the
challenging and exciting area of Virtual Reality. South Texas is a high
percentage minority area and major effort is being waged to recruit minorities
into the participant pool. Five participants will be selected for the 1994
summer research experience and, subsequently, ten participants will be selected
for each of the following summers (1995 and 1996). Seven Professors of the
Computer Science Department provide the research mentorship for students in
seven different state-of-the-art aspects of Virtual Reality. Each student
selects a research aspect area and mentor from research
presentations/demonstrations during the first week of the Summer Research
Experience. After eight weeks of intensive research, each student should have an
in-depth understanding of research methodology, simulated world development, 3-D
graphics, object oriented graphic design, intelligent systems and, consequently,
Virtual Reality. Most research will be conducted in the newly created Meadows
Scientific Visualization Laboratory that contains twenty-two (22) H.P. 9000
networked high-end processors with enhanced graphics capability. Participants
will be expected to submit their research experience to either the ACM Annual
SIGSE Conference or the National Conference on Undergraduate Research. ***
