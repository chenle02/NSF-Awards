This research aims to improve student learning effectiveness, efficiency, and
enjoyment in online courses by using online learning data to provide
constructive feedback to course developers and instructors. The feedback
provides assistance with the design and improvement of course activities and
interactive instruction. Online course development is often guided primarily by
the intuition of the instructor. This research seeks to enable course
improvements using a data-driven approach by developing methods to measure the
effects of course redesign.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project integrates
diagnostic feedback on course content and activities, analytic methods and
course-inspection tools for discovering barriers to student learning and
opportunities for course improvement, and authoring tools to translate
discoveries to course improvements. An Integrated Development Environment with
Analytics (IDEA) that allows course developers and instructors to validate
courseware contents before actual use will be developed. Once the courseware
becomes available online and used by students, IDEA will support the use of
logged data and analytics to discover barriers to learning, to hypothesize
modifications in the underlying cognitive model of learning, and to evaluate and
select the modifications that best predict the data. IDEA will provide
performance profiling to developers and instructors to summarize students'
learning and identify issues to be improved by analyzing learning curves and
modifying knowledge component models. IDEA will also provide developers with a
tight connection between performance profiling and courseware contents so that
developers can review and modify troublesome courseware contents.
