This project will create a network to coordinate development of biological fiber
diffraction methods, particularly computational methods. Many biological
molecular assemblies are long helical structures, and have a natural tendency to
form fibers. Structural studies of these fibers are difficult; conventional
macromolecular crystallography is not usually possible. Fiber diffraction,
however, is a powerful technique for determining the structural details of such
assemblies. Activities will include development and integration of software for
biological fiber diffraction, and exchange of information about fiber
diffraction methods through retreats, workshops, and a public web site. Software
applications will be adapted to various platforms, integrated with the suite of
programs available through the British Collaborative Computational Project for
Fibre Diffraction (CCP13), and made available to the scientific community. New
software will be developed where existing software is inadequate. The network
software will be complementary to CCP13 software; together, they will eventually
cover all aspects of biological fiber diffraction. The network will integrate
fiber diffraction groups in the USA with each other and with the world fiber
diffraction community, particularly with CCP13. This will be done through
workshops organized by the core participants, including workshops at the BioCAT
facility at Argonne National Laboratory, and through partial sponsorship of
sessions organized by the fiber diffraction Special Interest Group of the
American Crystallographic Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact will
be through involvement of undergraduates, graduate students and others in the
workshops and the research, and through enhancement of infrastructure for
research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
