Modeling and analytical studies will be carried out for turbulent combustion
systems. Included in these studies will be efforts directed at development of
better understanding of fundamental mixing processes. This research will be
carried out in two basic stages: (1) An analytical study to shed light on the
dependency of time evolution of chemical composition as a function of the mixing
parameters governing various systems of interest; (2) A model development and
implementation effort to apply new ideas in turbulent mixing modeling to full
scale combustion systems. In this activity, the turbulent mixing and reaction
processes will initially be modeled based on ideas developed in prior
formulation of a linear eddy model, the only current model formulation that
allows for distinction between the effects of molecular diffusion and turbulent
stirring at the smallest turbulent scale of the flow; such a distinction is
required for accurate prediction of the small- scale mixing which governs
turbulent combustion processes. An advanced formulation which can be used in
industrial combustion applications will be pursued. Part of the research project
will be devoted to implementation of such models and resulting computer codes on
massively parallel computing machines. Energy conservation and environmental
protection issues provide a strong impetus for development of cleaner, more
efficient combustion processes. Since most combustion occurs in a turbulent
environment and it is the turbulent mixing that governs the overall combustor
performance in most cases, it is very important that turbulent mixing and
combustion be treated in a more comprehensive manner than in the past. As part
of this program, models will be applied to realistic combustion chemistries for
analysis of energy production and pollutant formation.
