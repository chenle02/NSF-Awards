The proposed work will provide information about the development of memory and
academic skills in the context of the elementary school math and language arts
classrooms. The project is focusing on the possibility that the kind of mnemonic
language used by teachers will affect the kinds of memory strategies used by
students which, in term, will influence their STEM learning. By using a
combination of longitudinal and experimental methods, the PI will be able to
chart the development of memory within individual children across the key first
two years of elementary school and to make statements about aspects of the
classroom context that serve as mediators of developmental change. The resulting
dataset will be unique in the literature. This ongoing experiment represents an
important first step in taking basic research outcomes into the schools, but it
is essential to expand the extant knowledge base in five critical ways before
large-scale interventions can be undertaken profitably. First, given that
children's deliberate memory skills most likely build on their earlier
competence in autobiographical memory, the project assesses their abilities at
school entry to talk with their parents about past events. Second, because of
the importance of the initial year of schooling, the project must gauge the
impact of instruction in kindergarten on children developing skills. Third, in
order to understand more precisely key aspects of teacher's conversations that
are associated with children's skill acquisition, the project must expand
observations to include small-group as well as whole-group instruction. Fourth,
they must replicate the findings obtained to date because they had been derived
from a relatively small number of classes. Fifth, they will launch a small-scale
intervention study, based on longitudinal and experimental findings, in which a
sample of teachers is trained in instructional techniques that are associated
with skilled remembering. The students will be assessed on an array of measures
of memory skill as well as STEM content learning.
