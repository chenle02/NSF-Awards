The PI will study and explore scientific situations dealing with repeated
measurements on all experimental units in space and or time. Such studies are
recommended by FDA for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) evaluations
in one or more phases of clinical trials or for bio-availability studies in
making regulatory decision for generic drugs. Likewise, such experiments are
also highly desirable for studies in epidemiology, social networks, and
agricultural field experiments, including marketing, physical and virtual
stores. The PI will develop ready-to-use statistical/computational soft wares
which will be designed, tested, and freely distributed for dissemination of
knowledge on repeated measurements studies. The research outcomes will serve as
a platform to a broad class of multidisciplinary researchers and practitioners.
Scientists in the fields of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI),
pharmacy, medical devices, and generic medicine will be provided with highly
useful tools to carry out their studies and make proper and prudent evidence
based inference from the collected data under repeated
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Repeated measurements on the same
experimental unit, also known as crossover designs, often produce
residual/neighbor/correlated effects which need to be modeled and explored. The
PI will focus on the scientific situations both in terms of data collection
(design) and modeling which have not been adequately addressed and studied
before. In the process, computational tools will be developed with thorough
study of the theoretical issues. Sound innovative techniques will be developed
for identifying cost-effective designs in order to ascertain optimal and nearly
optimal estimation of the primary and, if needed, secondary parameters embedded
in models under repeated observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
