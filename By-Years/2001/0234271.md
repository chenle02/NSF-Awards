The solar wind interacts directly with solar system bodies whose intrinsic
magnetic fields are too small to protect their atmospheres and ionospheres. This
effort focuses on the theoretical modeling of various solar wind interactions
with non-magnetic solar systems bodies such as Venus, Mars, Titan, comets, and
the interstellar neutral gas. Specific tasks include, (i) studies of spatial and
temporal variations of X-ray and Extreme Ultra-violet emission associated solar
wind/atmosphere/ionosphere interactions, (ii) development of a new electron
transport code to model the behavior of super thermal electrons in the plasma
environments of non-magnetic solar system bodies, and (iii) analysis of test-
particle simulations for ions in the vicinity of Mars and Titan with special
emphasis on finite gyro radius effects.
