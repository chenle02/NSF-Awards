9418586 Chamberlain The assembly of cratons involves formation of crustal-scale
boundaries as disparate crustal blocks collide and amalogmate. Understanding of
these boundaries in younger rocks is aided by relatively shallow levels of
exposure and relatively clear lithologic and temporal differences. However,
aspects of precambrian terrane boundaries remain problematic due in part to deep
levels of exposure and reliance an isotopic data for terrane discrimination.
This collaborative project will employ a variety of techniques and study one
Precambrian boundary (Mojave and Yavapai) in considerable detail, with the goal
of formulating a tectonic model for development of the zone that honors all
geologic constraints. Results will lead to increased understanding of crustal
boundaries in deeply eroded ancient accreted terranes.
