ATM-9422993 Johnston In this project, two areas that are relevant to gas-
particle transport in tropospheric air pollution will be investigated. The first
hypothesis is that surface coatings of organic compounds limit condensation and
evaporation of particles. In particular, respiratory and atmospheric
neutralization of sulfuric acid particles by ammonia may be inhibited by surface
coatings of atmospheric organic matter. To test this hypothesis, sulfuric acid
particles containing surface active organics will be exposed to ammonia vapor.
The accommodation coefficient of ammonia onto sulfuric acid will be determined
as a function of the composition and thickness of the organic coating. The
second hypothesis is that particle morphology, namely formation of solid phases
as an aqueous particle dries, may inhibit evaporation or condensation of
volatile components. In particular, ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulfate particles
relevant to polluted urban environments will be studied. If an ammonium sulfate
surface coating forms upon drying, then evaporation of ammonium nitrate will be
inhibited. To test this hypothesis, aqueous particles containing ammonium
nitrate and ammonium sulfate will be dried and the morphology of the dry
particles will be characterized. The evaporation rates of particles generated
and characterized in this manner will be measured. Most of this research will be
performed with rapid-single particle mass spectrometry (RSMS), a new method for
on-line chemical analysis of single aerosol particles that was developed with
previous NSF funding. The sample particles are detected by light scattering from
a continuous laser beam and then ablated by a pulsed excimer beam. Ions produced
by laser desorption/ionization are detected by time-of-flight mass spectrometry
and the chemical composition of the particles is inferred by the distribution of
ions o`served.
