The study will investigate the mass, momentum, heat, and species transport
processes occurring during the solidification processing of binary alloy metal
matrix composites. The program will consist of both numerical and experimental
components. The numerical study will make use of a single domain continuum
approach, making use of appropriate constitutive relations, including
permeability models, to account for the dispersed phase in the fluid and in the
mushy zone. The results will be verified against solidification experiments with
aqueous ammonium-chloride solution carrying isolated fibers. Flow visualization,
and measurements of temperature and velocity fields will be obtained.
