This project will examine the deformation behavior of a series of two-phase
aggregates of mantle minerals under well constrained thermodynamic conditions,
starting with the olivine- orthopyroxene system, and focusing on the effect of
the relative concentration so the two components on the overall strength of the
aggregate. Experiments will be performed under conditions favoring deformation
by dislocation creep in the constituent minerals. Detailed microstructural
investigations using scanning and transmission electron microscopy will check
for any microcracking and to investigate the nature and relative contributions
of the creep mechanisms in the individual minerals. The experiments will also
provide some insight into how the individual deformation mechanisms and slip
systems, measured in single crystal studies, can be recast into the behavior of
an aggregate.
