The principal investigator will study a mathematical model for an epizootic
which involves three species. This model has applications to a plague epizootic
which involves fleas, prairie dogs, and coyotes. Such investigations for
determining the outbreak of plagues are extremely important. At the present
time, plague outbreaks among wild rodents are not predictable as to time and
location. The mathematical models developed with the help of experts in the area
of epidemiology and epizoology have the potential of making such predictions
reliable.
