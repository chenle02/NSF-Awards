Plate tectonics is fundamental for Earth's evolution and the surface expression
of mantle convection. However, it is unclear how the narrow and strongly
deforming boundaries between the more rigid plates form. The reactivation of
plate boundaries, in particular, gives the continental plates a long-term
hysteresis with profound implications for tectonics. This project seeks to
better understand the causes and consequences of damage memory in convection.
Funding will support a female graduate student and speak to issues outside
geodynamics including the quest for a general law describing fault behavior from
the seismic cycle to long-term Earth evolution. The project will also support
new international collaborations, and research outcomes will be disseminated
widely, including for UT Austin's GeoFORCE K-12 outreach
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement strain-dependent
weakening into global, numerical convection models in order to explore the style
of "plate tectonics" that is generated by visco-plastic mantle flow.
Incorporating such rheological memory will allow study of the full range of
tectonic behavior, including how plate boundary evolution and plate motions are
linked with the deep mantle. A range of viscous damage formulations will be
explored and benchmarked against grain-size evolution theories and other
suggested mechanisms for strain-localization, such as formation of shear bands
and mechanical anisotropy due to lattice preferred orientation of olivine. Model
results will be compared with geological constraints including plate kinematics,
with particular focus on the time-dependence of plate boundary geometry, plate
speeds and sizes, and seafloor age distributions. The overall goal is to develop
a theoretical understanding of the role of tectonic inheritance in terrestrial
planet evolution and heat transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
