9526911 Sheehan This research and teaching grant is to study seismic estimates
of sharpness and depth distribution of mantle discontinuities which are
important for constraining models of composition and temperature in the Earth.
Seismic data for oceanic regions have been sparse to address this problem but
new stations coming online or planned will help to fill this gap. The work will
include assembly of data sets from permanent island stations, temporary island
stations, and temporary ocean bottom seismic deployments and application of
multiple techniques for determining the sharpness and lateral variation of crust
and upper mantle discontinuities. The undergraduate teaching efforts will bring
Internet and multimedia resources into the classroom, and bring development of a
new geophysical field course utilizing resources from a previously funded NSF
instrumentation grant. This grant is a component of the NSF CAREER program.
