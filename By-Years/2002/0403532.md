Bridging the Poles: Education Linked with Research Stephanie Pfirman and Robin
Bell OPP 0403532

The Bridging the Poles workshop will bring together researchers from the Arctic
and the Antarctic in a dialogue with educators to help polar scientists conduct
meaningful education and outreach and reciprocally, to help educators include
meaningful polar research in their classrooms. The workshop product will be a
guide (printed as well as web-based) for linking polar education with research.
Planning for the workshop began in the summer and fall of 2003 with
identification of existing resources, solicitation of potential participants for
the workshop, a special session on polar education for the American Geophysical
Union in December as well as a planning meeting also held at AGU. Draft sections
of the workshop guide are already being distributed to have a working copy for
discussion during the workshop in June 2004. There will be a public comment
period on the guide prior to its publication and broad dissemination of the web-
based version in fall 2004. The workshop will advance knowledge and
understanding about successful educational approaches and ways to harness
synergies between research and education. The workshop and guide will define
future directions for polar education, including needed infrastructure, which
will also maximize the educational impact of the International Polar Year
beginning in 2007. The workshop will build stronger partnerships between Arctic
and Antarctic communities, and between polar education and research in order to
engage the next generation of scientists, engineers and leaders, as well as to
educate the general public about polar regions.
