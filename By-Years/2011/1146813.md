This award will defray costs associated with hosting the 30th Annual Technical
Conference of the National Association of Black Geologists and Geophysicists
(NABGG) in San Francisco, California (September 7-10, 2011). An important goal
of NABGG is to encourage students of color to pursue baccalaureate and advanced
(MS and PhD) degrees in STEM fields in order to help provide a competent and
diverse workforce in these economically critical areas for the 21st Century and
the conference will provide an opportunity for mentoring underrepresented
students in the Earth and environmental sciences. The planned conference will
have wide-ranging technical programs, career success workshops for students, and
interactive exhibits with appeal to professionals, students, and science
educators in the San Francisco Bay Area. The theme of the conference will be
Innovations at the Boundary of Geology and Geophysics, emphasizing innovations
in geoscience and understanding geological hazards. Among the highlights of the
conference is a field trip to the major plate tectonic boundary in California,
the San Andreas fault. The Department of Geosciences at San Francisco State
University, with its diverse population of students and interdisciplinary
programs, will host the conference.
