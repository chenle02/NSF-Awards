Research will be conducted on the complex flow of viscoelastic fluids. The
approach is through complementary use of experimental and numerical simulation
techniques. The experimental part is based on rheological characterization, and
also a combination of Laser-Doppler-Anemometer and fluid birefringence
measurements. Numerical simulations are via finite element modeling using both
differential and integral constitutive descriptions of the fluid. Polymeric
material processing involves flow characteristics of complex fluids, and greatly
improved modeling and predictive capabilities are required for reliable and
realistic process design.
