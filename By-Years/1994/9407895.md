9407895 Kiserow This research combines experimental and theoretical methods to
investigate the electronic and molecular structure, the optical properties, and
photochemical degradation of elementary building blocks based on linear chains
of silicon atoms. The primary issues to be addressed are (1) the relation
between chain conformation and spectroscopic properties, particularly electronic
and vibrational spectra; (2) the nature of the low-lying electronic states and
the associated photophysical properties as a function of chain length and
conformation; (3) the relative stability of individual chain conformers and the
real-time dynamics of conformer interconversion; and (4) the nature of the
photochemical reactivity of the chains. The information obtained for the simple
models containing 3 - 30 silicon atoms will then be combined with the results of
measurements on high-molecular weight polymers and utilized to provide a
comprehensive picture of their optical and photochemical properties. This is a
grant to Professor Josef Michl of the University of Colorado at Boulder, jointly
funded with the Army Research Office. ***
