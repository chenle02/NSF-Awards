9358344 Holloway The work carried out under this NYI research award is directed
to improving our capabilities in modeling plasmas that are either collisionless
or dominated by charged particle-neutral particle collisions, such as non-
neutral plasmas in high power systems and in electrostatic traps, or processing
plasmas. The algorithms being explored are based on the use of pseudospectral
collocation for the spatial and velocity discretization of the kinetic equations
and Maxwell's equations, with the discretization carried out so that much of the
Hamiltonian structure of the exact system is preserved in the collisionless
limit. The resulting semi-discrete systems can be made to exactly preserve the
Hamiltonian of the original system, as well as some of its Casimirs, such as
number of particles and square integral of the charged particle distribution
function; methods tat exactly conserve momentum at finite grid size are also
being sought. Time discretization methods that exactly preserve these important
physical quantities at finite numerical grid size are used; these methods
include explicit and nonlinearly implicit methods. The modeling of systems with
phenomena occurring over very disparate time scales (such as in processing
plasmas) is being studied by a combination of asymptotic methods (multiple time
scale analysis) and spectral methods. ***
