This study proposes to examine the contextual factors that affect women's
decisions to pursue scientific careers. Specifically, the PI will conduct in-
depth interviews with faculty and students in four science and engineering
departments in a high ranking research university. By looking at the sex role
expectations of faculty members and teaching assistants, the PI will highlight
some of the ways women students are either encouraged to or discouraged from
pursuing further work in particular fields. Anecdotal evidence has suggested
that a negative effect may be especially pronounced when the faculty or teaching
assistants are foreign nationals who may harbour traditional sex role
expectations. However, there is virtually no research investigating the
influence, if any, of foreign nationals on the aspirations of female students.
This study is important because it focuses on subtle cultural factors which may
affect the recruitment of women to pursue scientific careers in the United
States.
