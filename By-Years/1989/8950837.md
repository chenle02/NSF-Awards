This funding supports the improvement of the materials testing laboratory at
Montana Technological College by the establishment of an experimental stress
analysis capability. The experimental stress analysis equipment is used to
promote student interest and ability in stress analysis, to verify theoretical
equations by experimental procedures, and to broaden the preparation of
engineering students for industry. In the materials testing laboratory, the
students study the properties of steel, concrete, wood and other structural
materials. The institution is providing matching funds in an amount equal to or
greater than the funds provided by the Foundation.
