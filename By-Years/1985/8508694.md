This project deals with the topic of predicting the sound radiation from the
surface of a vibrating body. Much effort has been devoted to modeling and
analyzing such idealized sources as spheroids, cylinders, and plane rigid bodies
in baffles. Current attention focuses on a variety of numerical methods to solve
more general radiation problems. Most researchers have reconstructed the sound
field by using a pressure measuring method. A velocity measuring technique is
proposed which may have advantages over the pressure method for certain
applications. The objective of this research is the development of this method.
