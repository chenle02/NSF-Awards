Longitudinal studies of network systems are very difficult to conduct when
systems are large, heterogeneous, highly interconnected, and open; yet, the
importance of these studies cannot be underestimated. This project focuses on an
18-month longitudinal study on server-side vulnerabilities in the campus network
of the University of California at San Diego and on client-side vulnerabilities
the University of California at Davis. The issues concern the efficacy of
security measures at the campus-wide networks and its implication for security
of networked systems at universities, government facilities, and commercial
enterprises.
