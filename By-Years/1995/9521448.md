9521448 Corliss This project will use sediment traps and short cores south of
Georges Bank to determine seasonal flux of organic matter and corresponding
changes in benthic foraminifers. The goal is to determine whether availability
of phytodetritus affects taxonomic assemblage and/or shell chemistry. These
variables are widely used as indicators of deep-water conditions, but the
controls upon them are unknown from direct observation; they are based mostly
upon indirect correlations.
