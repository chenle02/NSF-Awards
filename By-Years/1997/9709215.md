This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will help the
Department of Chemistry at Princeton University acquire a x-ray diffractometer
equipped with a CCD detector. The equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: (1) new oxides and chalcogenides with unusual
electronic and magnetic properties, (2) oxidation catalysis related to the
chemistry of cytochrome P450, and vectorial molecular self-assembly in model
phospholipid, (3) reactive intermediates, (4) design of compounds which increase
the absorption of polar molecules, (5) synthetic inorganic chemistry, and (6)
unusual structure and bonding in aromatic molecules. The X-ray diffractometer is
used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional
structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of
all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate
information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
neighboring molecules.
