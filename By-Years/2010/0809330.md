In this project, the PI will investigate the nature of point defects and related
transport properties in (Mg,Fe)O such as diffusion and electrical conductivity.
(Mg,Fe)O is one of the major minerals in the Earth's lower mantle and these
properties are key to the understanding of the dynamics of the lower mantle. A
particularly important issue is the role of oxidation state and of hydrogen in
controlling these properties. A review of existing literature suggests that the
role of hydrogen in controlling these properties in (Mg,Fe)O is likely very
different and pressure dependent. Through a systematic study of point defect-
related properties, the PI and his team will obtain the first data set to
understand the transport properties of the largest part of Earth's
mantle.&lt;br/&gt;
