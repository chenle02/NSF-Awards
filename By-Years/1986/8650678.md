This project will incorporate a modern, computer-controlled Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer into the established project-based Advanced Laboratory
program at Westminster College. This program, developed over the last fifteen
years, has been very successful in the preparation of students for a wide range
of scientific and technical careers. The new instrument will replace an aging
and failing spectrometer whose capabilities are very limited. This project will
enable students to gain experience with a modern computer-controlled
spectrometer and to use all of the capabilities inherent in its design. The
Advanced Laboratory program and Organic Chemistry laboratory will be improved by
the addition of many new techniques not previously available: computer data
handling, spectral database searching, reflectance sampling methods, and high
resolution vibrational- rotational spectra for the study of gases. These
capabilities will allow students to study molecular structures and properties in
a variety of chemical, biological, and environmental samples. Almost 50% of the
students affected by this project are women preparing for science teaching,
scientific or technical careers.
