This project will exploit novel underground communication techniques to utilize
wireless underground soil sensors, commercialize smart irrigation management
solutions, develop a customer base, and validate business hypotheses. The team
has developed an underground communication system based on empirical and
theoretical underground communication models. This system mitigates the adverse
effects of soil on wireless communication. A novel underground antenna design
and software tools are employed to maintain a high communication success under
varying soil moisture conditions. The resulting technology accommodates
communication ranges of up to 85m from an underground sensor to a center pivot
irrigation system. During the summers of 2009-2011, field evaluations were
conducted in corn fields at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln South Central
Agriculture Lab. The developed system provided real-time soil information to
center pivot irrigation systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the
potential to facilitate more efficient irrigation management technologies
through real-time soil information provided by wireless underground sensors.
Accordingly, farmers can make better informed irrigation application (timing)
decisions without the need for tools that obstruct field operations, thereby
significantly reducing costs. The team targets three main customer bases:
Nebraska farmers will be the initial target customer base for early adoptions
and retro-fit. In addition, three of the four major center pivot irrigation
companies are based in Nebraska and hold the 75% of the market. At the end of
the project, an operational, wireless underground sensor-aided center pivot
irrigation system and a viable business model will be demonstrated. Accordingly,
water efficiency in crop production can be improved by utilizing real-time soil
information in agriculture.
