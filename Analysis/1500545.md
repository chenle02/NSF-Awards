The PI studies the interconnections between the fields of geometry, physics,
dynamics, statistics and number theory. A geometry on a space is a means of
measuring distance in the space and can be thought of as giving the space a
shape. One approach to studying the geometry on a space is to consider the
geodesic flow; this is an object that generalizes the notion of a straight line
to spaces that are curved. By studying the properties of this object much can be
discovered about the geometry itself. For example, the question of how many flow
paths close up is related to the distribution of prime numbers. Often different
geometries can be placed on a space and thus one obtains a space of shapes. A
natural question to ask is if this space of shapes can be given a nice shape
itself. The PI proposes to study these geometries on the space of geometries and
investigate their properties. The PI will continue his commitment to both
undergraduate and graduate education. The PI will mentor graduate students and
postdoctoral assistant professors on research related to the project. The PI
will also give research talks, expository talks, minicourses and lecture series
on material related to the proposal as well as organize conferences.

The research plan of the PI centers around the use of certain geometric measures
to define structures on moduli spaces and representation varieties. Such
measures include the Hausdorff measure on the limit set of a Kleinian group,
geodesic currents, the Patterson-Sullivan measure of a Kleinian group,
equilibrium measures defined using Themodynamics associated with representations
of hyperbolic groups, and push-forwards of volume measures by certain
geometrically defined functions. One area of study is Higher Teichmuller Theory
which is the study of representation spaces of hyperbolic groups into semi-
simple Lie groups. These are generalizations of the classical Teichmuller space.
Using Thermodynamics, the PI and collaborators define a Pressure geometry on
this Higher Teichmuller space. space. The PI proposes to study the geometric
property of this metric including its curvature, metric completion, and isometry
group. Another area of proposed study is geometric identities; these are
equations that hold on a moduli space of geometries. The PI and collaborators
derive such identities by studying the statistical properties of the geodesic
flow on a hyperbolic manifold. The PI proposes to study these identities and
their relation to other known identities.
