The scientific aim of this project is to participate in an in-depth research and
development investigation on the potential use and mechanical properties of
aramid fiber reinforced concrete (AFRC) already in progress in Japan. Aramid
reinforcement considered in this study is made by weaving filaments in braided
form and impregnating with epoxy resin. Fiber bundles in rod-like form are
expected to replace steel reinforcing bars or prestressing tendons, whereas, cut
in short lengths, can be used as discontinuous-type reinforcement. The proposed
project will be conducted at Mitusi Technical Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.
The Institute has developed the fiber braiding technology using U.S. produced
aramid filaments and is presently very active in various fields of construction
research.
