Analytical and experimental investigations will be carried out in this research.
Experimental tests will be made in a servo-controlled loading device with
tension, torsion, and internal pressure loading arrangements to test thin-walled
tubes. Measurements will be made to determine the stress response to non-
proportional straining history in polycrystalline ductile metal in which strain-
induced plastic anisotropy is generated. The data will then be applied to
formulate constitutive relations which predict such response. This combination
of experimental and analytical research has a good potential to extend the
domain of finite deformations analysis to cases in which the coupling of the
deformation with anisotropic characteristics take place.
