9706507 Yang Yang proposes to study three problems in an analytic approach to
conformal geometry. The first problem is the variational problem: to minimize
the square integral of the Weyl tensor of a four dimensional manifold. The
optimal conformal class which achieves the extremal will have a canonical metric
which is often Einstein, conformally flat, or half conformally flat. The second
problem is to find apriori estimates for solutions of the prescribed scalar
curvature problem on spheres of dimension greater than three. It is expected
that there will be a new phenomenon to be understood which does not arise in the
case for spheres of lower dimensions. The general goal is to find general
conditions for the solvability of the Nirenberg problem in these dimensions. The
third problem is to investigate regularity property of critical maps of
conformally invariant energy functionals. For biharmonic maps in four dimension,
such regularity result will permit the construction of biharmonic maps of four
dimension which represent an arbitrary homotopy class. Yang has already made
good progress on this problem. The project represents an analytic approach to
the study of four dimensional spacetime which may or may not model the actual
physical spacetime in which we live. The idea is to study various global
quantities attached to each spacetime that reflect the local geometric
structure. We then look for the spacetime that optimizes these global
properties. The ones that do often have nice properties and may allow one to
eventually classify the set of all possible spcetimes. The three projects
outlined above are technical aspects that need to be developed to carry out such
a program.
