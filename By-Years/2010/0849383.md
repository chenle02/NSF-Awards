This thematic program will explore the evolving interface between mathematics
and computation. A wide variety of mathematical disciplines are involved,
including computational algebraic geometry and symbolic computation,
computational number theory, computational geometry, topology and dynamics,
complexity and computability in real computation, computer science and
optimization theory. Algorithms will be central, not only in their traditional
role in the invention and analysis of numerical methods, but also as fundamental
theoretical tools for mathematical experimentation and discovery, as proof
techniques, and as models of computability and tractability. By assembling a
large, broad group of participants, ranging from established mathematicians and
computer scientists to graduate students, the program will transform our
knowledge of computational mathematics well into the future.

The Fields Institute in Toronto will host this timely six-month program,
capitalizing on rapidly evolving networks of international expertise linking
mathematics and computation; NSF funding will support participation of junior
U.S. researchers and graduate students. The impact of constantly increasing
computational power on applied mathematics, science and engineering, motivated
by new applications such as encryption, data mining, and web search, has
inevitably led to the study of the computational tools themselves, creating and
reinvigorating a rich spectrum of mathematical disciplines broadly represented
at this special semester. The program involves three one-week focus workshops,
special lecture series and graduate courses (delivered in particular by two
distinguished U.S. female computer scientists, Eva Tardos and Lenore Blum),
diverse senior and junior researchers and postdoctoral fellows making long- and
short-term visits and engaging in day-to-day interaction, and extensive efforts
to disseminate the emerging new science. These diverse activities will integrate
cutting-edge research, interdisciplinary synergy, and learning and training
opportunities for an array of participants as broad and inclusive as possible.
