The principal investigator, in a collaborative effort with Frank Spera (Univ. of
California at Santa Barbara), will model binary solid-melt phase change problems
in magmatic systems. The solid, mush, and totally molten regions will be solved
for temperature, fraction solidified, velocity, pressure, and coexisting solid
(if present) and melt at every location and time. The model will be tested
against existing experimental data for various systems. Further, it will be used
to address fundamental questions about igneous processes for both basaltic and
granitic systems.
