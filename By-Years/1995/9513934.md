This award supports Professor E. James Davis and graduate students of the
University of Washington to collaborate in their research in aerosol chemistry
with Professor Gustav Schweiger of the Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany. They
share an interest in chemical reactions in aerosols which are associated with
atmospheric pollution and ozone depletion. Professor Davis has unique facilities
featuring the coupling of electrodynamic balances with Raman spectroscopy, which
are particularly well suited for the study of relatively slow gas/aerosol
chemical reactions. Professor Schweiger has developed unique facilities which
combine the vibrating orifice drop generator with Raman instruments, an approach
which is well-suited to the study of rapid reactions. Joining of their
complementary expertise and facilities will be mutually beneficial.
Microparticles play an important role in atmospheric phenomena. Condensation
nuclei affect cloud microphysics, and nucleation and growth phenomena dominate
cloud physics. In addition to their chemical role, microdroplets can serve as
optical cavities, and resonances arise from interference of the internally
reflected and refracted light, which complicate analytical inferences. This
collaboration addresses the interaction between elastic and inelastic (Raman)
scattering which is unique to microdroplets, and how this interaction affects
measurement of chemical reactions of particular significance in atmospheric
chemistry.
