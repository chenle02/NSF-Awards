Workshop on Civil Infrastructure Systems (CIS) Research, to be held in October
2001 in Christchurch, New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the
Symposium is to provide an expert forum for identifying and comparing common
problems and solutions, for exchanging ideas on recent and future developments,
and for promoting international cooperative research in all areas of Civil
Infrastructure Systems. The Workshop will last four days. Two days will involve
invited presentations; the third day will consist of workshop sessions; the
fourth day will involve a field visit to the City of Wellington. Prepared papers
by invited representatives from the US and NZ will exemplify contemporary issues
in Civil Infrastructure Systems, with an emphasis on asset planning and
management in a multi-hazard environment.&lt;br/&gt;
