The proposed research will examine sediment transport and deposition under
varying fluvial discharge and oceanic conditions on the Waipaoa River shelf, New
Zealand, and combined with work done at other river-shelf sites along the US
West coast margin, create a framework to explain the differences and
similarities amongst these river systems and assess transport and depositional
patterns on as yet unexamined river-shelf systems.Objectives are to investigate
the conditions under which preservable flood and storm beds form on the river
shelf systems and to create a conceptual framework to predict preservation
potential of flood and storm beds on margins.The study will entail rapid
response sampling, experimental numerical modeling of hydrodynamics and sediment
dynamics, and a global-scoped statistical analysis of the fluvial and oceanic
conditions during sediment transport on shelf systems. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact
include the support of a new, young female post-doctoral researcher and
involvement of undergraduate and graduate students. The results could be useful
to wide range of workers concerned with the coastal research and policy issues.
