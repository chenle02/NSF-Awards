9452343 Morgan Funds are requested to develop a unique laboratory facility in
support of undergraduate research into a range of topics related to animal
physiology. In contrast to traditional physiology laboratories where students
perform a series of prescribed exercises, this facility will support "project-
laboratories" in which small groups of students initiate, carry out, and present
the results of a research project of their own design. I propose to make
computers an integral part of our physiology teaching laboratories at all stages
of data acquisition and analysis, not just when analyzing data obtained using
traditional and now largely outdated physiological instruments (e.g.,
oscilloscopes). Specifically, I wish to develop a computerized facility that
will enable students to develop research skills in physiology in three key
areas. (1) The first is a computerized facility for addressing questions
relevant to energy metabolism and respiratory gas exchange. Equipment requested
includes O2 and CO2 analyzers, an oxygen meter and electrode, and computer data
collecting and analysis software and hardware. (2) The second is a computerized
facility for addressing questions relevant to animal motion (locomotion and
feeding behavior). Equipment requested includes a stereozoom microscope, a video
camera and monitor, a video recorder, and computer. (3) The third is a
computerized facility for addressing physiological questions relevant to nepve
and muscle function. Equipment requested includes physiological transducers, a
preamplifier, and computer data collecting and analysis software and hardware.
Development of technologically sophisticated laboratory facilities such the ones
proposed above is integral to departmental efforts to enhance the quality of
undergraduate education at East Carolina University.
