The Fourteenth Symposium on Real Analysis will be held from June 20 to June 23,
1990 at California State University, San Bernardino. This is the fourteenth in a
series of symposia that have provided real analysts from North America, Europe,
Africa, Australia, and Asia the opportunity to meet, to hear, and to discuss
mathematics. A list of the invited speakers will include Jack Brown, Andrew
Bruckner, Jack Ceder, Alexander Kechris, and David Preiss. Written versions of
all the presentations will appear in the Conference Proceedings Section of the
following volume of the Real Analysis Exchange.
