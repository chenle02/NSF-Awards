JiTTDL is a user-contributor digital library serving the Just-in Time Teaching
community. Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) is a pedagogical strategy designed to
blend active learning with web technology in a traditional classroom setting
(more information is available at www.jitt.org). The library holdings consist of
JiTT resources, such as assignments, assignment construction methods, analysis
rubrics, classroom strategies development, assessment strategies and results,
etc.) These are sharable materials, developed and contributed by faculty from
eighty plus institutions from all science disciplines. The project is: a.
achieving collection of sharable JiTT materials and relating these to research
literature; b. creating a JiTT-specific assessment toolkit; c. developing
metadata to facilitate search and retrieval; d. deploying a "new adopter start
up service" so that implementing JiTT is not technically challenging and
adopters can concentrate on classroom strategies. This includes providing new
faculty with space on the JiTTDL central server during their first JiTT year. e.
developing a mechanism to facilitate the discovery and use of the library
resources; f. providing a tutorial on JiTT use and, underlying philosophy and
architecture; and, g. offering development workshops (JiTTDL stand alone
workshops and JiTTDL components at other national workshops.)
