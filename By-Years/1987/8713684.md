This project investigates problems of maintaining large- scale information
systems. It has been observed that maintenance efforts are hindered because much
of the richness of the design process, namely the process knowledge, is lost in
the course of designing large systems, and a major component of process
knowledge ignored by current methods is knowledge about the teleology of design
decisions. The purpose of this research is to articulate more precisely an
underlying theory of design and maintenance that takes cognizance of the
teleological structure of information systems.
