An enhancement of an advanced laboratory course in modern physics for physics
majors is proposed. The specific goal is to offer new experiments closely
related to present-day research and applications in the areas of atomic physics
and condensed matter, in response to a projected increase of students with
interests in applied and engineering physics. The project introduces to the
laboratory two new experiments: one using a solid state diode laser to do
optical pumping and spectroscopy of atoms in an atomic beam and a second
experiment involving measurements on a high Tc superconductor. The laser
spectroscopy is combined with a Stern-Gerlach experiment to yield a rich variety
of atomic physics effects which would be accessible to the undergraduate
student. In addition to the Stern-Gerlach effect, the experiment allows
demonstrations of: Doppler-free optical spectroscopy, hyperfine structure,
optical pumping, radio frequency resonance, and Zeeman effect. The experiment on
a high Tc superconductor involves measurements of the persistent current.
