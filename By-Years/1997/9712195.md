9712195 Stark, Louise University of the Pacific Special Project: Workshop on
Undergraduate Education and Computer Vision This project provides partial
support for faculty from primarily undergraduate teaching institutions to attend
the IEEE sponsored Workshop on Undergraduate Education and Computer Vision, held
in conjunction with the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) '97
Conference. Growth of the field of image-related computation, including
particularly computer vision and pattern recognition, has created a significant
need for additional educational opportunities in these areas and this project
provides a highly leveraged approach toward meeting a part of that need. The
workshop provides well-documented examples of courses, course modules, case
studies, laboratory resources and other teaching materials to help faculty
design high-quality image-related undergraduate courses.
