Analysis of flood slackwater deposits and paleostage indicators (SWD-PSI) in
appropriate "self-gaging" natural fluvial settings have proven in recent studies
that they yield accurate and complete catalogs of extraordinary floods. The SWD-
PSI catalogs extend hundreds and thousands of years into the past providing real
physical data on the cataclysmic floods that are most problematic to estimate by
conventional methods. The present work capitalizes on this scientific
breakthrough by improving and standardizing SWD-PSI methodology; by developing
new procedures for flood paleomagnitude and age estimation; by incorporating
paleoflood data into flood frequency analysis; by establishing criteria for data
collection and other applications; and by studying the spatial and temporal
patterns of extraordinary floods in relation to regionalization and climate
variability. The academic infrastructure necessary for the healthy development
of paleoflood hydrology as a field of science and engineering will be supported
by this project, and the beneficiaries will be the investigators specializing in
assessing the nature, magnitude, risk and consequences of extraordinary and
cataclysmic floods.
