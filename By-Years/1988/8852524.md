This laboratory improvement program involves engineering students in the full
spectrum of computer integrated manufacturing from the CAD to the CAM phase
through a dedicated experimental laboratory facility. The planned facility would
fulfill two objectives: introduction of key advanced manufacturing technologies,
and investigation of fundamental engineering and scientific concepts and their
application to a real engineering system. The laboratory facility centers around
a fully-instrumented computer numerical control (CNC) machining center that
supports experiments in four interwoven areas, namely, (1) measurement and
analysis of basic physical quantities, (2) manufacturing processes, methods and
equipment, (3) analysis and synthesis of servosystems used in manufacturing
systems, and (4) principles of numerical control, computer numerical control,
and metrology. It is anticipated that the capabilities offered by this facility
would profoundly impact the quality of education in four core courses in the
newly-introduced option in manufacturing.
