CBET-0821459&lt;br/&gt;Guess&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests funds to
purchase equipment that would enable state-of-the-art multi-modal measurement of
human motion at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. The seven major
components were: 1) Force Platforms = Four model OR6-7 force platforms
manufactured by Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., 2). Motion Capture System
= Vicon MX 6-camera motion capture system, 3) Electromyography System = Delsys
Bagnoli 8-channel electromyography system, 4) High Speed Camera and
Optics=Photron's FASTCAM 1024 PCI, 5) High-performance Oscilloscope = Agilent
DSO80604B Infiniium high-performance oscilloscope, 6) Signal/Spectrum Analyzer =
Agilent N9020A รป MXA Signal/Spectrum Analyzer and 7) Network Analyzer Funds =
Agilent N5230A รป PNA-L Network Analyzer. The instruments would be used to: 1)
strengthen and expand existing research activities in biomechanics and
biometrics, 2) enhance existing graduate and senior level engineering courses,
3) boost existing outreach activities aimed at introducing area high school
students to engineering, and 4) foster new research, education, and outreach
initiatives. Four research areas, one for each of the named investigators were
described: 1) Computational Biomechanics, 2) Biometrics of Human Motion 3)
Experimental Biomechanics, and 4) Body Area Sensor
Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
