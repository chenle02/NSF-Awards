Fundamental research is combustion is being conducted. During Phase I, a
systematic study of the mechanisms involved in the formation of soot at high
pressure conditions relevant to diesel engine operation was conducted. A more
thorough study will be performed to validate and elaborate on these results.
Shock tube measurements are proposed for a variety of molecules over a range of
pressures from 1 to 40 atm. A larger number of optical (including laser)
diagnostics at various wavelengths will be validated and used to investigate
kinetic mechanisms of soot initiation as well as soot particulate growth.
