Evolution Problem in General Relativity

Abstract of Proposed Research Sergiu Klainerman

The research focuses on the mathematical analysis of the evolution of the
solutions of the Einstein-field equations. Attention will be concentrated on a
number of conjectures about these solutions. One concerns the relationship
between the curvature tensor and the causal geometry of space-time. Two concern
the phenomenon of "cosmic censorship", other concerns the asymptotic behavior or
"final state" and one about the stability of the Kerr solution. The resolution
of these problems will require the study of the relationship between geometry
and curvature of Lorentzian manifolds as well as analysis of the Einstein
equations.

Einstein's equations are the field equations of general relativity and their
analysis is central to the understanding of many issues in cosmology including
the theory of black holes and gravitational waves. There are only a few exact
solutions known of these equations and this research will pursue a more
mathematical analysis that will prove qualitative results about the solutions.
This analysis should also help the development of algorithms for the numerical
computation of solutions of these equations.
