One of the central open questions in geometry, growing out of theoretical
physics, is the mirror symmetry conjecture which states that a class of
geometric objects, of fundamental importance in many branches of mathematics, as
well as theoretical physics, so called Calabi-Yau manifolds, come in natural
pairs, which are "mirror " in that one geometric aspect of one is equivalent to
a quite different geometric aspect of its pair. The conjecture is important both
because Calabi-Yau manifolds appear in many diverse parts of mathematics, but
also because the mirror aspect unites two branches of mathematics (symplectic
and complex geometry, which measure the two different aspects) in ways not
previously anticipated. Perhaps the most fundamental question is how, given one
such object, one obtains its mirror partner. The main focus of the proposed
research is a detailed program for constructing the mirror to a given Calabi-
Yau. Under this award, the PI will continue mentoring postdocs and training of
graduate students. In addition, he will also mentor high school students in
mathematics.

The award is based on the PI's conjecture (joint with Gross, Hacking, and
Siebert) that certain manifolds (log Calabi Yaus with maximal boundary, or
compact Calabi Yaus close to a the large complex structure limit point of the
moduli space) come with canonical functions, vastly generalizing the classical
theta functions for polarized Abelian varieties. The proposal is to construct
these theta functions and use them to prove a surprisingly simple conjecture on
moduli of polarized Calabi Yau pairs, and to extend to higher dimensions the
PI's construction (joint with Gross, Hacking, and Siebert) of a geometric
compactification of the moduli space of polarised K3 surfaces.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
