The response of the Earth's magnetosphere to the effects of the solar wind is
complex and non-linear. The behavior exhibits features characteristic of
coupling over multiple spatial and temporal scales. This project will develop
models of the magnetosphere based on the framework of phase transitions and
multi-scale coupling. Data from ground-based and spacecraft-based instruments
will be used to study the time evolution of various features in the
magnetosphere. Techniques such as nonlinear filters, multifractal spectra,
mutual information, and multi-scale singular spectrum analysis will be used to
characterize the observed features. These studies will complement models based
on first principles.
