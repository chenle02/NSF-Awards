This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project aims to
investigate the development of photo-reconfigureable surfaces that will enable
control of ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) alignment and switching properties
in ways not previously possible. The central problem is that the FLC-surface
interaction forces needed to produce good optical uniformity of the FLC
(alignment) are different from the forces needed for good analog electro-optic
performance. If successful, our solution to this problem has the potential to
enable sought-after fast analog electro-optic modulation modes (&lt; 100 us)
sought for beam steering, adaptive and active optics, tunable optical filters,
optical information processing, displays, and telecommunications. The Phase I
objective is to develop prototypes of the proposed surface materials and to
evaluate them by building liquid crystal test cells. The crucial test will be to
determine whether or not the surfaces can be configured first to promote good
FLC alignment during cell fabrication, and then be photo-reconfigured into a
state providing optimal surface forces for analog electro-optic
modulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analog electro-optic modulation that would
be enabled by the proposed innovation is the foundation for a class of advanced
optical devices. A leading example is laser beam steering and optical wave front
correction that find application in free-space optical communications, in MxN
all-optical switches for telecommunications, and in beam steering and beam
shaping for laser radar in aviation. It would also be useful in megabit write
heads for the emerging holographic data storage industry, in tunable filters
used in optical telecommunications, in spatial light modulators for optical
information processing, and in microdisplays for consumer
electronics.&lt;br/&gt;
