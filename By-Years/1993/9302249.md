9302249 Borning This is the first year of a three-year continuing award to
investigate the use of the constaint-based languages and systems and their
hirarchies in interactive interfaces. Four specific constraint-based language
and environment areas are targeted in this project: 1) the study and development
of efficient incremental constraint satifaction alogrithms, including algorithms
for systems with cycles and constraints with multiple outputs, 2) the
improvement of debugging tools and techniques for constraint satisfaction
systems, 3) the integration of the constraint-based language use with an object-
oriented imperative language, and 4) the testing and validation of results from
the three previously mentioned research areas in an exploratory interactive
application such as a how-things-work electronic encyclopedia.
