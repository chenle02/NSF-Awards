This planning grant will lead to a full proposal from the Bozeman Public
Schools. The planning grant will initiate an effort to "create a unique and
innovative systemic change model for dissemination of new skills unique to rural
schools." Through a myriad of task groups, issues are examined in the context of
rural education where resources are often not available locally and
collaborative networks are difficult to establish. The focus of the project is
on individual teacher change or adaptation through a school district based
collaborative re-training project for the region. The planning grant begins the
examination and compilation of strategies that will lead to a Teacher
Enhancement proposal. The cost sharing is estimated at 22%
