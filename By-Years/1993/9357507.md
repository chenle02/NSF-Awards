9357507 Shen This is a New Young Investigator Award for research in condensed
matter physics using electron spectroscopy techniques. These techniques
represent a powerful tool to study magnetic 3d and 4f electrons in atoms in
magnetic and superconducting materials. This research will mainly involve spin-
polarized appearance potential spectroscopy and spin-polarized inverse
photoemission spectroscopy. These techniques will be used to study magnetic and
other materials, particularly thin films and multilayers. These studies will be
complimented by high-resolution photoemission and other experimental techniques.
%%% This New Young Investigator Award will support research to develop an
advanced magnetic materials characterization technique and will be carried out
in close collaboration with scientists from IBM who have provided most of the
equipment needed for the project. This technique is currently unique in the US
and has potential to provide fundamental information about the materials
properties of magnetic thin films and multilayers. These properties are
important for applications of these materials as sensors and as magnetic storage
media. ***
