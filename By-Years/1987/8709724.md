The mammal division of the Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collection, at Texas A&M
University, has grown steadily since its inception in 1937 and currently ranks
among the 12 largest institutional collections of Recent mammals in the United
States. The strength of the mammal division lies primarily in its North American
material, particularly Texas and New Mexico; however, it also has nationally
important collections from Central and South America. Previous NSF awards have
funded the reorganization, updating and curation of all of the dry materials
(skins and skeletons) in the collection. This project will improve access to
non-traditional preparations, primarily chromosomal and frozen tissue specimens,
by providing support for curating and cross-referencing them to the dry
specimens. Funds will be used to purchase equipment and supplies to improve the
physical storage of the ancillary preparations and to fund a collection
assistant position for one year. The mammal division has prepared a model
agreement specifying the ground rules for making loans of the non- traditional
specimens to scientists throughout the country and for accessioning new
ancillary specimens into the collection.
