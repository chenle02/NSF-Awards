The transformation of manufacturing activities in the United States and the
rest of the world has engendered profound changes in the location of industrial
activity. Similarly, changing patterns of foreign investment have been
documented and analyzed. Relatively little effort has been made to merge these
two themes, however, thereby shedding new light on how investments by foreigners
have altered production patterns in the U.S. and elsewhere. This doctoral
dissertation research proposal will analyze two facets of Japanese investment in
U.S. manufacturing. First, data on Japanese investment in different states will
be statistically analyzed in order to provide a more detailed description and
theoretically based explanation of those patterns. Second, an analysis of the
ways in which U.S.-based Japanese manufacturers have used materials transfers to
integrate themselves into the economy at a number of geographic scales will be
based on data gathered through a survey of manufacturing executives. This
project will provide direct and indirect benefits. It will contribute to general
scientific understanding by providing an empirical analysis of some relevant
theories. It will have practical implications through its examination of the
geographic patterns of investment and materials linkages of Japanese industrial
firms operating in the U.S., and it will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising graduate student to expand and refine his basic research skills.
