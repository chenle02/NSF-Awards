This award supports work to understand neutrinos: the smallest but most common
massive particle in the universe. Although there are a billion neutrinos for
every more well-known electron or proton, neutrinos interact only via the so-
called "weak" force: so they rarely bump into anything, even the detectors
designed to study them. That means they are also the least well understood of
the fundamental particles. One of the big mysteries in neutrino science is how
they change (or ?oscillate?) from one type to another. Neutrino oscillation
experiments explore possible explanations for the difference between matter and
anti-matter in the Universe. This project will improve the computational tools
for simulating and estimating neutrino fluxes for existing and future neutrino
oscillation experiments. These tools are necessary for efficient and cost-
effective design of the neutrino beams and detectors used in high-energy
particle physics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The best available data on hadron
production cross sections and other experimental inputs will be incorporated
into existing beam-line simulations, and improved tools for rapid iteration of
studies for novel beam-line designs will be created. This effort will both
produce improved simulations of the NuMI beamline at Fermilab, leading to
improved measurements of neutrino cross sections in the MINERvA experiment, and
inform the design and optimization of the future DUNE/LBNF long baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment. The methods used in this program are also
broadly applicable to the optimization of beam-line and detector systems for
physics research. Graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to modern
simulation and computing techniques. Previous students from this group have gone
on to highly successful careers both in the private sector and in High Energy
Physics.
