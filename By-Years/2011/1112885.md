This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a technology that can effectively capture ventilation air methane (VAM)
generated in coal mine operation and convert it to fuels. VAM is the #1 cause of
coal mine explosion. Currently, the only available method to reduce this risk is
to use powerful ventilation systems, which are costly to maintain and
insufficient to handle emergencies. Methane is also a greenhouse gas that is
over 20 times more effective in trapping heat than CO2. Each year tens of
millions tons of methane are released into the atmosphere due to mining
activities. The proposed technology will provide an ideal technical solution
that can solve all the main concerns of VAM - safety, environment, and energy.
Compared to existing methods, such as ground VAM burners, the proposed
technology features underground operation, room-temperature operation, portable
in size, stand-alone, energy efficient and much lower costs.

The broader/commercial impacts of this research are the reduction of coal mine
accidents, reduction of mine shut-down time, increase of work place safety, a
technology that may lead to further development and applications for the
treatment of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), a constant threat to people
safety and health. Although, this project targets at the coal mine industry at
Phase I, the technology developed in this project can be easily adopted for
applications in other industries without significant modification, such as
petroleum, chemical engineering, pharmaceuticals and residential air quality
control etc.
