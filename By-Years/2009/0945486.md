This SBIR Phase I project will study novel algal strains to produce large
amounts of high quality animal feed using on-farm resources including spare
heat, flue gas, and livestock manure. Research will focus on algal growth under
cool climate and low sun conditions to achieve reliable year-round production of
large amounts for livestock feed in the upper Midwest. This project seeks to
investigate growing algae in raceway reactors located within green houses. The
purpose of growing the algae will be to provide animal feed. The nutrients will
come from diluted anaerobically-treated hog waste. Heat will be provided from
coal-fired boiler and flue gases will be used to provide carbon dioxide. Flue
gases will be sparged either in a tank full of feed water or through the fluid
in the raceway pond itself. The work will be carried out on a farm and the algae
will be harvested using a bag system. Harvested algae will be evaluated in a
nearby university for its utility as animal feed. Several algal strains will be
evaluated. Whole algae will be fed to animals also to test its effectiveness as
feed.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be that success in the project
research could help farmers become a little less dependent on energy from fossil
fuels. If the harvested algae can be utilized as such without much treatment, it
will represent an operation that can perhaps be sustained even on medium sized
farms. There appears to be considerable interest in such activity from farmer
groups. The facility will also be used to educate high school students in the
art of sustainable farming and train in plant operation. Success in meeting the
objectives of this SBIR project could lead to fairly rapid commercial success.
The use of aquaculture for animal feed production is anticipated to have a
smaller footprint and be less energy and water intensive as opposed to
terrestrial crops. The use of algae as livestock feed also carries the distinct
possibility of producing meat and dairy products with a more favorable (with
respect to human health) fatty acid profile.
