Internet miscreants cooperate for profit in identity theft, denial of service,
etc.  Meanwhile, defending organizations act separately and treat Internet
information security (infosec) as a cost to be minimized. Customers could choose
more wisely among competing Internet firms if they knew which had good or bad
security, and such fame or shame would cause firms to improve security to retain
and attract customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To verify such a policy of peer
influence, this project uses a readily available stand-in for organizational
infosec: outbound spam (unsolicited bulk email).  Other security problems may
not cause outbound spam, and this project makes no claims to solve all problems.
 However, just as a sneeze indicates disease, spam indicates poor infosec that
could be exploited for even worse purposes (theft, denial of service, blackmail,
etc.), and no organization wants to be seen to have such
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project ranks similar organizations in
SpamRankings.net, using daily data from multiple anti-spam blocklists,
aggregating it from IP addresses into routing blocks (Autonomous Systems), and
categorizing their owners by geography and type (hosting, medical, ISP, etc.).
 Field experiments, including the relative effects of different publicity
strategies, seek to determine whether publishing information on a symptom of
infosec (outbound spam) causes firms to improve that
symptom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Positive experimental results will serve as
stepping stones to policy recommendations of legislative mandates of timely and
publicly accessible incident disclosure to enable more third-party peer rankings
for further infosec improvement.  Minimal enforcement could thus catalyze
significant improvements in Internet usability, profitability, and national
security.
