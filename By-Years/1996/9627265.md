967265 Euler This research project is concerned with the development of new
thin film strain gages. Three approaches will be used. The first employs wide
band gap semiconductors as the active sensing element in a strain gage where
both resistivity and absorption spectroscopy can be used to monitor the strain.
These materials are attractive because they have good reproductivity, long term
environmental and sensor stability, and large gage factors. The second approach
will use polymers as the sensing element. The optical response of these
materials is also sensitive to strain with the potential to lead to inexpensive,
commodity level active strain elements. Finally, new polymers will be developed
that store the integrated strain over time and can be used to measure
accumulated damage to the substrate. The development of this aspect of the
research relies on the ability to monitor the strain response conveniently such
as during earthquake, wind, or vehicle induced structural vibrations using the
optical methodology developed in the initial stages of the project. A successful
outcome to the research will lead to cheaper strain gages that, because of the
thin film nature, can be applied to buildings and infrastructure materials to
monitor the strain and to assess the damage during a catastrophic event such as
an earthquake. ***
