This proposal requests funds to help support a number of U.S. scientists,
including graduate students, postdocs and junior scientists to attend the "2014
US Volcano Seismology workshop" to be held at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in
Anchorage on April 29, 2014. The aims of this workshop is to bring together the
U.S. volcano seismology community in a one day long series of small- and large-
group discussions aimed at developing a community-driven plan to address the key
outstanding scientific and technical challenges in the field of volcano
seismology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations of volcano-seismic phenomena
generally provide one of the most reliable bases for forecasting hazardous
volcanic phenomena. As a result, the number of seismically-monitored volcanoes
has increased dramatically in recent years, resulting in a large proliferation
of high-quality data sets. This workshop will address questions related to the
effective organization and exploitation of this large data set to address some
of the most critical outstanding issues in the field, and it is part of an
international concerted effort to advance the field through large-scale
collaborative research, tool-building and resource sharing.
