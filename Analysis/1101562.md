This award will provide support to defray expenses of participants to attend a
conference on analysis and its applications during May 16-20, 2011 at Princeton
University.

This major conference will include lectures by world leaders in Harmonic
Analysis, Several Complex Variables, Partial Differential Equations, and
Geometric Analysis. The conference will also emphasize the interaction of
Analysis with Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Theoretical Computer Science.
All of these areas were significantly impacted by the research and teaching of
Elias Stein, and the conference is being organized in honor of his influence.

The conference will allow participants, as well as others in the mathematical
community, to learn about recent progress on a broad range of subjects in
Analysis. The organizers will invite graduate students, young postdocs, women
and minority researchers to participate actively in the conference. In addition
to the plenary lectures, the conference will include a panel discussion on
teaching Mathematics, collaboration in Mathematics, and the writing of
Mathematics books.
