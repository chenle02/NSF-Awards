This award provides funds to the Mid-Atlantic Mass Spectroscopy Laboratory
(MAMS) for purchase of a new high resolution, double- focussing mass
spectrometer and support of a postdoctoral fellow who will be active in
technique development with the new instrument. MAMS is an NSF funded regional
facility at The Johns Hopkins University that provides mass spectroscopic
analyses to investigators at a number of institutions, either as a service or
through collaborative research projects. Dr. Cotter is an outstanding young
investigator known particularly for his technique development activities in use
of time of flight (TOF) and plasma desorption mass spectrometry which he
proposes to continue. The new instrument will replace two older instruments of
differing types. Collaborative projects include structural studies of lipids and
composition of lipid membranes, structure function relationships in enzymes and
other proteins, and structures of oligosaccharide side-chains on glycoproteins
and glycolipids. In the last decade or so, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a
technique of increasing usefulness to biologists and biochemists. MS is of
particular use in the analysis of lipids, of polysaccharides, of the types and
sites of naturally occurring modifications of proteins, and of other aspects of
protein structure including primary sequence. Because of the expense of their
purchase and operation of the spectrometers, the disparate types of biological
problems for which MS is useful, and the real but often infrequent need for MS
in a given research project, mass spectrometers are particularly suited for a
service facility such as MAMS that provides analyses for investigators at a
number of institutions. To be of maximum benefit, such facilities should be
equipped with sensitive and reliable instruments which minimize the risk of
sample loss. The purchase of a new spectrometer should insure that the state of
the art MS is available to the research community through the MAMS.
