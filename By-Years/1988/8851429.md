A Perkin-Elmer Model 1640 FT-IR spectrophotometer complete with a diffuse
reflectance accessory and a graphics plotter has been acquired. The theory and
practice of FT-IR analysis is being incorporated into the introductory organic
course as well as five upper division laboratory courses. The instrument is also
being used in undergraduate research. Specific course improvements include the
enhancement and expansion of IR analysis in organic laboratories, the
introduction of FT theory and instrumentation into analytical, as well as the
extension of IR analysis to small samples and opaque materials and extensive
demonstration of the FT-IR capabilities as both a qualitative and quantitative
tool. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal services.
