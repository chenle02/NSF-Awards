The basic goal of the Engineering Research Center for Intelligent Manufacturing
Systems (INS) is to stimulate development of fundamental knowledge in
engineering fields that will enhance the international competitiveness of U.S.
industry and prepare engineers to contribute more effectively through better
engineering practice. The center focuses upon discrete product manufacturing.
Within a manufacturing enterprise, the activities addressed include all of the
steps in realizing products from early design to final assembly and finishing.
Research goes beyond current emphases on flexibility and computer integration,
to the next logical step in the continuing evolution of manufacturing practices.
In particular, IMS will possess the ability to respond, promptly and correctly,
to changes in requirements. These changes may be deliberate (as in new product
introductions) or forced (as in machine breakdowns or material shortages), but
in any case are inevitable in the factories of the future. The key issue is
responsiveness. The research program is organized into seven related thrust
areas: Design, Planning and Control, Processing, Transport, communications,
Sensing, and Assembly. Projects within these areas produce enabling technology
for the IMS and eventually merge via integration projects. Each project is
organized as a cross-disciplinary team effort structured to meet specific
objectives relating to needs of the IMS. This action is a five- year renewal.
