A devastating earthquake occurred in Wenchurn, Sichurn province, China on May
12, 2008 and caused over 70,000 deaths. This SGER proposal is to support a team
of US earthquake engineering specialists to conduct field reconnaissance study
to recover perishable earthquake and damage data , and prepare a report to NSF
on the new research challenges and disaster mitigating actions that could be
carried out and implemented under the mechanisms of US-China S&T Protocol on
Cooperative Earthquake Studies, Annex III.

The emphasis of this study is placed on seismic design and retrofit of buildings
and structures-particularly school and hospital buildings, geotechnical
engineering (slope stability), and ground motions (aftershock tracking and
monitoring). This team will travel to Chengdu, China to join a companion
Japanese team to conduct field survey during July 13-15 under the logistical
support and guidance of Sichurn Provincail Department of Science and Technology.
Ultimately it is expected to reach a comprehensive understanding as to where we
are and where shall we go from here in terms of US-China Annex III Earthquake
Protocol, of which ENG/NSF is the Program Administrator from the US-side.
