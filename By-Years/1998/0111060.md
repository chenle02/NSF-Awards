Multidimensional, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy will be used to investigate the
folding, cation binding, and structures of (1) the hairpin ribozyme from the
tobacco ringspot virus satellite and (2) telomerase RNA domains. The hairpin
ribozyme studies are a continuation of previous structural studies of the
individual domains A and B, and will focus on the folding pathway and cation
interactions of the intact ribozyme. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein which is
responsible for replication of telomere DNA found at the physical ends of
chromosomes. Telomerase activity is generally undetectable in somatic cells, and
high levels of telomerase activity are only found in proliferating germ cells
and cancer cells. The known components of human telomerase are a reverse
transcriptase (hTERT) which catalyzes the addition of the nucleotides, a 451
nucleotide RNA (hTR) which contains the template for the synthesized DNA, and
telomerase associated protein 1 (TP1). The proposed secondary structure of the
vertebrate telomerase RNAs based on phylogeny consists of four conserved
structural domains: the pseudoknot domain, the CR4-CR5 domain, the Box H/ACA
domain, and the CR7 domain. This essential core structure appears to be
preserved despite extensive sequence and length divergence. The conservation of
the core telomerase RNA structure and a variety of functional studies both in
vitro and in vivo indicate that the structure of the RNA plays an important role
in telomerase function. The structures of essential subdomains of telomerase
RNA, specifically in the pseudoknot and box H/ACA domains, will be determined
and their interactions with known telomerase binding proteins will be studied.
These structural studies should complement the existing information on the
molecular biology and biochemistry of these enzymes, and provide new insights
into RNA folding, tertiary structure, role of cations in tertiary structure
formation, and catalysis. In addition, the telomerase studies will provide basic
information on the structure and assembly of the telomerase RNP complex.
