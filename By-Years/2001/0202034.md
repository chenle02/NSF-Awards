0202034 Little The mixing mechanisms induced in water by bubble-plumes will be
identified and incorporated into a coupled bubble-plume reservoir model for
design and operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation systems.&lt;br/&gt;Field
testing will be conducted using a linear bubble-plume diffuser in a small water
supply reservoir in Virginia and using six circular bubble-plume diffusers in a
mid-sized eutrophic lake in Switzerland. Oxygen transfer and plume induced
mixing will be monitored before, during and after diffuser operation. In
addition, biogeochemical fluxes will be monitored.&lt;br/&gt;This research will
enable the development of the first scientifically rigorous coupled bubble-
plume/ two dimensional reservoir model that includes mechanistic features of
oxygen transfer, plume-induced mixing and the impact on biogeochemical fluxes,
including SOD.&lt;br/&gt;
