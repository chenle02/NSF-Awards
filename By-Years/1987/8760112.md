The biggest challenges facing robotics today are issues dealing with novelty,
processor faults and self-organization. To meet these needs, the proposed study
will implement a prototype of a neural network model used to adaptively control
the coordination of a multijoint robot arm and two stereo cameras. The
implementation will be based on the computer simulations of an existing neural
network model of adaptive hand-eye coordination. The implementation will evolve
smoothly in two generations: the first, with commercially available equipment
and the second, with new dedicated hardware. In phase I of the SBIR work, the
implementation will be designed for a combination of image processing hardware
and a robot arm. When fully implemented on dedicated hardware in SBIR phase II,
this prototype system will coordinate a multi-joint robot arm to adaptively
reach targets in three dimensions in real time. The neural system self-organizes
and maintains visual- motor calibrations starting with only loosely defined
relationships. The system tolerates internal noise, partial system damage and
changes in the mechanical and optical parameters of the robot as they occur
during wear. This adaptability will replace operator calibration in many
different robots.
