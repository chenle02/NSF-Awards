The project conducts a large scale, research and technical assistance project
that investigates the nature of elementary and middle school principals'
knowledge of mathematics and beliefs about mathematics teaching and learning
through the construct of Leadership Content Knowledge (LCK) and its effect on
their practices of classroom observation and teacher supervision. The project
addresses the key MSP features of teacher retention, challenging courses and
curricula and sustainability. All interested MSPs that address middle school
mathematics will have the opportunity to participate. Phase I of the work yields
diagnostic information about the principals' level of LCK which MSPs can use as
a needs assessment. In Phase II half of the participants will receive leadership
training in mathematics teaching and learning as an intervention to explore
aspects of LCK that change most readily and those that are more resistant to
change. Phase III will use comparative case studies to address how principals
with known LCK conduct classroom observations, make judgments about the quality
of instruction, and indirectly, affect students' mathematics achievement. The
research allows the PI to refine instruments that assess the multidimensional
aspects of LCK that will be shared through the MSP Learning Network.
