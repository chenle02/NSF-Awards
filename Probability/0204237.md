A close relationship between linear elliptic and parabolic partial differential
equations and Markov diffusion processes played an important role in the
development of both fields during the last century. A new chapter in this
direction -- an interplay between a class of semilinear equations and
superdiffusions -- has evolved over the past 15 or so years. The theory has
reached a certain stage of maturity. However some key problems remain open (for
instance, the uniqueness of the solution with a given fine trace and the
structure of exit boundaries of superdiffusions). The work on these problems is
the subject of the proposal. Superdiffusions is a special class of branching
measure-valued processes also known as superprocesses. Outside of pure
mathematics, they play a significant role in population genetics and they
provide new tools for the study of complex physical systems with infinitely many
degrees of freedom. For about two decades these processes have attracted the
efforts of many investigators around the world.
