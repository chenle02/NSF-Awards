Four workshops are designed for women in cognitive science, especially women in
the early stages of their academic career. The focus will be on the "imposter
phenomenon," the internal emotional experience of not being qualified, both
intellectually and professionally, despite objective evidence indicating the
opposite. Research suggests that this phenomenon is widespread but is
experienced more often by women than by men. Its well-documented aversive
effects can be a significant psychological barrier to seeking a career in
science. The workshops focus on negotiation techniques to create opportunities
and optimize mechanisms to sustain research productivity. A second focus is on
predoctoral, postdoctoral, and early career grant application writing. The
workshops are to be held in conjunction with four major scientific meetings in
Psychology, across a broad geographical area (the Cognitive Science Society, the
Psychonomic Society, the Association for Psychological Science, and the Society
for Mathematical Psychology). The workshops will take the form of a public forum
with invited speaker-panelists to initiate discussion about best practices for
the professional advancement of women in cognitive science at the individual and
institutional level. By partnering with these established societies, the
workshops will maximize the outreach potential to a group that continues to be
underrepresented in senior academic positions in the cognitive sciences.
