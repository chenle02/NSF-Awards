This award will support a software development effort that, in close liaison
with major scientific communities, will expand the use and increase the
effectiveness of a major scientific preprint archiving system, and focus on the
design, implementation, and incorporation of new, innovative tools for
electronic communication of research results. Moreover new archives will be made
available to other communities. During the past two years a powerful new tool
has been developed for exchange and processing of scientific information. The
Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed and
implemented an "e-Print Archive" system for the distribution, archiving, and
searching of scientific preprints. Thus far, e-Print Archives have been set up
for twelve scientific disciplines, and are rapidly becoming the primary means of
information exchange in the communities they serve. The system has been operated
as a community service in a "cottage industry" mode by the particle theory group
at Los Alamos. The Principal Investigator on this proposal, Paul Ginsparg, has
had essentially full responsibility for software/hardware maintenance as well as
user support. Given its importance to the research communities it serves, the
e-Print system project now needs long-term stability. Consequently, this award
will allow it to be transferred to a team of computer personnel that will
guarantee its reliability and development, and in particular to be put on a firm
technical support basis.
