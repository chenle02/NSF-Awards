"Strings '90," a conference dealing with various aspects of the superstring
theory of elementary particle physics, was held March 12-17, 1990 at Texas
A&amp;M University. The conference brought together many leading experts, both
junior and senior, in superstring theory to discuss recent developments and
future directions. While superstring theory is potentially the answer to the
very fundamental question of how one may describe and unify all of the
fundamental forces, including gravity, itis also dauntingly difficult, and
interactions which can take place at conferences such as this one are very
important to progress in the field. Also important is the publication of a
proceedings which will make the developments reported at the conference
accessible to the many unable to attend. The creation of the proceedings is the
project supported by the present award.
