A conference on Cognition "Expertise and Skill Acquisition: The Impact of
William G. Chase" will be the 36th conference in the Carnegie Mellon Symposium
series on cognition. The conference aims to examine expertise, complex skill
acquisition, memory, and visual information processing, all areas in which the
late William G. Chase has had substantial impact. The conference will frame
issues for future investigation and recruit and motivate new and promising
students to the field. An additional aim is to illustrate for policy-makers and
the public how fundamental research in theoretically significant domains (e.g.,
chess, mnemonics, mental calculation, navigational skills) can lead to
substantial practical contributions to contemporary societal and national
interests, as well as to the growth of scientific knowledge and understanding.
