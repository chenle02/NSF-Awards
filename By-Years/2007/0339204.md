Do older and younger adults differ in how they process information? Do they make
systematically different decisions as a result? How can we help older adults
make better decisions? The aim of the proposed research is to examine adult age
differences in affective (feeling-based) and deliberative (thought-based)
information processes in order to understand how such dual information
processing might impact judgments and decisions. Five experiments will be
conducted to study whether older adults may react more to and learn more from
affective experiences than younger adults and whether relevant and irrelevant
sources of feelings may impact older-adult decision performance more. The tasks
are intended to identify factors that might hurt older adult performance and to
test methods to enhance their decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will add to the growing body of knowledge concerning how affective and
deliberative ways of thinking may follow particular developmental paths. In
addition, proposals to improve decision-making abilities are based primarily on
research with younger adults. Decision making is essential to life at all ages,
however, and older adults are increasingly being asked to make their own
decisions. No longer are health and financial decisions left entirely to
specialists such as the family doctor. Instead, older adults are faced with more
choices and more information than in previous generations at a point in their
lives when their abilities to deliberate carefully about important decisions may
be declining. Understanding the psychological processes that underlie the
judgments and decisions of older adults will help us to identify areas in which
they may be most vulnerable and guide efforts to help them maintain their
health, financial security, and quality of life.
