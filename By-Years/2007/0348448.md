This project proposes to utilize the superior mechanical properties of
statically and kinematically determinate truss structures (as defined by
Maxwell's rule) in a novel way-to create a three-dimensional morphing system
that provides both efficient propulsion and high maneuverability. The idea is to
take advantage of the stiffness and strength of these structures, and enable
them to change shape by replacing some of the passive members with actuators.
This project will then study the feasibility of using this structure as the
basis of a low powered, biomimetic-actuating system that can achieve the
propulsive and control capabilities of the dolphin and manta ray. The goal is to
use this project as a first step in generating a bio-inspired autonomous
underwater vehicle (AUV), capable of performing tasks where it would be
dangerous for humans to go. To achieve the project's goals, the Principle
Investigator will integrate the sciences of biomechanics, adaptive
multifunctional materials, and artificial muscles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
