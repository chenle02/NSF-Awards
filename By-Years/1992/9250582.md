Innovative and improved investigations with the computerized HP 8452 UV/VIS
spectrophotometer system (HP SPECTRO) in plant biology enable students to: 1)
study and compare absorption spectra of different biological molecules; 2)
evaluate rates of reactions through the automated features of the instrument; 3)
store, retrieve, and extrapolate data acquired; 4) take advantage of time saved
to pursue additional spectrophotometric investigations; 5) use a state-of-the-
art instrument to obtain real data for understanding biological phenomena; and
6) obtain expertise in operation of a modern biological instrument. Classes
using this instrumentation include: Plant Biology (required for all biology
majors), Plant Physiology, Plant Anatomy, and Individual Study.
