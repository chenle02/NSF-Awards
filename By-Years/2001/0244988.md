The proposal is a request for support to cover the costs of producing 10,000
six-page brochures to accompany the recent HEPAP subpanel report on long range
planning for U.S. high-energy physics. The tentative title of the brochure is
"The Science Ahead, the Way to Discovery." The brochure will have three pages
devoted to science and another three pages covering the field's plans for the
future. It will show how science drives the long-range plans. It will be
distributed in print, but will also be available on the web. The audience will
include the general public, interested students, other scientists and the makers
of public policy.
