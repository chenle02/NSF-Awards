0406388&lt;br/&gt;Deering&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Delaware
provides support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to be used
on R/V Cape Henlopen, a 120' research vessel operated as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Specifically,
support is recommended to acquire two new fluorometers, a sound velocity probe,
a bottom grab sampler, and a thermosalinograph, all for shared-use operation.
These acquisitions provide an important upgrade in capabilities for marine
scientists using R/V Cape Henlopen in their research during 2004 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
