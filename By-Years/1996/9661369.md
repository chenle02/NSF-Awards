*** 9661369 Chibante This proposal explores the viability of solvent-free
manufacture of the molecular form of carbon, know collectively as fullerenes. As
part of an innovative design in the manufacturing process, it is proposed to
utilize direct in situ sublimation of molecular fullerenes from the nascent
"soot", during continuous on-line production. Important parameters such as
temperature gradient, inert gas pressure and residence time will be evaluated.
The evolution of this Phase I project will naturally grow into the Phase II
program wherein three further major concepts will be implemented. These advances
will lead to more than an order magnitude decrease in production cost (<$300
/kg) in the short-term, and will set the precedent for large scale manufacture.
The proposed Phase I/II program will result in a marked decrease in cost and
greatly increased availability and quality of these fundamental materials in the
immediate future. The demand continues to grow rapidly and practical
applications are within range of the lower anticipated costs. ***
