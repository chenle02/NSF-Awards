This project seeks to provide new understanding of the cognitive and assessment
conditions that support learning of culturally and linguistically diverse
children. The study would examine some prevailing myths about the cause of
differences in mathematics performance. The theory for the study is drawn from
cognitive science theory, constructivism, and socio-cultural theories of
learning and thus investigates the interaction among cognitive processes and the
cultural context. Multiple forms of assessments would be designed. It will show
whether assessment formats and design influence the measurement of performance,
how different assessment methods that reflect the linguistic and cultural
background of students affect performance, and it will conduct multivariate
analyses to detect other performance factors. One goal of the study is to
provide systematic examination of several explanatory factors of student
achievement in mathematics for grades 4 to 8.
