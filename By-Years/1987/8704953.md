The primary objective of this U.S. Yugoslav cooperative research project between
Krunoslav Pisk of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute's Department of Physics in
Zagreb and Richard H. Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh's Department of
Physics is to investigate higher order photon-electron interaction in external
electromagnetic fields. The two groups interests and abilities are well matched
and through this joint collaboration a new method for describing photon-electron
interactions will be developed. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav
Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a
joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav
governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of
State and no NSF funds are involved. The grants are composed principally of
Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Funds include
travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for
Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
