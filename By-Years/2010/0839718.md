This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop silicon
germanium quantum dot lasers. The quantum dot approach has demonstratable
advantages for the near-IR wavelengths of 1.3 to 1.55 micron.

Near-IR lasers emitting at 1.3 ìm and 1.55 ìm are very important to fullfill the
needs of increasing data bandwidth. By developing systems on silicon, a photonic
integrated circuit can be fabricated that will address the needs of the telecom
marketplace. A low cost 1.3 ìm wavelength laser is viewed by industry analysts
as a key-enabling device for high volume production of fiber-optic transceivers
for the metro and metro access markets.
