The principal investigator will continue his work on Markov processes in
population genetics. Several specific problems will be studied. For example, the
investigator will study the two- locus diffusion model of Ohta, incorporating
gene conversion. Another example is the coupling of the coalescent
(genealogical) and diffusion versions of the infinitely-many-neutral alleles
model.
