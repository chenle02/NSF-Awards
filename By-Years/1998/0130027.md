Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the feasibility of genetic
studies of avian choice behavior. The project has two key goals. First, it will
develop a system for testing the choice behavior of Coturnix quail that will
allow the investigators to efficiently assay several aspects of choice behavior,
such as how quickly food preferences develop, and how sensitive preferences are
to differences in the timing and amount of food reward. The second goal of this
project is to make preliminary estimates of the heritability of, and
correlations between preference traits. These estimates will be made by
comparing the measured "preference traits" of related individuals. In this study
we will test half-sib families, that is, family groups in which a given pair of
quail has the same father, but different mothers. This method allows us to
exclude possible maternal effects. The resulting genetic estimates will allow us
to make predictions about how choice behavior should respond to natural or
artificial selection. Genetic correlations between traits provide information
about the extent to which the different aspects of choice behavior are
influenced by the same genes.&lt;br/&gt;
