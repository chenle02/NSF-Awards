This award funds a 2018 workshop in game theory and applications of game theory.
The conference, follow-on workshops, and lectures are held each summer as a
coordinated program designed to bring together a distinguished group of senior
scientists from around the globe with junior faculty and graduate students from
across the U.S. Topics include new developments in game theory, areas in the
intersection between game theory and computer science (such as Computation and
Privacy), and applications of game theory to business and public policy. The
activities advance science by giving young scholars the opportunity to form new
research collaborations and present their work to a distinguished
audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
