This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project addresses the challenge
of scaling pre-silicon functional verification of digital integrated circuits
such as microprocessors, ASIC microcontrollers, and SOC products. The complexity
of industrial designs results in an large state space with vast room for errors,
and prevents designers from being able to comprehensively reason about the
correctness of systems deployed in numerous devices, whose real-time failure
causes serious losses, monetary and otherwise. Earlier research showed that
complexity can be significantly reduced using abstraction and reasoning methods
that are applied on design descriptions used for production. Expected challenges
moving forward include automatic tuning of the abstraction, and effective
reduction to reasoning engines that can cope with the exponential blowup in the
size of designs.

Reveal's effort specifically addresses the needs of designer and verification
engineers by automating the formal verification process through an iterative
abstraction and refinement process. The target market for Reveal includes both
the integrated design manufacturing and fabless ASIC/SOC suppliers. A typical
potential customer would be an ASIC semiconductor design company who is looking
to lower its verification costs, decrease time-to-market, and reduce the risks
of discovering errors during post-silicon verification or post-production. Given
that Reveal's primary function is to find errors in semiconductor design, its
implications for equipment with high degrees of complexity, but also with little
to no tolerance for failure, which otherwise may pose threat to human lives.
Examples of these markets are semiconductor design and manufacturing for
hospital equipment, high-availability sensors, and automotive semiconductors.
