The project will purchase equipment to assemble two complete, self contained
vacuum line systems and design experiments to incorporate their usage
specifically into the Advanced Synthesis Laboratory. It will also incorporate
their usage into the Advanced Inorganic Chemistry and Organometallic Chemistry
courses, and to encourage student research using the equipment. Students will
learn the techniques for manipulation of air- sensitive compounds and their
applications to industrial and academic experimentation.
