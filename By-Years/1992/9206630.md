The Center for Computational Statistics at George Mason University will purchase
a Silicon Graphics 4D/420/VGX graphics workstation which will be dedicated to
the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used
for several research projects, including, in particular,1) nonparametric
function (structural) estimation using k- skeletons, 2) graphics for binned 2-D,
3-D and 4-D data, 3) adaptive probability density estimation in low to moderate
dimensions using random tessellations, and 4) virtual reality for exploratory
data analysis. Visualization of statistical and geometric structure forms a key
element in these research projects.
