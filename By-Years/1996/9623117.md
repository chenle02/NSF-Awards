The focus of this research is a broad study on the syntheses and metabolism of
chlorophylls and derivatives. The biosynthetic origin of macrocyclic carbons in
the bacteriochlorophyll-e will be investigated and the degradation of the
molecules in senescent bacteria studied. Synthetic studies will be aimed at the
production of a variety of targets including 3,8-divinylchlorophyll-a,
isochlorophyll-a, a conformationally locked phytochromobilin and a series of
non-planar porphyrins and chlorins. Stable phlorins and corroles will also be
constructed with the goal of producing bis-macrocycles. With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kevin M. Smith of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Smith
will focus his work on a broad-based and wide-ranging study of the biosynthesis,
catabolism, chemistry and spectroscopy of novel porphyrins, chlorophylls and
bacteriochlorophylls. Chlorophylls are the catalysts in the vital process of
photosynthesis and are involved in light gathering as well as the process of
charge separation. Certain porphyrins and their metal complexes are to be
studied as biomimics of chlorophylls found in photosynthetic organisms and as
molecules with potential biomedical implications.
