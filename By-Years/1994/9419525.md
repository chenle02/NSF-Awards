9419525 Hauri The PI will utilize a thermochromatic liquid crystal-sheet
lighting technique to measure the entrainment of ambient fluid into thermally
buoyant plume structures under a variety of experimental conditions. The flux of
the entrained fluid will be compared to that of the injected fluid to calculate
absolute and fractional entrainment. In this way, entrainment into steady state
conduits, thermal conduit solitary waves, and time dependent conduit flow will
be measured and characterized. The PI will also vary the chemistry of the fluids
to investigate the effects of different rheologies on entrainment, which can be
tested by examining entrainment in a plume conduit which traverses layers of
different density and viscosity. This research has the potential to evaluate
mantle plumes as "sampling probes" of the mantle through which they pass, and
when combined with existing and future geochemical data, results form seismic
tomography, and experimental and theoretical determinations of deep mantle
rheologies, will allow the PI to place firmer constraints on the locations of
geochemically distinct reservoirs in the convecting mantle ***
