This project supports a national survey, focus groups, and an experiment to
investigate public perceptions of the American People. Previous research on
American public opinion has tended to focus on people's views of politicians,
policies, institutions, and democratic values and processes. Surprisingly little
work has been done on what people think about the American people as a group or
on the extent to which people identify with this group, even though the people
are a key political actor given the idea of popular sovereignty in the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator contends that we need to
discover how the people themselves view the American people to understand their
beliefs about democracy. Two contrasting political theories highlight the
importance of understanding how views of the people can affect views of
democratic political systems, and the researcher draws on these theories to
develop hypotheses to test. The literal view espoused by James Madison and
others holds that the American people are fallible and hold wildly diverse
interests. The solution to these problems is an institutional structure that
protects government from the whims of the people and makes sense of the diverse
demands made on government. A more communitarian view holds that people pursuing
their wildly diverse interests hurt democratic government. Democratic government
needs a unifying force that brings the people together, and that unifying force
is a strong national collective identity. This identity helps people to fulfill
their obligations to fellow Americans, trust fellow citizens, and want to pursue
the common good over narrower interests. In both these theoretical approaches,
beliefs about how the government ought to operate are influenced by perceptions
of the people. Are the public's beliefs about government similarly affected by
its perceptions of the American people? The researcher assesses this key
question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher discovers how Americans
characterize the American people in terms of their capabilities, their political
values, their demographics, and their homogeneity or heterogeneity as a people;
to investigate the extent to which people identify with the American people as a
group; and to determine the consequences of these characterizations and of a
national collective identity for several political
attitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides the most detailed
understanding yet of public attitudes toward the American people and provides an
extremely valuable dataset for others interested in understanding people's
attitudes toward democratic government, the American people, and group
identity.&lt;br/&gt;
