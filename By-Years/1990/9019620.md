This dissertation research award will allow a cultural anthropologist from the
University of Kentucky to study how new economic opportunities to sell cash
crops affect the patterns of authority in the households of Venezuelan peasants.
The methods to be used include structured sample interviews and participant
observation, to test hypotheses concerning the decrease in rural- urban
migration, increase in male control over economic resources, and increase in
economic incentives offered to younger household members to keep them on the
farm. This research is important because peasant households throughout the world
are shifting from a subsistence to a cash-crop livelihood, with attendant
changes in household structure and function. Increased understanding of how
households react to specific incentives can help us design programs to
ameliorate problems of deteriorating social control in rural families and
excessive rural-urban migration.
