This project explores, develops and tests the educational possibilities of
using an integrated, multi-functional computational medium that includes full
programming capability. Boxer defines a high-powered work station environment
for the personal and professional use of children, teachers, and curriculum
developers of the 1990s. In a previous NSF grant, we established the scientific
basis for such a system in a principled design, and we established the
technological basis in a field-deployable implementation. Models of new kinds of
educational practice in school settings that are made possible by such a medium,
will be developed and tested. These models will highlight the new and special
characteristics of Boxer that promise important changes in the ordering, content
and form of school science. In particular, it will be demonstrated that Boxer is
transparent, allowing students and teachers to get more quickly through the
technical aspects of the system to basic mathematical and scientific learning,
and that Boxer provides dramatic synergy in allowing easy combining of the
various aspects of the system (text editing, data base capabilities, etc.), most
particularly, synergy between programming and learning scientific principles.
Two new generalizable models of educational practice based on the use of a
computational medium will be built. The first will teach about motion by
developing a product-oriented community practice in the classroom. That practice
will grow out of a carefully designed and integrated set of exercise
microworlds, and its effectiveness in promoting deep conceptual change will be
assessed by the capability of students to learn more on completion of the
course. The second model will teach topics in fact-intensive sciences like
biology by using the medium to display the hidden structure of knowledge in the
domain, and by supporting learning and problem solving activities specifically
appropriate to such domains.
