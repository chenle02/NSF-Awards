The project will use data from the 10-year deployment of the seismic stations in
the USArray Transportable Array across the lower 48 states to map seismological
properties of the top 100 km of the crust and shallow mantle beneath the
continent. The focus of the project is a comprehensive analysis of seismic
surface waves using traditional and modern methods, including the analysis of
ambient seismic noise, which are seismic waves caused by human activity, ocean
waves, and atmospheric phenomena such as wind. The project will generate high-
resolution maps of different properties of the rocks in the crust and mantle
that will facilitate continent-wide interpretation of the structure and tectonic
evolution of North America.

The seismic data collected by nearly 2000 sensors distributed across the
continent will be used to determine (1) maps of short-period (5-40 sec) Love and
Rayleigh wave speed using inter-station cross correlation of seismic noise; (2)
maps of longer-period (25-125 sec) Love and Rayleigh wave speed using two-
station and mini-array techniques; and (3) maps of local elastic Rayleigh wave
amplification at longer periods using a differential-amplitude technique.
Quantitative comparisons of the data with model-based predictions will be used
to demonstrate the consistency between results of different researchers, and
identify differences that motivate further investigation.
