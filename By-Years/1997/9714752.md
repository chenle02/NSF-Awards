The Department of Meteorology at Penn State University requests partial support
for an upgrade of present computer capacity in the department. This upgrade is
part of a complete overhaul of Penn State's present computing facilities and is
part of a transition from Penn State-developed weather analysis and display
system to use of Unidata provided software. In addition, the transition will
include archiving data in community-standard formats, such as those developed by
Unidata. Penn State is planning to spend approximately $100,000 upgrading
various parts of their current computing and classroom display systems. Support
to acquire two servers, two workstations, disk storage and networking component
is requested. This hardware will provide an important component of the overall
department upgrade.
