9513154 Dodge Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering
reactions centered on the study of coherent neutral pion electro- production
from complex nuclei. Research in this area will advance our understanding of the
interactions of the delta resonance in the nuclear medium, and test predictions
of model- independent low energy theorems and chiral perturbation theory. The
experiments will be carried out largely at the NIKHEF laboratory in Holland.
Planning for future experiments at the CEBAF laboratory to test the Drell-Hearn-
Gerasimov sum rule will also be carried out. This activity relates to probing
the spin- structure of nucleons. Development, construction, and utilization of
major state-of-the-art equipment, including drift chambers for the CEBAF CLAS
spectrometer, is integral to this latter activity. All of the above topics are
high priority activities in contemporary nuclear physics. ***
