A grant has been awarded to Dr. LeBlanc (North Carolina State University) to
elucidate the basic endocrine control of sexual differentiation in a snail
species (mud snail: Ilyanassa obsoleta) and to determine the mechanism by which
the biocide tributyltin causes sexual ambiguity in marine snails. Tributyltin is
an antifoulant used in marine paints. The material is ubiquitous in the marine
environment and has been causally associated with the global occurrence of
reproductive system abnormalities in marine snails. Studies will be performed to
identify the hormones that are responsible for the development of the snail
reproductive system. Initially, field surveys will be performed to establish
relationships between hormone or hormone receptor levels and development of the
snail reproductive system over the seasonal reproductive cycle. These
investigations will be followed by laboratory experiments where levels of
tentatively important hormones will be manipulated and consequences to
reproductive system development will be established. Once the relevant hormones
have been conclusively identified, the effect of tributyltin on those hormone
levels and activity will be established. Results from this study will
significantly advance our understanding of basic molluscan endocrinology. Many
Asian and South American countries are developing snail culture as a sustainable
food source for local consumption as well as export. Understanding the
regulation of the reproductive cycle of snails would greatly enhance the
economic feasibility of such operations. In addition, the International Maritime
Organization has implemented a phase-out of tributyltin in marine paints owing
to its adverse effects on marine ecosystems. The economic incentive to minimize
drag on ocean-going vessels through the use of antifoulants will necessitate the
development and use of tributyltin alternatives. Elucidation of the mechanism by
which tributyltin interferes with sexual development of snails will help ensure
that alternative antifoulants do not share this insidious property.
