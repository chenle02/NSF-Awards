This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) Planning Grant proposal in
computational theory to develop 1) numerical techniques for parallel processing
and 2) application of computing machinery and methods to large systems problems.
The overall goal is to integrate the two areas. During the planning period the
investigator will develop effective ordering procedures for the applications of
parallel sparse vector methods such as, parallel triangulation and inversion of
matrices. Feasibility studies of these methods and testing them on an actual
supercomputer system will be conducted. This grant will provide support for a
well-trained minority scientist to perform these and other preliminary
activities as a basis for developing a competitive proposal for submission to
the MRI research initiation component.
