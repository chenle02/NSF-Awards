This project will support the purchase of computing equipment which would allow
the introduction of a significant laboratory component into an undergraduate
numerical analysis course. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of improving the
quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or
improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in
science, mathematics, or engineering. In particular, the project will enable
students to gain hands-on experience with all the important numerical methods
studied in the course; the goal is to increase the students' understanding of
the behavior of numerical methods through extensive experimentation and problem
solving.
