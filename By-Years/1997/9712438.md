9712438 SIERWALD Millipedes are of outstanding ecological importance and play a
crucial role in nutrient cycling within the soil. With an estimated total of
more than 80,000 living species, the millipede class (Diplopoda) is the third
most diverse among terrestrial arthropods, after insects and arachnids (spiders,
ticks, mites). They are one of the most understudied groups of animals, with few
up-to-date taxonomic treatments and few remaining active experts. In this
project, Petra Sierwald, Richard Hoffman, William Shear and R. M. Shelley will
combine their expertise to train new millipede experts and produce new taxonomic
treatments, especially of North and Central American taxa, using modern methods.
Species checklists, keys and classifications, for use by experts and nonexperts,
will be produced and made available electronically. In addition, specimen
collections will be prepared, and those now available upgraded.
