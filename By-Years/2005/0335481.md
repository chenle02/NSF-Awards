Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0335481&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Jindrich Zapletal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial
support for the annual Southeast&lt;br/&gt;Logic Symposium (SEALS), to be held
at the University of Florida&lt;br/&gt;in March 2004, 2005, and 2006. These are
weekend conferences&lt;br/&gt;that emphasize set theory and bring together
established&lt;br/&gt;logicians and set theorists, junior researchers, and
graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. The emphasis of SEALS 2004 will be on the
interaction&lt;br/&gt;between descriptive set theory, cardinal invariants,
Borel&lt;br/&gt;equivalence theory, pcf theory, and
determinacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
