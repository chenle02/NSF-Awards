Phase transitions, ranging from familiar occurrences such as liquid water
freezing into ice to technologically critical phenomena such as transition to
superconductivity, are ubiquitous throughout nature, have been an active topic
in mathematical and physical research for as long as science has existed, and
continue to pose important research challenges. Lattice models, constructed to
study natural phase transitions, are probability distributions on subsets of
graphs depending on continuous parameters. This research project will study the
phase transition of several important lattice models, including (1) the
constrained percolation model, which randomly assigns "0" or "1" to each vertex
of a graph, satisfying constraints that represent aspects of molecular
structure; and (2) the self-avoiding walk, which is a path on a graph visiting
each vertex at most once, introduced as a model for long-chain polymers. The
work will broaden and deepen the mathematical foundations of the subject, with
potential important applications in theoretical physics and
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator aims to develop new theory
concerning the phase transition of certain lattice models. Imposing constraints
in the percolation model usually makes the model lose stochastic monotonicity,
which, in the unconstrained case, is critical to study the phase transition
described by the behavior of infinite clusters. One goal of the project is to
develop new combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to study the behavior of
infinite clusters without using stochastic monotonicity. Enumerating self-
avoiding walks is typically difficult due to the non-Markovian structure. The
connective constant and exponent of self-avoiding walks are fundamental
properties of the underlying graph, yet can be identified for very few graphs.
Another goal of this project is to obtain new information about connective
constants and exponents for large classes of graphs, which may be achieved by
analyzing harmonic functions on graphs. An analog to the central limit theorem
in two dimensions is the limit shape behavior of height functions of certain
lattice models at criticality, i.e. when the phase transition occurs. The
investigator also plans to study the limit shape, using techniques from complex
analysis and algebraic geometry.
