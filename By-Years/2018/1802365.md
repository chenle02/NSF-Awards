This award provides partial participants support for a conference to be held at
Harvard University on June 4-8, 2018. While the central focus will be on the
recent developments in number theory, the conference will also promote dialogue
and interaction between number theory and other
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature research-level
talks from a range of distinguished mathematicians, mostly (but not entirely)
working in various areas of number theory, including the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture, Galois representations and modularity, Iwasawa theory, and
Diophantine equations (just to name some of them), and the talks at the
conference will present the latest developments in many of these fields. More
details can be found at the conference website:

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
