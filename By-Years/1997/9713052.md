9713052 Chung Past research has demonstrated that a major role of boron in
ductilizing intermetallic alloys, such as Ni3Al, is to suppress moisture-induced
embrittlement. It is generally agreed that the embrittlement arises from the
diffusion of atomic hydrogen to the crack tip and that the atomic hydrogen is
produced from the chemical reaction between the water vapor and the freshly
exposed intermetallic surfaces. The mechanism by which the boron suppresses the
embrittlement process has not been explored in detail. This project examines
three physical and chemical effects of boron on the surface reactivity of single
crystal Ni3(Al,Ti) surfaces towards water vapor, viz. (1) physical site
blocking; (2) formation of surface hydroxyls in the presence of oxygen; and (3)
modification of the relative rates of hydrogen desorption and surface diffusion.
To understand a recent surprising finding that boron-doped Ni3Al is less ductile
than boron-free Ni3Al in dry hydrogen, the dissociation of hydrogen on
Ni3(Al,Ti) surfaces is investigated. These studies are performed in situ as a
function of boron surface concentration and temperature using primarily x-ray
photoemission and thermal desorption on single crystal Ni3(Al,Ti) (100) and
(111) surfaces. Controlled dosing of boron is accomplished using a solid- state,
low-energy boron ion source. %%% Nickel aluminide, Ni3Al, belongs to a class of
aluminum- based intermetallics that are potentially valuable for high
temperature structural applications. This work assists in understanding factors
affecting the ductility of these alloys. ***
