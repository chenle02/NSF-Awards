This project provides for the continued operation and maintenance of an
automatic weather station network on the Greenland ice sheet in support of the
GISP-2 drilling effort and the associated atmospheric chemistry research. Three
AWS units are located at the GISP-2, GRIP, and atmospheric camp sites, while
four are located 100 km to the north, east, south, and west of the drill site.
These are used to determine the regional divergence and vorticity fields.
