9627084 Weiss The New York Hall of Science will develop an interactive exhibit
for the general public "The Chemistry of Life". There will be two editions of
the exhibit: one 2,500 sq. ft. version will be installed permanently in the New
York Hall of Science and another 1500 sq. ft. version will travel nationally.
Focusing on the common chemical processes behind all life on earth, the exhibit
will help visitors learn four basic chemistry concepts: 1) a shared chemistry
underlies all forms of life, 2) the chemistry of energy transformation takes
place in all living things, 3) chemical energy is converted to mechanical energy
to animate life, and 4) the chemistry of reproduction provides for the
continuity of life. The chemistry of the human body will be used whenever
possible as an entry point to the concepts. Exhibits will include a hands-on
staffed visitor chemistry lab, interactive activities, stimulations, models,
demonstrations, and video clips. Complementary materials and workshops will be
developed for families, school groups, and teachers. These materials are being
developed with the curricular needs of the New York State Systemic Initiative
and New York City Urban Systemic Initiative in mind. Teacher and student
materials will be keyed to the curriculum guidelines. The long-term exhibit is
scheduled to open late in 1998 and the traveling version will be available in
spring 1999.
