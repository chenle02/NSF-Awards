The major goal of this work is to obtain estimates of the dipole and quadrupole
families of dynamo theory from the present back into the Mesozoic. This will be
done by using paleomagnetic data from lava flows that provide estimates of the
paleosecular variation with latitude. The results should be robust for several
reasons, including that one can distinguish the relative strengths of the two
families with time without having accurate continental reconstructions and
because unreasonable a-priori assumptions relating the paleomagnetic data to the
geomagnetic field are not required. The data and analyses yield valuable tests
of models for reversals of the Earth's magnetic field that involve interactions
between the dipole and quadrupole families.
