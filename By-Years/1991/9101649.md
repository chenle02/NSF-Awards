This research project involves the dissertation research of a graduate student
in linguistic anthropology who will study the semantics of illness speech in a
Mayan Indian community in southern Mexico. The project, based on structured
interviewing and lexicographic techniques, represents one of the first attempts
to concentrate on the overall semantic characteristics of language signs and
symptoms of a group. The researcher will select 50 health conditions for in-
depth study about symptoms (how it feels to the afflicted person) and signs (how
it appears to observers). The researcher will analyze the semantic patternsin
this data and place it in the context of other analyses (of botanical and
ethnopharmacological semantic domains) of this community's semantics, as well as
comparing it to other near-by community speech patterns. This research is
important because understanding of medical problems in their cultural context is
a crucial factor in addressing health issues in any society. In-depth
understanding of this one case will help build general theory on the semantics
of illness. Recording and preserving indigenous ethnomedical knowledge is an
important part of preserving global biodiversity.
