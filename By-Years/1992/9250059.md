The Partnership for Reform Initiatives in Science and Mathematics (PRISM),
between the Department of Education and the Kentucky Science and Technology
Council, Inc., builds upon the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) to address
specific needs and barriers hindering the restructuring of science and
mathematics education in the State. The project has three goals. 1. Kentucky
students will acquire the conceptual knowledge, process skills, thinking skills,
and habits of mind that characterize scientific literacy. 2. More Kentucky
students, especially those from underrepresented groups, will follow programs
leading to science, mathematics, and technology-related careers, including
teaching. 3. The general public and opinion leaders in Kentucky will value
knowledge and skills in mathematics, science, and technology as important
outcomes of education. To achieve these goals, PRISM will coordinate mathematics
and science initiatives in four areas: develop teacher- specialists to support
change in classroom practices; alter teacher preservice programs; develop and
implement a plan to foster participation by underrepresented groups; and
establish policy to enhance awareness and value of mathematics and science
education.
