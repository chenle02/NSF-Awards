This project examines the impact of perceivers' chronic and temporary, positive
and negative future-event expectancies on social judgments and evaluations. This
program of research relies on multi-stage models of the social inference process
to tease apart the direction of and stage at which such effects occur. Of
particular interest is the potential reversal of perceivers' typical expectancy-
consistent biases on their perceptions of and ability inferences for another's
performance outcomes. This work should yield information about the necessary and
sufficient conditions for such reversals of perceivers' expectancy-related
biases, as well as the mechanisms underlying them. The results might well
suggest that parts of the inference process are more flexible and more complex
than previously thought.

This work also should have important implications for work on the social and
human potential costs associated with perceiver pessimism. To the degree that
evaluators in a variety of settings (e.g., school, work) have multiple task
demands and role-related stressors that occupy their available cognitive
resources, their activated expectancies may well bias their judgments of others.
The costs of such biased evaluations are potentially enormous, both for the
target individual and for society. The results of this research, then, should
aid in the development of effective de-biasing interventions for several of the
more deleterious and pervasive effects of perceiver pessimism.
