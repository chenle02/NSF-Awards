CTS-9523284 Conner University of Massachusetts The performance of hydrophobic
molecular sieves (zeolites) in selectively removing Volatile Organic Compounds
(VOCs) for recycle or resuse will be evaluated with industrial collaboration.
The removal of cyclohexane from a chemical process stream will adsorbents
supplied by Philadelphia Quartz. The energy necessary to desorb the solvent for
recycle back into the process will be determined. The desorption of cyclohexane
will be done by microwave radiation and also by using a hot purge gas for
comparison. Fundamental studies will focus on competitive adsorption and
transport of VOCs and water in a variety of inorganic molecular sieves. KSE
Corp. will participate in evaluating the economic and technological aspects of
the process. The SGER/GOALI project will explore a new strategy to use microwave
radiation in solving environmental problems associated with chemical processing.
