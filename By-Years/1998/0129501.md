The "RNA-Based Life" Workshop will be held November 15-18, 2001 at Indiana
University in Bloomington, IN. The objective of the RNALife Workshop is to
provide a high caliber, interdisciplinary meeting for researchers with an
interest in the many roles RNA can play in sustaining life, focusing on the
single question, "How viable is life based on RNA?" The question is relevant to
cutting edge efforts in metabolic engineering, molecular medicine, cell biology
and studies of the origin of life. This will be the first meeting of its kind.
It is intended to be international in scope and to provide extensive
opportunities for interaction between established scientists from various fields
of RNA research and the next generation of scientists. The meeting is open to
principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate
students and other interested scientists.
