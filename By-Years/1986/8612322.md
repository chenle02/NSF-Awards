This expedited exploratory engineering research study will evaluate the
feasibility of utilizing a novel method to form stable hemoglobin-in-oil-
aqueous-saline-solution (Hb/o/w) multiple emulsions for use as an artiffical
blood. With the development of this methodolgy, a concentrated hemoglobin
solution will be emulsified in a suitable nontoxic oil phase, followed by
dispersion of the primary emulsion into an outer aqueous phase, containing
suitable nontoxic surfactant to form the multiple emulsion. The size of the
microdroplets, the stability and thickness of the oil interfacial membrane
enveloping the microdroplets, and the size of the primary emulsion droplets will
be controlled to achieve rapid mass transfer of oxygen. The stability of the
interfacial layer (i.e., a type of liquid membrane) will be assessed by
measuring interfacial rheological properties.
