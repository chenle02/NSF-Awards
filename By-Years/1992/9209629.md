The goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms by which dopaminergic
(DA) and cholinergic (ACh) neurotransmitter systems interact in the neural bases
of cognitive function. In previous studies, Dr. Levin has documented the
interactions of DA and ACh drugs given systemically. The current proposal is to
investigate critical neural pathways which underlie these DA-ACh interactions.
Sites to be studied are those which are important for cognitive function and
where DA and ACh systems are anatomically connected. These include the septal
nucleus, the nucleus basalis and the ventral tegmental area. These studies will
help achieve the goal of elucidating basic mechanisms of DA-ACh interactions in
cognitive behavior. This is important to further develop basic understanding of
the neural bases of cognitive function. Since no neural system acts alone, it is
important to understand how they act together.//
