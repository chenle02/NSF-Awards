For imaging or position-sensitive detection (particle counting) of low-
intensity electron, ion, or photon beams, a common approach is to use a
microchannel plate (MCP) intensifier (with an appropriate emissive coating or
photocathode if necessary) followed by a position-sensitive anode. Of several
possible anode designs, one which has proven to be rugged, inexpensive, and very
useful, particularly when timing of individual particle arrivals is important,
is the resistive anode encoder (RAE). Present limitations of this device include
limited maximum counting rate due to RC delays and electronic processing times,
and the need to use high voltage vacuum feedthroughs and breakdown-prone
standoff capacitors on the signal leads for in-situ vacuum applications where
the anode must be biased to high voltages. A fast new generation of RAE-type
detectors will be developed. Proposed new pulse processing electronics,
applicable to existing RAE devices as well, should increase the signal rate over
that of current detectors by a factor of ten. The new detector would replace the
resistive anode with its optical analog, using a scintillating lightguide to
convert an electron burst into optical pulses, which can be transmitted over
optical fiber signal leads. The advantages include inherent high speed, noise
immunity, and non-conducting signal leads that allow the detector to float at
high voltage.
