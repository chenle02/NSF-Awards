Intractable computational problems, in particular recursively unsolvable
problems, occur naturally in combinatorial group theory and have been studied in
that context for over a hundred years. This project is devoted to finding better
algorithms and partial algorithms for these problems, both for well-known ones
and also for new ones which have arisen, for example, in group-based
cryptography. Using techniques developed in their previous work, the
investigators will perform computer experiments to discover and test new
computational procedures and also to gather information on the distribution of
hard instances in specific problems.

An algorithm for a computational problem may be useful even though it sometimes
fails, if its failures are rare. A well known example is the simplex algorithm
for linear optimization. This algorithm (which is used hundreds or thousands of
times every day) can take a very long time for certain carefully constructed
cases but never does so in practice. In other words the difficult cases are
extremely rare. Although there are many other algorithms which behave the same
way, this phenomenon is not well understood. The broader significance of this
project is that it seeks a better understanding through investigation of an
appropriate class of computational problems.
