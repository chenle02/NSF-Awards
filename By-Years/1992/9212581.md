Two regulatory proteins alpha 1 and MCM1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
cooperate to activate transcription of alpha cell type specific genes. MCM1
protein, which is homologous to the mammalian serum response factor, is a
multifunctional protein implicated in several processes in the yeast cell. Both
the alpha 1 and MCM1 proteins bind their DNA recognition sequence in both duplex
and single stranded DNA. Since most DNA binding proteins recognize B form DNA
and contact the sugar-phosphate backbone, this is an unexpected activity. The
hypothesis that the proteins unwind duplex DNA to generate single stranded DNA
will be tested; thus two apparently different activities could be in reality a
single activity. The relationship between the duplex and single strand binding
activities will be analyzed by comparing 1) the protein-DNA contracts, 2) the
sequence requirements for binding and 3) the domains of the proteins required
for each type of binding. Selection of a alpha 1 mutations in vivo will be used
to extend mapping of the domains. The unusual binding properties of other
proteins are integral to their function. %%% This research, which deals with
issues potentially very important for eukaryotic gene expression, has the
potential for wide applicability in biotechnology. It is an interesting and
potentially significant phenomenon, and the research planned will help to
delineate the biological role for the unusual findings to date. The planned
research will also provide useful training for student associated with the
project.
