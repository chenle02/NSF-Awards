This grant is for continued development of Dr. Kuipers' approach to exploratory
map construction and qualitative robotic navigation. Current simulation studies
will be extended to control of a momentum-dominated robot in an unknown and
dynamically changing 2-D environment. The perceptual approach is to model
topological features of the robot's world before extracting error-prone
estimates of geometric features. A major theme will be recognition and
resolution of topological ambiguities, with modeling of both parametric and
qualitative changes in world states. Another theme is smooth switching between
anticipatory control strategies in a momentum-dominated world.
