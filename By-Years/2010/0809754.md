In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Bern Kohler of Ohio State University, together
with his graduate and undergraduate students, will conduct a bottom-up
investigation of the photophysics of single- and double-stranded DNA. The
experimental approach of the Kohler group is to use ultrafast, femtosecond laser
spectroscopy to probe the photochemical events that take place when small
fragments of DNA absorb ultraviolet light.

DNA is the basic unit of biological hereditary information. The ultimate goal of
research like that of the Kohler group is to investigate how DNA is changed by
ultraviolet light, which may have implications in health as well as emerging
applications that seek to harness DNA's optoelectronic properties. In addition
to the broader scientific impact of the proposed research work, Prof. Kohler
plans to organize an annual undergraduate chemistry research fair on the campus
of Ohio State University. The goal of this outreach event is to encourage more
undergraduate students to pursue research in chemistry and to get students
interested in research earlier in their undergraduate careers.
