NMR Concepts is offering two workshops each summer for three years. The
workshops will improve the ability of undergraduate faculty to teach NMR courses
and to conduct research. Each workshop will consist of lectures, laboratory
sessions, and problem solving sessions. There will also be keynote speakers and
classroom presentations by the participants. The workshops end with round table
discussions to aid the participants in incorporating their new knowledge into
their courses and research efforts. The first workshop, NMR Concepts and
Operating Techniques, presents the physical concepts of NMR and includes
spectrometer operation, the Fourier transform, quadrature phase detection, data
treatment, relaxation measurements, and NOEs. The second workshop, Intermediate
and Advanced Interpretation of 1D and Basic Interpretation of 2D NMR Spectra,
reviews the general features of proton and carbon spectra and then treats the
use of relaxation time measurements, proton decoupling procedures, NOE, and some
multinuclear NMR. The keynote speakers will be selected from academia with a
focus on how they have integrated NMR into their curriculum and how they use it
in their research. Participants will be expected to share through a variety of
means instructional materials that they develop as a result of their
participation in the workshop.
