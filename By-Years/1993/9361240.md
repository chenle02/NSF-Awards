9361240 Dreizin From spot welding to soldering, joining metal wires to one
another or to substrates is a major part of the assembly process for electrical
and electronic devices. This program will develop an entirely new method for
welding such joints using filler metals. In this novel method, 50-500 micrometer
diameter monodisperse droplets of high temperature filler metal are generated
remotely and then transported and deposited at the joint to be welded. Since
there is no direct contact between the energy source and weld site, thermal or
electrical damage to components is eliminated. Droplet size and temperature can
be controlled so that the weld can be tailored to specific requirements. Almost
any metal can serve as weld filler, including refractories. Welds of copper and
aluminum wires to aluminum and silicon plates (copper or aluminum filler) and of
tungsten wires to tungsten or molybdenum plates (tungsten or molybdenum filler)
will be made. The weld strengths will be measured and correlated with
experimental parameters such as droplet metal identity, size, and temperature.
This new method for making permanent electrical and electronic connections will
be useful for applications requiring high durability connections such as for
printed circuit boards for use in vibrating or accelerating environments or for
attaching lamp filaments to base connections. The technique could replace
environmentally unsatisfactory solders in many electrical and electronic
assembly processes.
