ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9634222 Principal Investigator: Pullin This is a
continuation grant to investigate the role of dynamics and kinematics of
stretched vortices in describing the fine scales of turbulence with special
emphasis on the relation of the fine and inertial range scales to the large
scales in the context of large eddy simulation. The research will focus on three
areas: a) continued development and testing of an LES model of for flows of
increasing complexity, b) completion of the calculation of the longitudinal-
velocity structure functions followed by the calculation of other structure
functions of other turbulence quantities such as pressure and dissipation, and
c) continuation of supporting research in vortex dynamics which will enhance our
understanding of the structure of turbulence. This is an extension of prior work
in which a standard model of turbulence was developed on the basis of the
stretched vortex model of Lundgren.
