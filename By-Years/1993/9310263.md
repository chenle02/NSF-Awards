to study sums of independent random variables and quadratic forms. The topics
envisioned include strong limit problems, approximation of expectations for sums
having a fixed or random number of terms, approximation of tail probabilities of
sums of independent variates, and decoupling issues for quadratic and
multilinear forms. This is research in basic probability theory. In particular,
the investigator will study sums of independent random variables and
probabilities associated with those sums. ***
