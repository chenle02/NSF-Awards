The ability to make causal inferences is important for addressing a wide range
of research questions in the social, statistical, economic, and medical
sciences. From a societal perspective, it is difficult to determine if a policy
intervention is effective in the absence of causal inference. This research
project will develop new methods for causal inference. The resulting methods
will improve statistical analyses for causal inference, thereby enabling more
accurate conclusions from experimental and observational intervention studies
across many disciplines. The open source R/Matlab software developed from the
research will provide valuable data analysis and educational tools for the
scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motivated from important real
applications like racial disparity in health care service, this research will
develop new, general, and accessible weighting methods for drawing causal and
covariates-balanced descriptive comparisons from observational data. Population-
based observational studies have been increasingly used for drawing causal
conclusions, but the complex (and usually unknown) underlying data-generating
system poses great challenges to valid causal inference. Weighting methods that
originated in survey research are flexible and powerful tools for causal
inference, as are covariates-balanced descriptive comparative analysis, but
these are arguably less developed compared to regression and matching methods.
Research foci will include a unified framework for weighting-based causal
inference that extends beyond the traditional inverse probability weights, and
propensity score weighting methods for complex survey data with multilevel
structure. This research will blend theory and methodological developments with
motivating applications in areas including health policy, epidemiology, social
sciences, and economics.
