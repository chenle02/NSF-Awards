Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Paulsen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My research will focus in three
directions. I will continue to study injective envelopes, seeking deeper results
about their structure and further applications of these objects to the study of
operator spaces and C*-algebras. I will especially focus on attempting to
develop a deeper understanding of the connections between injective envelopes
and the weak expectation property. I will also continue to study applications of
operator algebra techniques to the study of Nevanlinna-Pick type interpolation,
especially focusing on the use of the C*-envelope and Schur ideals. The third
direction that I will focus is the study of finite dimensional frames from the
viewpoint of coding theory, especially the problem of determining optimal frames
for certain coding theory problems.-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My research on frames
could have the broadest impact. Frames are used as a way to ensure accurate
communication of analogue information in the presence of uncertainty, usually
coming from a noisy communication channel. My work on frames from a coding
theory point of view intends to find the optimal frames to use for transmitting
data, when it is anticipated that some of the data will be lost during the
transmission. My work is especially relevant to the problem of "lost packages".
Here one assumes that the data is packaged into discrete "bundles" that are then
transmitted separately, perhaps even over different channels, and then
reassembled later. The problem is what to do if only some of the bundles arrive?
Clearly, one wants to build some redundancy into the transmitted data so that
one can still reassemble a message, that if not exactly the original message, is
close to the original message in some sense.&lt;br/&gt;
