Large-Scale numerical simulations demand scalable solvers that strike a delicate
balance between robustness and cost. The proposed project aims to solve the
complex problems of algorithm selection and tuning by implementing a heuristic
decision-making agent. Through techniques from data mining and machine learning,
applied to production runs, the decision-making component will increase its
repertoire of heuristics and tune these heuristics. This will enable many areas
of computational science and engineering to use sophisticated numerical software
with high efficiency, profoundly reducing the execution time of production runs.
We will work on solver software in wide use, over which we have source code
control to permit necessary monitoring and manipulation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovative aspects of this project are in
the integration of numerical analysis and techniques from mainstream computer
science such as machine learning, data mining, and componentization, creating a
software architecture that makes it easy to employ numerical techniques in an
application context with expert knowledge, and to codify their benefits for
wider community.&lt;br/&gt;
