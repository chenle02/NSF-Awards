This award provides funds to the Undergraduate Neurosciences Program at Duke
University to establish an NSF-REU site which will support a Summer
Undergraduate Research initiative. The program emphasizes integrative, systems,
and behavioral neuroscience, reflecting the breadth of neuroscience research at
Duke University. Research, and training experiences will be organized around the
theme of "mechanisms of behavior", capitalizing on the strengths of the present
academic Undergraduate program and targeting laboratories in which supportive
and stimulating research environments are found. Duke University has a history
of successful summer research programs, especially those that provide training
experiences for women and minorities. The mentors have drawn form this
experience in developing the present program, and are able to make use of
existing administrative structures both for recruiting candidates to the program
and for providing the logistical support necessary for an engaging and
stimulating research experience.
