This research will further characterize essential genes that are required for
bacterial nucleoid partitioning. Partitioning defective mutants within the S.
typhimurium temperature sensitive lethal collection have been identified, and
preliminary data documents the "Par" phenotype. Genetic data show's that most of
these new par mutations lie in genes other than parA-through-parF, the known Par
genes. Experiments are genetically and molecularly characterizing, these new par
genes. The genes will be mapped, complementing clones will be isolated, and to
the extent necessary to provide new information, the genes sequenced.
Interactions between the Par proteins will be sought by suppressor analysis. %%%
Faithful partitioning ensures that bacteria contain single copies of their
genes. The process works without microtubules or any apparent analog, suggesting
that an entirely novel mechanism accomplishes faithful bacterial DNA
segregation. As such, this process may provide new targets for antibacterial
drug design. The comparison of prokaryotic, eukaryotic and archebacterial DNA
partitioning, will suggest whether these fundamental processes arose after the
separation of the primary kingdoms.
