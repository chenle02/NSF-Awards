CTS-9706942 Duke University Adrian Bejan ABSTRACT The proposed work is a
fundamental study of the architecture of flow paths between a finite-size space
and one or more discrete points. Thermodynamic principles will be used to
deterministically optimize networks for systems with volumetric heat and fluid
flow. The optimization is based on geometrically minimizing the resistance to
flow. The work is relevant to many engineering applications such as the design
of heat exchangers, thermal storage systems, etc. It is also relevant to the
understanding of the architecture of the natural environment such as biological
and geological systems.
