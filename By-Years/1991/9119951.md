The storing and sharing of energy between the two electrons in alkaline earth
atoms is examined using multi-laser/multi- photon techniques. Short pulse laser
technology makes it possible to study the detailed motion of the two electrons
in a time less than the period of a single electron. These measurements
complement the more usual spectroscopic techniques, providing new insights and
tests of theoretical models.
