9316895 Miller PI, collaborator Oscar Carranza (UNAM, Mexico), and an assembled
team of experts will collect and study Mio-Pliocene-age vertebrate fossils from
key localities in central Mexico. They will obtain greater chronostratigraphic
precision for this time period in the terrestrial record, including
magnetostratigraphy, and radiometric dates from ash beds within the fossil-
bearing sequences. This study will help date earliest occurrences of important
mammalian taxa, including South American immigrants, and provide valuable data
for comparisons with similar fossil-bearing sequences elsewhere in North
America.
