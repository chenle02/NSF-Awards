The general chemistry laboratory experience at most large public institutions
in this country is characterized by tedious manipulations that often appear to
take precedence over the development of an appreciation for the underlying
physical phenomena. The chemistry department is removing the busy work from
laboratories by introducing computer equipment and commercially available
transparent interfaces for data acquisition and analysis. These laboratory
workstations serve as platforms for molecular visualization. They allow students
to learn more while they stimulate student interest in science. The intention is
not to replace wet chemistry experiments with computer simulations, but rather
to bring the data-collection methods used in those experiments into the modern
era. In short, the focus in these courses is shifting from data generation to
data interpretation and understanding. By making routine use of computers in the
large service courses, the university maximizes the number of students affected
by the project and provides the largest possible audience with a modern approach
to the practice of chemistry.
