This award provides funding for the acquisition of a mass spectrometer to be
installed and operated in the Department of Geosciences at the University of
Houston. The instrument will be devoted primarily to isotopic analysis of argon
gas in order to determine ages of formation and the chronology of heating-
cooling cycles in igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks using potassium-
argon radioactive decay techniques. An ability to determine temperature-time
histories in crustal rocks is the key to understanding a variety of tectonic
problems, evaluating fossil fuel and geothermal energy sources, and deciphering
the pattern of volcanism in active volcanic provinces. This laboratory facility
will also be available for use by researchers at Rice University and other
regional research organizations.
