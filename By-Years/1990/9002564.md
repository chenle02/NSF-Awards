This action is for a one-year extension to a research program (BCS-8715450)
supported by NSF: the goal of this project is to develop a better understanding
of the destructive action of a tsunami (seismic sea wave) as it impacts a
coastal zone. The extension expands the research scope; it also provides an
opportunity to reanalyze the extensive quantity of laboratory experimental data
obtained during the past five years of research. The motivation for this
extension arises from the results obtained previously. The objective is to
develop a thorough understanding of the fundamental behavior of broken tsunami
(bore) propagation up a sloping beach; the tsunami actions at the shore; and the
ensuing runup and drawdown processes. These phenomena are fundamental to an
understanding of the destructive effect of a tsunami as it reaches a coastal
zone.
