9601954 Sugar, Robert University of California - Santa Barbara Academic Research
Infrastructure: Acquisition of a High-Performance Computing Facility This
Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a high speed
SMD computing system operating at a peak speed of approximately 15 GFLops. The
research projects supported by the equipment include: 1. Computational materials
science in the NSF funded Materials Research Laboratory. 2. Computational
chemistry in crystal growth, zeolite properties, and surface chemistry. 3. The
computational investigation of electronic microstructures. 4. Simulation of 3-D
ground motion in earthquake simulations of the LA basin. 5. Quantum
chromodynamics. 6. Fluid mechanics, geophysical fluid dynamics, and free and
moving boundary problems. 7. Research at the Institute of Theoretical Physics,
the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, and the Alexandria
Digital Library project. 8. Research in computer science, numerical mathematics,
and general scientific computation for SMD architectures.
