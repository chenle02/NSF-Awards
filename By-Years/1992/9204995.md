This award provides partial funding (approximately 30%) required to purchase a
gas-source mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Department of
Geology at the University of Georgia. The University of Georgia is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for this acquisition. The instrument will
be applied initially to the research projects of the Principal Investigator in
the field of stable isotope geochemistry, including evaluation of stable isotope
thermometry, the mechanisms of sulfur isotope exchange in rock systems during
metamorphism as well as isotope systematics of hydrothermal and magmatic
systems.
