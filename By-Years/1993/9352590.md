The project involves acquisition of a modern, rapid scan CW NMR spectrometer to
provide students across the curriculum with greatly increased opportunities to
gain hands-on experience with an instrument that plays a fundamental and pivotal
role in any modern chemical laboratory. The instrument will also have a
substantial educational impact on the Advanced Chemical Analysis, the Physical
Chemical, the Advanced Inorganic Laboratory, the Chemical Spectroscopy and the
Biological Biochemistry courses. The acquisition will allow enrichment of
existing experiments and development of new instructional exercises.
