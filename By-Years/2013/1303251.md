This award supports two related projects within the context of musical
acoustics. The two projects represent complex problems involving energy transfer
in metal structures. The specific goals are to understand the stick-slip
excitation mechanism of idiophones and to determine how structural vibrations
affect the sound of brass wind instruments. Studies of the stick-slip excitation
of idiophones will be performed using electronic speckle pattern
interferometery, laser Doppler vibrometry and recordings of the acoustic field
resulting from the vibrations. The results of the experimental research will be
compared to a computer model that includes the dynamic effects, as well as the
effects attributable to the size of the region of interaction between the
instrument and the driver. Studies of structural vibrations of brass wind
instruments will involve both optical and acoustic measurements. Previous work
has shown that the vibration of the walls of the instrument contribute
substantially to the sound produced by the instrument, and that this
contribution is not due to direct radiation of the vibrating metal into the
surrounding air. This research will lead to an understanding of the mechanism
through which the vibrating metal contributes to the sound
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work involves undergraduate students,
particularly women, in original research. While the systems under study involve
musical instruments, the research centers on studying basic physical phenomena
which are not unique to musical acoustics. The work will contribute to the
understanding of physical systems while providing undergraduate students the
opportunity to be involved in original scientific research through a subject
they find fascinating.
