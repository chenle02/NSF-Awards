This is a three-year research project proposed by Dr. Richard Suttmeier and Dr.
Cong Cao, University of Oregon, to assess the U.S.-China relations in science
and technology and the challenges ahead. This study will focus on (1) changes in
Chinese science and technology policies, ongoing reforms in the national
innovation system, and statistical indicators of levels of performance, and 2)
the role of government programs in the U.S.-China S&T relationship; the role of
the corporate sector in S&T cooperation; and patterns of academic cooperation.
The U.S.-China relationship of collaboration and competition in science and
technology is significant and fundamental given the increasing globalization in
production and R&D, as well as China's emergence as a world power. The impacts
of this study can be broad and extensive both academically and politically.
