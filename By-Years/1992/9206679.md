The principal investigator will study nitrogen speciation and isotope
distribution in terrestrial igneous and metamorphic fluids and rocks using
experimental, applied, and theoretical techniques. He will attempt to
characterize N-isotope signatures related to various magmatic, metamorphic, and
meteoric sources, and to identify N-isotope fractionation mechanisms in mineral-
fluid-melt systems.
