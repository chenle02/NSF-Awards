9302834 Burns The Westnet mid-level network is connecting 14 institutions to
NSFNET via 56,000 bits per second lines. One community college is in Idaho, one
in Colorado, two are in New Mexico and tow in Utah. Eight of the institutions
are public libraries in Utah. The connections enable the schools' faculties and
students to communicate and collaborate with the international scientific and
educational community, and to access network resources such as libraries,
databases and supercomputers. The library connections will provide this
capability to the general public and to students during non-school hours. This
award funds part of the costs for two years. ***
