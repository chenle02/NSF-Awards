This award support the research of Ronald L. Lipsman and Jonathan M. Rosenberg.
In general, the scholars will continue their respective work in group
representation theory, analysis on homogeneous spaces and algebraic index
theory. Lipsman will study the spectra and multiplicities of symmetric spaces
and other homogeneous spaces. Rosenberg will use operator algebras to study
index theory and geometry on manifolds and similar spaces. This research is in
the general area of modern analysis where spaces of functions and operators on
those spaces are examined to achieve both geometric and analytic insights.
