ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No. CTS-0320621&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: O. Zikanov, University of Michigan-
Dearborn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Major Research
Instrumentation grant, the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the
University of Michigan - Dearborn will acquire equipment for newly established
computational thermo-fluid laboratory. The central part of the equipment is a
Linux-based cluster of high-performance parallel processors. This infrastructure
will support the ongoing research effort emphasizing energy-efficient
technologies and control of pollutant emission. The areas of particular interest
include turbulent flows of liquid metals, combustion, formation and destruction
of pollutants in diesel engines, particle dispersion in multi-phase flows, and
atmospheric dispersion of pollutants. The new laboratory will also play a major
role in enhancing the computational component of the College of Engineering
curriculum and facilitate training of graduate and undergraduate students in
high-performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
