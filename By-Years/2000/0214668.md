This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing surface plasma resonance phenomena to
obtain significant improvements in magneto-optical imaging. Improved sensors and
systems are needed for non-destructive, non-contact testing and evaluation (NDE)
in many areas, including security, structural, medical, research and industrial
manufacturing and quality control applications. Magnetic detectors and imagers
play a major and growing role in these applications. In Phase I, the research
objectives include improvements in spatial and magnetic field resolutions and
imaging bandwidth over existing methods. Magneto-optical materials quality and
sensor design will be improved. Prototype sensors measuring 1cm2 will be
fabricated by combining surface plasma structures with materials exhibiting high
Verdet constants. The compositional, magnetic and optical properties of the
starting sensor materials will be measured, and the magnetic imaging
capabilities of the prototype sensor structures will be evaluated in terms of
magnetic field and spatial resolution. Imaging tests will be made on electrical
current patterns, magnetic inks, magnetostrictive structural composites and
magnetic medical cell-tagging particles, among others.

Commercial applications include magnetic character reading, magnetic code
reading for security, superconductor research, spin valve and magnetic RAM
research and manufacturing, integrated circuit electrical current imaging,
structural composite stress imaging using magnetic and magnetostrictive
materials, flaw detection in metals, biomedical tagging and identification of
cancer and other cells, and research and testing of MEMs actuators and devices.
