This grant will support the urgent collection of Silurian fossil invertebrates
from threatened exposures near Waukesha, Wisconsin. The site (Brandon Bridge
Quarry), ca. 420 million years old and reported in Science in 1985, is extremely
rare in preserving soft-bodied invertebrates. The locality will be destroyed by
commercial mining activity within one or two years. The project also involves
site stratigraphy, sedimentology and taphonomy, and initial preparation the
Silurian biota. Recovery and study of these fossils will lead to a much better
understanding of the diversity and paleoecology of marine life during the
Silurian and the phylogeny of marine invertebrates.
