9313035 Najar Eigenvalues of graphs first arose in the study of graphs from an
algebraic viewpoint. In the past ten years, there have been a number of
fundamental developments in spectral graph theory brought about by the strong
interplay between graph theory and a variety of areas, including group
representations, number theory, differential geometry, communication networks,
algorithms and computational complexity as well as chemistry and physics. Such
cross- fertilization has produced powerful new techniques and deeper
understanding of the fundamental structure of graphs. Also, results in spectral
graph theory have led to numerous applications in these diverse areas. There is
a strong cadre of active researchers in combinatorics at several California
universities. The conference will be an opportunity for interested researchers
to hear an informative set of lectures on the state of research in a very active
area. It will encourage newcomers, graduate and postdoctoral students, to do
research in the area of graph theory and combinatorics.
