The proposed research experimentally investigates exclusion, an important
condition determining the distribution of power in exchange networks. Predictive
studies for theory testing and exploratory studies for theory extension are
proposed. STudies examine predicted distributions of power, measured by rates of
exchange, and predicted rates of power development, measured by changes in
exchange rates over time. Exploratory studies form a foundation for the
extension of the GPI analysis of Markovsky, et al. (1988) to a new class of
exclusionary networks. These studies are intended to systematically remove scope
conditions which have restricted application outside the laboratory. These
studies also initiate examination of the structural dynamics of exchange
networks. The proposed work is facilitated by ExNet, an electronic network now
on line at the USC Laboratory for Sociological Research.
