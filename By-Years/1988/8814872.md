This project is the sixth in a series of international conferences on Lattice
Gauge Theories. These are numerical approximations to coupled field equations
for interaction of fundamental particles, an approach that has grown rapidly
with the advances in computer power of the last decade and has grown in
importance to elementary particle theory. This Conference should be of material
benefit in increasing the rate of progress in the field. In particular, it may
help bring closer the goal of making predictions for the mass of the "Higgs
Boson" an as yet undiscovered particle that plays a central role in particle
theory.
