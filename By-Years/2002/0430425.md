Proposal: NSF-0430425&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Securing Untrusted Software
with Interposition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: David
Mazieres&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principles for
building secure computer systems have been known for decades. Yet violating them
---by assuming elevated privilege, for example---makes application development
so much easier on conventional operating systems that it's doubtful the
principles will ever be broadly followed there. This research program
investigates a new operating system design, Asbestos, that allows applications
to be completely secured by third parties, such as system administrators,
without help from application authors themselves. The fundamental Asbestos
security primitive is interposition, whereby programs can easily interpose upon,
monitor, and control any or all interactions between an application and the rest
of the system. Unlike previous systems, this includes interactions with other
applications as well as system services. Interposers correspond to security
policies, or per-application firewalls. They can block or virtualize undesired
accesses, so that legacy applications that demand inappropriately high privilege
can run in a less-privileged setting. Design challenges include making system
interactions easy for interposers to understand, and developing a convenient
library of security policies built from interposition components. A successful
Asbestos design has the potential to significantly improve the security of
critical systems, even those running insecure applications. Source code will be
released publicly under an open-source license.&lt;br/&gt;
