The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 200 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer with a
1H/ 13C probe, variable temperature capabilities, and a sample changer. The use
of nmr is being incorporated into all four years of the undergraduate chemistry
curriculum beginning with the freshmen honors course and culminating with two
new senior-level courses. One of these courses involves inorganic and organic
approaches to synthesis. Student projects include following the evolution of the
active site of a metal-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction, thus familiarizing
students with the process of synthesis- characterization-design/redesign cycle
important to solving problems in chemical synthesis. The second new senior-level
course emphasizes the principles of fourier transform NMR spectroscopy and more
advanced laboratory applications of NMR including, command mode of operation,
spectral optimization, DEPT, selective homonuclear decoupling, solvent
suppression, multiple quantum filtered COSY and other advanced two- dimensional
experiments. The sample changer allows students enrolled in the introductory
organic chemistry laboratory to obtain routine NMR spectra of their reaction
products.
