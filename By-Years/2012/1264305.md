The goal of this dissertation is to create a descriptive reference grammar of
the Patwin language, using materials available in archives around the country.
Patwin is a Native American language formerly spoken in the southwestern
drainage of the Sacramento River in California. It is the southernmost member of
the small, moribund, and under-documented Wintuan language family, a member of
the proposed Penutian stock. Formerly spoken by a population of about
8,000-12,000, Patwin is now spoken as a first language by only one or two living
people known to the linguistic research community. Enough language materials
have been collected in various archives throughout the country that it should be
possible to arrive at a reasonably complete description of the language. Yet
there is no adequate grammatical description of the language available and since
the important work of Kenneth Whistler in the 1970's and early 1980's no
linguist has published on Patwin, whether descriptively or theoretically. This
dissertation will therefore be an academic, descriptive grammar of the language
with each of the areas traditionally described in grammars: phonetics (speech
sounds), phonology (sound patterns), morphology (word structure), and syntax
(sentence structure). It is moreover important that such a description be made
at this time as there is currently considerable interest in Patwin language
revitalization among various heritage Patwin communities. This project will also
support the scientific training of a promising scholar.
