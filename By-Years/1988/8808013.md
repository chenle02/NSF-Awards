The objective of this award is to support the conduct of a conference for the
purpose of assessing fundamental research needs in environmental engineering.
The conference will focus on comprehensive approaches for addressing
environmental issues that are subject to the practice of environmental
engineering design and on the process by which the results of research become
integrated into practice. The conference will be organized and conducted by the
Association of Environmental Engineering Professors working through the
Carnegie-Mellon University administrative office, and will be held in the
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area from November 13 to 15, 1988.
