Issues of openness, secrecy, and sharing in the communication of scientific and
technical information are central both to scientific progress and to individual,
group and societal control. Industry is an increasingly important contributor to
this country's scientific research effort, and any discussion of information
sharing, openness and secrecy in science should include an analysis of
industrial policies and the practices of industrial scientists. This project
will explore information sharing policies in the pharmaceutical industry and the
information sharing, openness and secrecy practices of pharmaceutical chemists.
In-depth interviews will be conducted with several companies' chemists and
chemistry managers. Managers will be asked about company policies and
guidelines; chemists will be asked about their external communication
activities, company policies and the decisions they make about what to share and
with whom they share scientific information, data and results. These interviews
will be analyzed and the results used to design a questionnaire for a large
sample of chemists and managers. This study comes from a promising researcher at
a primarily undergraduate institution; research plans are appropriate and
incorporate undergraduate research assistance. Institutional support is good.
The project will provide rich data about information sharing, openness and
secrecy policies and their effects on the external information sharing practices
of industrial scientists. Results will be relevant to both researchers and
policymakers. Support is recommended.
