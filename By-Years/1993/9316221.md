9316221 Haeberli The University of Wisconsin experimental nuclear physics group
will carried out research in the structure of few-nucleon systems (including the
quark substructure), meson production and meson exchange current processes,
fundamental weak interactions (tests of the standard model of electroweak
interactions), and symmetry tests. An in-house tandem van de Graaff accelerator
with polarized beam capability, as well as polarized targets, will be used to
carry out the in-house research program and develop equipment needed for user
mode experiments. Precision measurement techniques are central to the in-house
few-nucleon studies. User experiments will be carried out at IUCF, Bates,
NIKHEF, HERA, and Louvain la Neuve. Polarized beam and target techniques are
central to all research activities. Optical traps for polarized radioactive
atoms will be developed and used in some of the weak interaction experiments.
Atomic beam and laser pumped polarized targets and related equipment will be
developed for the medium energy program, which is based at the IUCF Cooler
facility, and the electron accelerators at Bates, NIKHEF, and HERA. ***
