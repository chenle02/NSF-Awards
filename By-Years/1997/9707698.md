Abstract ATM-9707698 Bradley, Raymond S. University of Massachusetts Title:
Precipitation Variability in the Inter-tropical Andes - Climatological Studies
for Paleoclimatic Reconstruction This proposal os to study relationships between
Atlantic SST and the precipitation in the inter-tropical Andes on the inter-
annual- decadal time scales. Isotopes data over the Andes, where important ice
core records were recovered, will be examined to develop an empirical model
relating circulation changes to isotopic variations. This study will utilize
Atlantic SST anomalies data, upper air data over tropical South America,
precipitation data from a dense network of stations along the tropical Andean
range, and stable isotope data. This research will help interpreting Holocene
climatic record of tropical ice cores and will thus throw some light on the
climatic conditions in that distant past.
