This project will create a textbook with integrated laboratory, field and
classroom activities, teacher guide and a teacher professional development guide
to support the teaching of an environmental science course for grade 10-12. The
materials will be designed for a course that has a focus on the relationship
between humans and their geological surroundings. A learning cycle pedagogical
design will be used to help students develop concept understandings and skills
through concept exploration, development and application phases. Concept
application will feature student-driven inquiry into environmental issues that
require application of geological, geographical and technological understandings
and tools. Embedded and performance-based assessments will elicit students'
conceptual understanding of core environmental and earth systems concepts,
unifying concepts and processes, applications of technology to societal problems
and the nature of science and technology. Print materials for each unit will
integrate application of USGS global GIS data sets and tools to student
research. Appropriate supplemental web content will be provided to enhance
teachers' understanding of science content, facilitate data acquisition and
support student inquiry.
