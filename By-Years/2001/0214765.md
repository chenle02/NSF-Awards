This project will investigate the processes controlling mercury (Hg) fluxes
between the atmosphere and soils and vegetation. Plant exposure chambers will be
used to develop data for modeling the role of forest stand interactions with
atmospheric Hg in the biogeochemical cycle of Hg. Mesocosm studies will be used
to study soil flux on multiple scales. This effort is important for
understanding the role of plants in the biogeochemical exchange of Hg between
the atmosphere and terrestrial systems.
