9413543 Khorrami This research provides funds for research equipment for
development of high-speed, ultra-accurate motors and robotic systems for
advanced manufacturing applications. The focus will be on the development of
closed-loop control of Sawyer motors using a high-resolution, two-dimensional
position sensor. This should provide significantly improved performance over the
entire work area, increasing both speed and stiffness of the system. The Sawyer
motor is used in many robotic systems for wafer probing and assembly operations.
Some of the major research areas that this equipment will support are the
control of high-speed positioning devices and structural vibration damping.
