Dr. Herbig will carry out observations which are designed to provide important
new clues to the source of the diffuse interstellar bands which have been
puzzling astronomers for many years. In an effort to correlate the strengths of
the diffuse bands with local properties of the interstellar medium, Dr. Herbig
will carry out high precision observations of stars imbedded in ionized hydrogen
clouds and of stars behind clouds in which the coatings of interstellar dust
grains have been removed. Dr. Herbig will also search for the signature of
interstellar polyatomic carbon molecules which have been suggested as a carrier
of the diffuse bands. A classical problem of stellar spectroscopy remains
unsolved after many years; the source of the diffuse interstellar bands is still
a mystery. New instrumentation, such as charge coupled devices and reticon
arrays, makes a renewed observational effort to solve this problem worthwhile.
Dr. Herbig is in an excellent position to provide new clues to the resolution of
this puzzle.
