Drs. Scholz and McGraw capitalize on a unique opportunity to undertake a
massive study of the impact of changes in the tax law on compliance. From an
empirical perspective, this research employs a complex design using several
different data collection techniques, including surveys of taxpayers,
experiments, and a rich but untapped data base of tax returns from the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). The surveys of taxpayers before and after the
introduction of the 1986 Tax Reform Act constitutes a naturalistic experiment of
the effects of legal change on citizen behavior. Combining the individual self-
reported measures with objective information from IRS records is especially
innovation insofar as it permits modelling the interrelationship between
perceptions, belief, and behavior. In addition to the surveys, experimental
study further probes the impact of different types of information and appeals on
taxpayer orientation and action. The analytic approach of these investigators
combines elements of self-interest and normative models to produce a
comprehensive framework for testing alternative theories of compliance. As such,
this work should add substantially to our knowledge of how citizens respond to
the tax system and to our theoretical understanding of the interaction of norms
and self- interest in shaping compliance. Further, subjective considerations are
rarely examined in social control research, although speculation abounds about
how they mediate the effects of structural changes in law, punishment, and
enforcement. This study provides direct data on reasoning and perceptions that
should advance our knowledge of the underlying processes that mediate
compliance. Finally, beyond these investigators' own scientific ambitions, the
project will yield a data base for other researchers' use.
