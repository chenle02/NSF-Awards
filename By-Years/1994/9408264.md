9408264 Raffa We know very little about the extent to which pheromone chemistry
of prey species has evolved in response to selection generated by predators that
use pheromones to locate prey. The PI is studing the ecological implications of
bark beetle-predator semiochemical interactions. He will test the hypotheses
that 1) subtle shifts in pheromone chirality and secondary components may
facilitate escape from predators, while retaining intraspecific functions, and
2) variation in bark beetle semiochemistry can affect reproductive success
within colonized trees. This research will yield new insights into the
ecological relationships between insect predators and their prey, and , in
particular, how prey adapt to reduce attack by predators that home in on their
chemical communication systems (pheromones). Because bark beetles are one of the
major challenges to sustainable forestry, the results of this research will have
important application to management of forests and bark-beetle outbreaks.
