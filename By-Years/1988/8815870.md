This proposal describes a three year research program to study magnesite-
dolomite equilbria in the temperature range of 100 to 200oC. One to four month
dedolomitization experiments will be run in Na-Mg-Ca-Cl brines in which
equilibrium is approached by magnesite precipitation, following dissolution of
"ordered" stoichiometric dolomite. The experimental procedure has been
successfully tested in the seven week dedolomitization experiments of Stoessell
et. al. (1987) in which calcite-dolomite equilibria was approached over the same
temperature range. The reacted solids will be examined with X-ray diffraction
techniques, petrographic microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and by an
electron microprobe. Data from the study will fill in the experimental gap on
dolomite-magnesite equilibria in the 100 to 200oC range. The results will (1)
help resolve the location of the dolomite-magnesite equilibrium boundary and (2)
help define the stablity field of dolomite.
