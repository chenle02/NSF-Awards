This proposal requests funds to obtain a scanning spectrofluorimeter, associated
epifluorescense microscope and computer. The instrumentation will be used in the
research programs of several investigators, all of whom need to measure
intracellular ion concentrations using various ion sensitive dyes. The specific
projects in this proposal will investigate the role of intracellular calcium in
cell volume recovery by invertebrate blood cells following a hypoosmotic stress;
the role of calcium in acetylcholine receptor differentiation; the role of
calcium in visual transduction in Limulus eye and vertebrate retina; the role of
calcium fluctuations in the regulation of mitosis in plants.
