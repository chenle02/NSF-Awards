Spatial heterodyne spectroscopy (SHS), a relatively new and undeveloped
spectroscopic method, has fundamental advantages over its relative, Fourier
transform spectroscopy (FTS). In SHS, diffraction gratings replace the flat
mirrors used in each arm of a conventional Michelson, and an imaging detector is
used at the output to record a spatially heterodyned interferogram without any
scanning elements. The PIs have achieved an additional light-gathering gain of
about 150 over conventional FTS or Fabry-Perot interference spectrometers with
their SHS system. These gains translate into smaller instruments and higher
sensitivity for a specified application. Their work will focus on atmospheric
remote sensing problems. The investigators will fully design a field-widened
system suitable for monitoring the global distribution of middle atmospheric OH
from space; further, they anticipate performing ground-based testing on a large
telescope.
