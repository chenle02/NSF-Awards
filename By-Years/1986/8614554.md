Annual growth bands from the coral Montastrea annularis preserve a record of
fallout plutonium concentrations which is simply related to the known history of
fallout 90-Sr deposition. The relationship between the plutonium concentration
in an annual band and in coeval seawater is clouded by ignorance of mechanisms
of plutonium uptake by corals and in synthetic calcium carbonates. The coral
plutonium oxidation-state signature will be recovered through application to
corals of techniques (solvent extraction, coprecipitation, selective adsorption)
previously applied to homogeneous aqueous solutions. Comparisons will be made
within (by ages of annual bands) and between corals (over taxonomy and
geography). Coprecipitaiton experiments will provide models of the
physicochemical control of plutonium uptake in calcium carbonate.
Coprecipitation of plutonium oxidation states in aragonite will be emphasized,
but coprecipitations with calcite and aragonite will be compared. In all cases
rate of precipitation will be controlled. Results for plutonium coprecipitation
will be compared with those obtained for actinide analog (Th, U, Np, Am) for the
plutonium oxidation states.
