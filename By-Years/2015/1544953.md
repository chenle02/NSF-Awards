Over the past decade there has been a growing awareness and interest in large
networked systems such as those presented by power (smart-grid), communication,
biological, social and sensor networks. A large body of research focused on
networked systems has resulted where the primary goal has been the design of
strategies by which individual agents in a network cooperate to achieve
coordinated goals. Less studied are competitive-strategic scenarios where agents
may be competing while trying to achieve their objectives, or may be competing
in teams using local communications for local coordination purposes. This
project considers the competitive-strategic domain for two opposing teams,
motivated by applications that can abstractly be viewed as a competition between
a large collection of autonomous agents, and an adversarial agent or team of
adversaries. A primary example is the problem of controlling a large wind farm
composed of numerous turbines: each rotating blade creates a downstream wake and
every turbine faces the problem of setting an appropriate rotation speed under
complex aerodynamic interactions. The cooperative control problem is to
determine rotation speeds for the individual turbines that maximize the total
collective energy extracted from the wind, under wake effects from neighboring
turbines and difficult-to-predict variations in wind speeds and directions. In
this example, the Principal Investigators propose to address a generalization of
the problem where the turbines are viewed as competing against nature, which
continually and adversarial changes the wind speed at each turbine. Ongoing with
the analytical and applications-oriented research efforts will be the
development of educational programs with interdisciplinary activities in
optimization, mathematical systems theory, game theory and clustering
algorithms. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved, with an
emphasis on attracting students from underrepresented groups to participate in
the research activities throughout the duration of the project.
