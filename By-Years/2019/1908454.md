This award will enable the Principal Investigator (PI) to support a Tissue
Engineering Science and Technology summer school project for underrepresented
minorities students in STEM. The summer school is designed to create a class
room environment aimed to provide participants with hands-on research experience
and focused training and mentoring for underrepresented minority/women students
in the emerging field of tissue engineering. The hierarchy-based learning
environment involves the principle investigator, graduate students and
undergraduates along with new recruits to develop strategies to design
biomaterial structures, create tissues and tissue interfaces. During the summer,
the participants will implement new designs and strategies to build their
engineered tissue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on promoting
diversity in engineering, science and technology and will use a mentorship
approach that involves providing research experience as well as mentoring
participants in professional development, scientific writing, and communications
skills development. Participants of this project will bring new knowledge and
demos of prototypes to the classroom that will serve as a tool to create
awareness in science and engineering technologies. The immediate benefits would
include promotion of STEM careers and address long-term workforce diversity
issues in the biomedical science/ engineering related areas. This award will
allow the PI to implement a successful mentoring program and create laboratory
mentoring demonstrations to attract minority/women students in STEM careers. The
PI has both a successful track record and the resources necessary to
successfully implement this highly rewarding education
grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
