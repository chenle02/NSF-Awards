The investigator will collect vegetation exposed along the margins of receding
glaciers on Baffin Island, Canada and use radiocarbon dating to determine when
it was frozen as glaciers advanced during the Little Ice Age. Samples from the
same sites collected in 2005 suggest that ice may have expanded following
volcanic activity. This study will address hypotheses about the rate of cooling
by combining the distance of ice retreat since 2005 and difference in age of the
mosses. A graduate student will participate in field work and prepare results of
radiocarbon dating for publication.

The goal of this project is to examine the rate of onset of persistent Little
Ice Age (LIA) cold by dating 50 new samples from current ice margins from ice
complexes in Baffin Island, Canada, and comparing them to similar collections
from 2005. If LIA ice expansion was abrupt and persistent then dates on the new
plants should be about the same age as the 2005 samples, 200 to 500 m distant.
Whereas if summers slowly cooled over decades-to-centuries through the late
Holocene, then the new dates will be significantly older than their 2005
counterparts. Collectively, these data will provide the most robust testing of
an abrupt onset of LIA cold and will be of interest to the sea ice and climate
modeling communities.
