The University of Arizona (UA) will conduct a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Program (REU) designed to teach students science by involving
them in research. The specific focus of the program is molecular biosciences -
the application of biochemical and molecular biological techniques to biological
problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students recruited nationally will participate
in summer research on the University of Arizona Campus. Particular attention
will be paid to identifying students from ethnic minority groups
underrepresented in the sciences and those who have little opportunity for
research experience at their home institution. Participating students will work
for 12 weeks during the summer. REU students will be matched with participating
faculty and will have a major voice in determining which lab they enter. In
addition to regular lab meetings, they will participate in a two day orientation
covering lab safety and an introduction to research ethics at the beginning of
the summer followed by weekly REU student group meetings with the project PI and
co-PI. The REU group meetings will enable students to develop professional
skills, such as presentation of research results, and will feature presentations
on preparing for, applying to, and selecting a graduate program. In addition,
students attend seminars by UA and visiting scientists on relevant scientific
topics. Field trips to places such as the Biosphere II and the Arizona Sonoran
Desert Museum will supplement the research experience. The summer will culminate
in a poster session at which students share their experimental
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carol Bender, UBRP Director, is the contact
