*** 9553539 Hamilton Loyola University will initiate a 6-week, summer commuter,
Young Scholars project with an extensive 8-month follow-up activities during the
academic year for 18 students entering grades 11 and 12. The program is
interdisciplinary, integrating computer science, physics and mathematics. the
students are introduced to basic computer architecture, after which they
assemble IBM-compatible microcomputers that are given to them to keep at the
completion of the program. Other activities involve students performing labs in
digital electronics, engineering and computer architecture, under the direction
of a research physicist. The students also perform experiments on mathematical
objects using computer programs they write in Pascal. Field trips are an
integral part of the project. Career-oriented field trips will be made to
R&amp;D and production facilities such as AT&amp;T Bell laboratories, Motorola,
Rockwell International, and General Motors. ***
