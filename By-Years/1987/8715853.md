Previous studies demonstrate that antarctic meteorites differ from non-
antarctic falls in frequency of type. Antarctica sampled at least one, perhaps
more, extraterrestrial populations in the past, different from that falling
today elsewhere on earth. The research objectives of this project are threefold:
to determine if the chemical weathering scale established for antarctic H/L
chondrite ratio is a weathering artifact; to study the extent to which the
nature of antarctic populations is site- and time-dependent; to chemically
investigate antarctic meteorites of unique or rare type so as to establish
chemical and thermal conditions during their formation. This research should
enable the PI to use meteorites to further study the recent (&lt;10 year)
history and dynamics of the antarctic ice sheet. Additionally, it should enable
the PI to establish in what ways the near-earth meteoroid complex changed with
time, how the changes relate to ice sheet history, and what they signify about
the nature of meteorite parent bodies.
