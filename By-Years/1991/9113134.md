The objective of this research is to evaluate the concept of using plasma
torches that can effectively be operated in situ in a cased borehole surrounded
by a geo-material medium. The plasma torch would be lowered to the bottom of a
small diameter, cased borehole. By raising and operating the torch at
progressively higher levels the borehole casing is rapidly melted opposite the
plasma flame, and a column of soil (and/or a mixture of soil & waste) is heated
and converted into a stabilized vertical mass. Successive (or simultaneous)
operations in adjacent boreholes, properly spaced, would likewise stabilize an
entire region.
