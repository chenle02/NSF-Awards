This research activity is supported under the "Research Opportunities for Women
--Planning Grant Program". The purpose of this program is to provide an
opportunity for women, who have never been the recipient of a federal award, to
undertake preliminary work to determine the feasibility of a line of research.
This award will allow the investigator to begin to develop and test models to
examine male/female wage differentials and occupational segregation. The
investigator will pay special attention to the differences in job mobility
between men and women as possible factor in explaining wage differentials. This
line of research in the general area of labor economics is extremely important
and timely. There is great controversy over whether wage differentials between
men and women are caused mainly by discriminatory practices or whether it is
mostly a result of other factors such as differences in human capital,
occupational choice, willingness to relocate, career interruptions, etc. Whether
wage differentials are due mainly to sex discrimination or other factors is of
enormous importance in determining what public policy ought to be with respect
to employment practices.
