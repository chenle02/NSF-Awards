This project is providing modern laboratory equipment to establish a
contemporary cell and molecular plant science teaching program. Two upper-level
laboratory courses are affected: Plant Physiology, and Plant Growth and
Development. Plant Physiology currently is undergoing complete renovation at the
hands of the principal investigator (who was hired a year ago to fill the
department's void in modern plant laboratory sciences). Plant Growth and
Development is a new course, offered for the first time in 1987- 1988. The
equipment is fitting out two entire laboratory courses in a manner that allows
students to observe fundamental principles in plant biology and to gain
experience in methodologies currently employed in plant science laboratory
research. As direct result of this grant, students are having an opportunity to
utilize the following techniques in their study of plant processes: fluorescence
and gas exchange at the whole leaf/whole plant level, organella isolation and
characterization, suborganella fractionation, polarographic gas assay in
solution, electrophoretic separation of proteins and quantification by scanning
densitometry, immunochemical assays including Western blots and enzyme-linked
immunosorbant assays, and in vitro translations. Plant molecular and cell
biology currently are areas of intense research efforts which are generating a
great deal of excitement. An objective of this project is to transmit some of
that stimulation to the local level. Some of the equipment also is being used in
other upper-level laboratory courses by biology majors, a majority of whom
continue their formal education in either graduate or professional schools. The
grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from
non-Federal sources.
