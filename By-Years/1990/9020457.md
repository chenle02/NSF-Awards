A detailed study of the angular distrbutions of photoelectrons following two-
step laser ionization of molecular systems will be made. Both direct ionization
and autoionization via an intermediate state will be studied. An important
aspect of the work is that the angle between the polarization vectors of the
lasers may be varied, and theory predicts that when these are not parallel there
will be a breakdown of cylindrical symmetry, which may be verified by this type
of measurement. During the later stages of the work the polarization of the
ejected electrons as well as their angular distribution will be measured.
