This grant covers experimental Cosmic Ray physics research by a group at
Louisiana State in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists and
foreign scientists. The group will continue to study the ultra-high energy
nucleus-nucleus interactions in cosmic rays and in accelerator based
experiments. They will study the spectrum and composition of cosmic rays of TeV
to PeV energies. The ratio of heavy to light nuclei in cosmic rays is a primary
indicator of the origin of such radiation.
