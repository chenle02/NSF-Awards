An innovative summer and full academic year REU site will be established with
the summer program devoted to mainly students from other schools and the
academic year program will be comprised of mainly Cornell studies. Each group
will involve 8 students, for a total of 16 students. The faculty involved have
proposed 16 research projects. Projects primarily related to engineering at
biological systems include: electronic sensors for measurement of milk
composition, methane formation of energy crops, and fragmentation of cellulose.
Agriculture engineering projects include: vehicle stability, measurement of
suspended particles, and greenhouse environmental control. Written and oral
reports of their research experience are required.
