9321233 Toogood The focus of this research wil be to determine the biosynthesis
of lanthionine and to synthesize the two natural products motuporin and
keramamide F. The research will lead to a better understanding of the function
of didehydropeptides in natural products. %%% With this award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Peter L. Toogood of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan. Professor Toogood will
focus his work on the synthesis and structure of several didehydropeptide
natural products and study the possibility of building these residues into
synthetic peptides and peptide mimics. ***
