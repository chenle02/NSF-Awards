Until recently, the presentation of an integrated view of plant function in the
laboratory has been hindered by a lack of instrumentation. Students learn about
cellular and molecular aspects of plant physiological processes in the course of
discovery-based laboratory experiences, but they have had limited opportunities
to extend these experimental studies to the organismal level. This project is
now revising the plant biology laboratory experiences so that students will come
to understand the importance of making connections between the levels of
organization inherent in living organisms. They will also gain an appreciation
of the influence of specific environmental conditions at all levels of plant
function, from both laboratory and field studies. The implementation of this new
laboratory curriculum will require portable instrumentation to measure
chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange, transpiration, and plant water
potential. The addition of this equipment will enable students to measure
various aspects of photosynthesis and plant water relations in the laboratory,
greenhouse, and field. In addition to these scientific goals, this new
curriculum will provide new opportunities for discovery-based learning and
promote the formation of communities of learners and teachers.
