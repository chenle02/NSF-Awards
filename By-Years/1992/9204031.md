This proposal seeks partial funding for an international conference on the topic
of organic non- linear optics with meeting headquarters at Washington State
University. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together top researchers -
whose expertise spans material design, material characterization, device
fabrication, and integrated device architectures - to the intimate setting of a
small university town to discuss and assess progress in the field.
