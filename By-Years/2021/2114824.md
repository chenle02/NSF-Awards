Despite increasing awareness of the critical nature of cybersecurity, the
cybersecurity workforce is currently insufficient to meet needs across the
public, private, and academic sectors. The project will directly address the
growing demand for cybersecurity professionals by increasing the number of
effective cybersecurity learning materials available in a standardized and
compatible format. These learning materials can then be widely adopted and used
in training future members of the cybersecurity workforce. The proposed
framework will also incentivize additional cybersecurity scholars to turn their
research or teaching materials into case studies. These case studies will be
attributable, which will expand societal and community impacts and also
positively impact scholars’ research reputations via citations and thus enhance
their academic progression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the team
proposes to develop a simple yet flexible framework named SAGA (Security Arxiv-
Github-kAggle), where scholars can easily create cybersecurity case studies
related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). For example,
these case studies might illustrate the use of machine learning to detect
malicious activities in social media or detecting spam/phishing emails using
classification. Furthermore, by adopting the notion of “citation” from the
academic world and implementing it using three public platforms (arXiv, Github,
Kaggle), the SAGA framework allows the developed case studies to be found easily
and shared across the cybersecurity community and allows the authors of case
studies to be appropriately recognized for their efforts. This attribution is
intended to encourage scholars’ participation in creating and sharing such
cybersecurity case studies. Finally, the project proposes to evaluate the
effectiveness of the developed cybersecurity case studies in improving students’
learning of cybersecurity concepts and skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace
(SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the
fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education. The SaTC
program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic
Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the
growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security
and privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
