This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Are ant-plant
mutualisms disrupted in rainforest fragments?" The subtitle is "Influence of
fragment size and edge proximity on ant colony establishment, growth, and
defense against herbivores." This research investigates how rain forest
fragmentation impacts plants and the ants that defend them from herbivores. In
addition to determining if the community of ant-plant mutualists is reduced in
fragments, a focal ant-plant system is being used to experimentally investigate
three potential mechanisms by which ant-plant mutualisms can be altered in
forest fragments. The field work is being carried out in Brazil.
