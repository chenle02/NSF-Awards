9419748 KELLOGG In a two-part project Dr. Elizabeth Kellogg of Harvard
University is studying the phylogenetic relationships and aspects of
developmental biology of grasses in the tribe Andropogoneae. Both corn (maize)
and sorghum are members of this tribe, a large group of warm-season grasses that
also includes sugar cane and many of the world's forage grasses. The nuclear and
chloroplast genomes as sources of character data, to measure mutational
differences among the many species. The developmental study emphasizes aspects
of growth and differentiation in floral and inflorescence structures among
various species, studied within an explicit phylogenetic context. One goal of
the project is to determine the evolutionary sequence of modifications in size,
shape, and position of floral parts that have ultimately led to the origin of
the cob in maize and of the related inflorescences in its close tribal
relatives.
