Manifolds are spaces locally resemble Euclidean spaces, and are the main object
of research in Geometry, with applications to all areas of mathematics and
theoretical physics. The principal investigator's project is centered on one of
the most classical problems in Geometry: determining which metric is the best
for a given manifold. A metric is a mathematical way of measuring the distance
and angles in a manifold. The project's research will require the use of
different techniques from several areas of mathematics: differential, algebraic
and symplectic geometry, analysis, dynamical systems, and topology. The PI will
take advantage of working at The City College of New York to reach
underrepresented groups in the sciences, as this institution has an unusually
high percentage of minority students.

Dr. Santoro's plan of research breaks down into three main projects revolving
around various notions of "special metrics" in differential geometry. The
special metrics appearing in the first project, about aspects of the
classification of ALE scalar-flat surfaces, can be seen as a generalization to
gravitational instantons. The PI's second project is the study of a collapsed
Dirichlet problem (at infinity) of complete constant mean curvature
hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space. Yet another notion of special metrics are the
Hermitian-Einstein metrics, a generalization of Kahler-Einstein metrics for
vector bundles: in the third project, the PI proposes the development of new
notions of stability in Yang-Mills theory for non-holomorphic vector bundles.
