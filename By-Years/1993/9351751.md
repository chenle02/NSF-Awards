Graphical and interactive multimedia presentations are used to improve
laboratory instruction. The multimedia equipment is used to develop multimedia
presentations that demonstrate correct laboratory procedures and setup using
diagrams, photographs, and/or video; provide instruction and demonstration of
proper laboratory technique; provide examples of valid data; and present theory
and phenomena in an understandable form using visualization tools. Laboratory-
level modules employ a high performance dedicated platform and are available to
every student in the laboratory, while laboratory- station-level modules are
appropriate for the computers available at each station. During the first year,
two laboratories are targeted: the high- frequency and microwave lab, and the
electronics lab. Because students generally find the microwave lab particularly
difficult, multimedia presentations are used in the laboratory to elucidate
concepts such as standing waves. These two labs also have one laptop/notebook
computer per station to present the laboratory-station-level modules. In the
following year, other faculty are introduced to multimedia in the laboratories
where it is most effective in improving instruction.
