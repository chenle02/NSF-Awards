The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve early detection of cognitive
decline and fall risk, particularly in the elderly. The proposed project will
develop an artificial intelligence system to assess cognitive issues and
estimate how likely a subject is to fall, enabling a new level of security for a
vulnerable population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances early detection of mobility problems
and cognitive decline. This will be accomplished through the development of
machine learning algorithms assessing gait dynamics (with dual-task information)
in habitual settings. Research objectives include: (1) Developing a machine
learning algorithm for fall prediction, (2) Developing preliminary mobility and
fall prediction scoring system, (3) Estimating the cognitive state, and (4)
Developing an accurate automatic fall detection
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
