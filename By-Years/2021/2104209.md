The 2020 election has the potential to introduce challenges not only for voters
searching for accurate information on candidates and voting procedures, but also
for officials, poll workers, and cybersecurity experts working to administer and
protect the electoral process. This award supports a workshop bringing together
experts from a range of relevant fields to discuss lessons learned from the 2020
election. The workshop will explore how our country can continually improve our
electoral process to be resilient in the most trying of times while
simultaneously advancing basic scientific research on all aspects of the voting
process. By sparking long-term collaboration across scholars and practitioners
that rarely engage with one another, the workshop will help generate new
research ideas and partnerships that will chart the course for future election
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The myriad challenges posed by 2020 elections
provide a strong opportunity for interdisciplinary research (e.g., voter
behavior at the intersection of political science, sociology, psychology, and
information science; voting access at the intersection of election law, data
science, and cybersecurity). However, traditional professional society meetings
rarely enable the interdisciplinary dialogue necessary to develop a
comprehensive understanding of the successes and shortcomings of the 2020
election. The workshop brings together scholars from across disciplines,
including law, political science, computer science, data science, and
mathematics. The output from the workshop will be a widely-disseminated document
that lays out the new or updated research problems and ideas that could lead to
a potential NSF DCL to solicit new proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
