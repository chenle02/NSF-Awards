This three-week summer workshop at the University of New Hampshire targets
undergraduate mathematics faculty who teach linear algebra or differential
equations, but have minimal experience with computer-aided instruction (CAI) in
their courses. These faculty seek to enhance their teaching by creating CAI
materials, e.g. in- class demonstrations, problem sets, syllabi, and operational
procedures, that effectively integrate computer technology into their
instructional plans. Morning sessions survey and reinforce specific mathematical
concepts, address the development of pedagogical strategies, and examine the
design of curriculum materials. Each afternoon, participants work in teams to
formulate, produce, and evaluate CAI materials appropriate to their individual
courses. Guest visitors supplement these regular activities with talks and
discussions on applications and broad pedagogical issues raised by CAI. The
major impact of the program is the enhancement of the teaching of differential
equations and linear algebra. Effective use of CAI in these subjects can
increase the mathematical maturity of students without sacrificing course
content. This objective is also with curricular goals in engineering and the
physical science.
