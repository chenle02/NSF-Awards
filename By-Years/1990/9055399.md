Fairfield University seeks funds for a three-year program for 24 mathematics
teachers to improve their mathematical understanding and pedagogical practices.
The program consists of six semesters of Saturday courses presenting a
chronological development of mathematics with heavy emphasis on participant
discovery of mathematical concepts, accompanying computer laboratories,
familiarizing participants with appropriate software, a computer network linking
participants via BITNET for extramural electronic mail communication,
participant development of curricular units, and participant-hosted Fall
conferences for colleagues. The evolution of logic, set theory and discrete
mathematics, of geometry -- both Euclidean and non-Euclidean, and of calculus
and analysis will be developed, with special consideration to the contributions
of women and non-Western men and cultures to this evolution. Participants may
earn 18 graduate credits. Each participant will serve as mathematical mentor to
a mathematics teacher and an administrator in her/his school, and staff/peer
site visits during each school year will stimulate a dialogue among mentor and
mentees concerning the mathematics curriculum and the use of computers in
teaching mathematics. Thus an additional 48 second-wave colleagues will be
brought into the program. In all, 72 teachers and administrators will be
enhanced. A Journal of Curriculum Units prepared by participants will be
distributed to participating schools and others for a possible third-wave
enhancement. Fairfield University and local business cost-sharing will account
for 13% of the NSF budget. Seeing the development of mathematics from an
historical perspective and knowing the great contributions of women and non-
Western men and cultures to this development is a key component to scientific
literacy. This project may serve as a model enhancement program for promoting
this component.
