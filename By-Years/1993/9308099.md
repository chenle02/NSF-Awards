A tool to aid in the design of parallel computers by computing their
performance is developed. Currently queueing networks or stochastic Petri nets
are the main methods used for computing the performance indices of parallel
systems. A method that uses probabilistic automata to model parallel computers
will make the tool easy to use, comprehensive and efficient. Probabilistic
automata are a modular way of modeling parallel systems. The modeler is relieved
from dealing with a global model of a parallel system as the system is divided
into modules that are dealt with separately. Problems such as the design of
architectures for certain problem domains and the mapping of algorithms to
architectures are studied with the aid of such a tool.
