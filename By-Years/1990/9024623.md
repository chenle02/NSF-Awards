Travel funds are provided to enable a well-known speaker from overseas to
present a keynote address on the role of surface mechanics in tribology at
special sessions held at the Winter Annual Meeting of the ASME in Dallas, TX.
The special sessions are entitled "Intersection of Tribology and Fracture" and
are intended to expose researchers in mechanics to the relevant specific
research needs in tribology. The keynote talk is entitled "Predicting Wear for
Metal Surfaces in Sliding Contact Using a Low Cycle Fatigue Model of Wear
Particle Generation" and is authored by professor Peter Oxley of the University
of New South Wales in Australia.
