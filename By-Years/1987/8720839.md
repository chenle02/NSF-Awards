The availability of a large quantity of long-period digital seismic data has
played a major role in recent advances in our understanding of the large-scale
aspherical structure of the Earth. Many new models exist which have been
designed to fit these data. They succeed to various degrees but it is
indisputable that much of the signal in the data remains to be explained. One
reason for this is that approximate theoretical formulations have been used to
intepret the data. In this proposal, we describe techniques of data analysis
which can avoid most approximations and we illustrate how well some approximate
techniques are capable of performing. The application of these techniques to a
large dataset will lead to many integral constraints on aspherical structure
which we call structure coefficients. These structure coefficients can also be
used to compute three-dimensional Green's functions for accurate studies of
long-period source mechanisms.
