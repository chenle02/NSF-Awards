Angela Wilson of the University of North Texas is supported by the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program through a CAREER award to develop accurate
quantum chemistry methods for large-sized molecular systems and to apply these
methods to problems in atmospheric chemistry. In particular, she will develop a
hierarchy for, and understanding of, density functional methods that evaluate
accuracy and precision for larger chemical systems by examining the interplay
between basis set choice and functional choice. In addition, she will develop a
distance-learning web course on computational chemistry.

Computational chemistry has advanced so significantly that it is an essential
complement to experiment. This project will result in improved accuracy and
extended predictive capabilities for these methods, and contribute to the
understanding of atmospheric processes. Also, the development of web-based
courses will assist the next generation of students pursuing careers in
chemistry by training them in these techniques.
