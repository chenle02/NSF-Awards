ABSTRACT 0201770 Paul S. Wang Kent State U

The Kent State University requests a three year research grant to support
research on Internet Accessible Mathematical Computation (IAMC) and Web-based
Mathematics Education (WME). The research will be conducted by Professor Paul S.
Wang as Principal Investigator and two grad-uate research assistants. The
proposed effective date is August 1, 2002. The proposed work extends progress
already made, by the PI's group and others, in making mathematical computations
easily accessible and conveniently interoperable on the Internet. The research
involves protocol specification, design and implementation of prototypes,
architecture of a WME system, and design/implementation of a WME content
authoring language. The results have great potential for scientific research and
mathematics education.
