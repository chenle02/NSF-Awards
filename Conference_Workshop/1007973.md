There is a long history of interaction between number theory and combinatorics.
In the past two decades, deep results in automorphic forms and number theory
were used to construct (optimal) expanders, which are known to have wide
applications in computer science and communication networks. These techniques
were generalized to construct higher dimensional analogues. Very recently, zeta
functions for graphs have been extended to complexes. They contain topological
and spectral information of the combinatorial objects so that the Riemann
hypothesis is satisfied if and only if the object is spectrally extremal.
Furthermore, exciting developments in arithmetic combinatorics in recent years
provide new tools to construct families of good expanders, which in turn are
used to obtain deep number theoretic results. At the same time, the concept of
expansion is extended in group theory and computer science to a different new
context.

A workshop on graphs and arithmetic will take place March 8-12, 2010, at CRM,
Montreal, Canada, to review recent exciting developments in expanders and number
theory. The focus will be on the interconnections between combinatorics, group
theory and number theory. Both theories and applications will be emphasized.
Seventeen invited speakers are from the US. To cover the expenses of the invited
speakers and partially support graduate students and recent doctorates, support
from the NSF is sought to supplement the funds committed by the CRM.
