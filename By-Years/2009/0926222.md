The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) includes the
Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science
Foundation (NSF), and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). With the 2004
reauthorization of NEHRP (PL 108-360), NIST was established as the lead agency
for NEHRP. In order to coordinate NEHRP activities among the four agencies as
required by this reauthorization, NIST has established the NEHRP secretariat.
This award is an interagency agreement and provides partial support for the
NEHRP secretariat administered by NIST. The secretariat facilitates the
intellectual merit of NEHRP through coordinating various interagency activities,
updating the NEHRP strategic plan, publishing the annual NEHRP report, and
facilitating the NEHRP Advisory Committee for Earthquake Hazards Reduction. The
broader impact of NEHRP is to advance knowledge and promote innovation for
earthquake loss reduction for all U.S. citizenry. Through NEHRP, FEMA, NIST,
NSF, and USGS work together to improve understanding, characterization, and
assessment of hazards and vulnerabilities; improve model building codes and land
use practices; reduce risks through post-earthquake investigations and
education; improve design and construction techniques; improve the capacity of
government at all levels and the private sector to reduce and manage earthquake
risk; and accelerate the application of research results into practice.
