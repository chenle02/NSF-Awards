This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Carreira's Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry. The design and synthesis of structurally well-defined
rare earth complexes for the asymmetric catalysis of the hetero-Diels-Alder
cycloaddition reaction will be carried out. Systems to be studied include the
reactions of achiral aldehydes with funcionalized dienes. Protecting groups on
the dienophile will provide a second contact point with the complex to enhance
the selectivity of the formation of one diastereomeric transition state. These
steric effects will lead to increased product selectivity. %%% The Diels Alder
reaction is very versatile in the different kinds of molecules that can be
prepared by it. This proposal will study means by which the reaction can be made
more selective. The results will lead to the synthesis of new molecules some of
which could have important physiological properties.
