The investigators propose to develop new innovative approaches
for&lt;br/&gt;modeling and analyzing carcinogenesis models involving
multiple&lt;br/&gt;pathways with each pathway being a stochastic multi-stage
model and&lt;br/&gt;with intermediate initiated cells subjecting to
stochastic&lt;br/&gt;proliferation and differentiation and genetic and
epigenetic&lt;br/&gt;changes. The investigators also propose to apply these
new&lt;br/&gt;innovative approaches to develop carcinogenesis models for
some&lt;br/&gt;human cancers for assessing risk factors and to develop
predictive&lt;br/&gt;procedures for these cancers. Specifically, the
investigators will&lt;br/&gt;apply the methods to develop new stochastic models
for human liver&lt;br/&gt;cancer because of the importance of this cancer and
because of the&lt;br/&gt;availability of some precious data for this type of
cancer. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators note that the similar methododology can be
applied to&lt;br/&gt;other human cancers as well, which will be investigators'
future&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators study some
cancer models for human liver cancer&lt;br/&gt;based on the existing data
already collected. Such models are&lt;br/&gt;considered to follow EPA proposed
cancer guidelines (Federal&lt;br/&gt;Register 51(85), 33992-34003, 1996). The
use of such model is&lt;br/&gt;possible because sufficient biological
information on the human&lt;br/&gt;liver cancer is available. The end result of
this research should be&lt;br/&gt;useful for cancer prevention and cancer
control. The investigators&lt;br/&gt;believe that this along with other advances
will render many current&lt;br/&gt;practices in experimental biology, including
many steps of drug&lt;br/&gt;development, unnecessary. This will in turn make
the drug&lt;br/&gt;development process become more productive and
efficient.&lt;br/&gt;
