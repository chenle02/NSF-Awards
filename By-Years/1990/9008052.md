The investigator's previous work on structural polymorphisms, on the one hand,
and recursive types over CPO- categories, on the other hand, will be
synthesized. Both semantic and syntactical aspects will be considered.
Categorical algebra was once considered the most abstract and least likely
candidate for applications, but recent developments show promise of shedding
light on the semantics of programming languages.
