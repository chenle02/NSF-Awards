Optimal parallel algorithms are those whose total work (total number of
operations) matches the serial complexity of the problem, corresponding to
optimal (often linear) time sequential algorithms. The recent trend of designing
fast and processor- efficient algorithms has produced important new parallel
techniques and paradigms. The main goal in this research is to pursue a research
effort in this direction with a particular emphasis on a sample of specific
problems in arithmetic computations, graph theory, and VLSI routing.
