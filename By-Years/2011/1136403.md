In this project Tennessee Technological University (TTU) provides Robert Noyce
Scholarships to 24 students majoring in physics, chemistry, mathematics, and
various engineering disciplines so that they can take education courses in their
undergraduate years and complete additional courses after receiving their STEM
degree in order to qualify for licensure to teach secondary school science or
mathematics. With a total of up to three years of support, students engage in an
early teaching experience, are supported and mentored as they obtain their STEM
degree and licensure, and are assisted into the transition into the teaching
profession during their induction year. With over 2,300 STEM majors and an
updated teacher education program, TTU is well placed to contribute to the need
for well trained secondary school science teachers. Collaborators in the project
include the Colleges of Arts and Science, Engineering, and Education; the Center
for the Teaching and Learning of Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics; and several local education authorities. This pathway to licensure
appeals to STEM majors and provides an opportunity to conduct education research
identifying best practices in their training. It also enhances the
infrastructure for education in the Upper Cumberland region and makes the STEM
departments at TTU stakeholders in the quality of teacher education.
