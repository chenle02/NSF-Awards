Abstract Bunimovich The proposed research deals with the dynamics of spatially
extended systems. The systems under study include nonlinear hyperbolic partial
differential equations, lattice dynamical systems (in particular, coupled map
lattices), lattice gas cellular automata and the systems of interacting
particles. The pattern formation problem will be studied as well as order-chaos
transitions. Most of the questions that will be addressed have their origin in
physics and hydrodynamics, and were transformed into the mathematical form by
the principal investigator with collaborators during the last fifteen years. A
broad approach will be used that combines methods of the ergodic theory, the
theory of nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems, stability theory of
infinite dimensional dynamical systemq and the theory of bifurcations. The
recent breakthrough in the understanding of a complex (chaotic) dynamics of
systems evolving in time (dynamical systems) was connected with the studies of
nonextended (point) dynamical systems whose dynamics can be completely described
by measurements performed at a single point of a real (physical) space.
Evolution of extended systems such as the flow of fluids and gases, large
systems of interacting elements in electronics (e.g. Josephson junctions) needs
to be studied in space and time simultaneously. The purpose of this research is
to pursue the adequate approaches to study such space-time evolution and to
develop algorithms to evaluate quantities that characterize space-time dynamics.
The other novelty is the study of systems with dynamics which have both random
and deterministic components (but not small, random perturbations of
deterministic systems or vise versa). Most of systems in applications are of
this type, e.g. in chemistry, artificial intelligence, in the management of
warehouses etc.
