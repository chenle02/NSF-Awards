&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dalcanton, Julianne &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Julianne Dalcanton
of the University of Washington will use her CAREER award to study the formation
of galactic disks. Theoretical models of disk formation have had substantial
success in explaining many of the basic features of disk galaxies. The Tully-
Fisher relation, the exponential surface brightness profiles, and the rotation
curves of disk galaxies all can be reproduced by models of a simple spherical
collapse of a rotating gas cloud. However, the recent discovery that all thin
disk galaxies are embedded within an additional thick disk component suggests
that the existing picture is too simple. Either this pervasive thick disk
component captures a distinct phase in the initial collapse of the galaxy, or it
tracks the early hierarchical build-up of the galaxy (a phase absent from
existing models). With this award, Dr. Dalcanton will provide the critical
measurements and the theoretical foundations necessary for incorporating the
creation of thick disks into models of disk galaxy formation. By measuring the
kinematics, ages, and metallicities of a large sample of thick disks, she will
be able to cleanly distinguish among several scenarios for the formation of
thick disks and the early evolution of disk galaxies. She will also carry out a
systematic program of simulations and analytic calculations to derive the
cosmological implications of the previously unexplored thick disk population.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to her work in training the next generation of
scientists, Dr. Dalcanton will design and execute a novel program to capture and
reinforce the scientific interest of middle school girls, before their attrition
from scientific, mathematical, and technological fields begins. The program will
focus on outreach to the girls and their mothers simultaneously, to help foster
a "science positive "culture within the home, and to increase the support that
scientifically inclined young women receive from their most influential female
role model. This project is an outgrowth of her current work on the Board of
Directors of a non-profit organization devoted to fostering the interest of pre-
teen girls in science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;
