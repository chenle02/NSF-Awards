The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of an adhesive-free bandage to wear on the skin for wound healing
and other applications. Current bandage technology relies on rigid, adhesive
materials that do not provide comfortable, long-term adhesion for the user. The
proposed technology is an elastomeric mesh that is a highly deformable and an
elastic membrane with similar mechanics to skin that provides a conformable
surface to the microgrooves of the skin for long-term wound or scar coverage.
The technology has application in wound care, scar management, and skin-patch
type treatments (e.g., nicotine, wrinkle, acne, etc.). The goal of the proposed
technology is to provide a self-adhesive bandage that may be laminated on the
skin for a long period of time, circumventing the need for frequent removal or
replacement, and reducing the risk of potential infection. This adhesive-free
bandage may be suitable for patients with sensitive skin and/or allergies, such
as premature babies and elderly patients. Additionally, this technology may be
developed for on-skin, self-adhesive, wearable electronics and translated into
markets that have yet to be fully established such as the development of
stretchable electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on
the development of a microstructure that mimics the skin naturalâ€™s extracellular
matrix by providing an adhesive-free, comfortable substrate for long-term
lamination in wound care. Currently, used bandages require "tacky" adhesives
that can aggravate allergies and exacerbate inflammation. The proposed
technology is a self-adhesive, nanofibrous, silicone elastomer that may replace
adhesive bandages. Preliminary testing demonstrates its biocompatibility,
increased cellular proliferation, and viability compared to silicone sheets,
which are among the most widely used bandage materials. Further, it may increase
the rate of cell proliferation and cell turnover in vivo to diminish wound
healing time and improve the appearance of scars. In addition, it has been
demonstrated that the proposed technology adheres to the skin during exercise
conditions that result in vigorous sweating, acting as a fully permeable self-
adhesive. The bandages provide a unique opportunity to evaluate an unmet need in
the wound care industry for soft, ultra-thin, stretchable, and permeable
bandages, yielding a highly conformal, adhesive-free, and sweat diffusive
protective membrane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
