This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused on the application
of a new and powerful measurement technique for turbulent flows to strengthen
the linkage between experiments and numerical modeling in this area. The focus
is on coherent, organized structures. The technique is particle imaging
velocimetry, from which multi-point, multi-dimensional velocity field data can
be extracted. Experimental information of this kind is badly needed to enable
the development of more realistic models for complex turbulent flows involved in
mixing and the separation of flow from boundaries.
