Observations of the auroral ionosphere have shown the presence of very strong,
highly localized gradients in the ionospheric density. These gradients appear to
be related to localized electric fields. This project will examine the features
of localized electrostatic fields, and the plasma waves and density fluctuations
related to such fields. The project will also examine the interaction of ions
with the localized electric fields. The research will quantify the ion
interaction with the fields and determine the resulting theoretical ion
distribution functions, which may then be compared with direct measurements.
