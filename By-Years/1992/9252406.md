A series of laboratory exercises are being developed that provide students
extensive hands-on experience with techniques that are currently used in cell
biology research. The goal of these exercises is to give students sufficient
experience with these techniques so they can look beyond the techniques and see
the principles being examined and practical applications for these techniques.
To this end, the labs are organized into mini-project sections lasting two-four
weeks. During each section, students do several sequential steps on a single
preparation. Slight variations (e.g., isolation of different plasmids, assay for
different marker enzyme) make the results of each student unique, providing a
sense of discovery and accomplishment. Discussion of these results enriches the
overall experience and provides a format for discussing applications of these
techniques. The coupling of these techniques to this lab format will help
students experience the excitement of scientific research.
