Data analytics extracts insights from massive datasets, often with the
assistance of machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to allow
domain experts, including data scientists, to analyze massive datasets quickly
using the most powerful supercomputing systems in the world. The problem is that
state-of-the-art data processing algorithms that filter data, summarize results
and combine information from different sources have inherent scalability
bottlenecks. This project designs hyperscalable data processing algorithms that
harness the unprecedented compute, storage and networking concurrency of a high-
performance computer. This project also develops an open-source data processing
engine to disseminate prototype implementations of these algorithms to the
public. Another contribution is the creation of a massively parallel data
processing module and associated teaching materials for undergraduate data
science curricula, such as the diverse Data Analytics undergraduate major at The
Ohio State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The confluence of extreme compute
parallelism, fast networking and growing memory capacities in the modern
datacenter presents an opportunity to design a hyperscalable data processing
kernel for warehouse-scale computers. This project sits at the intersection of
data management and high-performance computing; it develops scalable join and
aggregation algorithms, topology-conscious query planning and optimization
techniques, and interference-aware data access methods for shared cold storage.
This is accomplished by carefully overlapping communication and computation,
identifying and avoiding unscalable all-to-all communication, accounting for
network path congestion and variability in remote memory access latency, and
judiciously using inter-process coordination to accelerate data ingestion from a
massively parallel shared file system. These research activities lay the
intellectual foundation to make data analytics scalable and efficient in
warehouse-scale computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
