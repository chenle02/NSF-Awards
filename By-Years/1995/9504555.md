9504555 Akin This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards
provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. Financial support for
this award is from the East Asia Pacific Program. This award will partially
support a fifteen month postdoctoral research visit by David W. Akin to work
with John Laete'esafi, Organizer of the Kwaio Cultural Centre in East Kwaio,
Malaita, Solomon Islands. This research is an anthropological study of how
genderbased inequality is being created and perpetuated in a situation of rapid
social change. The PI will examine the relationship between gender relations and
change in belief among the people of Kwaio in the Solomon Islands. The mountain
Kwaio are the last major non-Christian group in the Solomon Islands, and they
continue to worship spirits of their ancestors, that enforce a strict code of
behavior. However, the Kwaio have been steadily reinterpreting and reshaping
their beliefs to make them compatible with changing social conditions. Akin will
test and refine a hypothesis as to how particular aspects of this chanee are
taking place. This is a study of the role of human agency in processes of social
transformation. He will investigate how incremental adjustments in belief and
practice may, over time, produce significant socio-structural change. ***
