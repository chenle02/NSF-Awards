Current meter data from 26 long-term moorings in the North Pacific Ocean will
be analyzed. Moorings located in the Kuroshio Extension will be used to
"profile" that current, following a method developed by the P.I., and applied to
the Gulf Stream. This method can be used to deduce velocity and temperature
structure, as well as mass transports of the current. Results will be compared
for different alongstream locations, as well as with analogous results for the
Gulf Stream. Other investigations include: 1. Attempts to determine the nature
of the energy balance involved in the downstream decay of mean kinetic energy
flux in the Kuroshio Extension; 2. Determination of eddy kinetic and potential
energy budgets for the entire North Pacific region covered by the moorings; 3.
Identification of possible instability mechanisms occurring in the region via
their energetic signatures.
