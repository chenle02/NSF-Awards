9726986 Kaplan Over the past 30 years, the Stroud Water Research Center has
developed and used long-term ecological data for White Clay Creek watershed in
three interrelated areas of inquiry: biogeochemistry, microbial ecology, and
macro-invertebrate ecology. These studies represent a unique documentation of
the temporal variability in a protected Piedmont stream ecosystem. The depth and
detail in these data provide the baseline for a wide variety of research
projects concerning the dynamics of stream ecosystems, and are essential in the
evaluation of long-term patterns of environmental change. This current project
will (1) maintain existing watershed installations needed to continue
acquisition of long-term data on White Clay Creek, (2) address the data
management needs of the long-term research project, including making the data
available to the research community, and (3) test hypotheses concerning stream
ecosystem structure and function under stable and/or recovering conditions that
can only be examined with long-term data. This study is valuable in that it
provides a long-term perspective on how land use history and atmospheric
deposition affect stream water quality, organisms in stream communities, and
ecosystem structure and function.
