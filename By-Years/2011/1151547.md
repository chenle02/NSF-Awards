With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the
research of Professor Douglas of the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities for
studies toward the activation and functionalization of carbon sigma bonds
adjacent to carbonyls. First, new methods involving the metal-promoted
activation of these bonds in ketones, esters, and aldehydes will be developed. A
major focus will be on the insertion of unsaturated groups into the activated
bonds. Second, mechanistic work will be undertaken to develop a deeper
understanding of the new reactivity develop. Cross-over and kinetic isotope
effect experiments will teach us how the reactions proceed and give insight in
to the development of improved catalyst systems and asymmetric processes.
Finally the methods developed under this award will be applied to a diverse set
of synthesis challenges. Applications will range from the synthesis of commodity
chemical feedstocks like methyl ethyl ketone to the synthesis of complex natural
products like dragmacidin E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Douglas will also
initiate two educational projects that interweave research and teaching. The
first project involves discovery-based learning in the large chemistry
classroom. A hybrid, guided-inquiry and traditional-lecture teaching plan for
introductory organic chemistry will be piloted and tested against appropriate
control groups. The second program is an outreach program involving a local
recording-arts high school that serves at-risk children from predominantly
underrepresented groups.
