The recent and growing popularity of thin-client systems makes
it&lt;br/&gt;important to develop techniques for analyzing and comparing
their&lt;br/&gt;performance, to assess the general feasibility of the thin-
client&lt;br/&gt;computing model in modern networking environments, and to
determine&lt;br/&gt;the factors that govern the performance of these
architectures. &lt;br/&gt;This project involves carrying out a series of
experiments to gain&lt;br/&gt;information and understanding on the effectiveness
of thin-client&lt;br/&gt;architectural mechanisms for graphical and multimedia
applications in&lt;br/&gt;various network environments. These experiments
include performance&lt;br/&gt;analysis using several real applications as well
as controlled&lt;br/&gt;experiments with specialized micro-benchmarks designed
to isolate&lt;br/&gt;particular aspects of thin-client architectures that have
significant&lt;br/&gt;impact on overall application performance. Application and
user&lt;br/&gt;workloads will be varied to understand and analyze the
scalability of&lt;br/&gt;different remote display mechanisms in terms of network
and server&lt;br/&gt;resources. These experiments will be conducted in a
testbed&lt;br/&gt;environment in which network characteristics such as
bandwidth,&lt;br/&gt;latency, and packet loss are varied in a controlled manner
to&lt;br/&gt;understand their impact on thin-client architectural
design&lt;br/&gt;choices. The results of these experiments will have a
fundamental&lt;br/&gt;scientific impact by laying a quantitative foundation for
future&lt;br/&gt;innovations in thin-client computing research.
