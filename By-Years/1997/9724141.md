This project focuses on understanding how peptides in the central nervous system
regulate various physiological functions. In particular, the PI is interested in
a peptide that inhibits heart rate. This peptide is referred to as DMS or
dromyosuppressin. The DMS peptide is encoded by the dromyosuppressin gene. DMS
inhibits heart rate in a dose dependent manner when introduced into the animal.
The PI is conducting research in an animal amenable to genetic analysis and
proposes to generate mutations in the gene that encodes DMS to better understand
the role of the peptide in animal physiology. After obtaining these mutations,
the PI will use molecular and physiological techniques to determine when the
peptide is expressed and how altering the presence of DMS might affect the
animal. Because this peptide is conserved in structure and function, our work
will have broad application to other organisms.
