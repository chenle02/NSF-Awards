Council

Title: Girls Are IT!

The Girl Scouts, Hornets' Nest Council has been extremely active in the lives of
adolescent girls in the Charlotte regional community for over 65 years. In the
21st century, this involves reaching out to widely diverse populations including
recent immigrants from Asia, Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe. The
success of these outreach programs depends on understanding the language and
culture of the families in these communities and providing activities, support,
and education that is deemed appropriate and relevant for all of the girls and
adults involved.

Girls all over the country are faced with a range of opportunities that were not
available to previous generations. Part of the Girl Scout mission is to help
"girls gain insight into coping with contemporary moral and social dilemmas."
Through a series of Girl-Scout-sponsored series of innovative and engaging
programs, girls learn about preventing teen pregnancy, avoiding substance abuse,
and understanding the influence of popular culture on creating faulty self-
images regarding one's body and mind.

With support from ITWF, the Hornets' Nest Council will deliver this content in a
new and innovative way - through a custom technology-based simulation entitled,
"Making Choices." "Making Choices" will use a variety of technologies including
wireless networked laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs),
printers, scanner and digital cameras to deliver a series of simulation
activities (totaling 3-5 hours of instructions). A research evaluation study
will assess attitudes of girls and women volunteers who participate in the
standard programs versus the technology-based programs.
