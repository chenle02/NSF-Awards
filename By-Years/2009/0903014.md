This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will quantitatively
reconstruct deep ocean carbonate chemistry changes across the Paleocene-Eocene
thermal maximum to determine the degree of ocean acidification during a past
period of high CO2 and extreme warming. The PIs will generate records from
multiple sites in different water depths and different oceans using
palaeontological, geochemical, and modeling techniques. There will be particular
focus on the application of two Boron-based proxies for ocean pH. Ocean
acidification is a topic of great societal concern because of its impact on
marine organisms and on the rate at which the ocean can absorb additional CO2
from the atmosphere. The research will involve graduate and undergraduate
students at the four participating institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
