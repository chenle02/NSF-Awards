The project builds connections between computational geometry and machine
learning by extending and demonstrating how advances in geometry can impact and
inform machine learning, and vice versa. Computational geometry offers many ways
to characterize and compute on shapes in low dimensions (such as spatially-
encoded trajectories of people or objects) and provides understanding about
point sets in high dimensions. Machine learning focuses on automatically
discovering patterns which generalize across a population to new data. This
project will leverage computational geometry insights to make analysis of low-
dimensional shapes more amenable to machine learning, and to improve
understanding and efficacy of high-dimensional data analysis. The project will
also help bridge these connections by supporting several events including
international workshops on geometry in machine learning, and community building
ones in data science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project
highlights two keystone applications. The first is dealing with trajectories,
which can be modeled as time-parameterized curves in a spatial domain and pose
many challenges for direct use within typical analysis pipelines. The developed
approach shows how to convert such objects (and related low-dimensional
geometric structures) into a vectorized representation so it can seamlessly
integrate with numerous data-analysis tasks. The second is in analyzing data
sets already embedded as points in a high-dimensional space. Word vector
representations are a central and important such example where the individual
data-point coordinates do not have meaning. Hence, the project uses the geometry
of these high-dimensional data sets to provide richer analytical operations and
more intuitive and transparent analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
