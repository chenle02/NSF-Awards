9734899 Roth "Evaluation of Reliability of the Earth Resistivity Method in
Thinly Mantled Karst" Sinkhole occurrences in areas of thinly mantles karst are
a common cause of cost overruns during construction and failures of structures
during their useful life. The frequency of these failures can be reduced by
improved geotechnical site investigation prior to construction. The objective of
the proposed study is to investigate and demonstrate the use of resistivity
methods to increase the reliability of foundation design in karst areas with
clay soils. At the present time, methods of site investigation in karst areas
with clay soils are generally limited to borings and other types of intrusive
probes. The reliability of these methods for locating conditions which may lead
to the formation of sinkholes is poor. The research activities in this study
will evaluate the reliability of the earth resistivity method as a tool for site
investigation in these areas and demonstrate its use as a method to improve
foundation reliability. In this study, two areas of known subsurface voids and
frequent sinkhole formation will be investigated. Line surveys at a number of
different spacings will be conducted using an earth resistivity meter with
multiple electrodes. Anomalies indicated by the data will be confirmed using
boring methods or excavation. The results of the testing will be used to develop
relationships between line and node spacing and the probability of detecting an
anomaly of a given size. ***
