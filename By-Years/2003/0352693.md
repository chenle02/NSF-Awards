This institute will be operated under the auspices of the Department of
Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Nonlinear Analysis at Carnegie Mellon
University. The institute is a seven-week summer program
for&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students. Minority and female students are targeted
for recruitment into the institute. The primary goal of the institute is to
prepare students for and interest them in pursuing graduate work in applied
mathematics. Secondary goals are to acquaint students with modern application
areas of mathematics and to give them some understanding of the work involved in
studying in these areas at the graduate level. The&lt;br/&gt;institute has
operated successfully since 1994 under this format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US
citizens this year constitute a minority among Mathematics doctoral recipients,
continuing a long-term downward trend. Numbers of women among these are low and
the numbers for African-Americans and Hispanics and Latinos are extremely low
compared to population numbers. Programs such as this may serve to help enhance
these numbers by attracting more students into graduate programs.
