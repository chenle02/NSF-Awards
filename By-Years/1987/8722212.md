The objective of this project is to develop a composite metal membrane for
hydrogen separation/purification at elevated temperatures. The membrane will be
composed of a titanium alloy sandwiched between two thin (about a micron
thickness) films of either palladium or nickel for protection from surface
oxidation of titanium. Earlier experiments showed high fluxes of hydrogen
through the composite membrane at 200oC. In this phase of the project, the
fabrication procedure will be further improved, and the temperature range will
be extended to 500oC. Futhermore, cost analyses will be made to compare this
process and other processes. Current processes are all operating at the room
temperature. Successful development of this membrane would make hydrogen
separation at high temperature possible.
