With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Washington State University will upgrade
a scanning probe microscope (SPM). This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including a) studies on the kinetics of growth of Langmuir-
Blodgett films; b) evaluation of forces at protein surfaces; c) investigations
on the enhanced deposition or dissolution of materials controlled on the
nanoscale by precisely applied stress; and d) measurements of scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and STM based orbital mediated spectroscopy (STM-OMTS) in the
solution and electrochemical environment. Molecular electronic materials such as
porphyrins, phthalocyanines and Langmuir-Blodgett films will be studied with
solution phase STM. The scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to
image atoms directly. The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves
bringing an extremely sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of the sample
surface. The distance is small enough for electrons to leak or tunnel across the
gap and generate a minute current. As the gap between the tip and the sample
increases, the current decreases. As the probe crosses the sample, moving back
and forth across its surface, it traces out a contour map of the sample's
surface atoms. The interdisciplinary studies that will be carried out using this
instrument will have an impact in materials physicsand chemistry and in
biophysical chemistry. The graduate and undergraduate students who will use the
equipment for their research projects will be directly introduced to
nanotechnology.
