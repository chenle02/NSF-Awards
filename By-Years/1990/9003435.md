A conference entitled "Beyond the Standard Model II" will be held at the
University of Oklahoma November 1-3, 1990. This elementary particle physics
conference will include discussion of superstring theory, cosmic strings,
supersymmetry, left-right symmetry, conformal field theory, technicolor,
subquark models, grand unification, quantum gravity, limits on new particles,
and cosmological consequences of new physics. The so-called "standard model" of
elementary particle physics is universally believed to be incomplete, so that
conferences devoted to possible physics beyond the standard model are very
important.
