Computer algebra software packages can compute exact solutions for many
mathematical problems. However, the answers that such software packages return
are often not presented in their simplest form, especially when they involve
algebraic numbers or algebraic functions. The goal of this project is to develop
algorithms that can reduce mathematical expressions to their simplest form. The
focus will be on expressions that involve algebraic numbers or algebraic
functions.

Computer algebra software can be very valuable for research and education.
However, such software often produces large complicated answers. This poses a
difficult problem for the application of computer algebra in education, but also
in research, because it can be difficult to reduce a complicated expression to
its simplest form. Doing such reduction automatically will make computer algebra
systems easier to use.
