9315537 Morari This award of $200,000 is for curriculum development in control
systems. Traditional introductory undergraduate courses in control theory do not
capture the recent developments in research and still tend to be a collection of
tricks without a coherent theme. Moreover, control theory has become very
interdisciplinary and now has no natural home within the traditional engineering
disciplines. Yet because of the increasingly important role that the design of
control into engineered devices and processes that modern advances in computers
and communications is making possible, it is now very important to introduce
modern control theory and techniques to undergraduates. This proposal will
develop modular curricula for two control courses at the senior level, involving
both theory and experimentation. Two experiments that can be run remotely will
be developed for the courses, control in buildings and control of a ducted fan
engine.
