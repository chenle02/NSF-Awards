Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed is to develop quantitative tools
to model fluid flow and magmatism at subduction zones. The focus of the work
will be on the top of the downgoing slab where fluids are released by
metamorphic dehydration reactions, and the mantle wedge where fluids interact
with high temperature solids to form magma. The work will start with 2-D models
and extend to more challenging 3-D models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the modeling infrastructure of
the marine geology and geophysics community and other communities as well. It
will also address the need for the synthesis of geochemical and geophysical
observations as the MARGINS program enters its final stages. Finally, it will
support a full-time post-doc. &lt;br/&gt;
