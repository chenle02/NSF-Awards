This dissertation research seeks to examine techology transfer, using
rationalization theory. The objectives are (1) to examine the role of formal
relations in facilitating industry- university-government interaction, and (2)
to look at the effects of unstructured, informal interactions in technology
transfer. These issues will be addressed using field study techniques --
involving network analysis, surveys, and interviews -- in an area of high
technology research in Japan. The project will contribute to an understanding of
the nature and process of the transfer of technology. xxx
