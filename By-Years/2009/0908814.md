"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."

This award provides funding for a 3 year standard award to support a Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University (ERAU) entitled, "Research Experiences for Teachers:
Aviation and Aerospace", under the direction of Dr. Christopher D. Grant.

This program hosted by the ERAU College of Engineering will provide a 6 week
summer experience for a total of 30 in-service high school science teachers from
local school districts (10 per year for 3 years). These teachers will be given
the opportunity to be actively involved in research that will allow them to
bring knowledge of engineering and technological innovation related to
aviation/aerospace into their classrooms.

The objectives of the program are: 1) Actively involving high school teachers in
engineering research that has an aviation or aerospace focus; 2) Having the
teachers bring knowledge of engineering and technological innovation from the
research lab into their classrooms; 3) Improving the teachers' understanding of
engineering, the engineering design process, and research activities in
universities; 4) Building long-term collaborative partnerships between the
teachers and the ERAU researchers both during the summer and continuing
throughout the academic year; and 5) Helping the teachers translate their
research experiences and new knowledge of engineering into classroom learning
modules disseminated across the participating teachers' districts, high schools
which have joint agreements with ERAU, and the national SECME network of STEM
teachers.
