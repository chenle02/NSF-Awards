*** 96-60393 Gordon This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
Project will explore an improved commercial acoustic sensing system, called
FishMASS, for long-term fish monitoring in the open ocean, estuaries, rivers,
lakes, and streams. Designed on top of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)
technology, FishMASS will collect a wider range of information about fish than
other existing acoustic systems. It will incorporate much of the capability of
existing dual beam and split beam sorters, i.e., individual target strength
measurement, without compromising ADCP normal capabilities. In addition,
FishMASS will add the ability to measure target velocity and target backscatter
spectrum (over one octave in frequency), and it will use broadband signal
processing to improve discrimination of single and multiple targets. It will be
designed for long-term monitoring, i.e., battery operation, internal data
storage, and substantial internal data reduction, but it could easily be adapted
for use on ships. In addition to final, reduced data, FshMASS well provide raw
and intermediate data products to facilitate algorithm development by users.
Commercial applications are expected in fisheries research institutions for
research and to assess fish abundance. FishMASS is expected to supplement and
perhaps replace current methods for surveying fish from ships. ***
