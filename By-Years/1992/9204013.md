The goal of the MISETA (Multi-Instrumented Studies of Equatorial Thermosphere
Aeronomy) initiative is to improve understanding of equatorial thermosphere
aeronomy through studies that combine continuous measurements from a variety of
automatically operating instruments. This project will cover the Imaging Science
Component of the MISETA program. Boston University will construct a copy of its
CEDAR Class-I imager and operate it at Arequipa. Results from the imager will be
analyzed in coordination with other MISETA PI's to insure maximum science yield
from the topics listed above.
