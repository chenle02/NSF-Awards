9317976 Hartnett This research continues investigations into how mycorrhizal
symbioses mediate exchange of nutrients among plants and thereby influence the
structure and dynamics of plant communities. A combination of field studies and
greenhouse experiments examines the mechanisms controlling patterns of nutrient
transfer between plants via mycorrhizal hyphal bridges and the influence of
mycorrhyzae on competition among plants and on plant response to grazing. The
influence of grazing pressure on the activity of mycorrhizal fungi is also
examined. %%% This research is significant in providing new insights into the
role played by associations between mycorrhizal fungi and plants in the
competition for resources among plant species and interactions between plants
and herbivores. The function and structure of communities may be more strongly
influenced by mycorrhizal mutualisms than has been previously thought.
Information from this research could have important applications to
understanding ecosystem function, mineral nutrition of trees and agricultural
plants, and the effect of weeds on cultivated plants. ***
