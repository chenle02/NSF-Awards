Abstract ATM-9423335 Kim, Kwang-Yui Texas A &amp; M University Title: Studies
and Applications of Cyclostationary Imperial Orthogonal Functions This grant is
to develop a new statistical technique utilizing cyclostationary empirical
orthogonal functions to detect and predict forced climate change signals. The
efficacy of this interesting method to measure the strength of even relatively
faint signals is to be tested and evaluated by this grant.
