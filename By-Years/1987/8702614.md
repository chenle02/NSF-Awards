The Xenopus oocyte, after undergoing a prolonged period of growth, remains in a
state of developmental arrest in the ovary. In response to progesterone, the
oocyte resumes meiosis, is released from the surrounding follicle cells, and
becomes a fertilizable egg. This process has been shown by Dr. Robinson not to
invlove an increase in calcium, at least insofar as can be detected by calcium
microelectrodes or aequorin. Using his modified fluorescence microscope and the
calcium indicator fura 2, he propose to probe the cortical region to a depth of
about 10microm. underneath the plasma membrane and determine if there are
increases or decreases in calcium during the maturation process. Dr. Robinson
will also look for gradients of calcium associated with the animal-vegetal axis
of the oocytes. These measurements will be extended to the smaller oocytes that
are in the process of developing and expressing the primary polarity axis. Using
the method of fluorescence polarization, Dr. Robinson will measure membrane
fluidity during maturation induced by steroid and non-steroid agonists, with the
aim of identifying a common mechanism of action. In collaboration with Dr. Susan
Strome, Dr. Robinson will extend the calcium and vibrating probe measurements to
the early development of Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes and zygotes. The
significance of this research lies to two areas. The first is that of the
mechanism of steroid hormone interaction with cells. It has long been thought
that steroid hormones exert their effects directly on the genetic machinery. In
the amphibian oocyte on the other hand, progesterone is known to have its effect
at the surface of the cell, although the nature of the surface-hormone
interaction is unknown. Recently, it has become apparent that a surface effect
is a general feature of steroid hormone action. The second aspect of this work
addresses the important problem of pattern formation.
