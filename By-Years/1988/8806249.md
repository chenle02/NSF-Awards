This project provides resources to procure equipment to support
electromechanical devices research and contact physics research. The equipment
comprises a vibration isolation table, power amplifiers and a signal processing
computer. Two research projects will benefit from the availability of the
equipment. The first is concerned with the development of a vibration control
method for structures which support ultra precise systems (laser mounts, precise
machining systems, navigational gyroscopes, etc). The vibration isolation table
provides a quiescent environment for ultra precise experiments associated with
this project. The method takes advantage of the magnetostrictive properties of
materials made of iron and rare earth metals. The second project focuses on
understanding the tribological phenomenon of thermoelastic instability, whereby
sliding contact between a motor brush and rotor occurs over microscopic surface
bumps (thermal mounds) on the brush face. The mound tends to move over the brush
face in an unknown pattern. The research is directed at predicting this thermal
mound motion. The equipment will also be used for general tribology research
which emphasizes electrical contacts.
