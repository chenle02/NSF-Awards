This research program targets the chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis of sperm
CD52 glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) and glycopeptides, as well as the
intact antigen, and the investigation of the impacts of GPI and Nglycans on the
peptide structure of CD52 using synthetic samples and NMR methods. New synthetic
strategies will be used to prepare the CD52 GPI and glycopeptides in properly
protected forms. Deprotection will afford the free GPI and glycopeptides, while
selective coupling prior to deprotection will afford the intact CD52. Solution
structures of CD52 glycopeptides and antigens will be analyzed by NMR
spectroscopy.

Professor Zhongwu Guo, of the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve
University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
his synthetic and structural studies of sperm CD52 glycopeptides. Sperm CD52,
which belongs to a special group of sugar-containing proteins that are anchored
to cell membranes through molecules known as glycosylphosphatidylinositols
(GPIs), plays a critical role in the human reproduction process. However, the
difficulty to obtain pure forms of sperm CD52 has severely hindered further
detailed studies about this important compound. This project aims at solving the
problem through total synthesis and will advance chemistry by developing new
synthetic methods for GPIs, glycopeptides and GPI-anchored glycopeptides. The
efficient synthesis of these compounds, including specially labeled ones, will
facilitate structural and biological studies. The structural analysis of
synthetic CD52 glycopeptides and antigens will expand the knowledge regarding
the impacts of GPIs on peptide structures, which combined with biological
studies will help understand the structure-activity relationships of sperm CD52.
The results may ultimately facilitate the understanding of the human
reproduction process.
