This project will carry out a novel approach for educating engineering students
in the essentials of analytical chemistry. The course, which has been adopted as
a core offering for one of the largest chemical engineering programs in the
nation, treats analytical chemistry from a global viewpoint and emphasizes the
general aspects of analysis: sampling, separations, data acquisition and data
interpretation. The laboratory portion of the course will use hands-on
experience with chromatographic, spectroscopic, mass spectrometric and flow
injection analysis equipment to illustrate the concepts described in the
lecture. This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) award from the
Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the
Georgia Institute of Technology to acquire gas and liquid chromatography
equipment, spectrophotometers, an ion-trap detector, and flow injection analysis
equipment that will enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction.
