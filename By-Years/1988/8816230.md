The research will examine the coupled thermomechanical behavior of fluid-
infiltrated geologic continua with particular emphasis on nonlinear phenomena.
This investigation will be an extension of previous work on mall deformation
hygrothermal response evaluation of geological media. The governing field
equations and finite element formulations will be developed within a framework
consistent with continuum thermodynamics mixture theory. One-dimensional and
axisymmetric boundary value problems will be initially analyzed for
interpretation of coupled mechanisms, model calibration, and assumption
refinement. Particular attention will be devoted to the characterization of
critically stressed zones using recently developed strain or stress based
continuum damage models. Subsequently, advanced two-dimensional problems with
applications in nuclear waste isolation and hydraulic fracturing will be
investigated.
