In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor George W. Flynn of Columbia University will continue his
investigations on the energy transfer and quenching in highly vibrationally
excited molecules at the microscopic, quantum state-resolved level. Using diode
laser techniques developed by him, Prof. Flynn will study collisional reactions
on a time scale of the duration of a single collision, these involving the
vibrational and rotational, as well as translational degrees of freedom. Among
the specific problems to be attacked are the determination of the
characteristics of the donor molecules that lead to supercollisions, i.e.,
collisions in which large amounts of vibrational energy are transferred; of the
changes in angular momentum which occur in these processes; and how the mass and
other properties of the acceptor molecules affect the energy transfer. Also to
be investigated are the quenching of electronically excited molecules, hot atom
collisions and chemical reaction processes. Among the outstanding problems in
contemporary physical chemistry are the details of chemical reaction processes.
To this end it is necessary to investigate how molecules excited to high
vibrational and rotational energies behave when they undergo collisions with
other molecules. Since reacting molecules usually follow one of several possible
reactions paths that lead to different reaction products, a detailed
understanding of the transfer of vibrational, rotational, and translational
energies among the collision partners and the reaction products is desirable,
and necessary, in order to develop theoretical models that can lead to the
control of reactions so as to yield a desired product with maximum yield. Not
only do such studies yield data which can be compared conveniently to
theoretical calculations, they also provide rather definite evidence for the
mechanism or forces which control reaction processes. In addition, much of the
experimental data to be obtained will be of practical interest in the study and
control of unimolecular and bimolecular chemical reactions and photochemistry.
These processes are of importance in the development of advanced materials and
processing techniques necessary for improved microelectronic devices, the
development of new, more efficient laser devices, and in the development of an
improved understanding of atmospheric chemical reactions and environmentally
important chemistry.
