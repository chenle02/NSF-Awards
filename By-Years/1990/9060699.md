This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an
opportunity for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to
participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to
select promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality
research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the
conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. This is a Phase I project. Local area networks based on
the new international ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) standard will provide
high-speed multi-media (data, audio and video) communication over the same
network. These networks will require fast packet switches that can switch the
very small packets specified by the ATM standard. Fore Systems is researching
interconnection of multiple fast packet switches in an arbitrary topology to
build an ATM-based local area network capable of supporting hundreds or
thousands of attached computers.
