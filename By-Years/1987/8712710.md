Cornell University Title: Theoretical Studies on Ionospheric Irregularities in
the Magnetosphere Theoretical plasma physics is currently a very active research
field due in part to the large investments by the U.S. Government in fusion
research and energy resource development. Many of the theoretical tools used to
study the instabilities and turbulent behavior in fusion research have direct
application problems on the ionospheric scene and the large research effort in
theoretical plasma physics has served to accelerate interest, both theoretical
and experimental, in ionospheric turbulence. This activity serves to improve our
basic understanding of both plasma physics and ionospheric physics, and to
provide a firm theoretical and observational base for solving applied problems
dealing with radiocommunications, navigation and other technology problems. This
research project involves theoretical procedures to explain certain plasma
physics phenomena such as instabilities in the ionosphere above 200km and in the
high latitude auroral region. The PI is very much involved in both the fusion
and ionospheric research communities and as such is an important element in the
interchange of ideas between the two groups. This has been beneficial to both in
the past and is expected to continue. The PI is an acknowledged leader in these
fields and has had outstanding success in applying modern computational
techniques to the solution of ionospheric problems. He is held in high esteem by
his colleagues and has helped produce well trained graduate students in these
fields.
