Calcium, an important substance for cell activity, is relatively abundant
outside cells, but is kept at low level inside cells. In nerve cells, the
movement of calcium into the cell triggers a number of important processes. The
most well known of these calcium-regulated processes is the release of
neurotransmitters, chemical messengers which allow nerve cells to communicate
with other nerve cells or to control muscle activity. However, calcium entry may
also play a role in the growth of nerve cells, and may activate the types of
long lasting changes in cell properties thought to underlie learning and memory.
Because of its many important roles, calcium entry into the nerve cell is
tightly regulated. The goal of this research is to characterize a novel
mechanism for regulating calcium into nerve cells. This mechanism differs in
important ways from previously described mechanisms of calcium entry, because it
could allow calcium to enter nerve cells in the absence of nerve activity. The
study will investigate the possible role of this calcium entry mechanism in
regulating the outgrowth of axons and dendrites, extensions from the nerve cell
body. A knowledge of this growth process is important in understanding normal
and abnormal brain development and nerve regeneration following trauma.
