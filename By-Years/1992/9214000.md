Alfven waves are ubiquitous in space plasmas and their signatures have been
observed by many spacecraft under a variety of conditions. A large amount of
theoretical work and computer simulations deal with them directly or indirectly
although there have been a disproportionately small amount of laboratory
experiments in this area. The reason for this is the lack of laboratory plasma
sources in which clean, and detailed studies of these waves can be performed.
Recently, a machine has been constructed at UCLA which features a 10m long, 50
cm diameter plasma column. The machine can be operated in a regime of moderate
density, highly ionized (99%) He or H plasmas in a uniform axial field of up to
2.5 kG. We propose a series of experiments to verify that we can launch and
detect Alfven waves, and then diagnose them with a sate-of-the-art data
collection and visualization system.
