The design of systolic arrays for implementing Affine Recurrence Equations is
being carried out. The goals of this research are (a) the design of an automated
system for generating systolic architectures from Affine Recurrence Equations
and for interfacing with existing VLSI layout tools; (b) the synthesis of
systolic arrays that allows the design of complicated systolic arrays consisting
of a number of sub- arrays in cascade. New systolic architectures can be
designed using the theory developed. The system designed also serves as a
testbed for the new theory. Systolic arrays are an important class of parallel
architectures that have shown great promise for exploiting the advances in VLSI
technology. Since they are problem specific, the development of automated tools
for synthesizing them from high-level specifications is very important. This
research is directed towards Affine Recurrence Equations, which covers a general
class of practical problems. The principal investigator is a new Ph.D. who
already has significant progress in his research. The research focuses on
important and timely topics. Support is highly recommended.
