The aim of this research project is to determine the cellular and molecular
events that underlie the guidance of axons within the developing mammalian
central nervous system. Dr Dodd has identified an intermediate target in the
trajectory of a class of commissural neurons that appears to play a pivotal role
in their guidance within the embryonic rat spinal cord. This structure, termed
the floor plate, consists of a set of specialized epithelial cells. Although
intermediate targets have been described in invertebrates they have not
previously been observed in vertebrates. The effects of the floor plate on the
morphology of commissural growth cones will be examined. In an EM study, floor
plate.commissural growth cone contacts for morphological evidence of cellular
communication through specialized junctions will be examined. In addition, the
surface properties of floor plate cells will be characterized using
immunochemical methods and the function of these molecules in floor plate/growth
cone adhesive interactions that may be important for guidance at the midline
will be examined. Many of the mechanisms that have been hypothesized to account
for pathfinding by developing axons as they extend towards their final targets
are based on experiments performed in invertebrates or in the peripheral nervous
system of vertebrates. The studies described here will provide new information
about the guidance of developing axons within the mammalian central nervous
system and already suggest emerging parallels in the strategies and mechanisms
by which neuronal projections are established in vertebrates and invertebrates.
