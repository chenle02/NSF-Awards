Queueing networks with blocking frequently arise in performance studies of
computer systems, distributed systems, and communication systems. Despite their
potential applicability, their use is not widespread. This is mainly due to the
absence of comprehensive tools for analyzing such systems. This research aims at
rectifying this situation by developing algorithms for the analysis of multi-
class queueing networks with blocking. So far, such multi-class queueing
networks have not been studied in the open literature. In order to achieve this
objective, small configurations will be analyzed first. These configurations
will be in the form of merge, split, and tandem multi-class queueing networks
with blocking. The results and experience obtained from the analysis of these
configurations will then be consolidated in order to obtain solution techniques
for arbitrary configurations. Finally, these solution techniques will be
incorporated into existing algorithms for general queueing networks, in order to
further increase their usefulness.
