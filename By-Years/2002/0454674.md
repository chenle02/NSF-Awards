Funds are provided to acquire a comprehensive dataset of ice cover morphological
and optical properties across the Arctic Basin during summer melt and early fall
freezeup. This dataset will be a valuable asset for assessing the state of the
ice cover, evaluating sea ice models, and interpreting remote sensing data. The
specific science objectives of the project include (i) statistically
characterizing the morphological and optical properties of the summer ice cover
across the Arctic basin, including ice concentration, ice thickness, melt pond
coverage, snow depth, ice physical properties, and sediment load, (ii)
determining the partitioning of solar radiation between reflection to the
atmosphere, absorption within the ice, and transmission to the ocean for summer
and early autumn ice conditions, and (iii) archiving and widely disseminating
this dataset. The field plan includes on-ice measurements on individual floes
and helicopter-based aerial surveys. The on-ice observations will consist of
surveys and point measurements of sea ice morphology and optics. The morphology
component will include measurements of melt pond area and profiles of ice
thickness, topography, and pond and snow depth. The optical observations will
consist of spectral albedos, transmittances, and vertical profiles of in-ice
irradiance. Helicopter photographic survey flights determining the relative
areas of ice, ponds, and leads will extend the surface-based measurements to
larger scales. Deployment of 2-3 autonomous ice mass balance buoys, with a
three-year life expectancy, will add a temporal component to the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is evidence that the partitioning of solar
radiation has changed in recent decades. The data from this project will assist
in understanding the nature of this change and how it affects the climate
dynamics of the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;
