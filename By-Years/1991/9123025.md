This award is for support of a two year program to study the air- snow exchange
processes controlling the uptake, release, and incorporation of reactive gases
into polar firn. The concentrations of two reactive species, hydrogen peroxide
and formaldehyde, in air above and below the snow surface, will be measured and
the equilibria and kinetics of the absorption, and release of these gases at the
ice-air interface will be studied. A mathematical model to describe gas-snow
interactions will be developed, calibrated and validated using field data
obtained at Summit, Greenland.
