9314326 Smith The Center for High Resolution Electron Microscopy (CHREM)
provides state-of-the-art instrumentation and techniques for use by the
scientific community. Research carried out by users of CHREM involves detailed
investigations of many types of materials. The CHREM facilities offers a variety
of specialized electron microscopes for use, in particular, two specialized
ultrahigh vacuum electron microscopes are available for tackling key problems in
surface science, thin film growth, and solid state reactions. The unique
capabilities of the UHV electron microscopes are of particular interest to those
scientists who pursue their ongoing research at high spatial resolution, and
electron microscopists who study surfaces under cleaner vacuum conditions. ***
