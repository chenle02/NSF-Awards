The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will synthesize
novel slurries for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) of low dielectric
constant (K) materials. Standard abrasives such as silica and alumina lead to
significant scratching, indenting and delamination of the soft low K surface. In
this project it is proposed to use nanoporous silica based slurries in which the
hardness of the particle can be controlled. In the project, synthesis of
nanoporous silica particles will first be carried out followed by
charcterization; next will be development of the slurry formulation followed by
charcterization and finally testing against the specific needs of the CMP
application.

Commercially, these slurries are expected to reduce surface defects and enhance
slurry stability. It is expected that major electronic manufacturing companies
will use this new type of slurry. Wafer level experiments are already planned on
patterned wafers in collaboration with key industrial partners.
