This project is an investigation of the dynamics of flux-flow in high-Tc
superconducting materials which are of technological and fundamental interest.
Several methods will be employed to study the behavior of flux-flow. The primary
method is the use of a SQUID magnetometer to measure directly the flux-line
movement, which signals the onset of flux-flow. By studying the behavior of
flux-flow, information about pinning centers and the static structure of the
flux lattice can be obtained. In addition, the characteristics of flux-flow
noise, important for device applications, will be investigated.
