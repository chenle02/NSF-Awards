The principal investigators will study problems of stabilization and optimal
control of linear partial differential equations. These problems are physically
meaningful and are mathematically relevant. They also will examine extensions of
existing stabilization results to cover mildly nonlinear systems. Control theory
deals with the theoretical aspects of understanding how complex systems modelled
as algebraic or differential systems learn about its environment, process the
information to reduce uncertainty, plan, generate and execute control actions.
It has played a major role in many areas of science and engineering.
