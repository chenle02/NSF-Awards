9217434 Matsudaira A mass spectrometer will be used primarily by groups involved
in protein sequencing and peptide synthesis that currently use outside
facilities for mass analysis and by the mouse genome project for developing
methods for mapping DNA fragments. Laser desorption is a far superior technique
for detecting, resolving, and determining the mass of a molecule. Ionization of
the sample by laser desorption has many advantages over ionization by fast atom
bombardment, plasma desorption, electrospray, or thermospray methods. The
Lasermat routinely provides masses in the range 1,000 - 100,000 from < 1 pmol of
proteins and peptides. The accuracy of the mass observed mass is sample
dependent but is generally within 0.1% at a mass of 30,000. The instrument is
operated through easy-to-use software on a personal computer which controls data
collection and analysis. The software simplifies the training of unspecialized
researchers in the operation of the instrument and eliminates the need for a
specialist in mass spectrometry to operate the instrument and analyze the
spectra.
