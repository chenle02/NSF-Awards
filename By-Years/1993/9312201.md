9312201 Kolawa Silicon carbide is an attractive material for high-temperature,
high power, and high frequency electronic devices. It is also used in fiber-
reinforced metal-matrix composites. For both electrical and composite
applications, the reaction between the metal and silicon carbide and the
resulting interfacial structure is of great concern. The reactions between thin
metal films and SiC will be studied to provide the basis of facts and
understanding that is necessary for the judicious choice of metal-SiC contact
for SiC electronic devices. The reaction products, their evolution in time and
with temperature, as well as their microstructure, will be studied using mainly
backscattering spectrometry, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron
microscopy. The I(V), C(V), and contact resistivity measurements will be used to
characterize a contact electrically. Complete electrical contacts with a
diffusion barriers included for stability will be developed and tested.
Adhesion, fracture, toughness and stress will be measured to characterize
mechanical properties of the reacted layers and their interface with SiC
substrate. The proposed research will greatly benefit both electrical and metal-
matrix composite applications. ***
