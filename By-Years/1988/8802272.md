On 11-15 July, 1988 in Manchester, England, the History of Science Society
(HSS) and the British Society for the History of Science (BSHS) will be holding
the first-ever joint meeting of the two organizations. Many of the papers
presented during the three-day meeting will focus on Anglo-American relations in
the history of science and technology, although the meeting will include
presentations on a wide range of topics from the Renaissance to the present. The
program, as currently taking shape, will feature 18 specially organized morning
sessions in which the papers will be precirculated to allow for maximum
discussion. Afternoons will be devoted to a dozen or so thematic sessions and
various work-in-progress papers. It is anticipated that at least 75 North
Americans will be on the program (with an equal number representing the BSHS).
Of this group, roughly 70% are regularly employed in academic and research
institutions, 25% are graduate students, and 5% are unaffiliated. Approximately
two-thirds are men, one-third are women. This grant will assist 25 US
participants in this meeting with their roundtrip air fare on a US flag carrier.
