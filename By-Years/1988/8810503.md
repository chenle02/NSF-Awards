The research is the process of patent examination. The computer tool to be
called PatentAid, will greatly expedite the process of evaluation of the novelty
and obviousness of patent claims as ruled by U.S.C. 102 and U.S.C. 103. Once the
theoretical basis is refined and formalized, the resulting implementation of
PatentAid can be progressively extended by addition of new device
classifications to the hierarchy of the knowledge based design library.
