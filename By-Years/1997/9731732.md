9731732 Ustach This award to Duke University will provide instrumentation for
oceanographic research for use on R/V Cape Hatteras, a research vessel operated
by the Duke-University of North Carolina Consortium as part of the University-
National Oceanographic laboratory System research fleet. Specific instruments to
be acquired include fluorometer, altimeter and transmissometer sensors for use
with the CTD system for measuring sea water properties, Niskin bottles for
sampling water, tube holders for use with the multi-corer bottom sampler, a
debubbler for use in the underway water analysis system, and a gravity corer for
bottom sampling. The shared- use instrumentation supported here will assist
marine scientists conduct studies from R/V Cape Hatteras in the western Atlantic
Ocean, principally along the central Atlantic cost of the United States, in the
1998 and in future years.
