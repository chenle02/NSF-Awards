With NSF support, Fisk University proposed second phase CREST Center for Physics
and Chemistry of Materials (CPCoM) will primarily establish a sustainable
program that integrates high-quality science education with state-of-the-art
research and develop it over the course of CREST support into an internationally
recognized research center in the area of physics and chemistry of advanced
materials. Education of undergraduates and graduates will be a vital component
of the Center. The major objectives of the CREST-CPCoM Center are to continue
establishing a world-class research center for the study of electronic and
optical materials and related technologies. The research focus of the proposed
Center for Physics and Chemistry of Materials is in the study of advanced
materials, novel processing methods, new properties and phenomena while enabling
new devices for science, industry, energy, environment, and medicine. Phenomena
and their applications will focus on detection, emission and modulation of
electromagnetic radiation based on selected electronic and optical materials in
the form of crystals, nanomaterials, amorphous materials and glasses, glass-
ceramics and thin films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include dramatic
increases in the production of well prepared members of underrepresented groups
(primarily Afro-American and/or female) with Masters and PhDs at CPCoM and its
partners through rich interdisciplinary interactions and cross-fertilizations of
ideas among the faculty and students in the discovery and study of novel
materials and creating breakthroughs based&lt;br/&gt;on scientific and
technological excellence.
