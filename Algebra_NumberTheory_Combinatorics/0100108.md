The principal investigators conduct research in the following areas: global
geometric Langlands correspondence, local Langlands correspondence in the de
Rham setting, conformal field theories related to Hecke chiral algebras,
families of Tate spaces and related infinite-dimensional algebraic varieties.
They explore analogs of the local Langlands correspondence in the de Rham
setting relating representations of Kac-Moody affine algebras with de Rham local
systems for the Langlands dual group on the formal punctured disc. They study
the representation theory of chiral Hecke algebras and related global non-
rational conformal field theories in which the correlator D-modules form Hecke
eigensheaves in order to understand the global geometric Langlands
correspondence in the de Rham setting. They construct and study the universal
family of Langalnds transforms of GL(2) local systems. They study the algebraic
geometry of infinite-dimensional algebraic varieties similar to the space of
maps from the punctured formal disk to a smooth algebraic variety.

The subject of the research lies on the intersection of several domains of
modern mathematics and mathematical physics - the Langlands program, geometric
representation theory, infinite- dimensional algebraic geometry, and conformal
field theory. The blend of complementary ideas and methods is very fruitful - in
particular, it leads to construction of a geometric version of Hecke eigenforms
by means of an appropriate quantum field theory.
