NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and require a plan to broaden
participation of groups under-represented in science and engineering. The
fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the
future. This fellowship to C. Marisa Tellez supports research and training in
predicting the health status of aquatic ecosystems by studying crocodilian top
predators and their parasites. The host institution is the University of
California, Santa Barbara under the sponsorship of Dr. Armand Kuris. The lack of
data on community diversity of crocodilian habitats hinders the ability of
conservation managers to properly assess how anthropogenic disturbances affect
wildlife. Training objectives include techniques in community ecology,
biochemistry, and parasitology in order to assay biological indicators.

The research examines the significance of parasites as biodiversity and health
indicators of crocodilian habitats. First, the study determines if parasite
species richness correlates with biodiversity. Second, heavy metal analyses of
hosts and parasites, representing three different trophic levels, are being used
to evaluate human impact. Analyzing pollutant levels in both hosts and parasites
is a novel approach to assess anthropogenic impact. This may provide a more
advantageous indicator of ecosystem functioning, and of environmental quality,
than is presently available. Overall, the proposed analyses foster novel
theories and ideals about the function of community interactions, energy flow
and food web relationships in tropical systems.
