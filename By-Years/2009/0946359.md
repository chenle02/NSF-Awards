As part of the Arctic High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) program, the
investigators have developed a web portal to disseminate HSRL data, and this
portal is designed to reduce overhead tasks that most users encounter in
accessing data. These web-based tools give a user considerable flexibility in
manipulating data, retrieving the latest version of data or data product,
combining the data with other data types including satellite imagery, and
generating publication-quality graphics directly fro the archive. In this
project, this set of tools will be extended and adapted to incorporate a wide
variety of geophysical data types, considerably beyond HSRL, and this extended
framework will be deployed at NCAR for access by the climate science community.
The framework will be open source, and will be flexible with respect to common
scientific programming languages and commonly used data formats. Broader impacts
involve the ability to foster additional interdisciplinary scientific
collaboration in the climate sciences through more transparent access to many
complex data types from sophisticated instruments.
