9311559 Ahlfeld This is an award to support research, the objective of which is
to evaluate a numerical method for the design of hydraulic controls that affect
the movement of contaminated groundwater during procedures to isolate, contain
or decontaminate the water. The method proposed consists of a computationally
efficient approach to combining simulation of both groundwater flow and
contaminant transport with optimization techniques. The novel feature of the
approach the investigator is taking lies in the use of an iterative scheme in
which the computationally-easy hydraulic control problem is solved repeatedly
and at each iteration, the constraints of the hydraulic model are modified by
feedback information provided by solution of the contaminant transport model.
Significantly large amounts of financial and human resources are being used to
address the decontamination of groundwater resulting from indiscriminate
placement of contaminants in landfills. This research is expected to provide a
more efficient way of designing field systems for decontamination of
contaminated groundwater aquifers than is now possible using current computing
technology. ***
