This proposal is about several topics in arithmetic geometry. Riemann Roch
formulas for coherent Euler characteristics will be studied, with applications
to Iwasawa theory and capacity theory. The proposal also has to do with
quadratic invariants of coherent sheaves and of unit groups. Various methods
from number theory and algebraic geometry will be used to show that arithmetic
groups can be generated by elements of small height or by subgroups of small
rank. Finally, the inverse problem for deformation rings will be considered, as
well as the liftability of group actions on curves in positive characteristic.

This proposal is about symmetry and its applications in number theory and
arithmetic geometry. The exploitation of symmetry to understand the solutions of
equations and the geometry of objects has been a basic theme in mathematics. In
this proposal, symmetry will be used to show that complicated algebraic systems
arising from number theory and geometry can in many cases be described in simple
and compact ways. Symmetries will also be used to distinguish when such systems
are fundamentally different from one another and when they can or cannot be
extended beyond their original scope.
