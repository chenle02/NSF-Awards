This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 Project is to investigate the
technical feasibility for harvesting natural carotenoids from the marine algae,
"Dunaliella salina". Due to the high capital and operating costs associated with
existing technologies, the current price of natural beta-carotene is about twice
that of the synthetic variety. By enabling the commercial production of natural
beta-carotene at a cost&lt;br/&gt;closer to that of the synthetic product, this
research is expected to lead to a significant growth of the "natural beta-
carotene" market. The specific objective of the Phase I research is to determine
the feasibility of a low-cost method to harvest the above mentioned marine algae
from the growth medium and to extract the beta-carotene from this algae. The
technology to be developed in this project could also be used to harvest and to
purify other carotenoids from the algae.&lt;br/&gt; The commercial application
of this project will be in the beta-carotene market. Beta-carotene is currently
used for a wide range of applications : as a nutritional supplement, as an agent
for food fortification, as an animal feed, and as a food colorant.
