This project involves supporting students to attend the ACM Sigmetrics
conference to be held in London, UK in June 2012. Sigmetrics is the premier
conference in the area of performance modeling and it is important to expose
students to this conference, particularly in an environment where students tend
to shy away from mathematical modeling. The students will be chosen based on a
open competition and preference will be given to students who don't have any
existing support or belong to underrepresented groups
