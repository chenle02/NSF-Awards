ABSTRACT P.I. Jon Marks, Ken Kidd, Amos Dienard SBR-9315871 Recent advances in
the field of molecular genetics are being used to investigate the evolutionary
relationships between humans and apes and other primates. However, most such
phylogenetic analyses have used single individuals of ape species to represent
the entire species, and the resulting phyolgenies, given the genetic closeness
of the different species, could be seriously distorted by specific variation
within any of the species involved. Genetic variation within species is more
extensive than formerly imagined, and is the focus of much developing work in
this area. This dissertation research will directly address the question of both
population variation and phylogeny by a direct analysis of variation at five
selected genes in the nuclear genome. It will yield us a very good idea of the
extent of genetic variation within and among chimpanzee species, and offer a
comparison with the variation in humans (there are some indicaitons that more
variety exists among a single chimp species of small numbers and occupying a
small area than among all humans - if true, a remarkable finding on the
homogeneity of humans). Also, the work will provide a useful base from which to
plan future breeding of captive colonies. *** P\anthro\jfried\9315871.abs &lt;
