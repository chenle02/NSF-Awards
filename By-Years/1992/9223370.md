Research will be carried out on a diverse series of topics in theoretical
astrophysics. Mass Distributions in galaxies, the formation of structure in the
universe, the physical properties of Active Galactic Nuclei, models of the
regions surrounding these nuclei, and phenomena associated with neutron stars
will be among the topics studied. The Principal Investigator is regarded as an
outstanding theoretical astrophysicist.
