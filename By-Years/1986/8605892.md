Wood is an important engineering material whose use exceeds all other
construction materials. It constitutes an economic base on which many state
economics depend. Yet only recently has it been recognized as an engineering
material. Partial support is provided for an International Conference on Wood
Engineering to be held in Seattle, Washington in the fall of l988. The
objectives of the conference are: establish current world state-of-the-art,
provide exposure of the U.S. industry to potential world market, provide forum
for the exchange of views on research, hold discussions on future research
thrusts through panel discussions, and publish proceedings that will be of
assistance to research planning and development.
