Extending virtualization technology into high-performance, cluster platforms
generates exciting new possibilities. However, I/O efficiency in virtualized
environments, specifically with respect to disk I/O, remains little understood
and hardly tested. The objective of this research is to investigate fundamental
techniques for virtual clusters that not only facilitate rigorous performance
studies, but also identify places where performance is suffering and then
optimize the system to lessen the impact of such bottlenecks. &lt;br/&gt;This
research will greatly contribute to understanding virtualized I/O, identifying
I/O bottlenecks and optimizing I/O, and thus facilitate the cluster systems to
most effectively utilize virtualization technology. This project will also
contribute to the society through promoting research and engaging under-
represented groups that leads students to advancing their careers in science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
