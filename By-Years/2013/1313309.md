Understanding the cosmic history of star formation is one of the fundamental
goals in contemporary astronomy. Much of the light produced by star formation
over cosmic time is obscured by dust and reradiated at far-infrared (FIR)
wavelengths. For redshifts > 1, this light may be detected as submillimeter
(submm) galaxies. Unfortunately, current studies of dust-obscured, star-forming
galaxies at these distances are limited by confusion and blending, which
prevents us from studying the dominant populations that produce the FIR
extragalactic background light. In order to address this concern, the PIs will
use the new SCUBA-2 submm camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at 450
microns (and simultaneously at 850 microns) to obtain high-resolution
observations of submm galaxies.

This work will signi&#64257;cantly expand our understanding of the submm
universe and the history of dusty star formation. The research team will also
work with graduate students to develop a science activity for high school
students that will teach them about dust in galaxies. Finally, the PIs will
train graduate students in submm and radio astronomy, the facilities for which
the U.S. has made significant investments.
