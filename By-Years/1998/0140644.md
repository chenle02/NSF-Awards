0140644&lt;br/&gt;Wysocki&lt;br/&gt;This award provided support for a workshop
entitled "Analytical Instrumentation for the New Millennium - Biological
Sciences" to be held Dec 2-5, 2001 in Tucson, Arizona. The workshop will bring
together scientists with broad interests in biological measurements, including
both the biologists who need the measurements and the instrument developers who
design and build instrumentation. The format of the workshop will include
highlight presentations by cutting-edge researchers who will conclude with a
brief description of goals for the future and the major obstacles to be faced in
meeting those goals. These presentations will be followed by breakout sessions
to critique/evaluate the proposed goals and obstacles. The expected outcomes of
the workshop are a report to be written jointly by the breakout leaders and
organizers and presentations to be made at national meetings. This workshop is
jointly supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate
for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
