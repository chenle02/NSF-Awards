Proposal: DMS-9870027 Principal Investigator: Nigel J. Kalton Abstract: The aim
of this proposal is to study a number of problems related to the notion of an
extension of one Banach space by another, and the relationships between
extensions and unconditional structure. It is proposed to attempt to resolve the
conjecture that if every minimal extension of a Banach space is trivial then the
space has finite cotype, and to attempt a classification of those spaces so that
every extension by a Hilbert space is trivial. Both these problems can be
reformulated in other terms and would have considerable significance independent
of the theory of extensions. The proposer will also work on the fundamental
problem in the theory of unconditional structure of whether every complemented
subspace of a Banach space with unconditional basis also has an unconditional
basis. The theory of extensions can be considered in the following terms.
Suppose we are given a centrally symmetric solid in three or more dimensions and
we are allowed only to compute its cross-section by a slice in some directions
and the shadow cast by the body in the perpendicular directions. This allows us
to compute certain information about the solid, but not to reconstruct it
completely. The aim of this project is to obtain more complete information about
the body under certain additional conditions. It turns out that many questions
of importance in mathematical analysis and applications, although not expressed
in this form, can be visualized as problems of this nature, perhaps involving
infinite dimensions. An unconditional basis in a particular class of functions
is a collection of relatively simple functions with which we can approximate
every member of the class; such approximations are very important for many
practical situations, for example in engineering applications. One of the aims
of this project is to decide general conditions under w hich a basis can be
constructed. There is interaction between the theory of extensions and of
unconditional bases which this project will explore further.
