This SBIR Phase I research project will develop an innovative carbon nanotube
water filtration membrane technology that will drastically outperform
conventional filtration membranes. This project aims to improve performance by
fabricating an ultra-high flux carbon nanotube filtration membrane through a
solution-based material preparation technology. The goal of the carbon nanotube
filtration membrane is to provide ultra-high flux output, yet at low energy
consumption, which is currently unavailable.

If the carbon nanotube water filtration membrane is successfully developed it
will change the landscape for the water purification industry. The desired
performance improvement would significantly surpass the evolutionary progress
that has characterized the membrane industry over the past four decades. The
adoption of this novel ultra-high flux carbon nanotube membrane would have
profound impact on industries such as water purification, medical, chemical,
pharmaceuticals, food processing, and environmental remediation.
