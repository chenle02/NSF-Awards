Carbon has two stable forms, 12C and 13C. Both forms are used in photosynthesis,
but plants have a slight preference for 12C, so plants are ENRICHED in 12C
compared with atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, the degree of enrichment indicates
variations in plant physiology. This knowledge has long been used to study
physiology of individual plants; our study applies these concepts to studies of
WHOLE ECOSYSTEMS. By sampling air at night at the mouth of small, well-defined
watersheds, and analyzing carbon isotopes in respired CO2, we believe we can
monitor the physiological responses of the ecosystems within the watersheds to
environmental change. We will test this concept in two small watersheds, and
will also design and test equipment to automatically sample air for the isotope
analyses. At least two undergraduates will be involved in this study each field
season.
