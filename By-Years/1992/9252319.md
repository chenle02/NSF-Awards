The project aim is to extend and refine an innovative and promising application
of intelligent tutoring systems developed collaboratively by the University of
Pittsburgh's Economics Department and Learning Research and Development Center.
The methodology is a pioneering attempt at teaching major portions of the
introductory microeconomics syllabus as a laboratory science. The direction
taken is likely to serve as a model for economics departments at other schools,
given the way it addresses a pervasive dissatisfaction with the current methods
of teaching beginning economics courses. An important feature of the project is
the vast amount of data which it will gather on student learning difficulties at
the University of Pittsburgh and other college and universities. Results derived
from this project should reinvigorate what has been a declining interest over
the past several years in instructional research on the post-secondary teaching
of economics.
