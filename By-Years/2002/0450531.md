This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project aims to
develop a high-density optical disk storage prototype based on a new coding
concept that will result in the prototype development of a compact packaged
high-density optical disk storage system that is back compatible with current
optical disk. Using such coding concept can significantly increase the disk data
storage density and data access rate based on a modification of existing optical
disk recording/readout hardware architecture. The new high density disk drive
allows back compatibility with the current DVD disk and has advantage of easier
market acceptance for product roll out than other developing storage
technologies such as holographic and near field storages. The near term
objective is to achieve 50 GB/disk capacity and more than 100 GB/disk is the
next foreseeable product goal.

If successful, the outcome of this project will enhance the availability of
high-density low cost storage for many social applications, increasing US based
data storage technologies, and increasing US jobs. It will have extensive
commercial and military applications such as computer data storage, on-line
storage, library archival applications, image storage, and processing for
medical applications, and military target identification and fast access to
large intelligent databases. Educational impacts include advancing library
archive storage for educational uses and benefiting university research in
astronomy, meteorology and others that require huge data storage.
