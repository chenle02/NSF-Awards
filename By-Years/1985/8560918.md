Research is underway to provide for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) during the
design of the product. If a computer-aided design (CAD) system and models of
nondestructive tests can be integrated, then a part can be designed for
nondestructive testing. CAD systems that model objects as solids (as opposed to
those that model only the surface of an object) must be used in order to capture
the features of parts that are critical for nondestructive evaluation. In
addition, the model must include information about the material, finish, etc. of
the object. Researchers will work on developing models of nondestructive
evaluation using radiation and ultrasound. The thrust of the research will be in
determining the critical physical, phoenomena that must be included in the solid
model so that nondestructive tests can be simulated and in determining the type
of solid model that is best suited for inclusion of nondestructive testing
models.
