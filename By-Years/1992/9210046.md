The optics of the eye focus an image of the world onto the retina which
contains four types of photoreceptors: blue, green and red cones and a single
type of rod. Experiments are being conducted to learn how the signals from the
three cone photoreceptor types of the retina are organized and how the
information about color is organized and processed by the early stages of the
visual system. Conventional wisdom holds that information from photoreceptors is
transmitted by two main visual pathways in the brain: one is sluggish and
transmits information about color; the other is rapid and transmits information
about intensity. The specific studies being conducted in this research project
use flickering light of different colors and flicker interactions to address
specific questions about the nature of these two visual pathways, as well as how
their signals change when the visual system adapts to increasingly intense
lights. This research is providing clear evidence that the early stages of the
visual system are more complex than the prevailing psychophysical models
suggest.
