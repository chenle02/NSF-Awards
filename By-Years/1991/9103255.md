This proposal requests funds for a microscope and image analysis system that
will allow analysis of a wide variety of images from many different biological
system. The microscope is an old but very powerful instrument for the study of
living organisms. Few other biological tools allow subcellular structures, whole
cells, or even small organisms to be studied in an aqueous environment,
frequently in a living state. New probes for cells structure and function such
as fluorescently labelled antibodies, DNA probes, and calcium and pH dependent
fluorophores provide even more powerful implements for exploring cells. The
computer in combination with the microscope has proven to be a particularly
powerful means for acquiring and analyzing data from images. The research
projects described in this proposal encompass a variety of biological systems
including plant-virus interactions, cyanobacterial development, nerve
regeneration, optical pathways, leech development, and wasp evolution. These
projects share a need for a system to acquire, enhance, and analyze images.
