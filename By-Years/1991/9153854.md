This curriculum development project proposal comes from a partnership
comprising the Rocheste City School District, Eastman Kodak Company, Edunetics
Corporation, and the University of Rochester. Envisioned is a curriculum,
assisted by a totally integrated computer-based delivery system that includes
the following features: (a) current, comprehensive information in each
discipline which can be readily updated electronically; (b) current practical
applications of key concepts from basic science and mathematics; (c) flexible
sequencing of content matter, with coordinated activities and hands-on
materials; (d) remedial and accelerated stands within the instructional program.
All major components will be field tested in both urban and suburban locations
throughout the United States. The Foundation's support for this 3-year project
represents approximately 40% of total project costs.
