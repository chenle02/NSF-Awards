This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop a force
sensitive solution for touch applications that will overcome the technical
shortcomings of currently available technologies. The design utilizes the
sensitivity, size, and cost advantages of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
in a novel configuration to prevent overloading of the sensor for large applied
forces. The solution will enable truly force sensitive touch that is low cost
and highly sensitive. It will be operable with any object, including
fingernails, gloves, and styluses, while not being susceptible to environmental
factors that hinder current capacitive technologies, such as dirt and
moisture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project is pertinent to a wide array of applications, including force sensitive
buttons for consumer electronics, automotive controls, and force sensitive
displays for fixed and mobile devices. Two decades ago, touch technology was
primarily found within ATMs and point-of-sale systems. More recently, the
technology migrated to other electronic industry verticals, including one of the
largest and certainly the fastest growing ? smartphones and tablet PCs. Consumer
demand is driving an explosion of applications in every vertical. There is
increasing demand for low cost, low power, more feature rich touch solutions. In
addition, new user experience benefits such as force sensitivity are constantly
being pursued, yet there is no viable solution yet on the market. Such a
technology would be poised to capture significant market share from existing
technologies in all of these relevant verticals.
