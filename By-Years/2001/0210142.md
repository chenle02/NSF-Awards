The westward emigration of Albanians, including a substantial number of educated
professionals, is the highest rate found among post-socialist eastern European
countries. Most have settled in Greece and Italy as undocumented immigrant
manual laborers. After a decade of emigration, there are no signs of return
migration despite the increasing identification of post-socialist Albania's
economic, political, and legal systems with those of the West. Nor have these
changes lessened the desire of still-resident Albanians to emigrate. This
dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist from the University of
California, Irvine, explores the social and spatial transformations involved in
these migrations. The project will attempt to understand the decisions of
professionals to leave Albania and high-skilled jobs to emigrate and commit to
remain abroad, even as undocumented low-skill laborers. Fieldwork in Athens,
Greece, and Tirana, Albania, will compare the social worlds of Albanian
immigrants and would-be emigrants. Participant observation in key urban nodes,
interviewing, photographic documentation, and comparisons using correspondence
analysis, are used to assess the proposition that despite immigrants' observable
demotion in legal and social status, international labor migration is undertaken
and experienced as a social advancement. Rather than taking financial gain as a
given, this study examines the desire to work in the West as an identity change
that is part of international migration. The research will contribute to
theoretical issues in anthropology concerning development as well as further the
education of a young scholar. The broader significance of the project includes
the utility of the information for managing and serving the rapidly growing
global population of international immigrants, and for understanding the
generation and maintenance of disparities in global wealth.&lt;br/&gt;
