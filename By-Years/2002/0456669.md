The Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter (ICAM) is an open experiment-based
distributed Institute in which scientists in disparate disciplines and from many
institutions collaborate for the express purpose of creating new kinds of
science by identifying major new research themes in complex adaptive matter and
nucleating collaborative research and scientific training that draws from the
chemical, physical, and biological viewpoints of these themes. ICAM has 31
branches at academic institutions distributed in the US and internationally.
ICAM supports exploratory workshops, Symposia at the Frontiers of Science, a
Junior Fellows program, and a web site. In addition, ICAM collaborates
activities with the International Institute for Complex and Adaptive Matter
(IICAM), one of six NSF supported International Materials Institutes.
