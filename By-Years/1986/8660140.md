The purpose of this endeavor is to develop an efficient electrochemical process
for the commercial production of amino acids. The PI plans to use
electrochemically generated homogeneous catalysts to produce dl-dopa and dl-
phenylalanine. These products are used respectively in the preparation of the
artificial sweetener Nutrasweet and in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The
experimental program planned is directed towards gaining insight into
electrochemical reaction mechanisms involved in the amino acid sythesis.
Electrochemical processes may possess the following advantages: (1) provide
greater selectivity than an equivalent chemical process; (2) be environmentally
more benign; and (3) provide the opportunity for a simplified overall industrial
process where one or more steps normally found in conventional chemical
processes can be avoided. This project could also increase overall understnading
of electrolytic cells. The PI has broad experience in electrochemistry and the
company has the equipment to perform the proposed work. Funding of this Phase I
is recommended.
