A novel undergraduate engineering technology measurements laboratory is planned.
Recognizing that self-contained instruments such as oscilloscopes and signal
generators are covered early in the curriculum, it will emphasize computer
controlled test instrumentation, especially in-circuit testing using bed of
nails instrumentation. Other areas that will be covered include the measurement
of voltage, current and power with complex waveforms such as periodically
switched voltages. This will be accomplished using digitized oscilloscopes and
computer analysis. Another area which will be covered is device modeling through
impedance analyzer measurements.
