This research is on IC circuit and system design frameworks, focusing on process
and project management. Tasks include: (1) developing a model of design
development, tasks, and history appropriate for the CAD framework; (2) creating
a prototype implementation of a task manager to enforce the proper sequencing of
design activities and sharing of work among project members, which will be
integrated into the OCT framework; and (3) exploring the use of process
specification and history to provide effective feedback to project managers.
