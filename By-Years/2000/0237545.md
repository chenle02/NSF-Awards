The goal of this grant is to study the coevolution between the plant genus
Bursera and its herbivores, the beetle genus Blepharida. These are highly
diverse, tropical groups with spectacular adaptations and counteradaptations. In
Bursera, resin is stored in canals that run throughout the leaves. In some
species, the resins are pressurized and when leaves are damaged, an abundant
release of resins is triggered. Besides being toxic, resin solidifies when
exposed to air and may entomb small insects completely. Yet some Blepharida
species can neutralize Bursera's resin defense by severing the leaf veins to
stop the flow of resins before feeding on the leaves. Using DNA-based family
trees of insects and plants, I will investigate the role of plant defenses in
directing evolutionary host shifts by Blepharida. I will also determine the
historical correlations of Bursera's defenses with the insect counterdefenses,
and the time when they originated. This grant also seeks to help expand the
undergraduate and graduate basic science curriculum in the Department of
Entomology at the University of Arizona, through the developing of courses in
insect and plant biology and to help undergraduates develop their teaching
skills by training them in teaching natural history in the field and lab.
