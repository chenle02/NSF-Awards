With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Professor
Charles N. McEwen of the University of the Sciences seeks improved understanding
of certain newly developed mass spectrometric (MS) ionization methods, with aims
of improving reproducibility and sensitivity. These ionization methods
(discovered in collaboration with Professor Sarah Trimpin of Wayne State
University) have attributes of both matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI). They each produce multiply charged
ions, similar to ESI, allowing analysis of high mass compounds and enhancing
utility of ion mobility techniques. Increasing the sensitivity and
reproducibility of these new ionization methods may make possible high spatial
resolution imaging under atmospheric conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Areas
requiring high throughput analyses (such as consumer protection, counter-
terrorism, environmental monitoring, clinical applications, and biological
materials analysis) will be impacted by these developments. The broad training
gained by the graduate and undergraduate students involved will enhance their
future scientific potential.
