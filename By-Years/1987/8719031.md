This research seeks to develop the theory and practice of an integrated signal
detection system for detection in a narrowband burst environment such as is
encountered in sonar, radar, data communications, and other similar
environments. Optimal solutions to signal detection problems involve complete
statistical descriptions of the ambient noise. However, many important
environments are non- stationary, the noise consisting of a low-power quiescent-
mode random process punctuated occasionally by higher-power bursts. In some
environments, these bursts are strongly narrowband, a property that must be
considered. This research will be in three parts: characterization and modelling
of bursts, the development of processing algorithms, and investigation of the
properties of the algorithms using both idealized simulation and actual data.
