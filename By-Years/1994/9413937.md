9413937 Ernst The equipment furnished here will substantially upgrade the
research-related computing capabilities in the Physics Department of Vanderbilt
University while providing additional resources for teaching that are related to
research. Faculty members in the fields of atomic, nuclear and high energy
physics will implement a workstation farm that would be operated by Vanderbilt's
computing center. Each research group relies heavily on computing power to be
competitive in its field. In addition, both undergraduate and graduate students
will be served by this facility which will be used for specialized courses that
involve the use of the most up-to-date computers. ***
