The principal investigators will use bifurcation from infinity techniques to
study the asymptotic behavior of bifurcating branches of solutions of semilinear
elliptic equations to get detailed information about the existence and
multiplicity of solutions for such problems as well as stability information for
the associated time-evolution problems. Solution structure is strongly dependent
on the spatial dimension and the geometry of the domain. The stability of steady
state solutions in the case where multiple solutions exist is extemely delicate
and important in most physical situations.
