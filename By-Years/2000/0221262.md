&lt;br/&gt;Why are there so many animal species? Why are so many species
ecologically specialized, using a narrow range of resources and habitats?
Biologists have long suspected that ecological specialization and species
formation (= speciation) are causally connected. However, empirical tests of
"ecological speciation" models are extremely rare. This project evaluates
populations of Neochlamisus bebbianae leaf beetles that are associated with
different tree species (host plants) in eastern North America. Specifically, it
experimentally quantifies the ability of beetle populations associated with
different tree species to use each other's host plants and their willingness to
mate with each other, and it evaluates patterns of genetic exchange among these
populations by collecting DNA sequences and protein polymorphism data. These
data are integrated and analyzed at the individual and population levels to test
a variety of hypotheses on the diverse genetic and environmental mechanisms by
which ecological divergence may drive speciation and biological diversification.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such investigations on speciation ecology are rare yet
critical for understanding the origins of Earth's tremendous biodiversity.
Because many herbivorous insects (including some Neochlamisus species) are also
economic pests, understanding the factors that determine which plants an insect
uses, how plants are used, and how new herbivorous insect populations and
species form is of applied as well as academic importance. Ecological principles
underlying insect-plant relationships are increasingly being used to develop
agricultural strategies. The current proposal will provide insights into these
principles as well as their consequences for speciation.&lt;br/&gt;
