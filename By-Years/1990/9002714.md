NSF will share in the costs of operating a data communications link between the
NORDUnet node in Sweden and the NSFNET backbone node at the JvNCnet site in
Princeton, NJ. NORDUnet links the academic and research networks of five Nordic
countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Collectively, the
exchange of NORDUnet traffic with the NSFNET backbone accounted for over half of
the total exchange between european countries and the NSFNET backbone as of
July, 1989. The existing link, heretofore fully paid for by the NORDUNET
Project, is used to capacity for collaborative exchanges between US and Nordic
researchers.
