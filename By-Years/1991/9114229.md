Yanai proposes to continue his investigations into three related topics on the
dynamics of large scale tropical motions which focus on their linkage with
extratropical disturbances and with clusters of meso-convective scale cloud
systems. First, the nature of heat sources to the atmosphere induced by the
Tibetan Plateau and their influence on variations of the Asian monsoon are to be
further diagnosed. Secondly, the interactions of the 30-60 day tropical
oscillation and mid-latitude disturbances in the global flow are to be further
studied. Their differences between El Nino and non-El Nino years are now to be
explored. Third, the roles of downdrafts, mesoscale organization, and vertical
wind shear in the cloud cluster environment are to be analyzed, to ob- tain
improved statistical representation of the overall thermo- dynamic and dynamic
effects of convective cloud arrays of varying types. Yanai has long been a
leader in the quantitative analysis of observational data on these topics, and
in the conceptual framing of the results into process descriptions that have
been incorpora- ted into widely used components of numerical weather prediction
and general circulation models. This work should contribute to useful advances
in short-range weather prediction, as well as to a deeper understanding of
longer-term variations of major features of the global general circulation.
