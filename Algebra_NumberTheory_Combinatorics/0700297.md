The proposal belongs to a research activity in combinatorial number theory, in
particular 'additive combinatorics'. Many of the problems go back quite a while,
to the work of Erdos-Szemeredi and Freiman. But the revitalization of part of
this subject appears mainly during the last decade, with motivations from
harmonic analysis such as the Kakeya set problem in higher dimension, the work
on arithmetic progressions of Gowers and Green-Tao, the 'sum-product theorem' in
finite fields and its many applications (to computer science, the theory of
exponential sums and to the spectral theory of Hecke operators) . The problems
in the proposal are mainly related to the sum-product and product phenomena in
various rings and groups, continuing a line of research (in particular by the
PI) that turned out to have rather unexpected applications besides their
intrinsic interest from the combinatorial point of view. Indeed, purely
combinatorial (and basically elementary) techniques brought progress on issues
that had stalled for quite some time, such as on the expander properties of
certain 'thin' SL2 Caley graphs, and the 'expanding properties' of algebraic
functions on finite fields.

Recent results around the 'sum-product' and 'product-phenomena' in various
fields, rings and groups lead to progress on an amazing number of issues,
ranging from computer science to representation theory. The purpose of the
proposal is to explore further several types of questions that underly these
applications, including those are of importance to quantum computation and
nanotechnology.
