The University of Idaho proposes to engage 90 students in grades 4-6 and six
teachers on two neighboring Indian Reservations in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning through culturally-based and
content rich experiences and activities focusing on the large watershed shared
by the tribes. The project will deliver a summer and after-school programs for
the Coeur d'Alene Reservation. Students will create a "virtual watershed", a
web-based site comprised of an interactive map, which will provide geospatial
locations of social, cultural, and scientific significance. The proposal is
centered on two guiding frameworks, Critical Pedagogy of Place and Adventure
Learning. These established frameworks provide a sound foundation for program
activities and evaluation. Critical Pedagogy of Place is relevant to the Native
American Students in the program. Adventure Learning, with an inquiry-based
approach, is well-suited to STEM education. The evaluation is both formative and
summative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to enhance STEM content
understanding, improve attitudes toward STEM careers, and assist in building
community partnerships. A design-based approach to STEM instruction using
current technology will be used to give students a hands-on culturally based
foray into the world of STEM professionals. An Adventure Learning environment
will be created allowing students at both tribal locations to share their
experiences by uploading data, stories, learning experiences, and thoughts, in
real time.
