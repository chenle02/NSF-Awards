This planning grant to Northern Arizona University will pursue a restructuring
and revitalizing of the electrical engineering curriculum to achieve the
following goals: 1) equip students for future successful careers that require a
broader and more effective foundation that embraces emerging technologies, 2)
attract and meet the educational needs of all students, particularly under-
represented Native Americans and other minorities, by creating an active,
investigative and cooperative learning environment that emphasizes modeling,
simulation, analysis and computation skills and 3) attract and retain high
caliber students by removing legacy material and methods and infusing the
curriculum with 1) modern, more relevant material in emerging technologies like
Biology and 2) modern software and learning tools.
