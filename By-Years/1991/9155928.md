This project undertakes a systematic restructuring of how introductory digital
logic design is taught. The same computer-based tools used to carry out logic
design by practicing engineers is brought to bear on the learning process. The
use of workstations in the classroom and by students for simulation, computation
and optimization is emphasized. The restructuring effort will begin with two
short-term objectives: to develop new homework problems and other learning
activities which make use of logic simulation software, and to provide student
access to a multimedia electronic knowledgebase dealing with digital logic
design. The homework problems developed and a videotape describing the
multimedia knowledgebase will be made available to other academic institutions
for the cost of duplication. Results will be disseminated at the Frontiers in
Education conference.
