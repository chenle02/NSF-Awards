The Twenty-ninth Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern
University on the weekend of October 20, 2007. The Main Speaker is Chris Burdzy,
who will present two Hour Lectures on his research. There will also be hour
talks by Sladas Sidoravicius and Eulalia Nualart. We expect to have 75-100
probabilists from the greater Midwest area, including graduate students and
younger researchers. The MPC maintains a broad intellectual scope, making it a
vital forum for the exchange of research in both pure and applied probability.
This is a distinguished annual conference that brings together leading
Probabilists from the U.S. and abroad. The conference organizers give the
highest priority for funding to individuals without other support, with
particular emphasis given to early-career researchers and members of
underrepresented groups.
