The undergraduate chemistry and physics curricula will be enhanced by
incorporating an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. The range
of applications of EPR has widened significantly because of developments in
instrumentation. We will carry out new and existing experiments in the areas of
biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and inorganic chemistry, as
well as analytical chemistry and materials science. The instrument will broaden
our laboratory program for upper-level courses in chemistry and physics and will
also have a significant impact on undergraduate research. In addition to
research projects for seniors receiving honors degrees, smaller projects have
been designed for less sophisticated students, including non- science majors.
