9313319 Futrell The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University
of Delaware conducts research and training in the specialty areas of enzymology,
drug design and synthesis, catalysis, materials research, environmental
monitoring and chemical waste disposal technology, along with the more
traditional disciplines of chemistry. They are currently at the midpoint of a
ten year drive for excellence in chemical education and research. By emphasizing
the inseparability of teaching and research and involving undergraduates as
major contributors to the ongoing research, they can serve as a model for other
research intensive universities. This award will allow the university to
renovate their main facility for chemistry teaching and research, Fletcher Brown
Laboratory, which is currently obsolete. This renovation will facilitate
cutting-edge research, improve education for the next generation of chemists,
and attract outstanding new teacher/scholars and a more diverse student
population. The NSF award to this university will be matched by more than two to
one and will enable state-of-the-art laboratories at the University of Delaware.
