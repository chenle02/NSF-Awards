In March 2008, the Mathematics Department of the University of Florida will
conduct a conference on Partitions, q-series and modular forms, which will
include in it a Student Workshop. This conference is one of the highlights of a
year long program on Algebra, Number Theory, and Combinatorics in 2007-08. The
conference will bring together number theorists and combinatorialists to share
and learn new methods and results. An important aim of the conference is to
involve graduate students and advanced undergraduates. The Workshop in the first
part is to prepare students for the Research Conference to follow. The theory of
partitions and q-series is a central area of number theory having interactions
with combinatorics, analysis, the theory of modular forms, computer algebra, and
physics. It is an area where the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan
has made spectacular contributions. Topics covered in the conference will
include Rogers-Ramanujan type identities, elliptic hypergeometric functions,
partition congruences, modular forms and mock theta functions. A special feature
of the research conference will be a series of lectures by Ken Ono on recent
pathbreaking work connecting mock theta functions and modular forms. The three
conference organizers from the University of Florida - Alexander Berkovich,
Frank Garvan, and the PI - form one the major groups the theory of partitions,
q-series, and modular forms, and the mathematics of Ramanujan. The strength of
their program has been enhanced by association and collaboration with George
Andrews, the premier authority on partitions and Ramanujan's work. This
conference builds on several successful programs conducted previously by the
number theorists at the University of Florida.
