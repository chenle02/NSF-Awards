This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of producing copper/graphite composites by a continuous casting
process. Historically, copper/graphite composites have been produced by hot
pressing copper-coated graphite fibers or by high pressure liquid metal
infiltration. The development of a reliable air-stable coating which is easily
wet by molten copper allows new, low cost manufacturing techniques to be
investigated. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of
continuously casting copper/graphite composites. A prototype demonstration unit
will be constructed and the principle operating variables will be identified. At
the conclusion of the Phase I, completely infiltrated copper/graphite strips
will be produced and characterized.
