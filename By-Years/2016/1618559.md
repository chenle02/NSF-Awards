Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows several mutually untrusting parties
to perform joint computations while keeping their inputs private. This project
develops new techniques for constructing two-party secure computation protocols
with low communication overhead. Building on the Principal Investigator's prior
work for constructing special-purpose secure MPC protocols for greedy
algorithms, this project develops new techniques that exploit the algorithmic
structure of a function in order to develop more efficient secure computation
protocols.

The project develops new methods to achieve security against covert adversaries
for linear algebraic tasks, graph matching algorithms, and problems from
computational geometry. The investigators broadly disseminate the outcomes of
the research and software libraries in order to benefit both theoreticians and
practitioners. The project includes various educational and outreach activities
such as organizing workshops for high-school students. The project has created a
wiki for cryptographic constructions and security notions associated with these
constructions.
