This research is a combination of theoretical and experimental work addressing
the formation of instabilities in river channels. A unified non-linear model is
to be constructed for the formation of alternating sediment bars as precursors
to braiding and meandering. Relevant experiments are to conducted in a tilting
sediment flume, with the observations primarily visual. This research relates to
the potential for river control techniques concentrating on the key locations
and remedies, in contrast to the present general stabilization techniques
treating all of the banks.
