The University of Michigan STEM (M-STEM) Academy provides transitional academic
support for first and second year engineering undergraduates in a concerted
effort to increase the number and success of STEM students, with an emphasis on
students from diverse backgrounds. The M-STEM Academy replicates well-documented
success strategies, developed by the Meyerhoff Scholars Program at the
University of Maryland Baltimore-County, for the retention and academic success
of diverse students. It expands upon and tests the Meyerhoff model by
transferring its components to a large university setting and working with
students who, although-well qualified, have often struggled and not succeeded in
this type of academic environment. M-STEM partners closely with other STEM
education pipeline efforts at the University of Michigan, such as the Office of
Engineering Outreach and Engagement, the Michigan Louis Strokes Alliance for
Minority Participation Program, and the Michigan Alliances for Graduate
Education and the Professoriate Program to provide a seamless continuum of STEM
education and support services from grade school to graduate school and the
workplace. Assessment of the M-STEM Academy by faculty in the Center for the
Study of Higher and Post-Secondary Education will provide continual feedback to
determine needed program modifications. This M-STEM Academy creates a holistic
student academic support system, including scholarship support, in STEM fields,
increasing the number, success, and diversity of STEM graduates who will then
contribute to the STEM workforce both within the State of Michigan and the
nation.
