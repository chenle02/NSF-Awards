Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is improving the
power electronics and motor drives laboratories at the PI's institution in order
to provide the students with hands-on experience in this rapidly developing
field. The laboratory is utilizing eight experiments adapted from a highly
successful program at the University of Minnesota in addition to developing four
new laboratory experiments that utilize state-of-the-art technology. The project
also includes a short course program for practicing engineers and a
collaboration with a NASA lab that will also support this effort and provide two
senior NASA research engineers to act as advisors. The specific objectives of
this project are: 1) to have 40 electrical engineering undergraduate students
per year successfully complete three courses in power electronics and electrical
machines, 2) to increase undergraduate enrollment in an advanced power
electronics course by 50%, and 3) to update the skills of 10 practicing
engineers from regional companies specializing in power electronics and electric
machine technology per year. The evaluation effort includes monitoring course
enrollment records and short course attendance, analyzing of student performance
and evaluations, and conducting employer surveys. Dissemination plans include
conference and journal papers and participation in on-going national faculty
workshops on teaching power electronics and drives.&lt;br/&gt;
