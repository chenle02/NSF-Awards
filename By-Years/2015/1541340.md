The University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, and New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology are working together to deliver regional
workshops in support of statewide planning for research networking. This
collaborative effort by New Mexico√≠s research universities educates, encourages
adoption, and provides on-site technical expertise to implement advanced
networking and cyberinfrastructure (CI) to enhance and support STEM research and
education at small, remote colleges and universities in New Mexico. Invitations
to attend workshops are extended to institutions of higher education in adjacent
regions of Arizona and Texas who share similar demographics, topography, and
challenges; and to State of New Mexico Economic Development Department, the New
Mexico regional Councils of Governments, the New Mexico Department of
Information Technology, and other departments of city, county and state
government because, in New Mexico's rural areas, municipal governments and
tribal entities are instrumental in bringing broadband into underserved areas.

The essential partnership between educational entities, research entities, and
state and local governments ensures the cost-effective build-out of advanced
networking in this underserved region, enabling researchers located in remote
communities to thrive, and improving education (including distance education) in
a state where many students are the first in their families to attend college.
