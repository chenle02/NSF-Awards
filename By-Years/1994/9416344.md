9416344 Suppe This project uses geological and geophysical data combined with
advanced techniques of structural modelling to obtain an integrated, self
consistent solution for the three-dimensional blind-thrust geometry, slip
vectors, and loading of the faults of the Northridge and San Fernando
earthquakes and for other nearby blind thrust faults that may have been stressed
by the closely related Northridge and San Fernando events. Refined fault
geometries will be constrained by will tested theoretical relationships between
fault shape and associated fold shape. The study will also determine whether
there are other nearby fault segments that could slip in damaging earthquakes by
using three-dimensional boundary element calculations to evaluate the stress
changes on these faults due to the San Fernando and Northridge events. The
results of this study will provide subsurface maps and cross sections of the San
Fernando Valley and surrounding regions and will provide needed constraints on
the presence and seismic potential of other blind faults in the region.
