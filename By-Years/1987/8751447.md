With support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Public Radio
(NPR) will provide five years of operation of NPR's Science Unit to provide
science and technology news and information on NPR's MORNING EDITION, ALL THINGS
CONSIDERED, and WEEKEND EDITION shows. Prior NSF support has allowed NPR to
create stable, sustained in-depth science coverage on the national network of
335 local public radio stations. More than 9,000,000 people a month, or 2.5% of
the U.S. population each week, listen to NPR's news magazines. Science coverage
includes 400-500 science stories each year. NPR's News and Information Service
is widely acclaimed; awards have included the Alfred I. DuPont Columbia
University Journalism Award, and the Science Unit's staff's Westinghouse-AAAS
Science Journalism Award and the National Association of Science Writers'
Science in Society Award. With this five year award, NPR will consolidate the
gains that have been made, continuing to provide the coverage that has earned
their reputation, while moving towards financial independence from NSF. A FY87
30 month award of $574,449 and, subject to the availability of funds, following
12 month awards of $240,698 in FY89, $210,939 in FY90, and $180,623 in FY91 are
recommended.
