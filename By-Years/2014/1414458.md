This project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of
Chemistry, to Professor Webster L. Santos of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University examines the reactivity of copper boryl complexes, develops
copper catalysts (with particular focus on those containing inexpensive
ligands), and explores new solvents, including water, for borylation and
subsequent cross-coupling processes. The team conducts fundamental experimental
and theoretical studies on the structures and reactivities of well-defined
copper boryl, aryl and alkyl complexes as well as associated catalyst screening
studies. This research develops novel catalyst systems that replace rare,
expensive, and toxic transition metal catalysts (Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir, etc.) with
earth abundant metals such as copper. The investigations minimize the production
of hazardous waste by utilizing water as solvent rather than an organic
solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is conducted in collaboration with
Professor Todd B. Marder (Universität Würzburg, Germany) and Professor Yao Fu
(University of Science and Technology China). Together, the three groups combine
their separate areas of expertise to provide more sustainable synthetic methods
for the production of commodity chemicals. The broader impacts of this work also
include leadership training for graduate students and an international exchange
of ideas and expertise.
