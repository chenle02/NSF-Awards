Research involves the integration of computer-aided design (CAD) methods and
computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) for the production of radial plate and axial
barrel cams. Piecewise continuous rational polynomials will be investigated as
suitable functions for both design and manufacture of cams. Traditional methods
as well as recently developed spline-based design strategies do not present an
integrated, geometrically based system for design and manufacture. The
objectives to be realized during the grant include: Development of an
understanding of the mathematical foundations of rational polynomial functions
currently used in the computer aided design environment; investigation of
typical control systems used by industrial cam manufacturers and identification
of methods for interfacing CAD systems with CAM controllers to achieve high
order motion control in the manufacturing phase; and Development of experience
with the design of standard cam motion programs and contours using rational
polynomial curves.
