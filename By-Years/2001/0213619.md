This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a
novel positron source based on the generation of free 13 N produced via the 12
C(d,n) 13 N reaction. In a major advance over existing technologies, the 13 N
will be extracted as nitrogen gas from a porous carbon target, fed to a remote
location, and condensed onto a small diameter spot. A layer of solid Ne will
moderate the 13 N beta-particles to produce a beam of slow positrons. This
approach will yield an unrivaled brightness and two orders of magnitude higher
intensity than current 22 Na sources, thus opening the door to many valuable
uses of positron probes for science and industry.

The high intensity, high brightness positron source to be developed will have
many applications to high-data-rate, positron micro-beam instruments for use in
determining such things as: (1) the effects of radiation damage due to ion
implantation on the conduction characteristics of IC semiconductors; (2) the
effects of electro-migration on the failure of current carrying leads in ICs;
(3) the properties of low-k dielectrics used in high speed ICs; and (4) the
aging of the mechanical properties of plastic films.
