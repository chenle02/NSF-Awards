This research is in the area of number theory. Number theory has its historical
roots in the study of natural numbers. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics. Within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal centers on the theory
of automorphic forms. The main goal of the proposal is to establish a
quantitative refinement of the Gross-Prasad conjecture, in the special case of
Whittaker functionals. The conjecture can be viewed as a far-reaching local to
global principle for period integrals. The PI will also extend the techniques
developed to study the general case of Gross-Prasad conjecture.
