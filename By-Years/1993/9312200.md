9312200 Davis This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arkansas-
Fayetteville in the purchase of a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectrometer. This instrument will enhance the research in a number of areas
including the following: 1) The structure and reactivity of molecules
interacting with transition metal atoms, clusters and surfaces, 2) The
adsorption of alkyl groups on metal surfaces in catalytic processes, 3)
Dynamically modified, biospecific optical fiber sensors based on a
hydrophobically associated reagent phase, 4) The study of molecular self-
assembled monolayers (SAMs) and high ordered surfaces with controlled chemical
composition, 5) Characterization of structure (ex situ) and composition of
liquid crystals SAMs. %%% A Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer is
used to obtain information about molecular structure and molecular dynamics. It
is also very useful in detecting the presence and physical state of some
functional groups (e.g. CO groups, OH groups and others). ***
