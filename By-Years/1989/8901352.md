There is a clearly established need to perform work, remotely, in the undersea
environment. Typical tasks to be performed will range from observation and
inspection to servicing defective undersea equipment, or recovering a lost item.
While part of the work site may be structured, the environment is unstructured
(the ocean). In addition, the structured part of the work site may be damaged or
in unknown condition. This lack of structure, as well as the non-repetitive
nature of the tasks, require constant adaptation to the environment. This
program involves research in the area of teleoperation with the feedback delay
that occurs with surface-based teleoperation in untethered submersibles. The
delay in obtaining position and force feedback from remote slave arms makes
operation extremely difficult. A novel combination of graphics and manipulator
programming will interface the teleoperator master arms to a graphics display of
the remote environment. The operator's actions will be monitored to provide both
kinesthetic and visual feedback and to generate symbolic motion commands to the
remote slave. The research will be performed jointly and in connection with, the
French LAAS Laboratory in Toulouse, France.
