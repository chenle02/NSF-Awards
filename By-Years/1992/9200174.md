This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at the University
of Pittsburgh. The funds provide support for eight undergraduate students
selected from candidates from six colleges in the general area of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, to allow participation both in the summer and during the academic
year. Special emphasis is placed upon recruitment from institutions having all
female students, in order to attract more females into careers in research and
teaching. Students from departments of physics, chemistry, and engineering are
considered. Scholastic achievement is the primary requirement for participation
in the program. The research will involve research in the area of computer
simulation and modeling of polymer behavior using Monte Carlo and molecular
dynamics techniques. The professors involved in this program have a strong
record of interaction with undergraduate students in research, and have won
honors for joint publications in the past.
