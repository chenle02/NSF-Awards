This project studies and compares three alternative methods of measuring
willingness-to-accept to find acceptable solutions to the problem of siting
hazardous waste facilities. They are the contingency valuation survey,
laboratory experimental method, and the structured focus group or public value
forum. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. The focus of the
investigation will be to compare the effectiveness of these three alternatives
in obtaining willingness-to-accept measures, so that an acceptable solution to
the hazardous waste facility siting problem may become evident. Information from
this investigation will be useful in wording questions used in community
referenda that determine the acceptance or rejection of a hazardous waste
facility. Such referenda can include a compensation package which is used to
make more attractive the siting of an hazardous waste facility in a community.
Additionally, such information will be useful in investigating the ethical and
equity implications of certain socioeconomic factors such as education and
income in willingness- to-accept responses.
