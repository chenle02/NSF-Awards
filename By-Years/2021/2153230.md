The recent developments toward 6G and beyond wireless networks open a new
chapter in sensing and communication, enabling numerous services and
applications in emerging sectors. These new services and applications demand
unprecedented high-precision and efficient sensing and communication, which
entails the utilization of large bandwidths available at the terahertz (THz)
band. Although the transition to the THz band promises several benefits, the
full advantage of the THz band can be reaped by using quantum resources. This
multidisciplinary research will develop a unified framework to integrate quantum
information science with THz sensing and
communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish the fundamentals
of quantum sensing and communication at THz. In particular, the team of
researchers will: establish the fundamental performance limits of quantum
sensing and communication at THz, develop information- and estimation-theoretic
learning methodologies for quantum sensing and communication at THz, and design
algorithms for quantum sensing and communication at THz to achieve entirely new
performance levels. The cross-pollination of ideas and methodologies adopted in
this fundamental research will empower sensing and communication solutions,
paving the way to robust and efficient quantum networks for 6G and
beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
