This multi-faceted research program is designed to address several outstanding
problems in solar and heliospheric physics including the observed rigid rotation
of coronal holes and the apparent contradictions between solar imaging and in
situ observations of the evolution of the sun's open magnetic field. The
methodology balances theoretical modeling, large-scale numerical simulation, and
the analysis of various solar and heliospheric data sets. Analytic models will
be used to investigate various topologies of open and closed magnetic fields
during epochs when the solar surface exhibits complex magnetic polarity
distributions. Three-dimensional numerical simulations will subsequently be
employed to model the dynamical behavior of these topologies, in particular, the
interchange reconnection between open and closed magnetic flux. The simulations
rely on a new state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamics code, which encompasses a
fully adaptive mesh, and is optimized for all the latest parallel architectures.
Such calculations are essential for understanding not only the solar-
heliospheric dynamic coupling, but also three-dimensional magnetic reconnection,
the basic process central to most of space physics.
