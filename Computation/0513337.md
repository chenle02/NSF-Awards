his project aims to study interior-point methods for conic programming problems.
Improvements will be considered to allow these methods to easily detect when
such problems are infeasible or unbounded, as often happens when new models are
developed. The most efficient interior-point methods in most cases are primal-
dual methods, but in certain cases, dual methods are expected to be faster as
long as a suitable barrier function can be found: the project will study ways to
construct such efficient barrier functions. These two themes can be studied in a
unified way by considering a general conic problem and a related problem
associated with unboundedness. Several topics will be investigated from this
viewpoint: the relationship between optimal solutions, central paths, and Newton
steps for the two formulations, and the development of so-called self-concordant
barrier functions for faces and recession cones of convex sets for which such
barriers are known.

This project will continue investigations into interior-point methods for conic
optimization problems. These methods have proved the most efficient for solving
truly large-scale linear programming problems, as arise in resource allocation
problems in industry, government, and the military. More recently, they have
been extended to a range of nonlinear problems, in particular to second-order
cone and semidefinite programming, which have applications in structural
optimization, antenna array design, filter design, and portfolio optimization,
and in obtaining tight bounds for hard combinatorial optimization problems. The
project will extend the capabilities of these methods to detect when such
problems have been poorly formulated so that optimal solutions do not exist.
Improved methods for very large-scale problems will be investigated. Advances
will be tested in the software package SDPT3 developed in a previous NSF project
with two former graduate students, and available to other users over the
internet. Improvements in the code will be made available to practitioners and
other code developers. Graduate students will be trained to become experts in
the modelling and computational power of conic programming.
