Proposal Number: ECS-9703988 Principal Investigator: Li Yan Title: Mode locking
with a hybrid neodymium laser In this research, a new approach to easily and
reliably generate ultrashort ( &lt; 100 fs) coherent laser pulses will be
investigated. The approach involves a novel concept of mode locking with a
hybrid laser, which contain both a broadband inhomogeneously broadened medium
and a narrow band homogeneously broadened medium in a single cavity. As a
demonstration as well as being practically useful system, a broadband
Nd:phosphate glass and a narrow band Nd:YLF will be combined to form a hybrid
neodymium laser. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations of this
system will be pursued. The basic physics of the hybrid laser, particularly the
roles of the two gain media in the dynamic mode-locking process, will be
investigated. The materials science applications for ultrashort pulse lasers are
growing vigorously.
