Proposal 0242218 Group Travel Grant to 2003 IEEE International Conference on
Robotics and Automation PI: Yuan Zheng Ohio State University

The annual IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),
sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, is the best event in
terms of quality and quantity in the areas of robotics and automation, and has
served as a forum gathering international researchers for presentation and
discussion of emerging technologies. This project is to support about 45 U.S.
researchers to participate in the 2003 ICRA that will be held in Taipei, Taiwan,
May 12-17, 2003. The primary objective is to help U.S. researchers participate
in this key international conference, who could not otherwise attend the
Conference. U.S. researchers will maintain a highly competitive position in
research by presenting research results, discussion, and exchange information
with researchers from all over the world. This project strongly supports
minority group researchers and students who would need financial support for
their participation in the 2003 ICRA.
