An environmental engineering laboratory course is being developed to introduce
undergraduate civil engineering students to the laboratory procedures and
analytical processes associated with environmental engineering. The intent of
the course is for students to examine the scientific principles behind current
analytical methodologies and to subsequently have then perform each analysis.
Environmental problems within the region are often associated with the pollution
of the aquatic environment, particularly by metals, due to the considerable
amount of maritime and urban development activity. Instrumental analysis of
metals will be an important component of this course and will focus on metal
contamination of the aquatic environment. In this regard, samples from
surrounding coastal marine and freshwater systems will be sampled by the
students and subsequently analyzed. Links between anthropogenic activities and
the contamination of aquatic systems will be strengthen through these practical
experiences. An enhanced appreciation of this linkage is relevant for civil
engineering students since a large percentage enter maritime or urban
development-related employment.
