The PI plans to develop analytical methods for gaseous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
and dimethylsulfone (DMSO2) and to conduct exploratory measurements at a nearby
coastal site. His objectives are to (1) use isotopic dilution to improve
precision and circumvent problems due to reactions in the trap and variability
in sampling and analysis efficiencies, (2) desorb with supercritical fluid
carbon dioxide to simplify the extraction process thus allowing automation, (3)
improve detection limits to 0.3 pptv for 3 minute samples using a quadrupole
mass spectrometer as a detector, and (4) evaluate manifold background levels by
adding zero air directly to the manifold.
