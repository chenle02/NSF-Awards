The effects of greenhouse warming are expected to be much greater in the arctic
regions of both hemispheres than at low latitudes. In order to fully understand
and predict the effects of such a warming at high latitudes, it is necessary to
reconstruct the history of climate on the continents and over the oceans in the
Arctic. The goal of this project is to reconstruct the glacial-interglacial
history of climate in a region where, at present, there is a significant
sparsity of paleoclimate information: the regions of Alaska and Siberia known as
Beringia. Through a series of cooperative field programs, researchers from the
US and USSR will collaborate on paleoecological, paleoclimatological and
paleolimnological analyses which will determine both the history of climate
change in this region and its effects on the local ecology. This project is
important because it will help to identify and quantify the natural range and
rates of change in climate in regions where significant changes are predicted
for the future.
