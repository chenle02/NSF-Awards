Thermal processing plays an important role during the manufacturing of
electronic and optical materials. Several new issues are to be explored,
including the following: thermally induced instabilities at the solid-liquid
interface of thermally processed semiconducting films, microscale thermal
radiation phenomena induced by the sub- wavelength film thickness of multilayer
structures, thermal analysis of explosive crystallization of multilayer film
structures such as Si-Ni, and investigation of heat transfer and fluid flow
phenomena associated with the manufacturing of optical fibers. The quality and
ease of manufacture of electronic and optical materials are often controlled by
thermal processes. This research will bridge the gap in expertise between
manufacturing and heat transfer engineering, and will attempt to supplant the
trial and error methods so prominent in American industry today.
