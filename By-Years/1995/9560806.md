This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the fabrication of volume holographic grating filters for retro-reflection in
the 1.55 micron band with sufficient bandwidth to provide wavelength monitoring
over a 1 to 2 nm range. This would be sufficient to monitor any signal over the
full channel width of a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical network,
addressing a need for external wavelength references to insure that the lasers
do not drift out of their assigned channels. Current alternatives are not
feasible for integration into telecom equipment because of size constraints or
technical limitations. Phase I will focus on increasing bandwidth on current
holographic grating filters and decreasing input signal requirements with higher
detector sensitivity. A prototype design will be made. Anticipated commercial
applications of this technology include network monitors for WDM transmitters
and accurate wavelength laser sources, both for telecom and other laboratory
applications. In addition, filters can be used for remote sensing, i.e., eye-
safe LIDAR, instrumentation, and spectroscopy.
