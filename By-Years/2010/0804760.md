Daniel Ruberman will carry out research in geometric topology, using Seiberg-
Witten gauge theory, Heegaard-Floer homology, and more traditional topological
ideas. The first part of the project, in collaboration with Nikolai Saveliev and
Tomasz Mrowka, studies the relation between Seiberg-Witten theory and the
analysis of the Dirac operator on periodic manifolds. A second project, joint
with Saso Strle and Elisenda Grigsby, is to carry out further calculations of
new Heegaard-Floer knot invariants that were introduced in our study of
concordance. Related work with Matthew Hedden and Hee Jung Kim will explore
other aspects of knot theory and embedded surfaces in 4-dimensional
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of the structure of
the 4-dimensional universe in which we live is a key topic of investigation in
modern mathematics. Many of the questions posed by geometers and topologists
have to do with the nature of 2-dimensional surfaces sitting in a 4-dimensional
space, and with the singularities present on such surfaces. The research in this
proposal uses modern tools of analysis and geometry to shed light on the local
nature of such singularities, including new methods for showing that such
singularities cannot be smoothed. Related analytical techniques will be used to
explore the global topology of 4-dimensional spaces.&lt;br/&gt;
