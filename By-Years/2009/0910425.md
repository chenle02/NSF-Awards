The 2009 Gordon Conference on Microbial Population Biology will cover a diverse
range of issues in the microbial sciences. Founded in evolutionary biology and
with a strongly integrative approach, the Conference will cover a broad range of
topics including: the dynamics and genetics of adaptation, evolutionary
genomics, the evolution of protein structure and function and the evolution of
virulence. The Conference draws scientists from a diversity of fields, promoting
interactions among integrative and broad-thinking researchers in biology. As
such it provides the ideal venue within which to shape new ways of
investigation, particularly in areas such as infectious disease biology that
benefit from a firm foundation in evolutionary biology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evolution of disease is increasingly seen as key to
promoting public and individual health, animal welfare and agribusiness. The
current out-break of swine flu is an example of an incessant evolutionary arms
race between a disease and its hosts, one in which the pathogen continually out-
evolves host immune defences. While much biomedical research is concerned with
the mechanism and progression of disease at the molecular and clinical levels,
little attention has been paid to understanding how virulence and transmission
rates evolve, and what they evolve in response to. The Conference will explore
microbial evolution in general, and emphasise the evolution of virulence,
transmission rates and disease, and will increase understanding of the origins
and spread of new pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;
