This CAREER program has a scientific component that is directed toward the
modification and measurement of Rydberg atomic wavepackets. Chirped pulses will
be used to shift the revival of a wavepacket arbitrarily in time in single-
electron excitations. In two-electron atoms, one electron will be excited to a
Rydberg state while a second pulse causes the second electron to oscillate
between the ground and excited states. The educational component is focused on
the development of a set of interactive, web-based introductory science courses.
Interaction with engineering faculty in this endeavor enhances the
multidisciplinary nature of the new courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
