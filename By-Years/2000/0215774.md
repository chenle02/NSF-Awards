With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah will acquire a wide-bore 600
MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
studies on a) measurements of chemical shift tensors in natural products, ionic
compounds, aerosols and soots, b) quadrupolar interactions in shift tensors and
couplings in biologically important molecules, and c) spin exchange in polarized
noble gases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of
areas including drug development and advanced materials.
