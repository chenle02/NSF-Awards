Abstract for NSF proposal DMS-0400548 Nakano&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator will explore problems involving &lt;br/&gt;the representation
theory and cohomology of algebraic groups, &lt;br/&gt;Lie algebras and finite
groups. An important object of study &lt;br/&gt;will be support varieties which
provide a bridge linking &lt;br/&gt;the representation theory, cohomology theory
and the structure &lt;br/&gt;theory (involving conjugacy classes) of Lie
algebras. &lt;br/&gt;Computations of such varieties will be considered as well
&lt;br/&gt;as generalizations of the theory to quantum groups and affine
&lt;br/&gt;Lie algebras. The investigator will also look at
&lt;br/&gt;computations of cohomology groups/rings of finite Chevalley
groups&lt;br/&gt;and Frobenius kernels especially for primes less than the
Coxeter &lt;br/&gt;number. It is anticipated that the use of extensive
&lt;br/&gt;computer calculations might be necessary for several of these
&lt;br/&gt;projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic structures such are groups,
rings and Lie algebras &lt;br/&gt;arise naturally, and the basic understanding
of these objects have been &lt;br/&gt;used in applications involving biology,
physics and chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;These algebraic objects have complicated
internal symmetries. &lt;br/&gt;Information about the representation and
cohomology theories &lt;br/&gt;allows one to organize and extract vital
information that can &lt;br/&gt;be used in these various applications. The
principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;has been actively promoting the working
knowledge of these &lt;br/&gt;methods. He is currently organizing several
conferences in &lt;br/&gt;representation/cohomology theory and is a co-organizer
&lt;br/&gt;of the VIGRE (Vertical Integration of Research and Education) Algebra
&lt;br/&gt;Group at the University of Georgia which promotes learning through
&lt;br/&gt;active faculty and student participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
