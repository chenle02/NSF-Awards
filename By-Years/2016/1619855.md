The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will host a three day conference
on Statistical Machine Learning and Data Science from June 6-8, 2016. (See
http://www.unc.edu/~yfliu/sldm2016/.) The objective is to bring together
researchers in statistical learning and data science from academia, industry,
and government in a stimulating atmosphere focused on the development of
statistical learning theory, methods and applications. Statistical machine
learning is a relatively new discipline, evolving from machine learning methods
of artificial intelligence and multivariate statistics. It also plays an
essential role for the new important area of data science and big data. NSF
funding will provide travel support to increase the number of junior researchers
who are able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Section on Statistical Machine
Learning and Data Science of the American Statistical Association will hold a
meeting at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from June 6-8, 2016.
Topics of the conference include, but are not limited to, big data analytics,
classification, computational biology, covariance estimation, graphical models,
high dimensional data, learning theory, model selection, network analysis,
precision medicine, and signal and image processing. This award will provide
travel support for junior researchers.
