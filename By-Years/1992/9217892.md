This project is a renewal of a previous grant concerned with 2-D modelling of
continental extension and rifting. The P.I. will extend his earlier developed
2-D model of continental rifting which incorporates the effect of lower crustal
flow and explains the development of wide continental extension areas with high
heat flow. The P.I. will now use this model to derive the parameters (stress
&amp; strain, heat flow, time etc.) which control the long time development of
continental margins. Then these will be compared with several margins as a test.
