This award provides funds to develop a natural resource management practicum for
upper division students enrolled in the School of Forestry, Fisheries and
Wildlife in the School of Natural Resources at the University of Missouri-
Columbia. In order to facilitate field data collection, this award will be used
for the acquisition of portable electronic field data recorders. These field
data recorders will be used by a team of students with backgrounds in forestry,
fisheries and wildlife to gather biological data on a real tract of land. These
data will then be downloaded to existing portable computers for input into
biological simulation models to analyze and evaluate different proposed natural
resource management regimes for the tract of land. The proposed practicum will
bring together young professionals in an outdoor setting where they will be
expected to develop an integrated plan for the management of multiple natural
resources, under various disciplinary resource constraints and objectives, and
work together as a multi- disciplinary team. Additionally, this course will
serve as a feedback mechanism which can be used by the School to assess the
quality of the natural resource program. The grantee is matching this award with
funds from non-Federal sources.
