This research program is concerned with intergro- differential equations
associated with the mechanics of viscoelastic materials. Unlike previous effort
in this area, the focus will be on weak solutions: their existence, numerical
algorithms, decay rates, etc. Research results will contribute to the advances
of material science, particularly rheology, and structural system designs.
Information on the formation of shocks and their propagation will be useful for
our understanding of cracks in viscoelastic structures.
