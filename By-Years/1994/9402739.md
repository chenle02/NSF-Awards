9402739 Caffarelli This award supports a continuation of the successful Regional
Geometry Institutes (RGI). The defining feature of the RGI has been the
integration of researchers, graduate students, undergraduates, and high school
teachers in a structured environment that allow all members to attain deeper
understanding of the mathematical sciences enterprise as a whole. The project is
designed to increase mutual respect and understanding among the groups, while
advancing scholarship and learning. In a supportive setting where education at
all levels is the explicit concern, participants can make connections that are
difficult or impossible to achieve in their home locations. The RGI is managed
by a small, decentralized group of mathematical scientists and educators. The
Institute for Advanced Study proposes to become the institutional leader of this
program, called the Park City/IAS Mathematics Institute. The site for the
activity for the summer of 1994 will be at Park City, Utah. ***
