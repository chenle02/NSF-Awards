This engineering research equipment grant is to acquire an Nd: YAG pulsed laser
with a pulse energy of 50J to perform research in the area of manufacturing
processes. The projects for which the Nd:YAG laser equipment will be used
include: (1) advanced laser drilling methods for the production of noncircular
holes; (2) synthesis of metallic classes by laser glazing; (3) innovative laser
welding of recently developed Al-Li alloys; (4) laser machining of super alloys;
and (5) development of superhard coatings by laser vapor deposition. The
objectives of research with Nd:YAG laser equipment are threefold: (1) to address
the basis issues in near infrared laser beam-material interactions during
processing; (2) to examine the mechanisms responsible for the process advantages
and methods to minimize manufacturing defects; and (3) to assess the superiority
of laser processing over other nontraditional machining methods.
