Support is requested for the 34th annual meeting of the Wind River Conference on
Genetic Exchange, to be held at the Wind River Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado, June
6-10 1990. This conference is primarily concerned with the biology and molecular
biology of genetic exchange systems in a variety of procaryotic and eucaryotic
systems, and is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to this subject
area internationally. One significant feature of these meetings is their
accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel
funds frequently are limited. Specifically to address this problem, funds are
provided to support travel and scholarships to facilitate the attendance of
graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various areas of genetic
exchange and related subject areas.
