This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Symbiotic regulation and function of
proteins in Sinorhizobium melilota Outer Membrane." Sinorhizobium melilota, a
gram negative bacterium, and the legume Medicago truncatula are partners in a
symbiosis that requires coordinated differentiation for productive nodulation.
This research seeks to identify bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMPs)
differentially expressed in plant-associated bacteroids compared to free-living
bacteria, to be followed by a genetic and physiological analyses of the role
these proteins play at the interface of the bacterium and plant. This will
ehnhance our understanding of the complex metabolic coupling between bacteria
and plant required for nitrogen fixation.
