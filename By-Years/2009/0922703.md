James A. Birchler (University of Missouri - Columbia), Jiming Jiang (University
of Wisconsin - Madison), Gernot Presting (University of Hawaii - Manoa), and
Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra (University of California -
Davis)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centromeres are regions of the genome that organize
and regulate chromosome movement. They are key elements in the development of
next-generation artificial chromosomes for introducing new traits into crop
plants. Yet the biology of centromeres remains poorly understood. The
experiments carried out in this project will complete the sequence and assembly
of maize centromeres, address known epigenetic limitations associated with
employing artificial chromosomes, develop improved strategies for streamlining
centromere study and use, and document the diversity of centromeres in maize and
allied species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To expand training opportunities in plant
genetics, two programs will be initiated. One will provide hands-on training in
plant cytogenetics through an Annual Cytogenetics Workshop to be held at the
University of Wisconsin. The second will be an international student exchange
program between project laboratories and the National Autonomous University of
Mexico. Specifically, thirteen students will be funded to travel between
universities and work on collaborative projects relating to centromere evolution
and function. A web site (www.plantcentromeres.org) will be used to disseminate
results from the project and to coordinate outreach activities. In addition,
sequence data will be deposited at MaizeGDB (www.maizegdb.org) and GenBank.
Germplasm generated will be deposited at the Iowa North Central Regional Plant
Introduction Station (Ames, IA).
