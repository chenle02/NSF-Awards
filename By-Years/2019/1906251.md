This project provides participant support for the 41st Conference on Stochastic
Processes and their Applications (SPA) to be held July 8-12, 2019 at
Northwestern University in Evaston, IL. SPA is the largest research meeting in
the field of probability and is considered as the premier and most prestigious
international forum for the dissemination of new results in probability and
random processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature a broad
range of topics, bringing together both theoretical and applied researchers. In
addition to plenary talks which include the most prestigious named lectures of
the probability calendar, the meeting at Northwestern will feature several
invited and contributed sessions. These will provide a platform for early career
probabilists to present their work alongside the leading figures of the field.
To encourage such important exchange, travel support for Ph.D students, junior
researchers, women, and underrepresented minorities represents a large portion
of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full program details are available at the
conference website:

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
