Research is proposed in three areas of complex geometry and several complex
variables: characterizations up to biholomorphic isometry of classical bounded
symmetric domains and their duals via solution of a partial differential
equation, a version of the Schwarzian derivative for locally biholomorphic maps
between manifolds with projective structure, and convexity of complex manifolds
with respect to sections of a holomorphic line bundle.
