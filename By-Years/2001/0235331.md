With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa will
acquire a new console and probes for a high field (600 MHz) NMR Spectrometer.
This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on a)
investigations of the potential enzymatic role of Zn(II) in myelin basic protein
and in the design of chimeric peptides containing Ca(II) or Ln(III) binding
sites as a novel DNA binding motif to promote hydrolytic catalysis; b) the
discovery, isolation and structural determination of new bioactive natural
products; c) structure determination of glycosaminoglycan-derived
oligosaccharides; and d) biocatalysis and natural antioxidants.
&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.
