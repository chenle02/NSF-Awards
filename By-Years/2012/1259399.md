This project provides scholarships to 30 students to obtain baccalaureate
degrees in biology at the University of Miami following transfer from Miami Dade
College. It builds on an established and successful transfer program between a
community college and a research university and ensures that academically
talented scholars have financial and other support to persist and excel in
regionally and nationally important STEM fields. In addition to scholarships,
students are being supported comprehensively through seminars and professional-
development workshops, faculty advising, peer mentoring, research and conference
opportunities, and parental/family outreach. The intellectual merit of this
project lies in the well-planned activities and strong collaborative
relationship between the partnering institutions. The broader impact lies in
promoting STEM degree attainment by high-ability, financially needy students,
many first in family to attend college and/or from underrepresented minorities.
The project is also serving as a model for other institutions in achieving
transformation, not only for the individual students, but in integrating an
undertapped pool of talent into the broader scientific and economic enterprise.
