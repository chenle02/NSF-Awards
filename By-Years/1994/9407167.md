9407167 Eftink In the last grant period we developed a multi-dimensional
spectrophotometer, which enables the simultaneous and automated measurement of
multiple types of optical data (circular dichroism, fluorescence, absorbance and
light scattering) as a function of temperature, added denaturant, or hydrostatic
pressure. It is proposed to further develop this method by adding full spectral
fluorescence detection (via an intensified diode array) and by adding the
capability of automatic pH (or specific ion) measurement during titration
experiments. Additionally we will add a stopped flow accessory to this
instrument to enable multi-dimensional monitoring of the time course of the
folding/unfolding of macromolecules. %%% It is proposed to extend our studies of
the thermodynamics of protein folding by systematically perturbing proteins in
ways that are expected to lead to observable populations of folding
intermediates, with emphasis on the continued development of new, multi-
dimensional spectroscopic methods. We will use these multi-dimensional methods
to study the unfolding of selected proteins, which are selected because a) they
represent examples of different folding motifs (i.e., alpha helix bundle, beta
sheet structure, eight stranded alpha/beta barrel, mixed alpha/beta structures
having sub-domains, homodimeric proteins) and because b) they show evidence for
a multi-phasic transition under certain conditions. Our intent is to
characterize the free energy of coupling between domains/subunits and to
appreciate the type of perturbations that affect the interactions between
domains/subunits. A second goal is to continue to develop our multi-dimensional
spectrophotometer and related methods, to extend our ability to obtain
equilibrium and kinetics data for the folding/unfolding of proteins in a multi-
dimensional manner. ***
