Probabilistic methods in Computer Science range from design of algorithms to
analysis of typical behavior of algorithms to proving lower bounds in complexity
theory. This research will concentrate on a number of specific problems where
application of the probabilistic method seems promising. The questions include
graph algorithms (finding approximation algorithms for the coloring problem and
the independent set size problem), parallel sorting (in the so-called PRAM
model), as well as algebraic questions (diameter of Cayley graphs), problems in
circuit complexity (non-linear lower bounds), and complexity of on-line
algorithms. Based on past experience, the asymptotic combinatorial tools are
expected to be applicable more broadly, beyond the problems stated.
