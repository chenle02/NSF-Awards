This project is creating a support network for alternatively certified science
teachers in middle and secondary schools. Science and education faculty at
George Mason University are collaborating with teachers and administrators in
the Fairfax County Public Schools and Prince William County Public Schools to
enhance the quality of teaching of beginning middle and high school science
teachers who are provisionally licensed, to increase the retention rate of these
career changers, and to conduct longitudinal research to determine what makes
the most significant difference in retention. The Teacher Support Network
includes teaching mentors, coaches, academic mentors, basic and advanced science
or mathematics methods courses for new teachers, and a website to provide
resources for meeting the needs of diverse learners and for using technology in
teaching. &lt;br/&gt;
