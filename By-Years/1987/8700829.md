The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus
Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, Lie
theory has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself and theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics. The
representation theory of a class of such groups called semi-simple Lie groups,
is one of the most important and difficult aspects of the subject, as it is
interwoven throughout the core of modern mathematics and mathematical physics.
At the heart of this representation theory is the profound work of Harish-
Chandra from 1955 to 1968, culminating in his Plancherel formula which described
the harmonic analysis of square integrable functions. That work left open the
major analytic problem of the harmonic analysis for p between 0 and 2. In
technical terms this is the problem of characterizing the Fourier transforms of
tau-spherical functions for general p. Professor Trombi is one of the few
researchers in the world who is currently in pursuit of this difficult and
important problem, fraught with imposing technical obstacles, and he has the
best results to date. In earlier work, he solved the case p=1, and more
recently-under the previous award -- Professor Trombi completely characterized
the Schwartz space for general p, a major piece of work, His current
investigations concern determining the intersection of these spaces, simplifying
the Arthur-Campoli conditions in the Paley-Weiner theorem, and investigating
weighted orbital integrals. This is mathematical analysis of the most demanding
technical nature.
