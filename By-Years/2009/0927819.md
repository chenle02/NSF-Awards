The objective of this research is to develop methods to account for the effects
of material creep on the buckling of structural steel columns in buildings
subjected to fire. The research approach includes experiments on creep of
structural steel and experiments on creep buckling of steel columns for stress
and temperature regimes of interest in structural-fire engineering applications,
development of analytical and computational models for creep buckling, and the
development of predictive equations for creep buckling suitable for use in
design practice. The experimental studies will focus on ASTM A992 steel, which
is the most common grade of structural steel used in building construction in
the US, and for which very little elevated temperature data exists. Deliverables
for this award include a database of elevated temperature experiments on
structural steel columns; analytical and design models for evaluating safety of
steel columns subjected to fire; education of structural engineering students on
fire performance of buildings; and education of fire fighters on structural-fire
safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Columns are elements critical to the safety of
building structures, and failure of a column in a fire can lead to collapse and
loss of life. The results of this research will provide an important tool for
evaluating the safety of steel building columns subjected to fire, and will
contribute to improved practices for structural-fire safety design of buildings.
Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from involvement in the
research and from the enhancement of courses on structural-fire engineering.
Fire fighters will benefit from this award from training provided on the safety
and collapse risk of structures subjected to fire. &lt;br/&gt;
