9501397 Agler After the spectral theorem it is difficult to think of a theorem
that has had a more profound effect on the development of operator theory and
its myriad of applications to mathematics and science than the Sz.-Nagy Dilation
Theorem. The idea of representing a general operator in a specified class of
operators as part of a nice operator in the class has had many successes. This
project further develops this point of view with a primary focus on unsolved
problems in operator theory and the theories of one and several complex
variables. Hilbert space operators are infinite generalizations of matrices. The
infinite generalization of a vector is frequently a function and for this reason
Hilbert space operators are frequently modeled as the operator of multiplication
on a space of functions. This project involves finding models for operators.
Once such models are obtained many basic questions about the structure of these
operators become more natural. ***
