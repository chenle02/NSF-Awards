The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to reduce the loss of human
life and property by providing improved current and future information to water
management stakeholders. Rising sea levels and heavier downpours could increase
flooding costs in coastal communities by $23 billion per year by mid-century.
Traditional water monitoring sensors have major drawbacks, such as: constant
maintenance, costly installation, and application-specific dedicated hardware.
Continuous monitoring of flood prone areas and optimized water management for
freshwater conservation requires new technologies, including low-cost and robust
water control systems to limit the loss of human lives, crops, property, and
livestock. The proposed system in this project will offer a robust solution to
monitor water and make weather predictions using deep learning algorithms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR project proposes to develop a cost-effective
smart camera-based solution to perform a highly accurate risk assessment of
flooding in public waterways.A key innovation is running sophisticated computer
vision algorithms on a resource-limited platform. The proposed system will use
low-cost LIDARs, generally used for measuring solid object velocities, for water
velocity measurements. Furthermore, the project will develop a polarized-light
system to achieve the system accuracy requirements, including real-time
corrections of errors induced by visual impairments of the camera due to field
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
