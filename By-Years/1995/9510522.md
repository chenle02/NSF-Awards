History offers two contrasting lessons on the linkage between democratic
continuity and the advocacy of racist ideology. First, the general defense of
democracy requires that democratic governments embrace strong, effective, legal
means to confine the contagion of racism. Second, the surest means for the
survival of democracy is through the vigorous defense of the principle of free
expression. Which of these lessons is the truest account of the resiliency of
democracy to racist ideologies? To date there has been no scientific analysis of
the comparative effectiveness of different legal standards in terms of their
ability to diminish discriminatory behavior and to secure an appropriate range
of democratic rights for individuals and groups. This research compares the
responses of French and United States citizens to hateful speech, and to the
legal conditions that would permit or prohibit such expression. Survey based
experiments as well as focus groups will be conducted in these two countries.
