A laboratory is being developed which will provide more interdisciplinary
approaches in the Calculus and Finite Mathematics courses, and which will
incorporate interdisciplinary strategies and corresponding use of technology
into other major and service courses. The instructional strategies employed
within the undergraduate courses will more effectively demonstrate the real-life
applications of mathematics and statistics via scientific experimentation and
data-gathering and
