Work will be done on problems related to geometric function theory. This
expression refers to the analysis of univalent analytic functions of a complex
variable by means of their geometric mapping properties. Much of the planned
work pursues new directions which have developed in the field since the
resolution of the Bieberbach conjecture in 1984. One direction concerns the
nature of the logarithmic coefficients of a univalent function. Estimates of
their sums and weighted sums played a crucial role in the above mentioned
result. But best- possible inequalities were not obtained. Work will be done in
seeking the sharpest forms for these coefficients. If this can be resolved it
will provide a solution to the still unsettled problem of estimating consecutive
coefficients of univalent functions. A second thrust will be made in the
direction of coefficient regions: analyzing finite sequences of coefficients and
the n- dimensional sets they fill out. One specific goal is to demonstrate that
these coefficient regions (actually, their convex hulls) have no ridges or
spires. This will be accomplished by demonstrating that a univalent function
which is extreme for two or more linear functionals must reduce to a rotation of
a fundamental extremal function known as the Koebe function. Work will also
continue on questions arising in harmonic rather than analytic mappings. There
are natural applications to minimal surface theory in such studies. The
principal investigator is particularly interested in the growth and distortion
of such maps. Although there are a number of interesting questions worth
considering, emphasis must be placed on the development of an effective
variational method within the various classes of mappings. Some progress has
been made toward this end via the Poisson representation of harmonic functions.
Applications of this work are made to potential theory and grid design in
numerical solutions of partial differential equations.
