This project focusses on modeling (constructing mathematical and computer models
to gain understanding of phenomena) as the subject matter with the use of
cooperative learning groups to enhance the efforts of students. Participants in
the workshop will be prepared to include a module on modeling in present
science/math courses and/or to develop a course on modeling for their program.
The one-week summer training will give instructors a background and practice in
modeling and working in cooperative relationships, take them through the module
they would use as a guide for their teaching, have them develop more specific
examples and lessons for translating the module into their setting, and build
networking within and across teams and across teams. Follow-up will include
electronic bulletin board exchange of information, a newsletter from the Center
and visits from project staff to provide feedback and assistance.
