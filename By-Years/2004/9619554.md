Flexible and approximate computation considers how to allocate limited
computation resources and trade solution quality for reduced computational cost
in order to optimize overall performance of an autonomous system or agent. The
goal of this research is to develop general, effective, and efficient methods
for flexible and approximate computation. The approach, based on heuristic
state-space search, consists of a set of reductions that help to restrict search
effort to the most promising areas of a problem space. Specifically, a state-
space reduction is a process of reducing a state space that is difficult to
search into a less complex state space that is easier to explore and more likely
to contain high-quality solutions. After reduction, the optimal goal in the
reduced state space is found and used as an approximate solution to the original
problem. Better solutions can be found incrementally, with refined reduction
processes. One important issue in flexible computation is to find performance
profiles of a computation which measure system performance in terms of required
computation resources. This research also considers how to construct closed-form
performance profiles by analyzing the expected complexity of state-space search
algorithms. The results of this research will provide effective methods for
real-time scheduling and on-line searching, and provide intrinsic insight into
the computational behavior of state-space search methods.
