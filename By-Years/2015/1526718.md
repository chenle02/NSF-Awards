Branchless banking brings much-needed financial services to the unbanked in both
the developing and developed worlds. Leveraging ubiquitous cellular networks,
these services are now being deployed as smart phone apps, providing an
electronic payment infrastructure where alternatives such as credit
cards generally do not exist. Over 30% of the GDP in many such nations can now
be attributed to branchless banking applications, many of which now perform more
transactions per month than traditional payment processors including PayPal.
Although widely marketed as a more secure option to cash, these applications are
generally not subject to the traditional regulations applied in the financial
sector, leaving doubt as to the veracity of such claims. Accordingly, very
little is known about the technical security of this revolution in financial
services, let alone how it will interact with the financial infrastructure of
the developed world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is conducting the first
in-depth security analysis of branchless banking applications and their emerging
web interfaces. The project is evaluating the current state of security in such
systems and developing financial applications with stronger security
characteristics.
