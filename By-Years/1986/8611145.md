Partial funding is provided in support of a national conference of core drilling
for ultradeep scientific targets. The conference is organized by the Engineering
Foundation in cooperation with the Minneosta Geological Survey, ARCO Resources
Technology, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. The purpose of this conference
is to examine the state-of-the-art of core drilling technology, discuss
engineering research challenges in ultradeep drilling, and stimulate the
scientific interest in systematic investigations of engineering research
problems associated with ultradeep drilling. The deep drilling program presents
many challenges in a number of fields of engineering research including
geosciences and rock mechanics. In addition to the scientific results, it is
anticipated that this conference will stimulate research and development in deep
drilling technology that will have far reaching impact on present practices in
deep drilling.
