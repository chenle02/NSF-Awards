9413186 Chua The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between
Dr. Leon Chua of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Tamas Roska of
the Hungarian Computer and Automation Institute, Budapest, is to determine the
basic quantitative properties of a cellular neural network analog processor they
have been working on together. Specifically, they will examine: 1) the class of
operations realizable with analogic cellular neural network instructions; 2) the
properties and conditions for spatially propagating and non-propagating modes of
operation; 3) the classes of partial differential equations representable; and
4) global and local processing mechanisms for their cellular neural network
analog array computer. Results are expected to contribute to our basic knowledge
of analogic nonlinear computing structures. This project in computer information
processing research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ***
