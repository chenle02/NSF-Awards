The insight and intuition developed over the past 50 years about how species
form in terrestrial habitats does not apply often to speciation in the sea. Two
new biological tools will be used in the study of marine speciation in order to
understand biodiversity in the world's most diverse marine habitat: the Indo-
West Pacific. Recent advances in biotechnology allow DNA segments from the
nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of four species of tropical sea urchins to be
sequenced. Previous results show that these species are the most closely related
urchin species known, and new sequence data will show how genetic distinctions
arise early in the divergence of new species. The data analysis will take
advantage of recent techniques that emphasize the genealogical trees of DNA
sequences. The parallel analysis of different types of DNA segments will provide
a unique body of information explaining the evolutionary events surrounding
speciation in the group. The results will be generalizable to other groups, and
allow an understanding of how and why the large number of co- occurring species
in the tropical oceans has arisen and is maintained.
