This work assesses the impact of the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster on
Americans' views about the fairness of decision makers and their willingness to
accept nuclear power decision making. The project focuses on the degree to which
such views are associated with attention to media coverage of the Fukushima
incident. The research involves a survey of respondents who previously
participated in polls about nuclear power in March 2010 and then again during
the late summer of 2010. This second poll took place just after the massive oil
spill that originated with the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling
platform in the Gulf of Mexico. An additional sample of respondents will be
added to the original panel to obtain a final sample size of 800 participants to
enable future research. The use of a partial panel design provides a unique
capacity to understand the reasons for any changes in attitudes about nuclear
power that occurred because of the Fukushima disaster. The participants in the
surveys are being drawn from an academic-quality, probability-based online
panel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the issue-specific value of knowing
more about nuclear power perceptions, the research addresses several questions
of relevance to risk communication researchers in the area of media effects and
the role of fairness perceptions on views about technology. In doing so, the
proposed research will integrate theory from past media effects research into
the sub-field of risk communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID proposal
fulfills the NSF RAPID funding criterion of the need for urgent support as well
as the other funding criteria of intellectual merit and broader impacts. NSF
reviewed this proposal internally.
