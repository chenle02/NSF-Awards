A Workshop on the Interface of Probability and Number Theory will be held at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on May 19-20, 2000. The workshop
will provide a unique and unprecedented opportunity for researchers from the
number theory and the probability communities to meet and exchange ideas. This
workshop is expected to stimulate collaboration between number theorists and
probabilists and foster research in areas of common interest. Topics to be
covered in this workshop include probabilistic number theory, uniform
distribution and discrepancy, probabilistic models in prime number theory,
probabilistic methods in additive number theory, and probability theory on
random combinatorial structures.
