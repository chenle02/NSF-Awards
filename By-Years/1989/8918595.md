Dr. Phillips will investigate the evolutionary relationships between the North
American, European, and Asian trouts and salmon. This will be done by obtaining
data on the DNA sequence of the ribosomal RNA genes using techniques of
restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Using these data a phylogenetic tree
will be constructed. This tree will be compared with trees obtained from the
analysis of other data including information on morphology, chromosomes and
mitochondrial DNA. All of the data will be combined into a single tree which
will illustrate the current hypothesis for the evolutionary relationships
between these important fishes.
