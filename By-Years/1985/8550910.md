The Maryland Science Center is sponsoring Science Discovery, an approach for
introducing science to 4- and 5-year-old children in a child care center
environment. Four different centers, public, private, inner- city, and urban
facilities, will be implementing this program in the Baltimore area. Qualified
staff from the Science Center will visit each classroom once a week prepared to
give a half-hour presentation to the children with the cooperation of the
teachers. Once a month, teacher- training activities will be held in each of the
four centers for the purpose of training the teachers in the content, skills,
and methodologies necessary to insure an ongoing program. Materials and
equipment necessary for implementation of the science lessons will be brought to
the centers. Follow-up activities developed by teachers and staff will be
provided each week so that teachers may have the teaching materials to extend
the lesson. In addition to the teacher training component and the support and
resources provided by the Maryland Science Center, appropriate curriculum
material will be developed by staff, teachers and science educators which will
be useful at the kindergarten level as well as for preschoolers.
