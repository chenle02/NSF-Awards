This project will consider robust stability and sensitivity of general input-
output systems that do not necessarily have the structure of a feedback system.
It is assumed that such systems are governed by operator equations which relate
the input, the state and the output, and which depend on a parameter. In
particular such or parameter can be the transmission operator of a system block.
Results from this project will improve available theory, and furnish useful
tools for the design of nonlinear systems. The techniques are general enough to
apply to mechanical, electrical, and chemical systems.
