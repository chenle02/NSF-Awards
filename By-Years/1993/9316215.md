9316215 Jansma The PI will participate in a collaborative research program to
investigate the rate and direction of motion of the Caribbean and North American
plates, as well as the intervening geologic terrains in the northeast Caribbean.
The PI and collaborators will reoccupy the sites previously occupied in 1986,
and analyze their new data to determine plate and microplate motions during the
intervening years. In this way they will obtain new information relating to the
driving forces for plate motions, changes in local continental margins and
associated sea-level changes, strain partitioning between the plates and
microplates, fault slip rates, and seismic hazard along the major fault zones.
