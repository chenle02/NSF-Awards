The research objective is to determine the practicality of the optical control
of chemical reactions in the gas phase and on surfaces using short, &lt;1
picosecond, laser pulses. The methods to be employed bypass the early
difficulties of laser chemistry using temporally short pulses and pump-probe
techniques and extend the notions to surfaces and chiral molecules.
