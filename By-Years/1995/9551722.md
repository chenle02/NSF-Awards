This project is improving the effectiveness of undergraduate instruction in the
area of fluid power actuation and control by upgrading the laboratory experience
mechanical engineering students receive in this area. It has typically been the
case that the laboratory exposure students receive has not fully illustrated
concepts or components related to fluid power in sufficient depth and in the
context of applications of current interest. This project exposes students to a
greater variety of fluid power components and systems, and investigates their
behavior in greater depth so that students develop a better appreciation for the
capabilities and limitations of fluid power in relation to other forms of
actuation such as electromechanical actuation. Applications of current interest
are also highlighted to better motivate students to investigate fluid power in
greater detail in the context of design projects and elective courses.
