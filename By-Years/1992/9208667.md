This award supports research in finite group representation theory. The
principal investigator will investigate the many correlations between group-
theoretic structure and the representation theory of finite groups. In
particular, he will work on Alperin's weight conjecture and Brauer's k(B)
problem. The research supported concerns the representation theory of finite
groups. A group is an algebraic object used to study transformations. Because of
this, groups are a fundamental tool in physics, chemistry and computer science
as well as mathematics. Representation theory is an important method for
determining the structure of groups.
