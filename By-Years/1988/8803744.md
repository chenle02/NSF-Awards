Over 200 instrumented buildings in the Los Angeles area were shook by the
Whittier 1987 (Magnitude 6.1) earthquake. The data recorded in these buildings
contains a wealth of information and many valuable lessons for design engineers
and code writers. Six steel frame buildings from five to twenty stories in
height will be investigated under this project. Using very detailed analytical
models and systems identification techniques the effects of the nonstructural
elements and cladding on the response of those buildings will be ascertained.
The nonlinear behavior, effective periods, effective damping, torsion and the
effectiveness of current modeling practices are among those items that will be
considered. This study would provide a careful evaluation of the current ability
to model the response of steel buildings including the effects of real and
accidental torsion and irregularities.
