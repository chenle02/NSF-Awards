Dr. Loucas Christophorou is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the mechanism for optically enhanced electron
attachment to electronically excited molecules. This research has important
implications in the potential design of light activated electronic switching
devices. Dr. Christophorou has shown, in collaboration with his colleagues at
Oak Ridge National Laboratories, that electronically excited states of certain
molecules, produced indirectly by laser irradiation, can possess orders of
magnitude larger electron attachment cross sections than corresponding ground
electronic states. With this grant Dr. Christophorou will perform research
directed at establishing the precise mechanism for this observation. Most of the
research will be carried out on thiophenol which has been the subject of the
preliminary investigations; however, the research will also be extended to
studies of photofragments produced by the laser induced photodecomposition of
carbon disulfide.
