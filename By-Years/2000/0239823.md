This project involves long-term measurements of semi-volatile organic compounds
(SOC) at selected locations in the U.S. Northwest, including a site routinely
sampling the free troposphere. The objectives of this project include using SOC
molecular tracer data to more completely characterize long-range transport of
emissions from Asia across the Pacific Ocean, and investigating whether pristine
ecosystems at high latitudes and elevations are affected by deposition of
anthropogenic SOC. A variety of analytical techniques will be used to identify
the characteristics and origin of the hi-volume ambient samples acquired,
addressing a current void in semi-continuous data of this type available as
tracers of intercontinental atmospheric transport. The importance of Asian
emissions on intercontinental transport and global cycling of organic pollutants
is timely and important, and results are likely to have policy relevance. The
project will provide professional training for two graduate students and
research experience for up to five undergraduates. The educational component of
this CAREER award involves educational outreach to K-12 students and their
teachers, including those from underrepresented ethnic groups. This project is
the first NSF award to this new-start female faculty member.
