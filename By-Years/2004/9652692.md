Glaser 9652692 Chemical and Physical Controls on Transport Processes in Large
Peatlands Northern peatlands represent an important source and sink for
greenhouse gases. Attempts to estimate these fluxes of greenhouse gases between
the atmosphere and biosphere and relate them to global change, however, are
limited by uncertainties regarding the material properties of peat. These
parameters are difficult to quantify by traditional methods, which alter the
delicate fabric of peat and are incapable of resolving the three dimensional
(3D) structure of peat pores. Current estimates for the porosity of peat
deposits and their release of greenhouse gases may therefore have errors in
excess of several orders of magnitude. A new approach for determining the fine
structure of porous materials is Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI). The investigators will use these techniques in
conjunction with visualization software to quantify 1) the 3D pore structure, 2)
structural changes produced by laboratory experiments, and 3) production of
greenhouse gases in peat cores. These values can then be used to model the role
of peatlands in global change.
