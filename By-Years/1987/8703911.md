This research investigates the use of meta-interpreters for building expert
systems in Prolog. An expert system is conceived as a knowledge base and a
collection of simple meta-interpreters. Two main issues will are addressed: how
to 'mix in' a meta-interpreter into a Prolog program, so that the program is
imbued with the functionality of the meta-interpreter, and how to combine the
effects of several meta-interpreters. Building on earlier work, a classification
of meta-interpreters will be developed to facilitate combination. Expert systems
would then be developed by building the knowledge base, describing extra
features with meta-interpreters, combining them to produce a new
metainterpreter, and then mixing the new meta-interpreter into the knowledge
base. The necessary tools and techniques for facilitating such system
development will be investigated and implemented. The importance of this work is
its contribution to building expert systems with extensive knowledge bases which
are still humanly manageable and interpretable.
