This is a project to improve techniques in the acquisition and analysis of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) from seawater. CRC's are useful indicators of
circulation and mixing in the ocean, and will become common tracers in the
physical oceanographic community soon. This PI will investi- gate methods to
lowerthe contamination in the sample bottles, and in the on-board analysis. Hre
will test a number of bottle materials, and will design and test more automated
analysis procedure. Tests will be made at sea to demonstrate the efficacy of the
improvements. Additionally, he will participate in a cruise to the Black Sea to
obtain data for analysis of mixing and overturning processes.
