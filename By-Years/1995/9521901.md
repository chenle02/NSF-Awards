9521901 Kornegay This research program involves the characterization of surface
and buried channel MOSFET devices fabricated in SiC - a wide bandgap
semiconductor which shows promise for high temperature power and control
electronics. The program proposes to examine test patterns to extract device
modeling parameters for surface channel SiC devices and ion-implanted SiC buried
channel devices. These modeling parameters will be used in modified simulation
programs to model analog and digital circuits suitable for high-temperature
operation. The program emphasizes the use of enhancement-depletion (ED)
technology in SiC and extraction of modeling parameters over an extended
temperature range. ***
