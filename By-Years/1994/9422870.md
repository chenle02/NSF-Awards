The PI proposes to investigate the role of ambiguity in multi-attribute decision
making. Although most prior research has found ambiguity aversion in decision
making, this PI has found ambiguity seeking using medical decision making
scenarios. This research program will attempt to discover whether the ambiguity
seeking behavior will generalize to non-medical situations. Ambiguity will be
created in various ways in the scenarios, the scenarios will differ in their
number of attributes, the salience of the ambiguity will be varied, and the
information processing load on the subjects will be manipulated. In addition,
the PI will investigate the location of the status quo and the influence of
decision goals with regard to the subjects' reaction to ambiguity.
