Abstract

Award: DMS-0604775 Principal Investigator: Tamas Hausel

This proposal aims to understand the global analysis, geometry, topology and
arithmetic of complete hyperkaehler manifolds of non-compact type and find
exciting applications in other fields of mathematics and physics, where these
manifolds naturally appear. The proposed research has therefore two main
aspects: studying fundamental questions for non-compact hyperkaehler manifolds,
such as Hodge theory and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and applying these
methods in other fields. The hyperkaehler spaces appearing in this proposal
include: moduli spaces of Yang-Mills instantons on asymptotically locally
Euclidean gravitational instantons; more generally Nakajima's quiver varieties;
toric hyperkaehler varieties; moduli spaces of magnetic monopoles on R^3; moduli
spaces of Higgs bundles on a Riemann surface; and more generally hyperkaehler
spaces appearing in the non-Abelian Hodge theory of a curve (like moduli of flat
GL(n,C)-connections and character varieties) and in the Geometric Langlands
Program. The fields of applications include: combinatorics, representation
theory, finite group theory, low dimensional topology, number theory,
mathematical physics and string theory.

What is common in (1) the existence of a magnet with a single pole (2) the
reliability of computer networks and (3) code theory and code breaking? My
research provides an answer: these scientific problems can all be attacked using
quaternionic geometry. Quaternions are four dimensional analogues of complex
numbers. For problem (1) one can study magnetic monopoles using quaternionic
equations. The possible existence of these and similar elementary particles
could lead to new energy sources. For (2) the proposed research shows that the
number of holes on a certain quaternionic surface attached to a graph agrees
with the reliability polynomial of a computer network based on the graph.
Qualitative properties of this reliability polynomial, obtained from the study
of the geometry of quaternionic surfaces, help explain how to make computer
networks, like the internet, more reliable. In (3) arithmetic study of certain
quaternionic surfaces sheds light on the representation theory of finite groups
of Lie type, which are used in various schemes in code theory. Information
emerging from the geometry of these quaternionic surfaces, could help devise
better codes. In short, my research is two-folded, first it studies fundamental
problems in quaternionic geometry, and second it breaths life into these
investigations by applying the results to other fields in mathematics and
physics. This yields a colourful palette of various fields in mathematics and
physics all related in one way or another to quaternionic geometry.
