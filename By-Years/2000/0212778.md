0212778&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2000 Gordon
Research on Membranes: Materials and
Processes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award supports partially the participation by invited speakers and discussion
leaders from academic institutions at the Gordon Conference on Membranes to be
held in New London, NH, from August 4 to August 9, 2002. The sessions scheduled
for this year's conference include polymer membranes, inorganic membranes, fuel-
cell membranes, mixed-media membranes, and biomedical applications as well as
industry-university-government and international collaborations in the field. In
each session there will be two or three invited speakers. Poster sessions are
also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Conferences are kept small and are
structured to give the participants considerable time for discussion and
interaction. They provide a vehicle for communication between research groups,
which will be represented here by researchers not only from U.S. universities
but also from industry and universities in Europe and Japan. This grant is
specifically targeted to permit attendance by twenty advanced-level graduate
students and post-docs at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;
