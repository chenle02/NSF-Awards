This theoretical physics research revolves around the unprecedented
opportunities created by our experimental ability to measure and control atoms
and molecules. For example, individual atoms can be used as a clock to measure
time and space to an incredible precision, and are used in the global
positioning system satellites to enable location pin-pointing here on Earth. The
experimental advances drive the need for high-precision calculations on the
interactions of atoms and their ions with electric and magnetic fields. The
physical interactions between two, three and four atoms will also be
characterized through the development of novel theoretical and computational
tools towards improving the control of chemistry.

The massive set of data produced during the course of this project will be
compiled into a prototype atomic, molecular and optical physics database, called
'Atom Foundry'. Computational science and physics undergraduate and graduate
students will be involved in all aspects of the research including the
development of a website, designed around a periodic table, except that it will
access the Atom Foundry database. This will give other researchers more
information on how to manipulate our atomic building blocks for future
applications such as the ions used in quantum computers and the atoms used in
nanotechnology. All of which are part of the quest for the building of smaller
and smaller useful things.
