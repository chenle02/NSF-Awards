9223764 Nogami Fundamental aspects of surface electromigration(SE) of metals on
silicon will be studied using hot scanning tunneling microscopy(STM). The
instrumentation used and experimental approach followed will allow atomic level
resolution and identification of fundamental forces involved in the
electromigration process. Another part of the research is to understand the
effects of surface electromigration on overlayer growth, and to explore the
possibility of using electromigration to control crystal growth. %%% This
research is expected to provide fundamental new information about semiconductor
materials which are widely used for VLSI technology. State-of-the-art surface
instrumentation and methods are expected to reveal atomic scale features of
surface electromigration, a phenomena thought to be related to failure of
integrated circuit metal interconnect lines. The materials under study have wide
applicability in electronic and optoelectronic devices, and a greater
understanding of electromigration is expected to improve the performance of
devices and circuits made from these materials, and may lead to improvements in
the performance of integrated circuits used in computing, information
processing, and telecommunications. ***
