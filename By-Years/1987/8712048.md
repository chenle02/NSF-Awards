This grant will support an undergraduate student intern program at the
Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska- Fairbanks. The purpose of the
program is to give undergraduate physics majors experience in the fields of
geophysics research that are conducted at the Geophysical Institute. This
program will be conducted as an extension of the informal intern program that
has existed over the past several years, except that special efforts will be
made to recruit and accommodate undergraduates from other colleges and
universities around the United States. In this program, students work on a well
defined project directly with a principal investigator. Attempts will be made to
match student interest and skills with individual investigators at the
Geophysical Institute who are faculty members of the Departments of Physics,
Geology, and Geophysics, University of Alaska- Fairbanks.
