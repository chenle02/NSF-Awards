The research plans center on the following projects: 1) Numerical studies and
low-temperature electrical measurements of "confined" phonon dynamics in
semiconductor quantum-well structures. 2) Experimental and theoretical work on
the dynamical and pattern- forming properties of solitary space-charge waves in
bulk extrinsic semiconductors (p-Ge and n-GaAs). 3) Experimental studies of
quantum-chaos effects in irregular optical fibers using laser and image-
processing techniques.
