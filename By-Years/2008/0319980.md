This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a
reliable method to spawn yellow perch out-of-season, thereby allowing for the
production of two crops of fingerlings per year. Photothermal and hormonal
methodologies will be used to induce out-of-season spawning. It is anticipated
that the technology developed during this project will lead to the doubling of
annual fingerling production from existing farms. The greater availability of
fingerlings should markedly reduce their cost, and translate into greater
profits for growout producers.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of aquaculture.
