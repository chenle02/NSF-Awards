The PI will develop and analyze fast and accurate numerical schemes for liquid
crystal flows and for PDEs in unbounded domains, and produce a publicly
available high performance software package of fast spectral elliptic solvers
which will be a valuable tool for computational scientists and engineers. The PI
will also implement the proposed numerical schemes to investigate several
important problems of current interest, including in particular the coupling and
defect motion of liquid crystal flows, and the dynamic control and parametric
resonance in rotating flows. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes
will allow us to simulate these three-dimensional time-dependent flows with a
reasonable turn-over time.

Computer simulations are playing an ever increasing role in many branches of
science and engineering and are rapidly replacing much of the expensive
prototyping and testing phase required before any product is brought to market.
Consequently, fast and reliable numerical methods/software are becoming an
indispensable tool for many scientists and engineers, especially for
computational scientists in fluid dynamics and materials science. It is expected
that our numerical simulations will contribute towards better understandings of
the complex physical and mathematical problems, and provide valuable information
for the design of advanced materials and of turbo-machinery.
