This research is on conceptual structures used in IC and digital system design.
It explores aspects of digital design in a functional algebra, a theory chosen
for its simplicity, its power and its affinity to digital hardware description.
Fundamental abstractions of digital engineering are formalized in order to
expose principles for integrating methods and tools. Research is on obtaining
correct implementations through a sequence of algebraic transformations on a
specification. The synthesis algebra is being automated, providing a toll for
interactive digital design derivation. Experimentation with the algebraic
approach to synthesis is being pursued. Also, various decompositions of design
are considered with the object of distilling general principles for the
integration of engineering methods and tools.
