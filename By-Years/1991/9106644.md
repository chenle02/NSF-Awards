There is some amount of variation in almost every trait in every species that
exists, and part of the cause of this variation is genetic. The well known
forces of directional selection and genetic drift both act to reduce variation,
so its maintenance is difficult to explain, and has been a long standing
problem. The small marine crustacean, Paracercus sculpta has three different
genetically based male body forms, which affect their ability to attract and
mate with females. The proposed research will capitalize on this system to first
identify the precise mode of inheritance, then describe how the environment
influences the expression of the genotypes responsible for the different forms,
and lastly attempt to account for the evolutionary forces that allow the three
morphs to coexist. This system is uniquely suited to address these important
questions, because the genotypes and the environments are easily manipulated,
and the organism has a short generation time so that experiments can be done
quickly. Furthermore, the answers should have broad generality for explaining
the ubiquitous variation in nature.//
