0109155&lt;br/&gt;Knauft / Davidson &lt;br/&gt; The contemporary world if full
of cases of ethnic violence, where people who have been neighbors for years, if
not generations, turn to violence. Theories explaining such conflict have
addressed ancient animosities, political manipulation (especially during
turbulent transitions to democracy), and competition for scarce resources. This
dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student will test these
theories against the ethnographic reality of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, where
clashes between two groups, the Felupe and the Fula, resulted in violence and
forced removal of families from the community. Through participant observation,
structured interviews, household surveys and archival research, the student will
explore the definition of cultural differences in inter-ethnic contexts; the
modes of mobilizing ethnic solidarity; and the dynamics and trajectory of recent
outbursts of ethnic violence. The relative importance of kinship, inter-ethnic
marriage, land tenure, religious affiliation, initiation and socialization, and
cross-national ethnic alliances will be studied. The new knowledge to be gained
form this careful case study will be valuable to theorists of contemporary
ethnic conflict and will advance our understanding of this important region of
the world. In addition the project contributes to the training of a young social
scientist. &lt;br/&gt;
