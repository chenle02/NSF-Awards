&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide travel support for approximately twelve
graduate students to attend the Fourth Annual International Conference on
Optical Networking and Communications (OptiComm 2003: http://www.opticomm.org)
to be held in Dallas, Texas from October 13-17, 2003. The travel award will
target graduate students, since attending conferences is an important part of
their educational experience, and they often have limited funds. Opticomm is a
highly esteemed international conference series that have endeavored to provide
researchers and professionals with a cutting-edge forum to exchange and publish
their work and ideas.&lt;br/&gt;
