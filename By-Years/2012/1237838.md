The conference "Random Structures and Limit Objects", to be held on September
15-16, 2012 at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in New York
University, will use the occasion of the 60th birthday of David Aldous to bring
together a diverse group of eminent experts and new researchers, with the aim of
discussing and making progress on some of the most pressing research questions
in probability theory and related areas. Special emphasis will be laid on fields
influenced by David Aldous's works, such as exchangeability and graph limits,
mixing time of Markov chains and their deep connections with critical phenomena
in statistical physics and computer science, extreme value theory and Poisson
approximation, random trees and critical random graphs, stochastic coagulation
and fragmentation models, phylogenetics and biological models of evolution and
the notion of local weak convergence and combinatorial optimization.

The conference will feature eight talks over a span of two days, with additional
short talks by junior researchers and graduate students. Specialized
mathematical meetings like this are important since they give people an
opportunity to young researchers to exchange ideas and try out new theories and
interact with some of the pre-eminent thinkers in the field. This conference
will be an open meeting and will be advertised in the Bulletin of the Institute
of Mathematical Statistics, the Notices of the American Mathematical Society, on
the Web, and through a number of electronic mailing lists. A conference website
will also be maintained. The slides of the talks will be made available at the
conference website. If possible, we will also collect some of the core questions
and ideas that arise in the conference and publish this in survey form in an
open access probability journal such as Probability Surveys.
