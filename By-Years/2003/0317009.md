In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Norbert Scherer of the University of Chicago will
pursue a research program consisting of two parts: 1) investigation of solvent
dynamics coupled to photo-driven and reactive chromophores by means of the newly
developed polarizability response spectroscopy (PORS) technique, and 2) conduct
experiments that combine full-field simulations and time-resolved mid-infrared
(mid-IR) pulse propagation and pump-probe studies to fully characterize the
interaction between the solute and the solvent. Both parts rely on nonlinear
spectroscopic techniques and their goal is to examine fundamental issues that
affect the interaction between a solute and its surrounding liquid medium. These
issues are of fundamental importance and the results of the investigations
provide new practical insights into chemical reactivity as well as into the
methodology of measurement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be
conducted with the assistance of students and postdoctoral research associates.
They will thereby obtain skills and training in one of the forefront areas of
physical chemistry in preparation for either advanced studies or employment in
the scientific/technological workforce.
