The focus of this research is on the design, analysis, and implementation of
efficient algorithms and paradigms to solve problems in image analysis and
computational geometry on parallel computers. Specifically, algorithms are
considered for a scalable model of computation that provides a reliable metric
in terms of a comparison of running times between algorithms on commercially
available medium-grained parallel machines. The algorithms typically combine
efficient parallel data movement operations, paradigms, and data reduction
techniques, with efficient sequential algorithms. The concentration is on
problems with applications to robotics and image processing, including those
involving connectivity, convexity, proximity, area, intersection, and minimal-
area enclosing polygons, to name a few. The experimental component of the
research includes the porting, optimization, and evaluation of a large system
designed to solve an important problem in x-ray crystallography, over a wide
variety of multiprocessor platforms.
