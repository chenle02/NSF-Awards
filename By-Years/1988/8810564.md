This research investigates knowledge base machines, that is, computer systems
which support large amounts of knowledge in flexible form and allow efficient
retrieval and reasoning. The approach taken is to apply techniques recently
developed for text retrieval systems (such as signature files and special
hardware for unification based on cellular logic) to knowledge base management
systems. The combination of software development and hardware innovation through
Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) is particularly promising. The importance of
this work is that large knowledge bases are increasingly being constructed, and
it is critical to develop much more efficient means of accessing and utilizing
the knowledge in these systems. This award is being funded as one of the 1988
Research Initiation Awards for outstanding new investigators in the Computer and
Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate.
