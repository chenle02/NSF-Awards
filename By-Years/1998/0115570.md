Radio-frequency (RF) produced plasmas are widely used in industry for materials
processing, ranging from the hardening of airplane wings to the machining of
microscopic features within CPU semiconductor chips. The proposed work addresses
the difficult problem of uniform plasma processing of materials over an
arbitrarily large surface area through the use of a distributed source: an array
of smaller source elements, each covering a small portion of the surface. Proof
of principle experiments have been successful; optimization studies will now be
performed to determine the scaling design rules for plasma processing tools of
ever increasing size. Feasibility studies of uniformity control of large-area
plasma through control of the individual sources will be periDrmed by using
feedback control of the RF power to each antenna. Spacing between adjacent
elements within the array will be varied to determine its optimum value.
Permanent magnets will be used to create the individual magnetic fields that can
enhance the plasma density, and thus the plasma processing rate, from each tube
in a controlled fashion. Further optimization studies of the individual source
elements themselves will also be performed in order to increase their overall
effectiveness in a distributed array.

Successful results would be of tremendous benefit to chip manufacturers, and to
other industries that use plasma processing as well. A desirable outcome of the
proposed work would be a set of design rules for the construction of arbitrarily
large plasma tools that maintain sufficient process uniformity to be of use in
the ever growing plasma processing industry. Furthermore, the present use of
highly toxic substances in wet chemical processing of large area material
surfaces would be reduced, and perhaps eliminated, in favor of the relatively
benign plasma processing tools developed as a result of this work.
