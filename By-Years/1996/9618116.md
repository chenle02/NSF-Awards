Rasio, Frederick AST 96-18116 Dr. Rasio will carry out a program of research
into the phenomena associated with close dynamical interactions between stars in
dense stellar systems and in binary systems. In simulating interactions in dense
stellar systems, he will explore the effects of hydrodynamic mixing in the
production and evolution of blue straggler stars, the stability and evolution of
contact binaries, and the dynamical evolution of the cluster system. By
exploring interactions and the coalescence of binary stars, particularly neutron
stars, he will investigate the sources of gamma-ray bursts, the release of
gravitational radiation, the mechanisms of Type Ia supernovae, and
characteristics of extra-solar planets. ***
