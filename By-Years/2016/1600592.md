A coloring of vertices of a graph G is a partition of the vertex set of G into
sets (called color classes) such that the ends of every edge of G are in
different classes. The basic coloring problem is to find such a partition with
the fewest color classes. Coloring deals with the fundamental problem of
partitioning a set of objects into classes that avoid certain conflicts. This
model has many applications, for example, in time tabling, scheduling, frequency
assignment, and sequencing problems. The theory of graph coloring is among
central topics in discrete mathematics. It relates to other important areas of
combinatorics, such as Ramsey theory, graph minors, independence number,
orientations of graphs, and packing of graphs. Coloring properties of graphs
certainly heavily depend on the cycle structure of these graphs. The goal of
this project is to study a series of extremal problems related to colorings of
graphs and hypergraphs, where answers depend on the cycle structure. The plan is
to make significant advances in developing the theory of graph and hypergraph
coloring and studying their cycle structure. The project involves a number of
graduate students and young researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main
directions of study are planned to be color-critical graphs with small average
degree, list coloring, improper colorings, equitable coloring, bounds on the
independence number, hypergraph coloring, existence of cycles of specified
length in graphs with high chromatic number, Turan-type problems on cycles in
graphs and hypergraphs, existence of many disjoint cycles in dense graphs,
packing, and list packing. Work in these directions will exploit and possibly
develop recent advances in the field including the results of the investigator
and collaborators, in particular, graduate students working with him. Among
promising tools are the language of potentials and the notion of list packing.
Among expected results are enhancements of classical results on disjoint cycles
and on the longest cycles in graphs with restrictions on the vertex degrees.
