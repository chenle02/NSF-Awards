9317273 Matthews A combination of biophysical and genetic engineering methods
will be used to probe the mechanism of folding of dihydrofolate reductase from
Escherichia coli. Kinetic studies of this process reveal a variety of partially-
folded forms which appear in the millisecond time range and persist until the
appearance of the native form many seconds or minutes later. Comparisons of the
results of optical and NMR spectroscopy provide information on the development
of secondary and tertiary structure in these transient species. Variations in
solution conditions can provide information into the stabilities of these
intermediates and, thereby, the role of thermodynamics in driving the folding to
a successful conclusion. Mutational analysis pinpoints those individual amino
acids which play key roles in folding and, in combination with the kinetic
results, the step at which those roles are executed. Taken altogether, the
information obtained by these various methods and techniques will enhance our
understanding of the mechanism by which the amino acid sequence directs the
rapid and efficient folding to the native, functional form. %%% One of the
outstanding problems in biochemistry is the mechanism by which the amino acid
sequence of a protein directs the rapid and efficient folding to the native
conformation. A combination of biophysical and genetic engineering methods will
be employed to probe the structures and stabilities of partially-folded forms
which appear during the folding of dihydrofolate reductase. Underpinning this
approach is the rationale that an understanding of these folding intermediates
will serve to elucidate the complex mechanism involved. Success should enhance
our fundamental knowledge of biopolymers, increase our understanding of genetic
diseases, and lead to improved methods of production of protein products by the
biotechnology industry. ***
