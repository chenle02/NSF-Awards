This project focuses on two of the PI's current interests, thresholds for random
structures and asymptotic enumeration, with somewhat more emphasis on the
former. Roughly speaking, a threshold is the point at which some event of
interest in a random system becomes likely as some intensity parameter
increases. Understanding when this happens has long been a central concern of
probabilistic combinatorics and related areas, particularly theoretical computer
science and statistical physics. For example, thresholds have been a main focus
of the theory of random graphs since its initiation by Erdos and Renyi fifty
years ago. They are closely tied to the theory of percolation, a basic model of
statistical mechanics dating to work of Broadbent and Hammersley in 1957. (It
was, however, some decades before the connections between these disciplines
began to be appreciated). Asymptotic enumeration of the type considered in this
project is concerned with estimating rates of growth of various combinatorially
interesting families (e.g. graphs without triangles or functions representable
by k-SAT formulae) in situations where traditional generating functions
techniques seem to be of little use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several of the
problems considered in the proposal have roots in related disciplines (one
general theme underlying much of the material is that complicated structures can
often be usefully approximated by simpler ones), though the focus is primarily
on what appears to be mathematically fundamental. These problems are simple and
seemingly basic questions that have long resisted solution. Attacking such
questions requires one to go beyond existing methods, and to find and exploit
connections with other parts of mathematics. Despite the probable difficulty of
the main questions considered, recent progress by the PI and coauthors gives
hope of further developments and even full resolutions of some of them. There
are also many interesting lesser (sub- or related) problems that may prove more
tractable.
