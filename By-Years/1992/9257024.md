This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfields of bioanalysis and
neurochemistry. During the tenure of this five-year award, Professor Sweedler
and his students will develop the analytical instrumentation and methodology
capable of identifying and quantifying neuronal releasates from a single nerve
terminal and the contents of individual varicosities, and then use those
techniques to better understand the mechanisms of cellular communication.
Specific thrusts include the development of capillary zone electrophoresis/laser
induced fluorescence instrumentation and methodology to assay and quantitate the
contents of individual varicosities and vesicles; demonstration of the
capabilities of that instrumentation using cultured neurons; study of the
distribution of neuropeptides within individual neurons of the giant marine
mollusk Aplysia; quantitative measurement of the peptide content of individual
varicosities along a nerve process; measurement of the release of neuropeptides
from a single nerve terminal; and determination of whether facilitation in
Aplysia neurons is due to enhancement of neurotransmitter release. %%% The
successful attainment of the goals of this project will afford protocols for the
reliable quantitation of analytes in the zeptomole range, thereby extending the
sensitivity of conventional cell sampling techniques by over a thousand fold.
This research will also serve to further bridge the scientific domains of
analytical chemistry and cellular neurobiology, lead to a description of the
subcellular dynamics of neuronal signalling, and contribute to our basic
understanding of the nervous system.
