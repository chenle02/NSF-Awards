This award funds a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
at the Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences (KGI) for 10 students
each summer for ten weeks for research opportunities in biotechnology and
bioengineering. KGI is a part of the Claremont Colleges - a cluster of five
undergraduate colleges and two graduate schools on adjoining campuses in
Claremont, California. The goal of this REU site is to involve undergraduate
students in collaborative efforts between engineers and scientists in the fields
of biology, computer science, business, and ethics to effectively address
cutting-edge topics in biotechnology and bioengineering. Research topics will
include: microfluidics; bioreactor process optimization; microarray
technologies; DNA amplification and analysis methods; modeling of regulatory
networks; and rational design of multi-drug HIV therapy. In addition, some
students will be able to pursue ethics research related to the scientific
research at KGI. Students will be recruited nationwide, with a special effort to
attract women who wish to pursue a career in the biotechnology sector. This
program will introduce students at an early stage to interdisciplinary research
and help them develop the professional skills necessary to succeed in research
careers. The program is designed to aid in the future career development of
participants through career counseling as well as through mentoring
relationships with professionals from academia and industry.
