9402300 Dube Geometric algorithms arise in many application areas. The non-
robustness of such algorithms is of major concern. As geometric algorithms are
characterized by the presence of both numerical and combinatorial elements, non-
robustness problems here appear more intractable than in purely numerical
computation. Evidence suggests that current implementation approaches, based on
machine floating-point arithmetic, are fundamentally inadequate in dealing with
non-robustness. This project proposes to use exact computation for implementing
such algorithms. This is a fundamentally new computing paradigm that includes a
rich set of computational tactics. Initial analysis indicates that exact
computation can be quite effective for an important class of problems (the
rational bounded-depth problems). The two goals of the research are To establish
the practical viability of this approach. To investigate the theoretical bases
for exact computation. The practical goal involves the design of key software
packages, and to apply this to a significant application area. A new topic here
is the area of precision-sensitive algorithms, which promises to stimulate new
algorithmic research on problems which seems intractable using traditional
complexity parameters. ***
