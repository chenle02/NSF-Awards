CTS-9311781 Purdue University Charles Pidgeon ABSTRACT Funding of this
Engineering Faculty Internship award will allow the principal investigator to
spend time collaborating on the computational modeling of lipids in Immobilized
Artificial Membranes (IAM's) with scientists at Eli Lily. These theoretical
studies complement ongoing experimental measurements of the motional properties
of the immobilized lipids by 31P-NMR. IAM's have application in at least two
areas of potential benefit for the country. These include the formation of anti-
HIV synthetic membranes for AIDS prevention/therapy and the modification of
solid substrates for reverse-phase chromatography for the separation and
purification of medicines or medicinal components. s" Ã• FLW K PSFONTS K ! 89DECS
