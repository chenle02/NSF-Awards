A six-day workshop for undergraduate general chemistry teachers will introduce
participants to the LIMSport program, a cost- effective implementation of
computer data acquisition and reduction in the laboratory. LIMSport allows
direct data acquisition into a spreadsheet. Since standard hardware and software
(Lotus 1-2-3) are used, both the program and the individual student experiments
are easily shared. Faculty will have hands-on experience with interfacing and an
opportunity to adapt laboratory experiments to the LIMSport format.
