ACM Special Interest Group of Multimedia, ACM Multimedia has contributed
significantly to the advance of all aspects of multimedia research, technologies
and applications since 1993. Through the continuous efforts of the community,
ACM Multimedia has become a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication,
education, and interaction, including presentation and discussion of research
papers, participation in tutorials, demos, doctoral symposium, industrial grand
challenge competitions, and art exhibitions. All these activities provide a
unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and their
current research with internationally recognized researchers from both academia
and industry. ACM Multimedia 2011 (ACM MM 2011) is to be held in Scottsdale,
Arizona, November 28 - December 1, 2011 and is expected to attract many US and
international attendees from academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award provides support for ACM MM 2011 education related events, namely the
Doctoral Symposium, Face-to-face Meeting with Leading Researchers, the Open
Source Competition and partial travel expenses and registration for about 20 US-
based students; in particular, female and minority students and students
presenting in the doctoral symposium and participating open source software
competition. A Female Student Mentoring Workshop will be supported by a separate
funding from the ACM SIGMM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes
the opportunity for students to learn about the cutting edge research and
interact with experts in the top multimedia conference. The broad impact is to
train and develop the future generation of leaders and workforce in this
critical field, as well as enhancing the participation of women and minority
students in multimedia research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACM Multimedia
proceedings are published by ACM. The student award application procedure and
results will be announced at the ACM MM 2011 conference website
(http://www.acmmm11.org).
