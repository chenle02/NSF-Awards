Professor Gabrielse and his research group capture antiprotons produced in a
high-energy accelerator and cool them to only 4 degrees Celsius above absolute
zero. The collections of antiprotons are trapped and their properties compared
and contrasted with their more conventional proton counterparts. The ability to
directly compare antimatter with matter will lead to deeper understanding of the
basic structure of our universe.
