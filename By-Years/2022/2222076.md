Archaea are ubiquitous, playing important roles in most, perhaps all,
ecosystems. Many are found in extreme environments, imbuing them with great
potential for industrial applications. A subset of Archaea can significantly
affect the climate, while others may promote disease. Yet, we know relatively
little about their cell biology. The work funded by this grant will
significantly enhance our understanding of archaeal cell biology by addressing a
basic but critical question: What are the mechanisms that mediate archaeal cell
shape transitions. The cutting-edge tools used to complete this work, many
developed in the PIâ€™s lab, will provide scientists at all levels with an
excellent opportunity to gain new skills. NSF support will also help build a
more diverse and inclusive scientific community through an innovative program
exposing students traditionally underrepresented in STEM to research projects at
a young age and providing all biology students with a more holistic
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among Archaea diverse cell shapes have been
observed. For instance, Haloferax volcanii can form pleomorphic discs or
regularly shaped rods. The isolation of H. volcanii mutants forming only rods or
disks under various conditions allows detailed characterization of rod- and
disk-shaped cells. Using proteomics and advanced imaging of cells under various
growth conditions, proteins specific to each cell shape will be identified,
greatly enhancing our understanding of the regulatory and structural components
that govern cell shape. These studies could elucidate poorly understood aspects
of bacterial cell biology where, despite years of study, cell shape
determination, and associated selective pressures, remain poorly
understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
