This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable
design professionals and their clients to produce concise and accurate
statements of project requirements. The initial work will be done for the
architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. The proposed
requirements definition tool empowers businesses to develop on-line user needs
and analysis statements according to customers' preferences and to model, in
real-time, the type of constructed project desired. With superior understanding
of clients' needs, designers can shorten the product delivery cycle and provide
an end product with greater customer satisfaction.

The potential market for this innovation is since it can be used in any segment
of the AEC industry such as industrial, office, commercial, residential, hotel,
and education. Firms producing large, complex products-such as aircraft, flight
simulators, and telecommunication systems-have the same need for early, accurate
identification and statement of requirements.
