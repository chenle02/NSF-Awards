This research is to use the study of the S-P converted phase S670P generated at
the 670 km discontinuity beneath subduction zones to constrain the nature of the
discontinuity and its dynamical significance. After successful mapping beneath
the Tonga subduction zone, new areas such as the Izu-Bonin, Marianas, Java,
Japan, and Kurile arcs will be investigated. Moment tensor solutions, where
available, will be used to account for amplitude effects. This work has
significance in the current controversy as to the depth of penetration of the
subducting slab into the lower mantle.
