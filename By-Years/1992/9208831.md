This workshop is and NSF-initiated planning workshop to determine research
problems in the area of spoken language understanding that deserve future
funding. The main goals of the workshop are: (a) it identifies the most
important areas of research in speech and natural language understanding, with
particular attention to those not currently addressed by NSF or other funding
agencies; (b) to determine how NSF can benefit from other programs, such as the
DARPA speech and natural language program, and yet distinguish itself from these
programs; and (c) to produce a set of recommendations to NSF to help guide
funding opportunities. The workshop participants represent a balance of
researchers in the areas of speech recognition, natural language understanding
and human computer interaction. Participants include researchers with NSF grants
and researchers in government and industrial laboratories. The workshop will
consist of plenary sessions and breakout groups focused on three research areas:
robust systems; the interaction of speech and natural language; and human-
computer interaction.
