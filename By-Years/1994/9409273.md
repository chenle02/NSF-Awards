9409273 Ray The author proposes to investigate several open problems in
nonlinear time series analysis, with the goal of combining techniques from
nonparametric regression modeling and linear time series analysis and extending
them to the nonlinear time series framework. In particular, the author plans to
investigate the appropriateness of nonparametric regression techniques for
modeling nonlinear processes having very slowly decaying serial correlation,
known as long-range dependence. Modifications of existing procedures that take
into account the amount of correlation in a series will be investigated.
Additionally, the author will investigate appropriate methods of testing model
assumptions underlying the use of nonlinear regression algorithms when the
algorithms are applied to time series. The author also plans to extend existing
methodology concerning tests of nonlinearity in univariate series to the
multivariate case. Data-driven methods for obtaining full multivariate nonlinear
models will be investigated. Finally, the author will consider the advantages,
in terms of forecasting, of using a data-driven nonlinear model for data which
suggests a nonlinear generating process. ***
