A novel method for simulating experimentally the low Prandtl number natural
convection typical of semiconductor melts will be explored. Conventional fluids
with Prandtl number near unity will be subjected to thermal radiation to thicken
the thermal boundary layer. Visualization through streak photography will be
used to reveal flow patterns simulating semiconductor melt convection, since
such visualization is difficult to impossible in actual melts. This will
contribute to understanding and control of semiconductor crystal growth for more
homogeneous semiconductor crystals.
