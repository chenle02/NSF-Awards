Starting in 2010, the University of Hawaii's Outreach College will assume
management of the 22nd and 23rd Dissertations Symposium in Chemical Oceanography
(DISCO), a conference originally begun in 1978. The goal of the DISCO symposium
is to provide recently graduated, or soon to graduate, PhD-level chemical
oceanographers with an opportunity to present their dissertation research in
front of their professional peers and to forge professional relationships that
would facilitate their future research and academic careers. DISCO XXII and
DISCO XXIII will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from October 3-7, 2010 and October
7-11, 2012, respectively. Applicants eligible for participation in a given DISCO
meeting are those individuals who have received their doctoral degrees in ocean
chemistry within one year preceding that symposium or who are certified by the
degree-granting institution as graduating within one year after that symposium.
An applicant pool will be developed for the DISCO meetings from a broad
international announcement to chemical oceanographers at academic institutions
in the US and other countries, as well as an announcement in EOS magazine. From
this pool, agency personnel will select invitees. This symposium is jointly
sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration.
