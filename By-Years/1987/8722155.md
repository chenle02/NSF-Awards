The aim of this research is to investigate two novel device applications to the
propagation of surface acoustic waves (SAW's) and magnetostatic waves (MSW's) in
low loss ferrite films such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Each of the devices to
be developed can be used in frequency sorting applications; specifically in
separating signals of different frequencies into different channels. It is
expected that these YIG devices, with their unique feature of tunability, will
fill a need in the area of signal processing applications.
