DNA diagnostics are taught in the context of many fields within the Biology
Program, but reinforcement in the laboratory has lagged. The major goal of this
project is to incorporate into Cell Biology and Genetics a cohesive series of
DNA analysis laboratories. Together, these courses serve 150 biology majors in
the liberal arts or secondary science education each year. The laboratories
being developed demonstrate the utility of DNA as a molecular marker, provide
our students with earlier and more individual hands-on experience in a variety
of techniques, and relate to interesting issues in human disease. A new facility
is being established with six stations to do DNA restriction endonuclease
mapping, a thermal cycler to amplify DNA by PCR, a freezer, two
microcentrifuges, and a photographic recording system for gels. A novel feature
is the establishment of a network of three personal computers for data
acquisition and analysis. Students access and discuss human genetic disease
information found on CancerNet and OMIN on the Internet. With its focus on human
genetic diseases, the material in the new series of laboratories may be more
relevant and especially useful to secondary science education majors as a
classroom resource. Supplemental use of the facility can be arranged for select
laboratories in electives, for student research, and for a laboratory component
added to a nonmajors course in Human Genetics. One way in which information in
the facility can be disseminated is through the Internet World Wide Web page set
up for the students, the teacher graduates, and other local area teachers, to
whom the depatment can provide occasional workshops.
