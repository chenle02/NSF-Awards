This research will focus on topics in statistical theory and will be aimed at
developing new procedures in the areas of linear errors-in-variables regression
models and goodness of fit procedures. Both projects are in the general area of
statistics and probability. Errors-in-variables regression models describe
relationships among variables when both the explanatory and response variables
are subject to random error. Emphasis in this research will be placed on the
role of the reliability of measurements in determining the performance of
errors-in- variables regression techniques. Goodness of fit procedures assess
the adequacy of distributional assumptions or of structural models. This
research will involve a study of general multinomial-based procedures for
testing fit in categorical data.
