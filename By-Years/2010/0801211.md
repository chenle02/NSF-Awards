This proposal deals with many of the central questions concerning Fourier
transforms and how they manifest themselves on bounded domains or more
generally, Riemannian manifolds with boundary. In the context of the Fourier
transform on Euclidean space or the flat torus, topics such as restriction
theorems, Strichartz estimates (space-time integrability estimates for wave and
Schroedinger equations), and Bochner-Riesz means have been subjects of great
interest for quite some time. However, many questions remain on how these
theories should play out on a bounded domain. Here it may be appropriate to
think of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, and replace restriction theorems for
the sphere with integrability estimates on clusters of eigenfunctions. In this
regard, the PI intends to explore integrability estimates on restrictions of
these clusters to curves in the domain. In the case of Strichartz estimates,
analogies can be drawn with some of this restriction theory or a parametrix-
based approach can be employed. This latter approach is currently being used by
the PI and his collaborators to obtain results for general bounded domains.
Improvements on these estimates will be pursued for manifolds with a specific
geometric structure such as the unit disk or the unit ball. Finally, related
problems involving Strichartz estimates in exterior domains will be examined
along with applications to nonlinear equations.

Fourier analysis continues to be a significant factor in the development of both
mathematical and physical theories. In particular, it strengthens our
understanding of the partial differential equations that arise in mathematical
physics. The research pursued here expects to have several applications to the
study of wave phenomena and the equations which model it. These investigations
should yield insight on how the presence and shape of obstacles influence the
development of waves, a subject of great scientific interest.
