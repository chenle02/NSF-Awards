Multiple independent satellite remote sensing datasets indicate that the
Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is
losing mass faster than anywhere else in Antarctica. Thwaites Glacier, which
drains over a half a meter of global sea level potential from its catchment
alone, is one of the fastest retreating glaciers in the ASE. Although the ocean
is generally understood to drive rapid melting of glaciers in the ASE, the ocean
state and sea floor shape near most of the largest glaciers remains sparsely
sampled. These unknowns challenge efforts to validate coupled numerical ocean
and ice sheet models needed to predict future ice melt and sea level rise. This
project will acquire key new profiles of ocean temperature, salinity, and depth
near the Thwaites Glacier Tongue (TGT) from airborne platforms.

Data collected during previous collaborations with the Korea Polar Research
Institute (KOPRI) indicate higher concentrations of glacial meltwater and warmer
temperatures in the upper 300 meters of the water column near Thwaites Glacier.
Motivated by these results, this project will continue these helicopter-based
oceanographic measurements from the RV Araon icebreaker in 2023/24 to obtain
water column profiles near Thwaitesâ€™ grounding line. These new ocean state data
will enable the team to confirm their previous results, determine the amount of
interannual variability in this region, and evaluate ocean conditions in a wider
area near the TCT. Additionally, movement of ice in the two years between
observations will enable new seafloor depth observations from Airborne
Expendable Conductivity Temperature and Depth (AXCTD) sensors, adding to a
growing database of constraints useful for improving gravity-derived bathymetry
models. Through this deepened collaboration with KOPRI, the project will
demonstrate refined procedures and test new capabilities for helicopter-based
airborne oceanography in Antarctica. The PI will partner with the UC San Diego
Birch Aquarium in the creation of new polar exhibits designed to offer new types
of immersive and interactive experiences that capture active expeditions aboard
research vessels and at polar field stations.
