The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
significantly the productivity of software developers in evolving large software
systems. The proposed interactive refactoring Technology helps programmers to
semi-automate the process of improving the quality of large-scale software
projects by detecting, prioritizing and correcting design defects that affect
the ease of both understanding and maintenance of the source code of software
projects. In large-scale projects, programmers can spend at least 60% of their
time in understanding the code. This interactive refactoring technology will
significantly reduce that time which leads to higher productivity and much less
software bugs. The proposed technology will allow programmers to meet high code
quality standards when releasing a new software product and reduce software
maintenance activities that can consume up to 90% of the total cost of a typical
software project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is to semi-automate
the process of improving software quality by recommending refactoring changes,
using computational search techniques, instead of the current manual refactoring
tools support. Manual refactoring is error-prone, time consuming and not useful
for radical refactoring that requires extensive application of changes to
correct unhealthy code. This technology formalizes software refactoring as a
dynamic interactive optimization framework that provides refactoring-centric
interaction, enables refactoring and development to proceed in parallel and
collects interactive information in a non-intrusive manner that can be used to
inform dynamically the refactoring process. This technology recommends ways to
make code quality easy to estimate, improve, evolve and reason about. The
proposed refactoring technology has been successfully used by active programmers
in both open source and industrial projects. Based on the high performance and
low cost of the interactive refactoring technology, it may replace the current
refactoring tools in the marketplace.
