9403870 Yue The research covers several topics in dynamical systems theory and
ergodicity as to applied to Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature. Rigidity
questions will be pursued. The research has potential applications to chaos in
dynamical systems and entropy problems in mathematical physics. ***
