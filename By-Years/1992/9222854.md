In the preparation of superconducting powder (Tc = 110 K) in the Bi-system, the
precursor superconducting powder (Tc = 80 K) has similar composition and
physical properties as the 110 K phase. The objective of this project is the
separation of the 110 K phase powder after a significant fraction of it is
formed. Considering that there is no significant difference in the physical
properties (e.g. density, electrical and magnetic characteristics) of the 80 K
phase and the 110 K phase, separation techniques based on differences in such
properties can be ruled out. In this study, aqueous biphase formation technique
and selective flocculation technology will be examined to separate the 110 K
phase from the 80 K phase. Preferential fractionation of 110 K (or 80 K) phase
in the polymer rich (or aqueous phase) will be achieved using dextran, cellulose
and other synthetic polymers. Separation of the two phases by the selective
flocculation technology would also involve preferential interaction between a
given particle phase and polymer. The polymer examined would include,
polyacrylamides, polyacrylic acid and polyethylene oxide. It is expected that
the fundamental knowledge base generated in this study would be used in the
processing of superconducting powders, as well as other applications related to
materials production and environment.
