The Directorate for Education and Human Resources Programs (EHR) of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) proposes to organize and
facilitate the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Research, Evaluation and
Communication (REC) Principal Investigators and Contractors' Meeting to be held
October 27-28, 2003. AAAS will work cooperatively with NSF's Division of
Research, Evaluation and Communication to organize this one and one-half-day
meeting. AAAS/EHR will: (1) develop the agenda in cooperation with NSF staff;
(2) host the approximately 250-member PI/PD meeting; (3) oversee all meeting
logistics; (4) assemble "nuggets" from REC PIs; (5) organize a post-meeting
discussion with NSF staff to interpret findings from discussions and
presentations and prepare a brief report of important ideas that emerge from the
meeting and develop a set of research and evaluation questions related to issues
of importance both to the NSF Education and Human Resources Directorate and its
grantees.&lt;br/&gt;
