ATM 95-21761 ABSTRACT SHARON NICHOLSON FSU TITLE: "STUDIES OF CLIMATE DYNAMICS
AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN THE WEST AFRICAN SAHEL" This is a three grant to
conduct observational and modeling research on the climate processes over the
west African Sahel region which is well known for extreme droughts. Some of the
specific tasks to be accomplished are 1) Documentation of 20 year time series of
surface parameters and rainfall over Sahel using satellite data, 2)
Characterization of rainfall regimes, 3) Diagnostic study of SST- rainfall
relationships. The successful completion of this project will help in the
eventual understanding and prediction of west African Sahel climate.
