9714198 Wen This mid-career PI has been awarded a grant to continue his work on
various aspects of the problem of strongly correlated electrons. These problems
are integral to our understanding of the quantum Hall effect and the properties
of high Tc superconductors. This PI has been widely known for his innovative
approaches to problems, often bridging two components of his broad background,
particle theory and condensed matter. His specific projects include, (1)
underdoped high Tc superconductors, (2) random critical points and transition
between quantum Hall states and (3) non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states
and a theory of topological orders. %%% This is a mid-career PI who is well
recognized for original and innovative contributions to the physics of electrons
in very high magnetic fields and high Tc superconductors. In this renewal grant,
he is being supported to continue his work in (1) the special magnetic
properties of the materials, at doping levels less than when they are
superconducting and (2) some recent theoretical developments in the properties
of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects. ***
