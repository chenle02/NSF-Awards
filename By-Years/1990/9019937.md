This award will provide support to a group from the University of Michigan to
continue a research program in high energy physics. The group is participating
in a experiment (UA6) at the Super Proton Synchrotron (CERN) during proton -
antiproton collider operation. The experiment uses an internal hydrogen gas
target and studies high momentum transfer single particle production, focussing
on photons, production of e+e-pairs, and low momentum transfer elastic
scattering in both proton-proton and antiproton-proton interactions. The ability
to compare direct photons from proton-proton and proton-antiproton interactions
with the same apparatus yields a measurement of the gluon momentum distribution
in protons and the scale parameter lambda used in the theory of quantum
chromodynamics.
