9311512 Hyden Technical Narrative: This proposal represents a dissertation
enhancement project to be conducted by Dan Ottemoeller of the University of
Florida in conjunction with his major professor, Dr. Goren Hyden. This project
will use theory from the study of political institutions and political culture
to examine the potential for democratization in Uganda. The study will assess
democratization in Uganda through two mechanisms: first, by the appraisal of a
novel institutional framework, the Ugandan Resistance Council system; and
second, by surveying Ugandans for the presence of democratic attitudes. Project
funding will enable Mr. Ottemoeller to spend six months in Uganda collecting
data and coordinating surveys. Information gathered during this study will
provide a valuable description of the Ugandan polity. This project in political
science fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling a scientist early in his career to conduct fieldwork and collect data
in an international setting in order to enhance his dissertation and develop
collaborative linkages with African counterparts. ***
