Carbon fiber-reinforced in SiC whisker-reinforced molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2)
matrix composites have been identified as excellent candidates for high
temperature structural applications in oxidizing environments. However, the room
temperature fracture toughness and high temperature yield and creep strength of
these materials can still be drastically improved, and processing issues must be
resolved. In this Phase I proposal, Ultramet proposes to demonstrate the
feasibility of several fabrication methods for MoSi2 matrix composites that are
capable of eliminating the major sources of processing flaws and of greatly
increasing process repeatability and cost-effectiveness, while enhancing
mechanical properties. MoSi2-coated whiskers and MoSi2-infiltrated carbon fabric
will be fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with several alloy
microstructures, followed by properties measurements. These results will be
compared to available data for SiC/MoSi2, C/C, and C/SiC materials, and an
analysis of cost, reliability, fabricability, and performance will be conducted.
The most immediate application for MoSi2 composites for engine hot section
components, and industrial furnace equipment is another potential market. Also,
with upcoming EPA requirements for drastically reduced emissions, new materials
such as MoSi2 will be required in much greater quantities to withstand the
higher temperatures associated with clean-burning, low-Nox technology.
