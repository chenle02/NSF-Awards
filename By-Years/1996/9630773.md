9630773 Labhart A detailed analysis of transcription factor phosphorylation
resulting from activation of a signaling pathway is essential for a complete
understanding of signal transduction regulation of cell proliferation and
differentiation. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a moderately abundant
nuclear kinase that is activated by binding to double-stranded DNA ends and DNA
structures bearing single-to double strand transitions. DNA-PK has been shown to
have a role in repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, but its precise function
and its in vivo substrates are not known. DNA-PK has also been shown to
phosphorylate many transcription factors that are bound to the activating DNA
molecule. Yet, the physiological role of DNA-PK in transcription is not known.
DNA-PK strongly inhibits transcription by Xenopus RNA polymerase I in an in
vitro system. RNA polymerase I is the enzyme that synthesizes the large
ribosomal RNAs that -- after processing of a precursor molecule -- are
incorporated in the ribosomes. DNA-PK does not affect transcription by the other
nuclear RNA polymerases, class II and III.. Since DNA-PK is a central player in
this project, it is also proposed to purify Xenopus DNA-PK and to initiate the
molecular characterization of this enzyme. The investigator will address the
question about the in vivo significance of the repression of ribosomal gene
transcription by DNA-PK. He will examine whether there is a correlation between
the activity and subcellular localization of DNA-PK and the rate of synthesis of
ribosomal RNA during Xenopus oogenesis and embryogenesis. If DNA-PK negatively
regulates ribosomal gene transcription in the cell, high DNA-PK activity and
nucleolar localization would be expected to correlate with a low rate of
ribosomal RNA synthesis. Furthermore, he will attempt to inhibit the expression
and/or activity of the endogenous DNA-PK and investigate any effects on
ribosomal gene transcription, oogenesis and embryogenesis. The elucidation of
the mechan ism by which DNA-PK represses ribosomal gene transcription promises
to advance the knowledge about this nuclear enzyme and will help to eventually
identify its in vivo significance and its role in transcription. ***
