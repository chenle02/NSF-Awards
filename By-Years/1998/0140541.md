This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
program, will examine public attitudes toward civil liberties following the
attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In particular, the
researchers will conduct a national survey to probe how public anxiety and fear
influence support for civil liberties and personal freedom. The survey will ask
whether respondents are willing to limit their own personal freedom, the freedom
of people who are like them, or those who are different from them. It is exactly
the fact that efforts to constrict personal freedom are motivated by a threat to
public safety that allows the researchers to question whether people are
differentially committed to civil liberties norms. The study will test whether
during a time of widespread social anxiety, people view civil liberty standards
as universal or instead as more of a way to constrain the behavior of others -
in particular those who are viewed as different from the respondent in
ethnicity, race, or citizenship.
