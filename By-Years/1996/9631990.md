9631990 Smith The research team investigates how domestic conditions affect
international crises and how the outcome of these crises affects the domestic
survival of political leaders. More specifically, the researchers use a series
of game theoretic models to answer the following question: How does domestic
politics affect foreign policy? How do nations interact at the international
level, and how do the outcomes of international events affect the domestic
survival of political leaders? The international relations literature has
typically treated these relationships between internal and external politics as
separate, independent questions. In this study the investigators integrate these
three questions into a single coherent model. The investigation develops a
formal model to explain how domestic politics interacts with international
events. The researchers rigorously test the predictions of the theory. The
research introduces the International Crisis Game: A simple model that
represents the conflictual incentives facing nations involved in crises.
Augmenting this game with a model of domestic politics generates predictions
about the interaction of international and domestic politics. Specifically, the
model indicates how domestic conditions influence the outcome of international
crises. The model also predicts the domestic consequences of different
international outcomes. This investigation promises to substantially enhance our
understanding of the topic. ***
