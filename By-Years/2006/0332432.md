0332432 Childress Nanofiltration (NF) membranes are used in a wide range of
drinking water, wastewater, and industrial applications. The advantage of NF
membrane processes is that they require lower operating pressures than reverse
osmosis (RO) processes and have higher rejection than ultrafiltration (UF)
processes. Separation by NF membranes occurs primarily due to size exclusion and
electrostatic interactions and is therefore dependent on the surface and pore
properties of the membranes. Despite the increasing use of NF in various
applications, the transport mechanisms are not well understood and thus the
modeling of NF membrane rejection is still not very accurate. This investigation
will take a comprehensive approach to experimentally and theoretically
evaluating the effects of NF surface and pore properties on membrane
performance.
