0207658&lt;br/&gt;Kring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Continental
Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) is funding the drilling of a 2km hole in the
Chicxulub impact crater on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. NSF is funding US
investigators to analyze core samples from the Chicxulub Scientific Drilling
Project (CSDP). The Chicxulub crater is one of the world's largest impact
craters and has been linked to the mass extnction event at the Cretaceous -
Tertiary (K/T) boundary ~65 million years ago. As part of the CSDP Science Team,
the PIs will provide a general description of the core for the broader
scientific community, so that they can request appropriate samples for their
studies. They will also provide an initial set of detailed analyses to
characterize the impact lithologies in the core to better understand the
formation of the Chicxulub crater, its thermal evolution as it cooled over a
period of ~100,000 years, and the consequences it may have had for the
environment. The project will include petrographic, chemical, and isotopic
analyses of surviving target lithologies and shock-metamorphosed products of the
impact event.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
