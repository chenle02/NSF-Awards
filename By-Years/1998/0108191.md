This project aims to quantify the relationship of environmental variables to the
spatial distribution and abundance of forest tree species in montane forest
landscapes. Field studies will be conducted at sites in the western Cascades
(OR), the Sierra Nevada (CA), the White Mountains (NH), and the Southern
Appalachians (NC). These sites have exceptional baseline data sets that will be
expanded for model development and validation during this project. Complex
environmental gradients will be divided into component variables (topography,
soils, climate). Field studies will investigate forest establishment (including
dispersal), growth, and death in response to those individual variables. A
modeling framework will be used to synthesize forest response within and between
sites. These models will be used to develop regionally nested sensitivity
analyses indicating the relative importance of different environmental
parameters and biotic variables in governing ecosystem responses. The results of
this study will allow us to make more valid projections of possible forest
response to environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
