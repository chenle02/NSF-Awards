This project will investigate the crustal structure across the Eastern Aleutian
Arc by using ocean bottom seismographs to record wide angle reflections and
refractions from airgun shots fired during the acquisition of a multichannel
seismic reflection line. The data will be interpreted using two- dimensional
ray-tracing techniques. The primary objective is to determine seismic velocities
to depths of 30 km which will aidin the interpretation of the near-vertical
multichannel reflection data.
