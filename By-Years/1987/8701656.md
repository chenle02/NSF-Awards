Drs. Bernstein and Kelley plan a study of the time resolved photophysics and
photochemistry of molecules and molecular clusters prepared and isolated in a
supersonic molecular jet. The work will be centered about supersonic molecular
jet spectroscopic studies of solute-solvent clusters and solute dimers and will
also deal with time resolved (picosecond) spectroscopy of simple chemical
reactions and intramolecular dynamics. The molecular jet produces very cold
molecules and clusters isolated for easy optical spectroscopic characterization
by techniques including fluorescence excitation, dispersed emission, and two-
color time of flight mass spectroscopy. Cryogenic solutions are of particular
spectroscopic interest for the study of the liquid state, and solution phenomena
in general. Well known molecular systems can be employed as dilute spectroscopic
probes of the solvent, and the low temperature of the solution allows one to
obtain excellent liquid state spectroscopic resolution. It is possible to
observe spectroscopically the formation of clusters, dimers, and van der Waals
molecules; in essence, the preliminary stages of nucleation and precipitation
processes in solution can be followed spectroscopically.
