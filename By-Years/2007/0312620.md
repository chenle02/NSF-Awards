Boston University will host an international conference on "Milky Way Surveys:
The Structure and Evolution of Our Galaxy", June 15-17, 2003, in Boston,
Massachusetts. The intent of the conference is: (1) to present large area survey
plans and findings; (2) to discuss important remaining questions and puzzles in
Galactic science; and (3) to inform and excite students and researchers about
the potential for using large area survey databases to address key Galactic
science questions. The conference will have broader impacts on the astronomical
community at large and the public via the dissemination of findings and through
special efforts to engage other segments of the scientific research community.
This award will partially support participant costs, with primary emphasis on
providing assistance to young researchers. ***
