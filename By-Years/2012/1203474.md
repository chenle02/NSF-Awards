Abstract

Doctoral Dissertation Research: How Power Affects Empathy

This study examines the relationship between power, gender, and the ability to
predict human behavior, a phenomenon closely related to empathy. Specifically,
this study answers the question: Is the ability to predict another person's
behavior more affected by power, by gender, or a combination of both? The
project is grounded in social psychological literature and interdisciplinary
research on the role of non-verbal communication. Previous research has found
that women are more empathetic and are better able to predict the behavior of
others than are men. One possible explanation for these findings is that women
are socialized how to be empathetic, whereas men are taught to devalue this
ability. Alternatively, women may be better predictors because they usually hold
less powerful positions. Thus, women learn that predicting the behavior of more
powerful others can benefit them. Because men are, on average, more socially,
economically, and physically powerful than women, men may learn that their own
lives are not affected meaningfully by predicting the behaviors of others. This
study will explore the effects of power and gender by conducting an experimental
study of participants engaged in power-balanced and power-imbalanced tasks.

Broader Impacts This study informs our understanding of how power differentials
shape interactions between people. Findings from this project may be of interest
to the general public as well as employers and policy makers. Findings may also
have implications for how men and women negotiate professional relationships.
Findings will contribute to extant research by discerning whether accuracy in
role-taking is a function of individual attributes or structural position.
