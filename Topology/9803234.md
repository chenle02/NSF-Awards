9803234 Liu Modular forms and modular invariance have recently appeared in many
areas of geometry and topology. For examples, they showed up in the index theory
of loop space; in the computation of Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants; in
the counting problems of rational curves in mirror symmetry. They have also
appeared in mathematical physics and in the construction of topological
invariants of 3-manifolds. The investigator considers it very important to study
these new phenomena systematically and to find further applications of modular
forms and modular invariance in geometry and topology. Modular invariance should
be the key to the understanding of the geometry and topology of infinite
dimensional manifolds, such as loop spaces. The investigator hopes to combine
modular invariance and many classical techniques in geometry and topology to
solve several problems in geometry and topology related to modular forms.
Modular invariance, which is called the symmetry of nature by Edward Witten
(I.A.S.), quite often arises from mathematical physics, in particular, from
string theory. It is interesting to notice that the most beautiful mathematical
objects in string theory always have the property of modular invariance. While
modular invariance already has some very interesting applications in geometry
and topology, a deep and geometric understanding may tell us that modular
invariance is also the symmetry between mathematics and physics. ***
