Description: This project supports participation of ten U.S. scientists in "The
International Conference in Game Theory and its Application" scheduled for
December 18-22, 1990 at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in New Delhi. The
Indian organizer is Dr. T. Parthasarathy of ISI. The conference is planned to
cover the following topics: Non Cooperative Game Theory, Trade and Development,
Dynamic Games, Cooperative Games, Industrial Organization and Contracts and
Organization design. It is expected that participants will come from the U.S.,
the U.S.S.R., Western Europe, Japan, Poland and India. Proceedings are expected
to be published. Scope: Over 50 U.S. scientists have been invited. India is
expected to have a strong delegation from its well respected institute such as
the ISI in New Delhi and in Calcutta, the Indian Institute of Management, the
New Delhi School of Economics and from other universities. Some of these Indian
scientists have had considerable research careers in top U.S. universities. The
exchange of information is likely to be highly stimulating and to lead to new
research activities.
