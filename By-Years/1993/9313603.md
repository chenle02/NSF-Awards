Nancy Makri is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue her research in the development of propagator path
integral methodology. Makri is using this theory to treat systems with few
quantum degrees of freedom in a heat bath where the bath degrees of freedom can
be treated classically. This is accomplished by expanding the time evolution
operator in truncated basis sets and results in propagators that are valid over
large time increments and which do not suffer from the usual highly oscillatory
behavior. Proposed applications include hydrogen transfer reactions in (and on)
solids, tunneling, and non-adiabatic hopping probabilities of quantum particles.
A great deal of progress has been made in the theoretical treatment of gas phase
chemical reactions of systems consisting of relatively few atoms. Using state-
of-the-art theoretical methods, it is now possible to explain a great deal of
the experimental detail for such systems. However, the large majority of
reactions which are of interest to chemists occur in condensed phase systems in
the presence of solvent. The theoretical models for treating such complex
systems are in a much earlier stage of development. Makri is developing new
theoretical approaches for dealing with solvated chemical systems undergoing
chemical reactions where quantum effects may be important.
