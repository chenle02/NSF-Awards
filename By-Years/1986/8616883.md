This project involves the formation and characteriaztion of ultrafine magnetic
oxide particles using microemulsions. Microemulsions are thermodynamically
stable isotropic dispersions of water and oil stabilized by surfactants. Such
systems consist of 100-1000 Angstrom dispersed droplets. The reactions in such
microemulsions can be utilized to produce ultrafine particles of iron oxide.
With the precursor species solubilized in the dispersed droplets, the sollisions
and fusion of such droplets as well as the subsequent coagulation of primary
particles result in the formation of ultrafine particles. Previous research on
the coalenscence and fusion of such water droplets in microemulsions has
revealed that such coalescence can be promoted or retarded by the use of various
additives. The investigators have produced 50-500 Angstrom AgCl particles that
have an important relationship to photographic technology.
