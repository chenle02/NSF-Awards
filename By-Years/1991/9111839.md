This research is aimed at fundamental questions regarding the oxidation
behavior and structure of aluminum-lithium alloys. In the process of examining
these alloys, new characterization techniques are developed in the use of
Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). Specific areas being addressed include:
(1) oxidation behavior of aluminum-lithium alloys with emphasis on nucleation of
the oxide, growth phenomena, and lithium depletion; (2) lithium diffusion and
solute redistribution in the alloys; and (3) structural and chemical
characterization of intermetallic phases in the alloys. This research is
pertinent to further development of this important class of metal alloys, and
the characterization techniques being developed are generic to all materials.
The program is a collaborative research effort involving the Universities of
Chicago and Lehigh and the National Institute of Standards.
