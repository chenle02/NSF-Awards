Operator theory is a central discipline in Modern Analysis. Its origins lie in
the study of mathematical physics and partial differential equations in the
early twentieth century. At that time, it was seen that numerous physical
problems in the theory of equilibria, vibration, quantum theory, etc. could be
studied productively via the integral equations that model the phenomena. Thus,
from the fertile minds of Hilbert, von Neumann, and other giants the subject of
operator theory has grown to a central position in such investigations, and in
core mathematics as well. At the heart of this methodology is the deep
investigation of the spectrum of an operator. For self-adjoint or normal
operators, this theory is now a standard technique throughout analysis, and the
spectral theorem provides the necessary building blocks for all such operators.
The current frontier, therefore, is the study of the structure of non-normal
operators, as for example in the Fredholm theory. At this frontier, Professor
Carey and his collaborator, Professor Pincus, are world leaders with established
reputations for deep, conceptually innovative, fundamental, interdisciplinary
work. Their theory of the principal function, defined on the spectrum of certain
operators, is a broad extension of the ordinary index. This new research
collaboration has established connections between the principal function and the
distribution of zeroes of functions associated with ergodic flows, the structure
of subnormal operators and the theory of closed currents in the study of
function algebras. This work is particularly fertile as it directly combines
operator theoretic ideas with other branches of mathematics, notably commutative
ring theory and algebraic geometry. Currently, applications to the theory of
commuting Toeplitz operators and linear and nonlinear partial differential
operators are envisaged, among other technical applications in operator theory.
