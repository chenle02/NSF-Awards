9709783 Dilles This grant provides $20,000 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring a heating/freezing stage coupled with a microscope and video system
for use in studies of the physical and chemical properties of fluid inclusions.
A recently funded research proposal (EAR-9614683) will rely on data produced
using this instrument to constrain fluid inclusion trapping pressures to augment
isotopic and petrologic data in the interpretation of the temporal evolution of
hydrothermal fluid compositions and subsequent wall rock alteration that led to
the formation of the porphyry ore deposit at Butte, Montana. In addition, this
system will be used in combination with isotopic analyses of primordial helium
contained in fluid inclusions trapped in mafic phenocrysts and xenoliths to
yield insight into the petrogenesis of mid-ocean ridge and oceanic hot spot
basalts. Other projects that will benefit from this system include, studies of
fluid inclusions in metasomatized evaporite deposits and studies of fluid
inclusions trapped in diagenetic quartz overgrowths in clastic sedimentary
rocks. ***
