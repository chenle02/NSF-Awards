Engineering, science, and mathematics students studying calculus are using a
newly established microcomputer laboratory equipped with Macintosh IIs.
Materials have been developed that encourage experimentation and exploratory
investigation by the students. Classroom demonstrations and laboratory tutorials
will exploit the symbolic capabilities of the software, Mathematica, and the
effective graphical interface of the Macintosh II to enliven the teaching
atmosphere and to strengthen the analytic skills and geometric intuition of the
students. Institution will contribute an amount greater than this award.
