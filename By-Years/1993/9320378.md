9320378 Grier Technical abstract: The experimental program addresses the physics
of colloidal suspensions through a combination of digital video microscopy,
optical trapping, and laser light scattering. Systems to be investigated include
highly charged polystyrene microspheres and superparamagnetic ferrofluid
emulsion droplets. Areas of particular interest include: (1) precision
measurements of the interparticle potential; (2) analysis of structural and
dynamical processes responsible for phase transitions in supercooled
monodisperse colloidal suspensions; (3) analysis of phase transitions in
bidisperse colloidal suspensions focusing on metastability of disordered solids;
(4) effects of phase behavior of modulated substrate potentials simulated by
optical interference patterns; (5) microscopic kinetics of phase transitions in
quenced single-layer ferrofluid emulsions. Non-technical abstract: The
experimental program examines colloidal suspensions on three levels: (1) as
distinct states of matter; (2) as easily studied analogs for conventional
materials and (3) for their self-ordering properties which hold promise for
nanofabrication, nonlinear optics, and other advanced applications. Anticipated
practical benefits include (1) a method for determining the microscale
interactions in commercial colloidal suspensions; (2) improved understanding of
the "atomic"-scale processes responsible for phase transitions, particularly in
the technologically important case of rapid solidification; and (3) improved
understanding of the microscopic structure, dynamics, and phase transitions of
binary alloy systems. ***
