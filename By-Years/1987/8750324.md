The Chemistry Department at Eastern Michigan University has recently acquired
twenty four microsprocessors together with sufficient software so that computer-
based experiments can be integrated into the general chemistry laboratory. The
applications of computers being introduced include interfacing to
instrument/sensors for instrument control and data acquisition, simulating
inaccessible experiments and atomic-level phenomena, and exploring a chemical
database and mathematical models. Utilization of the computers in the laboratory
will be continued as students proceed to upper-level courses.
