This is a request to support a US / Japan Future Network Workshop. The Workshop
will bring together leading US and Japanese network researchers and network
research infrastructure developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring
together a diverse group of researchers from the US and Japan to discuss the
science and technology advances needed to advance our fundamental understanding
of the design, deployment and operation of the increasingly complex, networks of
the future. The outcome of this workshop will lead to a better understanding of
network research and&lt;br/&gt;network research infrastructure activities in the
two countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will result in more
efficient ways of how peer researchers in networking research and
infrastructure, from both countries, will collaborate and communicate with each
other. The workshop has potential for the development of individual linkages
between peer&lt;br/&gt;researchers in each country.
