This research is to demonstrate the feasibility of flow diagnostics with pulsed
laser speckle velocimetry in two-phase flow. The technique is non-intrusive and
provides simultaneous full-field velocities. It has so far been applied to
single- phase flow only. The feasibility experiment involves the generation,
motion, and subsequent collapse of a steam bubble in water. If developed, this
diagnostic technique would be highly useful in general two-phase flow analysis.
