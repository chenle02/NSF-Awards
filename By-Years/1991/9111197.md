Understanding the atmospheric boundary layer and the effect it has on cloud
growth is a fundamental meteorological problem that is important to a broad
range of atmospheric questions ranging from venting of pollutants to the free
atmosphere to the effect of cloud cover on climate. Observations have clearly
shown that clouds can form in distinctive and very organized patterns over
expansive areas. The Principal Investigator will continue his research on the
organization of mesoscale convection that evolves in time within the planetary
boundary layer as cold and dry continental air masses advect over relatively
warmer bodies of open water. The Principal Investigator will use observational
data collected from a previously held field program along with theoretical
studies and numerical models to ascertain important characteristics of the
boundary layer over Lake Michigan.
