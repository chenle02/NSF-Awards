The research under the direction of Dr. Coppens will make extensive use of the
synchrotron radiation facilities at the National Synchrotron Light Source and at
the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. A major effort will focus on the
structural analysis of modulated solids, in which the three-dimensional symmetry
is modified by superposition of incommensurate modulation waves. Such
modulations can strongly affect physical properties such as electrical
conductivity. In addition Dr. Coppens will develop further the experimental
capability of his laboratory at SUNY-Buffalo to carry out low temperature
measurements. This capability will complement the work at the synchrotron
facilities by permitting preliminary measurements to be carried out in a more
systematic manner. This research activity on electron densities and phase
transitions in molecular crystals is expected to provide new fundamental
insights in several areas. In particular, the understanding of electrical
conductivity and superconductivity is still not complete. These studies could
impact the search for new materials for electronic devices or for high
temperature superconductors.
