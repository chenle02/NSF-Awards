This project focuses on new areas and technologies within the rapidly changing
Biological Sciences. The mentoring program targets underrepresented youth and
will serve 120 10th to 12th grade students over three years (three cohorts of 40
each), providing one year of preparatory courses, a summer institute for career
exploration and lab orientation, and a second year of authentic research with an
AMNH scientist mentor. It takes advantage of significant new resources at AMNH,
including its new graduate school in Comparative Biology, and brings scientific
discovery to young people with an immediacy and informality that is rare for
students. The pedagogy will be active, hands-on, and developmentally
appropriate. The project implements and evaluates three major features that make
it unique among the small number of programs nationwide providing long-term high
school science mentoring experiences: (1) The program will involve AMNH
scientist mentors in designing and teaching preparatory courses that are infused
with digital learning tools, as well as the technological and computational
methodologies that the mentors use in their own research, including DNA
sequencing, geometric morphometric analysis, bioinformatics including remote
sensing technology, software for phylogenetic analysis, microscopy techniques
and CAT scan and cryo-lab technology; (2) The project will develop a mentor
training program through which Museum educators coach mentors on research-based
informal science education techniques, including inquiry and hands-on
experiences; and (3) The project will integrate biological anthropology, a
Museum strength, into its preparatory courses and mentoring experience.
