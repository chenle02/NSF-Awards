Alien species (those moved outside of their native ranges by humans) have large
ecological and economic effects around the world. Most studies of alien species
are done soon after the species appears, when scientific and public interest is
highest. However, the effects of an alien species may change over time, either
increasing or decreasing, as the alien species and the invaded ecosystem
accommodate to one another, or as the effects of the alien species interact with
other controlling factors (e.g., climate) that change over time. Results from
our long-term study of the effects of the zebra mussel (a European invader) on
the Hudson River ecosystem suggest that the effects of this invasive species may
be changing over the long term. Such evidence includes partial recovery of some
native species, changes in the size and geographical distribution of the zebra
mussel population, development of transitory "hot spots" where zebra mussel
effects are diminished, and strong interactions between consumption of algae by
zebra mussels and freshwater flow, another important control on the Hudson's
ecosystem. We propose to continue our long-term study of the Hudson to test
several specific hypotheses about how interactions between the zebra mussel and
the Hudson's ecosystem might change over time. This information will help better
predict the true long-term effects of zebra mussels on North America's
ecosystems, better understand the controls on aquatic ecosystems, and better
judge how alien species interact with the ecosystems they invade.
