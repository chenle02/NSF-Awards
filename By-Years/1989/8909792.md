Although gate matrix and functional array layout styles have received much
research attention, algorithms for these methods are not complete enough to
assess their design potential. The P.I. is developing a complete VLSI module
generation system based on these design styles and performing a thorough
evaluation of them. The system takes many design issues into consideration:
transistor sizing, timing analysis, physical-sized (gridless) routing and
layout, array folding, array partitioning, and variations on the gate matrix
layout. Research work includes: a new representation for dynamic nets, new
recursive min-cut algorithms, algorithms for performing net assignment in NMOS
and CMOS independently, a five-stage algorithm for compaction, a graph
representation for functional arrays, and algorithms for layout generation,
transistor reordering and traversing a reduced graph. A complete study of these
two layout styles is being performed, and the results evaluated against standard
design methods, such as standard cell. New VLSI design styles need to be
developed in order to design complex, high transistor count IC's. This research
investigates two new design styles, gate matrix and functional array layout
methods. The P.I.'s approach is unique in that he intends to answer the basic
question of whether these promising design styles are better than traditional
approaches. The novelty is in the concepts to be used in building a design
system that completely covers the design problem. The principal investigator is
a promising and competent young professor who should make significant
contributions to the field.
