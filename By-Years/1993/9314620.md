9314620 COWEN A state-of-the-art, fully integrated analytical scanning electron
microscope will be purchased for high resolution imaging in conjunction with
rapid and versatile elemental chemical phase and digital imaging microanalysis.
The school of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology has added many new faculty
in the last few years which have placed increasingly sophisticated demands on
our current instrumentation. The new analytical SEM system would provide: 1.
simultaneous optimal imaging and x-ray detection, 2. superior secondary and back
scattered electron high resolution imaging, 3. very high beam stability, 4.
advanced computer array (fast processor, large storage capacity) for efficient
data/image collection, processing and storage, 5. excellent stage automation for
high volume particle field analysis. The instrument will directly and
immediately benefit the diverse NSF-sponsored research programs active within
the Departments Oceanography, and Geology and Geophysics and the Hawaii
Institute of Geophysics.
