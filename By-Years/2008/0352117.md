The purpose of this project is to determine how the nervous system implements
principles of movement control. A computer model of neural control that is
capable of generating simulated reaching movements that correspond closely to
actual movements in both the dynamics of the trajectories and the acquisition of
a final position will be developed. With this model two hypotheses about the
control of human reaching movements will be tested: (1) multi-joint reaching
movements are controlled with a dual strategy that separately specifies the
dynamics of the movement trajectory and the final end point (or equilibrium
point); and (2) spinal proprioceptive afferents from spindles and Golgi tendon
organs are coordinated with gamma fusimotor control to provide simultaneous
regulation of the equilibrium point and the surrounding stiffness field of
joints, so that accurate and stable postures can be achieved. A recently
developed, structural model of single-joint movement control by the
investigators is able to produce simulated movements that are consistent with
experimental findings. Simulations suggested that one of the roles of
proprioceptive afferents in movement control is to regulate the equilibrium
point of the joint via control to spindles. The results also demonstrated that
movement trajectory can generated via a tri-phasic, pulse command to gamma
motoneurons. By extending the model to a multi-joint system, simulation studies
will allow determination of the demonstrated error pattern of reaching movements
by the model. The research fosters a multi-disciplinary approach, in which the
physiologically realistic, structural model is used as a means to interpret
experimental data and to test hypotheses on motor control. Broader impacts
include opportunities to enhance teaching in applying analytical methods of
science and engineering to the interpretation of biological data for
understanding sensorimotor control of movements.
