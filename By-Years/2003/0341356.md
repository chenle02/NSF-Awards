Computer Science (31)

Highline Community College (HCC), Seattle University (SU), and the University of
Washington (UW) (a two-year institution, a four-year private university and a
four-year public university, respectively) are collaborating on the development
of a Computer Security/Computer Forensics certificate program. By collaborating,
these institutions capitalize on individual institutional strengths and quickly
fill a void in computer security education in Washington State, a major center
for the software industry. Collaboration products include a six-course
curriculum and corresponding classroom software tools and exercises that deliver
a hands-on learning experience and effectively integrate technology into the
classroom.
