Experimental methods are performed to better understand the static and dynamic
domain wall structure of magnetic bubbles in (110)-oriented garnet films. The
velocity range over which a given domain wall structure is stable, the
velocities at which wall structural changes occur, and the types of wall states
that can be dynamically generated will be examined. The rotating gradient method
and a two-dimensional gradient propagation experiment will be used to perform
the study. The rotating gradient method allows the steady-state propagation of a
bubble and yields information on wall structure that is not available in other
experimental methods. The two-dimensional gradient propagation technique will
allow the propagation of the bubble in an arbitrary direction.
