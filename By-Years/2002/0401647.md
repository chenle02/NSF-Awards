This project is designed to build evaluation capacity among agricultural,
environmental education, and natural resource management organizations. The
mechanism for achieving this goal is an intensive summer institute in program
evaluation. The lack of courses addressing the contexts in which the target
professionals work produced the demand for the training. Development of training
materials including videotapes, case studies, and readings as well as summer
salaries and scholarship support for participants with demonstrated financial
need are the primary funding requirements. Faculty leaders in evaluation and in
the relevant disciplines will collaborate in the project. The workshop focus
addresses core competencies of all evaluators and unique content with respect to
multidisciplinary subject matter, indicators and standards for monitoring in the
target contexts, and hand-on minds-on instructional strategies. The unique
collaboration provides an opportunity for capacity building joining STEM
disciplines and evaluation methodologists in development of context-relevant
training.
