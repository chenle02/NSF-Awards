The hypothesis that proteins in aqueous solution interact with adsorbent
surfaces primarily via hydrophobic interactions will be tested by manipulation
of the hydrophobic effect at its origin: the ability of the solvent to assume
ordered structures in the vicinity of nonpolar species. This method is a
desirable alternative to studies of protein adsorption to a wide variety of
materials, where aspects of the surface chemistry other than hydrophobicity are
varied in an uncontrolled manner. As cosolvents with water, methanol impairs the
hydrophobic effect, glycerol enhances it, and ethylene glycol does not
significantly alter the effect. By careful selection of the experimental system,
constant protein conformation and adsorbent surface chemistry will be maintained
in the presence of the different structure- altering cosolvents in order to
assess the role of the hydrophobic effect in controlling adsorption isotherms
and rates, adsorption reversibility, and surface diffusion. While adsorption
isotherms and rates of adsorption and desorption reflect long time processes,
measurements of surface diffusion coefficients provide information about
processes occurring in the protein-surface binding region on rapid time scales.
