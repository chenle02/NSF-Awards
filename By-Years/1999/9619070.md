9619070 Tuthill This project develops an electronic campus that offers full
Masters of Science in Science Education from Montana State University to high
school science teachers nationally. Building on prior work and experience
offering graduate level courses on-line, the National Teachers Enhancement
Network (NTEN) provides content and methods courses appropriate for secondary
science teachers with the caveat that a full Masters program, including an on-
campus component, is also available. The project provides for the development of
the courses, the building of an electronic campus, and support for the first
cohort of teachers. Approximately 1800 teachers are expected to participate in
courses over the life of the project. In addition to a wide range of course,
NTEN offers access to scientists and science resources, provides professional
networking support, gives access to an electronic bookstore, and maintains close
ties to the Science Education Standards, Headline Science Seminars and a Faculty
Associates program. Cost sharing is 30%.
