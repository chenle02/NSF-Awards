In this project, the investigators will continue the operation of a World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Data Management Unit, and expand its activities to
meet the needs of WOCE. During the past two years, the Data Management Unit has
been developed to provide the means for tracking datasets, to serve as an
information center for US WOCE, and to act as a central activity to stimulate
and coordinate the development of a data management system for WOCE. during the
next two years, in addition to expanding the dissemination of WOCE project
information, the P.I.'s will work closely with the WOCE scientific steering
committee and other WOCE scientists to provide expanded and easier access to a
growing number of oceanographic data sets.
