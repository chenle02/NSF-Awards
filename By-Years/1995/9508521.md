With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program
supports research on odd-electron organometallic compounds by Dr. Rinaldo Poli
of the Chemistry Department, University of Maryland at College Park. Dr. Poli
will prepare new organometallic compounds of molybdenum, chromium, vanadium, and
tungsten which contain 15 or 17 electrons and investigate their reactivity using
EPR and other methods. Pairing energies and orbital splittings for the
stabilization of these `open shells` in organometallic systems will be
determined, thus increasing understanding of reactive intermediates in catalytic
cycles. Most stable organometallic compounds contain 18 valence electrons, or in
some instances 16, and do not exhibit a wide variety of oxidation states. By
investigating species which have an odd number of electrons and accommodate a
wider variety of ligands, information on the role of spin pairing in reaction
kinetics will be obtained. This information will be valuable in the design of
reactive species which may serve as new catalytic agents for organic synthesis.
