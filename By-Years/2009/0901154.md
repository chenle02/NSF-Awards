This objective of this research is to investigate micro- and nano-fluidic
devices utilizing ultrafast laser cavitation phenomena and their applications
for biomedical research. The approach is utilizing laser cavitation effects
originating from breakdown of water molecules in high optical intensity regions
through nonlinear optical processes.

Intellectual Merit: Micro and nanoscale explosive vapor bubbles can be excited
in nanoseconds by highly focused laser beams that are spatially patterned and
synchronized in time to achieve functional microfluidic devices with ultrahigh
speed that could not be achieved by any other physical mechanisms. The proposed
laser cavitation based microfluidic devices provide paradigm-shifting
performance for high speed microfluidic actuation by harvesting the mechanical
energy during rapid vapor bubble explosions. This enables sorting of
10,000~100,000 cells/sec on a single chip for the first time. Ultrafast laser
cavitation actuation can be driven by a compact, portable, and electrically
pumped two dimensional laser array for parallel pumping of a large scale
microfluidic device, solving one of the major miniaturization issue of
microfluidic systems by completely eliminating the bulky pumps and control
valves.

Broader Impacts: Results and expertise developed during the course of this
project will be incorporated into the PI?s teaching activities at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels. Minority graduate and undergraduate students
will participate in these projects through the outstanding outreach program at
UCLA. Students involved in this project will be exposed to an excellent
multidisciplinary training environment between the UCLA Medical School and
Engineering School.
