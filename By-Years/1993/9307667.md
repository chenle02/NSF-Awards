The focus of this research is to develop the chemistry of 1,2,3-vicinal
tricarbonyl compounds as electrophilic centers for bond-forming, bond cleavage
and rearrangement reactions having synthetic applicability. The preparation of a
range of heterocycles including alpha-keto lactams, hydroxyfurans,
hydroxypyrroles, pryrrolizidines, indolizidines, fused ring beta-lactams and
macrocyclic lactones and lactams will be pursued. %%% With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Harry H. Wasserman
of the Department of Chemistry at Yale University. Professor Wasserman will
focus his work on the chemistry of compounds containing three consecutive
carbonyl groups, the 1,2,3-vicinal tricarbonyls. These compounds are synthetic
intermediates for the preparation of a wide range of organic compounds including
systems of biological significance.
