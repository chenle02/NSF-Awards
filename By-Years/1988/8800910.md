This research addresses problems associated with the design and analysis of
discrete-event (DE) supervisory controllers of continuous- time (CT) systems
(hybrid systems) often encountered in manufacturing situations and distributed
computing. The approach involves development of a modeling methodology and
representational forms of hybrid systems which permit straight-forward
simulation and analysis of such hybrid systems. Appropriate mathematical
structures for the analysis and design of these hybrid systems are developed.
Petri-Nets (PNs) serve as the starting point for the modeling of the DE
controller component and classical state model (geometric) control theory
techniques are developed for the CT component of the hybrid systems.
Modifications to existing PN and CT modeling methodologies address several key
problems associated with hybrid systems including characterization of
information flow within the hybrid model and between the CT and DE systems. The
new modeling technique will permit meaningful re-interpretation of classical PN
properties and CT system properties.
