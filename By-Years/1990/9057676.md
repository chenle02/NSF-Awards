The research supported by the Presidential Young Investigator Award is the
theoretical and experimental analysis of extrusion of biological materials. One
of the difficulties in predicting parameters, for instance flow rate, in
extrusion processing is that most biopolymers undergo chemical reactions during
extrusion-cooking. These chemical reactions significantly change the rheological
behavior of the material. The objective of the study is to develop a
mathematical model to predict the interaction of rheological behavior, time-
temperature history and reaction rate. The experimental studies to verify the
model will utilize magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging will
provide a quantitative evaluation of the velocity profile of fluid in the
extruder during operation. FY 90 - PYI, First Year $25,000
