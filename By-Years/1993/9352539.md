9352539 Radak This project will purchase a HPLC for use in the teaching of
organic chemistry, analytical chemistry as well as other related fields.
Emphasis will be on practical applications as well as training for those
students who will enter the industrial sector as technicians. The technical
training would emphasize both the job related basic skills of being able to
operate a variety of modern laboratory equipment, as would be expected of a
technician, in addition to the basic research skills needed for a student to
successfully pursue a professional degree in science. ***
