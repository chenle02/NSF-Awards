The research is directed at overcoming two of the major problems associated
with the use of polymer concretes: shrinkage during curing which results in
residual stresses, and creep during service, which leads to delayed failure
under static loads. The approach taken toward controlling curing shrinkage is
the introduction of a mineral phase which loses water and expands during curing,
thus offsetting the shrinkage associated with resin polymerization. This effort
will also include research into the substitution of other, lower boiling liquids
for the hydration water in the mineral, to achieve greater effects at lower
curing temperatures. The creep problem is to be attacked by providing a detailed
characterization of the creep behavior of the material-i.e., through the
provision of an accurate constitutive law for the material, and through 3-D
finite element analysis to elucidate the effects of various material
modifications (aggregate size, shape, size distribution, inclusion of fibers,
etc.) on the creep behavior, to provide a basis for optimization of polymer
concretes for creep resistance.
