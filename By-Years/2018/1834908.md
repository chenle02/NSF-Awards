This award provides travel support for undergraduate student participation in
the Laser Science XXXIV Conference. This conference is the annual meeting of the
APS Division of Laser Science (DLS), and will be held in conjunction with the
annual meeting of the Optical Society of America. The conference program
includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical
Physics. The support of students through this award makes a substantial
contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who
graduate with a background in laser science acquire a broad range of knowledge
and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science
and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be held
Washington DC September 16-20, 2018. It offers an opportunity for undergraduate
students to present their research results and to interact with senior
scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international
community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US
universities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
