Over the past two decades, string theory has come to play a leading role within
the field of theoretical high-energy physics. It has not only provided many new
insights concerning the possibilities for physics at the highest energy scales,
but also led to new, deeper understandings of gauge theory, gravity, and even
condensed-matter physics and nuclear (heavy-ion) physics. This award provides
support for Strings 2010, the latest in a series of highly successful annual
international conferences covering all aspects of string theory, to be held at
Texas A&M University. In general, speakers at the Strings conferences include
most of the leading figures of the field. NSF support of this conference will
enable young researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to attend
this conference at reduced expense. This will enable them to keep abreast of
current developments in the field, and to publicize the work that they
themselves are doing to a larger audience of their peers, both senior and
junior.
