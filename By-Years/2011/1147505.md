The objective of this workshop is to explore in a transdisciplinary fashion how
models of the individual, his or her social network, and of societal decision
making derived from psychology, sociology, decision sciences, economics, can be
applied to create intelligent applications that empower patients. Empowerment of
patients and healthy individuals is a critical aspect of individualized medicine
and includes concepts of self-efficacy and self managed behavioral change,
supported by healthcare providers and payers. Technology plays a role in patient
empowerment but will be most successful if implemented within through
scientifically based, theory-driven systems that address the barriers that
patients face to empowerment within themselves and across the health system. To
achieve this, intelligent systems need useful, computable models of patients
reasoning and their social relationships and social networks. The workshop is
focused on identifying the key questions underlying empowerment with a
particular emphasis on the role of networking and information technology in the
empowering processes. The results of this workshop are expected to have
significant impact on the practical ability to empower individuals as well as on
fundamental understanding of the empowerment process.
