This theoretical research will be conducted to understand the role of magnetic
fields and current systems in solar flares, and to understand the interaction of
plasma flows with radiation in both the chromosphere and corona of flares and
active regions. Specifically, this effort will further develop an analytic
description of magnetic reconnection at an X-type neutral point, and extend the
studies to numerical simulation; study the influence of gas pressure on
photospheric magnetic fields as inferred from vector magnetograms; use active
region magnetic field models to determine cross-sectional area variation along
coronal loops for use in hydrodynamic and particle studies; improve a model for
the evolution of the gradual phase of flares, which reduces the complex
hydrodynamic description to a simple ordinary differential equation, making
simulations of the entire flare feasible; apply similar techniques to studies of
thermal stability of active region loops; and develop a new, simpler; faster,
radiation-hydrodynamics code for studies of the impulsive chromospheric flare.
These problems will be studied with analytic and numerical techniques applied to
the gasdynamic, radiation transfer, and magnetohydrodynamic equations. This work
will aid in interpreting spectroscopic data and vector magnetograms from ground
based optical telescopes during MAX '91. ***
