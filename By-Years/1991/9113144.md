This grant to the University of Texas at Austin provides for start-up equipment
and expenses for an experiment designed to measure the mass of neutrinos from
the beta decay of tritium. The experiment will be carried out using an electron
lens spectrometer of unique design. The upper limit on the mass of tritium beta
decay neutrinos to be attained in this experiment is expected to be below 5 eV.
