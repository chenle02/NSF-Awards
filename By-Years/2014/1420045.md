With this grant, the American Mathematical Society will provide ten scholarships
per academic year for three years to mathematically talented U.S. undergraduates
for a semester of study at the Math in Moscow program of the Independent
University of Moscow. The Math in Moscow program provides an intense and
enriching academic experience, focusing on the tradition of discovering
mathematics on one's own guided by an experienced teacher, and significant
connections with contemporary research topics. It allows mathematically talented
students to meet and work with other students from around the world who share a
strong interest in mathematics, as well as the chance to work with some of the
world's leading mathematicians. In addition to the unique academic experience
provided by the Math in Moscow program, it is a way to build vital scholarly
connections between the Russian and U.S. mathematics communities.

The Independent University of Moscow is a small, elite institution of higher
learning that focuses primarily on mathematics. It was founded in 1991 at the
initiative of a group of well-known Russian research mathematicians, who now
comprise the Academic Council of the University. Math in Moscow, a fifteen-week-
long program established in 1999, provides an experience in mathematics that
students would not find in the U.S. This is because participants explore
mathematics in the Russian tradition, the main feature of which has always been
the development of a creative approach to mathematics, with the emphasis being
on problem solving rather than memorizing theorems. At the Independent
University of Moscow, discovering mathematics under the guidance of an
experienced teacher is the central principle of its program, and the Math in
Moscow program emphasizes in-depth understanding of carefully selected material
rather than broad surveys of large quantities of material. The scholarship
provided through this grant will cover a substantial part of the typical cost
for a semester of study in the Math in Moscow program for each recipient. The
remaining funds from the grant will cover the costs of administrative support
for the program, which includes a plan to perform a longitudinal survey of
scholarship recipients that will follow each student for eight years to measure
outcomes of the program with regard to students going on to obtain M.A. and PhD
degrees. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences
and the Office of Integrative and International Activities.
