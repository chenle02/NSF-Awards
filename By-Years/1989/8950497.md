This project is part of the modernization and general improvement of the physics
laboratory courses at Gonzaga University. The courses are taken by approximately
150 students each semester. The students' majors vary from the liberal arts
through the sciences and engineering. The equipment includes video cassette
cameras, recorders, and monitors. The video equipment will be used to more
actively (and accurately) engage the students in time and distance measurements
in several mechanics experiments. The equipment will allow the department to
significantly improve general physics and intermediate physics laboratories. The
equipment will ensure more accurate, consistent and precise acquisition and
analysis of data. The University will contribute an amount equal to 107% of the
award toward the purchase of the equipment.
