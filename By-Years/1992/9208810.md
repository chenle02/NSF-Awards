This award is for support of a lake coring program in the Eastern Canadian
Arctic with the goal of recovering continuous records of environmental change
for the last 10 to 15 ka. Pollen and diatom assemblages will be studied, as well
as the physical characteristics of the cores. Down-core variations in the stable
isotopic ratios of carbon and hydrogen in plant macrofossils and the dissolved
organic carbon content of the sediments will be studied. These studies will
address questions of climate change, including regional glacial history and sea-
level change.
