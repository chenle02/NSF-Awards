Framework structures are ubiquitous and include the feldspars and perovskites,
major components of the Earth's crust and mantle, respectively. Perovskites also
have one of the most technologically important structure-types used for
electronic materials, including superconductors, gmr, ferroelastics and
ferroelectric device materials. This project will use single-crystal X-ray
diffraction to determine high-precision structure measurements of framework
solid solutions in situ at high pressure in order to elucidate the elastic and
thermodynamic effects of various element and defect substitutions into end-
members. These detailed studies will lay the basis for developing predictive
models for the high-pressure behavior of feldspars and perovskites, as well as
other complex framework minerals, including garnets and titanites. The results
obtained with this grant will therefore provide fundamental insights and
constraints on the geochemistry and mineralogy of the Earth's interior, as well
as having widespread application in materials sciences. The award of this grant
will also support the training of scientists at all levels, including the
hosting of a crystallography workshop each year for students and faculty from
regional undergraduate institutions.
