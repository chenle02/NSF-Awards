This project concerns the use of foveated geometries for scientific
visualization applications. Two main motivations for such geometries are (1) the
analogy with biological vision systems, and (2) their remarkably reduced pixel
density that is logarithmic in the radius of the visual field. To compensate for
the loss of peripheral vision in foveated geometries, the approach of active
visualization is to allow the user interactive control of several parameters of
vision, including rapid saccades and adjustable resolution. These are new
capabilities, to be added to the more conventional navigational control.
Foveated geometries will be a key to making current visualization systems more
robust, scalable and extendible. The project will investigate three main areas:
- Algorithms and data structures for rendering and manipulating foveated images.
- Wavelet theory and algorithms for a corresponding concept of foveated
multiresolution. - Application of active visualization in "thin-wire models" of
computation such as the internet. In a typical "thin-wire" visualization
scenario, imagine an image server with powerful computational resources, a
client displaying images with the the computational power of stock PC's, and
between them, a thin-wire. In current visualization applications, the bandwidth
usage from client to server is negligible but the bandwidth in the other
direction is a severe bottleneck. In exchange for a modest amount of bandwidth
going from client to image server, active visualization is able to remove this
bottleneck. Such a development can have major impact on visualization. ***
