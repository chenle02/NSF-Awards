9309989 Davenport This award in experimental elementary particle physics will
continue the principal investigator's long involvement with a large,
international group who do fixed-target experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron.
Analysis will continue on the data from E687 runs in 1990 and 1991 and
preparations will be made for a run of the follow-on E831, both of which are
studies of charm particles produced in hadronic collisions. ***
