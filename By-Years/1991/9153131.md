The Department of Meteorology is purchasing an infrared thermometer and a
radiosonde system for use by undergraduates at both the beginning and advanced
levels. The equipment is used to ascertain the thermal structure of the lower
atmosphere. By plotting the temperature, humidity and pressure data, gathered
during the ascent of balloon carried sensors, students obtain a real-time
picture of the vertical temperature and humidity distribution of the atmosphere
from which they determine the stability of the air, the height of clouds, the
condensation
