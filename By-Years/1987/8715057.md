In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program,
Professor Cukier's research in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics will be
directed towards theoretical advances in the description of vibrational energy
transfer, fluorescence quenching and electron transport in fluids. Vibrational
energy transfer is a key step in many chemical processes. When it occurs in a
fluid, the solvent can influence the rate. The theoretical task is to predict
this solvent dependence, which will be accomplished with a combination of
semiclassical scattering and kinetic theory techniques. When fluorophores are
de-excited by quenchers, the rate of the process can depend on the quencher
concentration in a nonlinear fashion. Quenching with ionic species is especially
important in protein fluorescence quenching and inorganic complex quenching.
Theories of this quencher concentration dependence will be developed using
multiple scattering and simulation methods. The nature of the solvation,
dynamics and reactivity of electrons in fluids is a central chemical problem.
The electron's mobility as a function of fluid density will be investigated by
techniques similar to those used in the quenching problems.
