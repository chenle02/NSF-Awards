In this STEP Type 2 project, the two-phase multi-method study examines the
structural and individual factors that contribute to women being less likely to
complete STEM majors than men. The study combines both a longitudinal
quantitative component and a qualitative component focused on the experiences of
the research subjects. The study examines structural/organizational and
individual factors and the interactive effects of these factors on women's
success in STEM from middle school through colleges in STEM disciplines in which
women are traditionally underrepresented. The data from the longitudinal aspect
of the study will be combined with data from surveys and in-depth interviews.
The research team has unique access to existing longitudinal data sets from the
University of North Carolina General Administration (UNC system's 16 campuses)
and the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. The study has the
support of major educational institutions in the state that have agreed to
provide grades 8-16 data for students in both systems. The qualitative aspect of
the study provides a rich data source for examining in greater detail the
experiences women have had as they make their way through grades 8-12 to
becoming STEM majors in and graduates from post-secondary education
institutions. The research examines the relationships among gender,
ethnicity/race, and socio-economic status with other individual and
structural/organizational factors, such as qualification of STEM teachers,
gender composition of faculty by campus and by department, and the racial
composition of student body by campus and by major. The focus on the experiences
of women (completer, avoiders, and leavers) in STEM has the potential to make a
major contribution in this area of research. Based on the interest of state
educational institutions, the study has the potential to lead to the
consideration of its findings by state-level stakeholders.
