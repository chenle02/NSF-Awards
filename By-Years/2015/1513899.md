Computer memory design is moving into a new era with emerging NVM (non-volatile
memory) technologies for increasingly data-intensive applications. This project
will investigate a novel memory architecture called versatile memory system that
hosts heterogeneous memory technologies to provide a powerful in-memory
computing engine, addressing the increasing demands for memory performance,
energy efficiency, and reliability from data-intensive applications. It is based
on a holistic approach, from low-layer hardware design to high-layer OS
management, to address the challenges of complexity and efficiency arising from
the integration of heterogeneous NVM technologies. It allows the memory system
to be self-adaptive to meet varying application demands on performance, energy
efficiency, and reliability. The project will study the framework, critical
hardware support, and feasible and meaningful functionalities of the versatile
memory system, aiming at improving the performance, energy efficiency,
reliability, and manageability of computing systems from mobile to server
platforms. It is expected that the outcome of the project will have broader
impact on the design of modern computer memory systems both in academia and
industry.
