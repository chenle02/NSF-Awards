It is in our national interest to support the advancement of scientific
progress, national health, and general prosperity in an economy increasingly
driven by scientific advancement and technological change. Colleges and
universities are engaged in an ongoing process of adapting to societal changes
and emerging scholarship that inform the ways we provide effective STEM learning
environments. Institutional policies relating to faculty promotion and tenure
can serve as incentives for faculty members to participate in activities such as
outreach and public engagement, use evidence-based teaching and mentoring
practices, develop and offer creative interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary
coursework, create novel ways to broaden participation in science among
underrepresented groups, and develop specific strategies for reflecting the
principles of convergence in courses and programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will organize and host
a national convocation of key scholars and stakeholders. The gathering is
designed to incorporate speakers and participants that represent a wide range of
STEM instructional faculty, including contingent faculty, at a range of higher
education institutional types. The gathering will be planned by an ad hoc
committee of the National Academies with experience and expertise in science and
engineering, promotion and tenure policies and practices, and higher education
research and teaching. The convocation will bring together 50-75 stakeholders to
discuss the issues and research and to determine strategies for creating campus-
based conversations aimed at examining new promotion and tenure policies and
practices. The gathering is designed to serve as a springboard for a major
National Academies consensus study of this topic starting in
2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
