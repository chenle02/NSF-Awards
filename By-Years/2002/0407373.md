Partnering with National Musical Arts, the Science Museum of Minnesota seeks to
develop BioMusic, a 4,000 sq. ft. traveling exhibition that explores the origins
of music in nature and the connections between music and sound of living things.
This project is based on planning grant ESI-0211611 (The Music of Nature and the
Nature of Music) awarded to NMA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The
project is based on the emerging interdisciplinary research field of biomusic,
which includes musicology plus aspects of neuroscience, biology, zoology,
environmental science, physics, psychology, math and anthropology. The exhibit
sections -- "Humanimal" Music; Natural Symphonies; Ancient Roots; Music, Body
and Mind; and World of Music -- use both music and natural sound to explore
biodiversity, cultural diversity, the physics of sound and the
brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: The exhibition is expected to travel
for at least six years, reaching some two million people in 18 communities. It
is to be accompanied by a six-part radio series (Sweet Bird Classics) for young
children. Because of the connection to music and many other areas of public
interest, this exhibition has the potential to attract and engage new audiences
to science museums and stimulate their interest in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;
