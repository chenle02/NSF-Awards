This project is providing scholarships to one cohort of 30 students to be known
as Silicon Valley Scholars. The scholarships are equally divided between majors
in computer information systems and engineering. Funds to sustain scholarships
for new cohorts of students would be sought from local industries in Silicon
Valley. Strong support services are offered during the college years and are
administered by the Financial Aid Office and the Student Academic Assistance
Center. The university's recruiters attract new students to the university from
among those students participating in outreach programs. In addition to Upward
Bound and Educational Talent Search outreach programs, the university operates a
charter high school for limited English speaking students who have fallen at
least a year behind their classmates in reading achievement.

Intellectual Merit: Low-income students with the diverse ethnic backgrounds of
the university's students have proven difficult to retain through to graduation
in most universities. The college has a track record of helping such students
overcome the barriers to a full university education. The college uses a hands-
on approach to teaching providing laboratory and workshop experiences for
students in lower division classes and internship experiences in industry for
upper division students. This practical approach to education facilitates a high
placement rate in industry for graduates. Broader Impact: Students who would not
normally attend college and would be found rarely in computer science and
engineering majors are afforded a rigorous education and support services
sufficient to assure success. Silicon Valley high technology industry receive
access to a pool of well-trained potential employees to which they have
heretofore lacked access.
