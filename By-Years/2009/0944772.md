The Center for High Resolution Neutron Scattering (CHRNS) is a national user
facility supported by the Division of Materials Research at the National Science
Foundation in partnership with the Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) at the
National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST). CHRNS develops and
operates state-of-the-art neutron scattering instrumentation with broad
applications in materials research for use by the general scientific community
through peer-reviewed proposals. The instruments are used by university,
government and industrial researchers in materials science, chemistry, biology
and condensed matter physics to investigate materials such as polymers, metals,
ceramics, magnetic materials, porous media, fluids and gels, and biological
molecules. CHRNS provides robust user operations at six premier neutron
scattering instruments: two small-angle neutron scattering instruments that are
used to characterize the nano- to microscale structure in materials (from 1 to
over 10,000 nanometers); and four cold neutron spectrometers that probe dynamic
processes in materials with characteristic times from 0.1 picoseconds to 100
nanoseconds. CHRNS staff scientists provide assistance to users; they also
develop collaborative research projects in their areas of expertise, while
continuously improving the measurement capabilities, reliability, and ease of
use of the instruments. In addition, CHRNS provides expert assistance with
sample environment equipment, chemistry laboratory activities, and data analysis
software. This award also supports the addition to CHRNS of the Multi-Axis
Crystal Spectrometer (MACS) which promises the world's most intense,
monochromatic, cold-neutron beam. MACS is currently being commissioned at the
NCNR. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year more than 500 scientists, postdoctoral
fellows and graduate students make use of these capabilities, and several PhD's
are awarded in the U.S. for research that involved experiments carried out at
CHRNS. Developments at CHRNS are often widely adopted throughout the neutron and
x-ray scattering communities. For example, CHRNS data visualization and analysis
software is widely used for small angle scattering and inelastic scattering
studies at facilities around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education and
outreach activities of CHRNS include a summer school for neutron science which
typically serves 35 graduate students, post-docs, and junior faculty each year.
In addition, CHRNS participates in the NIST Summer Undergraduate Research
Fellowships (SURF) program and the two-week NIST Summer Institute for middle
school science teachers. Outreach to groups that are underrepresented in
scientific research is a hallmark of these programs.
