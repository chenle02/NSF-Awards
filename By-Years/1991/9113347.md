This three-year award supports cooperative research between Olli Tuovinen, Ohio
State University (OSU) and Borje Lindstrom from the University of Umea in
Sweden. The objective of the research is to develop a genetic transfer vector
system for Thiobacillus ferroooxidans, an autotrophic bacterium which has been
used in the recovery of metals by leaching. Their long-term goal is to develop a
genetically improved strain with greater leaching capacity and resistance to
toxic metals. A new strain may also prove useful in the desulfurization of coal.
The development of a gene transfer system for T. ferrooxidans could facilitate
these improvements. The OSU group has expertise in the biotechnology of T.
ferrooxidans and organic sulfur degradation in coal. The Umea lab is concerned
with bioleaching at levated temperatures. The labs will conduct parallel
experiments with different test organisms. The project will benefit from the
availability of new test organisms and joint efforts in characterization and
analysis.
