The objective of this research is to introduce new power delivery schemes in
Systems-on-Chip that achieve higher power efficiency. The proposed approach is
to replace the numerous linear regulators within the system with more efficient
fully-integrated switching alternatives. The large size and cost associated with
switching regulators is addressed by switching at 300MHz-600MHz, which reduces
the required passive components to where they can be integrated on-chip and on-
package-substrate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research
is to leverage the ultra-high speed-to-power ratio of sub-65nm CMOS technologies
to enable integrated switching regulators to operate above 300MHz while
maintaining power conversion efficiency that is better than linear regulators.
The silicon area overhead of on-chip passives are handled through stuffing the
regulator?s power switches, input and output capacitors, and control circuitry
directly underneath the inductor. The magnetically-induced losses are reduced by
strategically placing the stuffed circuits based on how they are configured in a
switching regulator topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this
research is that it improves power efficiency while preserving small footprint
and cost. This makes many devices that are currently limited by unrealistic size
or battery life requirements, such as biomedical implants, technically and
economically feasible. The PI will complement this research activity with
education by developing curriculum that provides the missing link between
traditional power electronics education and state-of-the-art Integrated
Circuits. Additionally, the PI will provide graduate and undergraduate students,
including those from underrepresented groups, with the opportunity to interact
with industry and acquire necessary skills for a successful engineering career.
