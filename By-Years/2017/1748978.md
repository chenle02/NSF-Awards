Maize is a premier research plant model system as well as a globally important
crop providing food, feed, fiber, and raw materials that sustain humankind. The
international maize research community includes public and private researchers
that represents a global research engine that has allowed maize to meet world-
wide demands through fundamental and applied discoveries. Looking to the future,
challenges and opportunities that face the community include big-data production
and utilization, development of technologies that will support continued
research success, increasing the breadth and interdisciplinary interactions of
the community to envision and synergize new discovery, and ensuring translation
of discoveries to growers and consumers. These challenges and opportunities will
be met by recruiting and equipping a diverse scientific community, and through
identification and advocacy for resources that allow this vibrant community to
develop needed technologies and to continue its history of excellence in
fundamental and applied research. This Research Coordination Network (RCN) will
support planning to accelerate research into the next decade, will create
opportunities for synergistic interactions, and will allow deliberate community-
building efforts to grow the scientific and categorical diversity of the U.S.
maize research community. This project was co-funded by the Plant Genome
Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the
Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences.

The goal of this Research Coordination Network is to accelerate maize research
into the next decade by systematic planning and prioritization activities, and
by encouraging community growth and synergistic interaction. Community input has
identified four areas meriting specific attention by the RCN: development of
novel functional genomic technologies, big data acquisition and utilization,
discovery to product, and importantly, recruiting and training the next
generation of researchers. These topics will be addressed by targeted focus
group meetings that will produce white papers of value to all stakeholders.
Information will be gathered at the annual Maize Genetics Conference and through
pre-conference surveys which will then be broadly communicated to the community
members at the conference and as online resources. Finally, the RCN will also
seek new ways to broaden the community by active recruitment of scientists from
underrepresented groups of all types and by expanding the disciplinary breadth
of the maize research community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
