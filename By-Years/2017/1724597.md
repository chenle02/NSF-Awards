The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2
of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Program
recommends an award of for the purchase of the following: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;1) Network Server Upgrade/Replacement $6,500 &lt;br/&gt;2) NI VB-8034
(2 ea) $16,000 &lt;br/&gt;3) Fiber Optic Training, Supplies and Tester $12,000
&lt;br/&gt; Indirect Costs $5,180 &lt;br/&gt; Total $39,680
