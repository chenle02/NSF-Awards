This travel award supports participation in the Ninth ACM SIGCOMM Internet
Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM and co-sponsored by
USENIX, to be held in Chicago, IL, USA, November 4-6, 2009.

This technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research
results in an important area in networking, namely that of network measurements.
The conference focuses on many research issues associated with observing the
Internet, including: traffic analysis, structure and topology characteristics,
performance measurements, measurement-based network management, characteristics
of network applications, design of monitoring systems, anomaly detection,
measurement of security threats, tools and environments in support of
measurement, measurement-based assessment of simulation/testbeds, workload
generation and modeling. Thus attendance at IMC provides a valuable research and
career development experience for graduate students from United States academic
institutions. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend
panel and keynote speeches and technical sessions, as well as interact with
peers engaged in state-of-the-art research in the field.

Approximately 10 US-based graduate students are provided the opportunity to
attend IMC. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular
female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited
travel funds to attend workshops; attendance at such events is an important part
of their educational experience.
