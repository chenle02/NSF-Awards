In wireless systems, performing IF filtering/demodulation digitally has many
advantages. The software radio environment makes it possible to implement
diverse wireless standards on a single hardware platform. Since non-linear
quantization causes interchannel mixing, this application demands a premium ADC
performance in spurious-free dynamic range of at least 80 to 90dB. This highly-
linear data conversion at IF requires ADC performance typically of 14 bits at
above 50MSample/s. Although remarkable progresses have been reported, it is
unlikely to achieve this high sampling rate with 14 bits using any known CMOS
architectures. This research challenges the current ADC arts with two unique
methods. Multi- step ADCs are very linear but limited by the speed of the
interstage residue amplifier. On the other hand, folding ADCs are fast but
limited by folding amplifier offsets and their complexity to achieve more than
10 bits. This research presents two unique solutions. One is to use a trans-
resistance amplifier for fast residue amplification, and the other is to use a
subranging concept to cascade folding stages. Linearities in both cases are
calibrated in background using an oversampling delta-sigma calibrator. This work
is the first one that ever attempts to calibrate the folding ADC.
