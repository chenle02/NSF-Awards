This award provides funds to support cooperative research in theoretical
astrophysics between the United States and China. Dr. Ronald Taam of
Northwestern University and Professor Wang Deyu of the Purple Mountain
Observatory, Nanjing, China, will work together under this grant to investigate
interacting binary star systems, which have been demonstrated to be sites of
energetic and occasionally highly transient activiity. Specifically, this study
will focus on dynamical instabilities in thin accretion disks. This project is
jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Chinese Academy of
Sciences under the Protocol on Cooperation in Basic Sciences signed in 1980 and
renewed in 1986.
