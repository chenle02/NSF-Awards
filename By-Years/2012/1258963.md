This award will provide support for attendees and invited speakers for the
eleventh annual symposium of the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowships (AAPF) program, to be held in Long Beach, California, on 2013
January 5--6. The purpose of the AAPF program is to integrate research and
educational activities at the postdoctoral level to better prepare fellows for a
scientific career. The annual symposium provides a venue for fellows to discuss
their research and teaching or outreach projects while increasing their exposure
within the astronomy and astrophysics community. The symposium represents a key
component of the AAPF program and acts as a mechanism to facilitate knowledge
transfer from experiences that the fellows have obtained in the course of their
activities to a broad audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with previous symposia
in this series, the AAPF symposium for 2013 will promote interactions among
astronomers with very different interests and backgrounds. By creating a forum
in which discussions can occur across the standard boundaries defined by sub-
discipline, there is great opportunity for new insights and the ability to
develop new interdisciplinary collaborations. The symposium will also provide a
venue for discussing other issues that are important to early career
astronomers. In addition, the symposium will (1) provide a forum for discussing
the combination of research and teaching, (2) facilitate collaborations between
AAPF fellows on both research and education, and (3) provide exposure for the
fellows and the fellowship program within the astronomical community.
