This award is to support research that will develop new and extend existing tree
ring records from the North Pacific Rim. These data will be analyzed to provide
multi-century time series of coastal and oceanic
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field work will be undertaken to collect
samples from northern Alaska, Canada, Russia and northern Japan during the first
two years of the study. Ring width measurements will be cross-dated visual,
graphical and computer assisted techniques. Tree ring data generated during this
project will be used to evaluate several climate indices and reconstruct North
Pacific sea surface temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of
this proposed research are that it will lead to a better understanding of
natural climate variability for the North Pacific region which in turn is
critical for identifying anthropogenic signals in the short instrumental climate
records. This information will help the community understand future climate
change scenarios.
