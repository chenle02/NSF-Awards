Oceanographic and geologic criteria indicate that abyssal manganese nodules may
occur in the abyssal regions of the southeastern portion of the Exclusive
Economic Zone of Hawaii, which has been largely unmapped and unexplored. The
goals of this research project are to ground truth the occurrence of abyssal
manganese nodules, determine what water column, seafloor, and sub- seafloor
features exist in these abyssal regions, observe nodule distribution and
abundance as well as the concomitant fauna, and collect physical samples of
nodules, sediments, and biology. These data will help characterize the baseline
geological and biological environment in this prospective abyssal nodule region
and inform critical mineral and ecosystem resource potential.

To complete this work, ship-based multibeam echosounder and backscatter data
will be collectedin any regions of interest with mapping gaps. Box core
equipment will be deployed at priorityregions to obtain physical sediment
samples for geological (nodules, sediment composition,grain size) and biological
(epifaunal and infaunal diversity, abundance, distribution as well asgenetic
analysis) analyses. CTD will be cast close to box core locations to collect
water samplesfor eDNA and basic nutrient analyses to complete the research data
collection requirements.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
