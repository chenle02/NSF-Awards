The tectonic evolution of West Antarctica and its relationship to East
Antarctica is the most fundamental tectonic problem of the Antarctic continent.
It bears on global plate interaction, paleocirculation in the Southern Ocean,
paleoenvironment, and paleobiogeography as well as being critical to the
development of the continent itself. The joint United States-United Kingdom West
Antarctic Tectonics Project (1983-88) has shed considerable light on the
tectonic evolution of the Weddell Sea region. This award support a new
tripartite United States-New Zealand- United Kingdom program of study in Marie
Byrd Land for the years 1990-1993 to complete our understanding of the tectonic
evolution of the southern rim of the Pacific Ocean basin. This study is the
major U.S. contribution to the program and involves structural, paleomagnetic,
petrologic, and geochronologic investigations bearing particularly on the pre-
Cenozoic development of Marie Byrd Land.
