This work will use asteroseismic data of stellar pulsations to test models of
stellar evolution. As part of this effort, Dr. Basu and a postdoctoral associate
will test whether the internal structure and underlying physics of the most
stellar evolution theory is correct. Dr. Basu will also use asteroseismology
data to obtain masses, radii, effective temperatures, helium abundances, log
g(surface gravity) and convection zone sizes in stars. In particular, her team
will use data on the large separation and frequency of maximum oscillation for
numerous stars provided by the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium to
determine how gross properties of the models should vary across the HR diagram.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will extend well beyond stellar astrophysics
because stars are used to calibrate both time and distance scales in the
Universe and if the stellar models are incorrect, this would have many
cosmological implications. This will also involve the training of a postdoctoral
research associate.
