Cellular biology research has benefitted from the technological advances made in
cytometry. This company will utilize its patented "fluid resistor" to produce an
instrument with microchannels and valves small enough to sort cells
individually. This will allow not only fluid sorting but also stopped-flow image
analysis of individual cells. Potentially this instrument will be less expensive
than current cell sorters because less costly light sources can be used if the
analysis time can be increased. That would make this important technology
available to more research facilities. Phase I will consist of improving the
geometry of the channels, decreasing valve cycle time, and testing the system
using particles and cells.
