9400912 Nirenberg This award supports mathematical research on problems arising
in the field of nonlinear partial differential equations. They include second
order elliptic equations in general domains in Euclidean n-dimensional space as
well as on manifolds. Regularity conditions will not be assumed and the
differential operators are not necessarily self-adjoint. Other work will focus
on free boundary problems, in particular singular limits for nonlinear problems
and Liouville-type theorems for application to nonlinear boundary value
problems. A second line of investigation involves statistical mechanics for wave
equations. Specifically, statistical/mechanical probabilistic methods will be
employed to study classical and non-classical nonlinear waves. A new
(integrable) shallow water equation which has interesting connections with
geodesic flow on creased manifolds of otherwise constant curvature. Partial
differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical
world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations
as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the
solutions. This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness
and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of
solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations. ***
