Under this grant, Professor Sober aims to clarify the concept of altruism as it
is used in evolutionary theory and also in social sciences. There are obvious
differences between the concept of evolutionary altruism (and its opposite --
evolutionary selfishness) and the concept of psychological altruism (and its
opposite -- psychological egoism). To say that a trait of an organism is
evolutionarily altruistic implies nothing about whether the organism has
intentions or what those intentions might be. Evolutionary selfishness and
altruism are defined behaviorally. Whether an organism is an altruist or an
egoist is defined by the consequences of the organism's behavior for itself and
other organisms. The basic idea is that an altruist behaves in such a way that
it benefits the organisms with which it lives at its own expense. The
psychological concept of altruism, on the other hand, is usually understood in
terms of intentions. The psychological concept has to do with motivation, which
may or may not be reflected directly in the consequences of the behaviors that
result. A second obvious difference between these concepts is the "currency" in
which costs and benefits are understood. In evolutionary theory, an altruist
must enhance the survival and reproductive chances (the fitness) of others at
its own expense. In the psychological case, this need not be how intended
effects are conceptualized. These differences aside, there is nonetheless a
conceptual problem that the evolutionary and psychological concepts both
engender. Both the theory of natural selection and the theory of rational
deliberation are maximizing theories. Thus, it appears to be conceptually
impossible that evolutionary altruism or psychological altruism could exist. Yet
the existence of these traits should be determined empirically, not on an a
priori basis. Professor Sober will resolve this conflict by using techniques of
causal analysis deployed in science. The question of possible explanatory
relationships between these concepts will then be investigated.
