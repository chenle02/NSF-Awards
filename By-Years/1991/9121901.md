Wolf Research is on the relationship between high-level control specifications
and the finite state machine (FSM) implementation of that control. Models for
two problems in high-level control synthesis are being explored: Analysis of
delays in mixed data- control systems before scheduling; and scheduling in
complex control systems. The approach is to use the behavior FSM, a finite state
machine whose inputs and outputs are partially ordered in time. The approach to
solving the state minimization problem is to search over possible schedules of
input and output events to choose an implementation of a minimum number of
states. Algorithms developed for compaction on a cylinder are being used to move
both simple outputs and branches to minimize the number of states around cycles
in a behavior state transition graph.
