An REU Site will be continued in the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics
(SCIPP)and the Physics Department at UC Santa Cruz. This program successfully
integrates undergraduates from all over the country and largely from groups
under-represented in physics into the research program. In addition, there will
be lectures by the faculty twice a week and bi-weekly sessions on preparing and
presenting activity reports. Another important aspect of the program will be
visits to nearby research institutions and seminars on job choices and graduate
school application.
