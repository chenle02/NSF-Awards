An integrated wind tunnel and data acquisition laboratory which allows
undergraduate mechanical and aerospace engineering students to study aspects of
classical and modern aerodynamics is established. The laboratory includes a low
turbulence wind tunnel which is designed for experiments involving both laminar
flows and flows which are in the process of transition to turbulence. Facilities
which can produce the high flow quality necessary for modem aerodynamics
experiments are usually reserved for graduate research. The wind tunnel features
interchangeable test cells measuring 750 mm X 750 mm in cross- section that
allow experiments to be set up without disrupting concurrent wind tunnel
testing. In addition, modern instrumentation interfaced to a computer based data
acquisition system allows students to acquire, process, and interpret
experimental data for a variety of fundamental experiments. This will serve to
reinforce basic concepts studied in pure engineering science courses in addition
to teaching students modern experimental methods.
