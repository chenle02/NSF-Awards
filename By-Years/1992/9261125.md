An innovative method of fabricating large-area long wavelength infrared (LWIR)
detector arrays that can be operated at room as well as cryogenic temperatures
is proposed. This technique uses established technologies of micro-machining and
microelectronic processing of silicon (Si) wafers for fabricating monolithic
arrays of LWIR detectors. The detector elements of the array are formed by an
ultra-thin film of a bolometer material possessing the highest temperature
coefficient of resistance known, and the readout electronic microcircuit is
fabricated on the same silicon chip next to the elements. The resultant detector
arrays will possess features of low cost, low weight, high responsivity and high
sensitivity. The low cost is due to a monolithic array structure requiring no
cooling. The high responsivity is due a large to a large temperature coefficient
of resistivity (greater than 15% to 0.2% for a conventional bolometer) of the
new bolometer material. The high sensitivity is due to the combined effects of
high responsivity, low noise and high thermal isolation of the bolometer from
its surroundings.
