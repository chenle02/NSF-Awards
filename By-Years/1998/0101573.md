The Kentucky Information Technology Center (KITCATE) is a regional information
technology (IT) center. This consortium of the Kentucky Community and Technical
College System and Lexington Community College enables two-year colleges to
prepare skilled information technology (IT) workers needed by new and existing
Kentucky companies. The goals of the Center are to increase the IT enrollment
and completion rates of students in two-year colleges; to implement widely an
industry driven IT curriculum; to provide professional development for high
school and two-year college IT faculty; and to increase the support and
participation of business, government and industry in Kentucky for IT education.
To reach these goals the number of capable, qualified faculty to teach IT
courses must be increased. A physical center provides the education for faculty
and staff and for business, government and industry workers. A virtual center
provides information on the IT curriculum, offers IT courses, and supports
workshops. Mobile centers provide workshops for instructors and for workers in
business, government and industry at their locations. The two year-colleges
provide articulation for high school students with vendor certificates who
enroll in appropriate degree programs. An IT industry advisory board provides
guidance and support to the Center.
