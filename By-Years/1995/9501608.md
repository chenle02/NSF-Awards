The focus of this research is the development of the transition metal-catalyzed
cyclization of alkynols to afford isomeric endocyclic enol ethers. The
methodology represents a key step in the projected synthesis of two bioactive
ionophores, routiennocin and calcimycin. The focus of the educational plan
involves the teaching of chemistry by encouraging the use of inductive reasoning
skills. With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research and educational plan of Dr. Frank E. McDonald of the Department of
Chemistry at Northwestern University. Professor McDonald will focus his research
efforts on the development of new methods for the synthesis of polyether natural
products, compounds posessing important biological properties. The focus of
Processor McDonald's educational plan involves the teaching of chemistry by
encouraging the use of inductive reasoning skills.
