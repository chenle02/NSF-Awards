Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0916713 - CIF: Small: Structured Transmission Strategies for
Wireless Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we use lattice and other
structured coding techniques to induce alignment in wireless networks. This
effort uses these codes on three different fronts: a.) Interference networks,
where we use structured codes to align the interference seen at each receiver.
The objective is to determine the capacity of this channel to within a constant
gap using these codes. b.) Cognitive networks - where we use lattice codes to
mitigate the interference seen by both the licensed and the cognitive radios. We
exploit code structure to both (partially) learn the interfering signal at the
cognitive radio and then use this knowledge to precode/align our interference
signal. c.) Secure wireless networks: again, we utilize the structure of the
codebook to determine simple transformations at the source in order to keep
eavesdroppers in the network at bay. We employ these codes to detect, and
depending on code structure, correct for modification attacks on the codebook.&l
