The alignment of liquid crystals by grooved substrates is still not well
understood at the structural molecular level. This problem is important both
fundamentally as well as technologically. The increased use of
microarchitectural devices makes it imperative to obtain a better understanding
of the structure of the LC-substrate interfacial region, how it is affected by
the type of substrate preparation and how it affects the bulk of the LC film. We
propose to study the evolution of structure ordering of smectic LC's deposited
on grated substrates on grated substrates as a function of film depth and film
thickness. The substrates consist of photolithographed gratings whose period and
depth can be changed in a controlled manner. We use the X-ray glancing angle
technique to characterize quantitatively the LC structure evolution. This study
provide detailed information on the behavior of LC films between two disimilar,
competing interfaces. It will have considerable impact on the improved
implementation of LC films for applications, involving both disimilar as well as
symmetrical surfaces.
