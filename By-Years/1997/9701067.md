ABSTRACT OPP-9701067 KADKO, DAVID MIAMI UNIVERSITY This research project is an
ancillary project to be conducted in conjunction with a large, coordinated,
multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The
research program will be conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice
pack. This investigator will measure the concentration of Beryllium isotopes in
the ice and open areas in the ice where the ocean occurs at the surface to
determine how much heat from the melt water is added to the ocean . This
research will be important for the determination of the effects of the flux of
incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a function of changing atmospheric
and oceanic conditions. The results will help determine how atmospheric heating
is coupled to adsorption of heat by the sea ice and transferred to the ocean
during melting. These measurements are important to understanding how heat is
reflected or absorbed by the ice as it melts in the summer and thickens in the
winter in response to seasonal variations in climate. The combined set of
measurements of this project and the larger SHEBA program will allow refinement
of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to
better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under
a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
are increased above present levels.
