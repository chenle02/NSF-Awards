0322633&lt;br/&gt;Prather&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical components that permit
the miniaturization of an Application Specific Optical Integrated Circuit
(ASOIC) to a scale comparable to the wavelength of light represent a viable
candidate for developing chip-scale optical processing devices, such as
wavelength-division-multiplexed high-bandwidth optical communication links,
optical filters, lenses, switches, and routers. Currently, optical processing
devices tend to have a scale much larger than the wavelength of light, which
prohibits their use in on-chip applications. However, recent developments in the
area of nano-photonic devices has resulted in the ability to both design and
fabricate these devices. As such, the focus has now turned from "if" to "how."
That is to say, the question now is "how" should one go about realizing such
devices and circuits. Currently there are many proposed devices, design tools,
and fabrication processes. Thus, in this effort the PI will follow a consistent
path through the available techniques to demonstrate high performance integrated
planar photonic crystal devices. In particular, he will pursue the development
of such devices that are based on engineering the dispersion property of
photonic crystals. In so doing, he will demonstrate devices that exert control
over propagation waves within the crystal lattice by virtue of their unique
dispersion properties. To this end, the PI will begin by taking a broad view of
photonic crystal devices in the sense that they are electromagnetic components
that interact with optical waves on a subwavelength scale. In a general sense,
such devices can be thought of as devices that contain unique electromagnetic
dispersion properties. In this sense, they can be envisioned to belong to a
larger class of electromagnetically dispersive structures. Such structures can
consist of general periodic dielectric structures containing arbitrary two-
dimensional planar periodicity. For this case, one can properly engineer a PhC
that relies exclusively on the unique dispersion properties outside of the
bandga. To this end, numerous useful and interesting devices can be realized,
which is the emphasis of this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
