This project addresses core elements of an information base, key system
components of a Knowledge Plane for the future Internet. Today the Internet
network management functions are decreasingly available or capable of solving
our networking problems. We find a confluence of: current network management
being a human based ?cottage industry? limited to individual administrative
boundaries; and networks becoming increasingly more pervasive and central in
users? lives. In the context of tussles among policies, there is a need for
extensibility and distribution, and the necessity for controlled sharing and
exchange of information, the Knowledge Plane is a proposal for a new component
of the network architecture to provide self-knowledge, self-analysis, self-
prediction, and self-repair as much as possible.&lt;br/&gt;An important
component is the substrate in which information is collected, placed, made
available under policy control and accessed under that same policy control. This
work is taking the first step focusing on features the enable the ability to
make information available, a scoping approach to allow for scalability to the
size of the Internet, the ability to declare an interest in information
(rendezvous), delivery of that information under policy control. There are
further central aspects that are left to future work including: efficient
rendezvous mechanisms, truly efficient information distribution and delivery,
trust expression, and information location management. The contribution of this
work is that the information base is critically important to measurement and
monitoring required to insure that the future network infrastructure highly
available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
