Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposed research
is to identify molecular mechanisms for wall slip and flow instabilities leading
to sharkskin-like extrudate distortion commonly encountered in flow of highly
entangled polymeric materials. This is to be accomplished by performing five
experiments, the results of which will contribute to the understanding of
different facets of this complex phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;
