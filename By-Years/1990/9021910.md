The primary objective of this U.S.-Bulgaria cooperative research project
between Dr. Robert Begg of the Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Boian
Koulov of Sofia University is to study the impact of current changes in
Bulgarian national policies on the regional organization of manufacturing.
Efforts will focus largely on a case study of the Burgas region of Bulgaria
chosen because it is the fastest developing region and the site of a massive
petro-chemical complex with manufacturing heavily concentrated around the city
of Burgas. The researchers intend to examine the effects of the decentralization
of administrative and economic decision-making on the territorial organization
of manufacturing as Bulgaria moves away from a centrally planned economy toward
a market-oriented economy. In order to understand the changing pattern of
production and the causes, the researchers will: establish the historical
context and baseline data, identify and analyze national policy instruments, and
undertake fieldwork in the Burgas region. Results should help chart the
socioeconomic impact of new national policies on local economic planning,
decision-making at the plant level, firm start-ups and plant failures. This
project in geography and regional science fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
