Description: This project supports a cooperative project by the Professor Akif
Baha Balantekin, Department of Physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
Wisconsin and Dr. Tekin Dereli, Department of Physics, Koc University, Istanbul,
Turkey. They plan to conduct studies in theoretical physics, mainly on the
physics of neutrinos in gravitational fields, and many body problem in nuclear
structural physics. The objective is to have better understanding of the
neutrino masses and mixings, neutrino propagation through media and in strong
gravitational fields, understanding various aspects of core-collapse supernovae,
and understanding the origin of elements, especially those produced in rapid
neutron capture.

Scope: The research is in an area of U.S. national priority in nuclear science.
The collaboration involves U.S. and Turkish scientists in multidisciplinary
activities that connect particle, nuclear, condensed-matter physics and
astrophysics. A U.S. graduate student from the University of Wisconsin will
participate in the project and will work with scientists at Koc University, a
recently founded institution with excellent promise of contributing to
scientific collaboration between Turkey and the United States.
