This award provides funding for a three year Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site program in Brain, Sensory Systems and Behavior, at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, under the direction of Dr. Aixa Alfonso. This
program exposes a diverse group of undergraduates to the excitement and
challenges of pursuing original research at the intersection of the biological
and behavioral sciences. This is a renewal of a previously funded REU project
that will continue to train students in integrative neural and behavioral
science by working wih biologists, psychologists, and engineers who conduct
research within the areas of sensory processing and behavior, and synaptic
integration.
