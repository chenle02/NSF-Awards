9316902 Irving This award provides 54% of the funding required for the
acquisition of an equipment upgrade to the chemical analysis facility in the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Washington. A new
inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) unit, as well as
modernization of a used inductively- coupled atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-
AES) will enhance the department's ability to analyze the content of rocks,
minerals, soils, and other samples for diagnostic trace elements. Several
department faculty members are involved in basic research projects for which the
capabilities made possible by this upgrade are essential. The University of
Washington is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the project.
