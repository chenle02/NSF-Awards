9302522 Cerf A research and development project is proposed to extend the
results obtained in the earlier period of this cooperative project among the
National Science Foundation, National Library of Medicine, and the Corporation
for National Research Initiatives (CNRI). Working closely with the National
Library of Medicine, CNRI proposed to design and implement a prototype
distributed Application Gateway System (AGS) which will be situated between
existing and planned NLM information databases and users located on the
Internet. An AGS is made up of one or more powerful network servers interlinked
on a high speed local area network. The AGS can service users with simple
interactive terminals or it can accept and process Knowbot programs which embody
active search strategies constructed at the User Agent but interpreted by the
AGS. Each element of the distributed AGS system can be configured to provide
access to unique or replicated services. At the completion of the proposed
three-phase effort, the multiple components of the AGS will be manageable from a
network-based management station. To test the theories behind the Knowbot-based
Application Gateway System, it is proposed to deploy an experimental, scalable
system on the National Library of Medicine campus, link it to the Internet and
to explore its functionality and performance in that operational setting.
