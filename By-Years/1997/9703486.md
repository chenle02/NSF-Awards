Lineberger has submitted a renewal proposal to investigate the properties of
negative ions and their clusters in the gas phase using negative ion
photoelectron spectroscopy and ultrafast pump-probe excitation of ionic
complexes. With these techniques both the structural information and the
reaction dynamics will be investigated for a broad class of systems which are
either chemical transients, reactive intermediates, or transition state species.
Among the molecules to be studied are organic radicals and biradicals, metals
and metal clusters, and transition states for both unimolecular and bimolecular
processes. Electron affinities, singlet-triplet splittings, vibrational
frequencies, and geometrical information will be obtained. Ortho, meta, and para
forms of benzyne (C6H4) will be synthesized using stereochemical control.
Unimolecular processes investigated by ultrafast methods include the 1,2
hydrogen shift in vinylidene to form acetylene. The dynamics of ions in a
solvent cage will also be extended by following the appearance of products of
cage disintegration as well as solvent reorganization following electron
transfer in partially solvated ions. One goal of these studies is to increase
the quantitative understanding of the processes driving the simplest chemical
transformations. By studying the chemical transformations of molecules which are
both isolated as well as surrounded by solvent species, Lineberger will be able
to demonstrate the effect that different solvents have on reactivity as well as
on the rates at which these reactions proceed.
