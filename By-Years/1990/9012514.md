This grant will support the work of Colgate University Professor Charles
Holbrow, who will investigate the nuclear moments of radioactive nuclei. Using
the Stony Brook linear accelerator, radioactive recoil nuclei from heavy ion
nuclear reactions will be stopped and neutralized in a gas cell. Laser light-
induced resonance fluorescence will be used to examine the hyperfine spectra of
atoms formed with the radioactive nuclei. Undergraduate students from Colgate
University are participating in this research.
