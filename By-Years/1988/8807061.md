This interdisciplinary project is concerned with relationships between formal
quantitative methods used to aid diagnosis and decision making under undertainty
and the informal, largely qual- itative mental models employed by the human
beings who apply such methods. The goal is to be able to design effective user
inter- faces to the quantitative methods. Topics to be investigated include the
use of hierarchically structured influence diagrams to specify and display the
qualitative structure of models; ways of representing, propagating, and
analyzing vagueness and uncer- tainty; and quantitative and qualitative
explanations of model behavior. Research will include psychological experiments
to evaluate graphic tools for the probability encoding of uncertain influences
and to investigate probability encoding on the basis of causal and diagnostic
relations. The knowledge sought in this research is fundamental to the design of
machines that can effectively aid human beings in a quintessentially human
function: deciding important issues where much is known, but much remains
uncertain.
