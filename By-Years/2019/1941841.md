Synthetic Biology is the engineering of biomolecular processes for useful
functionalities for energy, environment, and medical applications. In the past
few years, there has been a dramatic increase of the use of systems and control
theoretic tools in synthetic biology. Systems and Control Theory has been
instrumental in many engineering domains, chiefly in Electrical, Mechanical, and
Aerospace engineering for obtaining desirable properties, including stable and
robust system behavior in the presence of environmental perturbations.
Biomolecular processes suffer from lack of robustness to context and this has
been hampering progress in the field. This problem has sparked notable interest
in the research community towards using systems and control theoretic tools for
equipping engineered biomolecular processes with robust behavior. This award
funds a workshop to bring together experts in synthetic biology, in the
application of systems and control theory to engineering biology, and in the use
of computer science to obtain biological design abstractions. Students from
local universities will be invited to the workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop, to be held in Spring/Summer 2020, seeks to discuss current challenges
in engineering biology and to set a research roadmap for how systems and control
theoretic approaches may be used and expanded to tackle some of these
challenges. This roadmap will provide researchers a rich set of problems to
investigate and will inform decision makers about areas where additional funding
may unlock the route of synthetic biology to societal impact. The workshop
includes broader talks, technical talks, and several group discussions.
Presentations of the outcomes of the group discussions will form the basis for a
workshop report, which will be publicly disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
