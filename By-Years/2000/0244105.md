A 10-week Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program will be held at the
University of Pittsburgh. Approximately 10 students and 2 high school teachers
will work with 10-12 faculty on physics-related research projects in fields
including condensed matter, physical chemistry, mechanical and biomechanical
engineering, magnetic resonance imaging, elementary particle physics (both high
energy and medium energy), astrophysics, and physics education. A number of the
projects have connections to biophysics. Students may be accepted as soon as
after their freshman year in college, through the summer before their senior
year. Information about projects, and other general information about the
program, may be found at: http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~reupfom. Students may
spend some time at projects off-site, and teachers, in particular, may work at
the CosRayHS project at the Univ. of Mo. at St. Louis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
addition to research activities in the lab, there are weekly reports and
conferences with the director, midterm and final presentations, and a final
paper. Every effort is made to support the students in attacking, intellectually
rigorously, a small piece of a real research project. There are also informal
workshops, an ethics forum, various informal social activities, and tutoring and
mentoring activities, in which participants serve as role models and
facilitators for younger students. Home institution advisors are invited to the
midterm presentations, for better general feedback on the students and the
program. Some of the most important contacts and feedback are among the students
themselves. &lt;br/&gt;
