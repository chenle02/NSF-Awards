This project will develop the use of infrared spectroscopy in the chemistry
laboratory curriculum at Allegheny College. The incorporation of fourier
transform infrared techniques is a key element for the success of our new
integrated laboratory program. Chemistry students will study and use infrared
spectroscopy starting at the introductory level and continuing through to the
senior year. The speed, resolution, and computerized data manipulation offered
by a fourier transform infrared are essential. Specific experiments include
characterization of polymers, of metal complexes, and of substances generated in
an integrated course in synthetic methods.
