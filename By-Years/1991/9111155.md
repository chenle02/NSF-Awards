ABSTRACT The ultimate goal of the project is to investigate the relationship
between phonology and phonetics for the feature Voice and other laryngeal
features, through a detailed phonological and phonetic study of several
languages. The purpose of the planning grant is two-fold. It will support
background work on the phonetics and phonology of voicing, increased familiarity
with the literature, exploration of possible phonetic methodologies, and
consultation with expert researchers. The second aspect of the plan is to
conduct preliminary research on three topics concerning different aspects of
voicing and related features. These include a study of sonorant voicing and
devoicing in English, a cross-linguistic study of the status of "voiceless"
nasals, and fieldwork and phonetic investigation of Madurese, an Austronesian
language spoken in Indonesia. The completion of these planning activities and
preliminary studies will enable the Principal Investigator to address broader
questions related to phonetic and phonological issues of voicing with the
purpose of developing a more comprehensive research proposal on the subject.
