The objective of the proposed STTR effort is to develop compact infrared laser
based gas sensors for the identification and monitoring of molecular species.
Ultimately, a series of infrared sources, each designed to monitor a particular
one or two molecular working the region form 3 to 6 um is planned. There is a
demonstrable need for gas monitoring in variety of application an IR
spectroscopic methods offer significant advantages for versatile in situ
detection of a large number of species. However, existing system such as FTIR
are not portable, are not rugged, and can be influenced by any backgrounds
effects. The new systems will incorporate solid-state technology to produce a
compact reasonable rugged, portable systems as a reasonable cost with high
spectral resoultion for certain species identification and accurate absorption
measurement that can be left unattended for long periods of time while reporting
gas concentrations by telemetry. Results of the research could have commercial
application in industrial process monitoring and pollution control.
