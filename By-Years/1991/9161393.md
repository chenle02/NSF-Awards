New technologies for producing useful products with engineered microstructure
and properties for optimized mechanical performance creates an insatiable demand
for materials processing and manufacturing. Plasma assisted chemical vapor
deposition (PACVD) is a new technique for materials processing that has the
capability to substantially enhance deposition rates. "Working" of a deposition
surface can cause continued renucleation to produce a very fine grained deposit,
defect and stress free that is smooth to virtually any thickness with
substantially improved mechanical properties. The program will develop a high
watt density plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process coupled with
continual in- situ "working" of the deposition surface to achieve
extraordinarily high deposition rates in a very fine grained stress free
deposits with mechanical properties substantially greater than conventional
materials. The process will be demonstrated with difficult to fabricate
refractory materials.
