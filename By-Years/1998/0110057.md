Copper is essential for normal growth and development of mammalian cells. It
serves as a cofactor for numerous enzymes mediating neurotransmitter
biosynthesis, radical detoxification, oxidative phosphorylation, and iron
transport. Currently, little is known on how copper became incorporated into
these proteins and how concentration of copper in a cell is regulated. This
project addresses these fundamental questions. The research is focused on HAH1,
a copper-chaperone, which delivers copper specifically to copper-transporting
ATPases in mammalian cells. The long-term goal of the studies is to understand
how HAH1 functions in a cell, and how its function is regulated. The
experimental approach includes combination of protein biochemistry, site-
directed mutagenesis, protein fragment complementation assay in cultured cell
lines, and chemical labeling. These techniques are utilized (i) to determine the
oligomerization state of intracellular HAH1 in the presence of different copper
concentrations, (ii) to characterize copper occupancy of HAH1 within the cell,
and (iii) to determine whether the in vivo interactions between HAH1 and the
copper-transporting ATPase are regulated by changes in copper concentration. The
results of these experiments will generate new information regarding key copper
transporters in mammalian cells and will advance understanding of basic
mechanisms regulating intracellular copper distribution.
