WEN&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207746&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a study of
seismic velocity and attenuation structures for both the Earth's inner and outer
core and their implications for mineral physics and dynamics. The seismic
structures will be studied based on the differential travel times and waveforms
of various PKP branches collected from the global and regional seismic networks.
Seismic studies will be performed for the "eastern" and "western" hemispheres
respectively, and in two steps: 1) establish two one-dimensional seismic
velocity and attenuation models of the Earth's inner and outer core for the PKP
phases sampling equatorial paths; and, 2) constrain anisotropy magnitudes and
transitions from a possible top isotropic layer to deep anisotropy in the inner
core.
