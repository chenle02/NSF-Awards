9354476 Foote This project is developing hypermedia-based instructional modules
to support a curriculum initiative called The Geographer's Craft. The
Geographer's Craft is a two-semester course and model for introductory training
in geographical methods, and is based upon a problem-solving, integrated
approach to the teaching of cartography, GIS, spatial statistics, and remote
sensing. It also addresses real-world issues with a range of textually
"appropriate" technical and conceptual tools and stresses independent thought
and reasoning skills. Prototype modules are being created to test software
designs and once a full suite of materials is complete, the Geographer's Craft
will become the core introductory course required of all majors and minors. The
project is also expected to introduce all geography students to the latest
research techniques, provide a means for non-majors to gain background in
valuable skills that complement their studies in other disciplines, and prepare
students for upper-division studies and advanced courses in geographical
techniques.
