The Department of Mathematics of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
will purchase a compute server, workstations, and other supporting equipment,
which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences.
The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: unproved claims left by Ramanujan in his notebooks; implementing
computational abstract mathematics, extending work on finite category theory and
the lambda calculus; graphs and associated simple Lie algebras via an embedding
of graphs into inner product spaces over GF(2); quasisolutions for finding
explicit solutions of some nonlinear PDE's; and connections between groups and
finite state automata.
