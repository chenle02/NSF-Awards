This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at Adelphi University in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported
scientists. The group will make precision measurements of the parameters which
specify the electroweak interactions within the Standard Model of interacting
quarks and leptons. They will initiate research on neutrino interactions at
Fermilab and participate in design studies for the SSC.
