Dr. Creese is studying the work of women in chemical research between 1800 and
1940. The project is based on an examination of women's publications in the
technical literature, primarily the journals published in Britain, France,
Germany, Russia/USSR, and the United States. Dr. Creese is establishing for each
country how much research was done by women chemists, who they were, where they
were working and what areas they were specializing in. This will provide a
unique base from which she will compare and contrast the work of women chemists
in the countries considered. In addition, she expects to fill in biographical
details for many of the women involved. This approach, with a slid basis in the
original technical literature, gives a picture of the achievements of women
chemists both broader and more detailed than anything so far published. This
project is part of the on- going reassessment of women's historical roles in
society.
