&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies focus on aromatic compound degradation by
the soil bacterium Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1. Catabolic pathways, which
serve as model systems for understanding many aspects of biology, can be
manipulated for bioremediation and for the generation of useful chemicals. The
success of such ventures rests on a thorough understanding of microbial
metabolic and genetic regulation. The first objective of this project is to
determine the molecular basis for a recently discovered novel type of
transcriptional activation. BenM, a transcriptional regulator involved in the
degradation of benzoate by strain ADP1, was found to respond synergistically to
two different metabolites. The synergistic modulation of transcriptional
regulation in response to more than one inducer can significantly alter gene
expression and may be a common biological regulatory feature. These studies will
determine the specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences that control how BenM
interacts with different effectors and DNA regions to regulate the expression of
multiple genes and operons involved in aromatic compound catabolism. The second
objective is to investigate preferential carbon source consumption by
Acinetobacter strains when multiple growth substrates are available. Many soil
bacteria degrade the components of a mixture of aromatic compounds in a
sequential fashion. However, the method by which aromatic-compound degrading
bacteria control the preferential consumption of carbon sources is unclear. In
ADP1, regulation may occur at the transcriptional level, the post-
transcriptional level, and/or at the level of substrate uptake into the cell.
This research project will address how CatM and BenM repress genes needed for
4-hydroxybenzoate catabolism.
