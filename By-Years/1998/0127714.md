This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is to design and develop
appropriate mathematical models and algorithms for optimizing the crosscut
operation in a wood processing (lumber processing) rough mill. The goal is to
incorporate these algorithms into an integrated software system for automatic
control of the process. The software system consists of a main engine that
contains the mathematical models and algorithms for finding an optimal cutting
pattern for each piece of incoming uncut lumber, along with all necessary
mechanisms to interface with (and to coordinate the operation of) various
components of the manufacturing line. These components include automatic
scanners, automatic crosscut saws, and all associated conveyor belts and
positioning devices. At the present time in most rough mills the task of
identifying a good cutting pattern for each piece of lumber is done by visual
inspection.

The commercial benefits of this software system wil be on the efficiency of the
crosscut operation, by increasing both its speed and its yield. This could lead
to substantial reductions in the manufacturing cost as well as significant
savings in the overall consumption of wood, which is a scarce national resource.
