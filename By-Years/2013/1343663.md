The very success of the industries that produce information technology (IT) and
the pervasiveness&lt;br/&gt;of their products and services in our daily lives
can obscure the mutually reinforcing&lt;br/&gt;roles that industry, government,
and academia play in conducting IT research and its translation&lt;br/&gt;into
new products, services, and industries. This project will capture examples of
such phenomena&lt;br/&gt;as how much industry builds on government-funded
university research, the long incubation&lt;br/&gt;periods sometimes needed for
research to be translated into major industry activities, the&lt;br/&gt;steady
work and funding required to get from initial exploration to large-scale
commercial&lt;br/&gt;deployment, the interdependencies between research advances
in different subfields, and the&lt;br/&gt;complex nature of the IT research
ecology. This project will build on earlier work by&lt;br/&gt;developing
additional and/or more in-depth examples and providing updated
information&lt;br/&gt;on research impacts and the other phenomena listed above
in the context of these examples.
