Professor Joseph Shinar of Iowa State University is developing structurally
integrated sensors utilizing an organic light emitting device for the detection
of anthrax. The resulting battery-operated sensors will be ideal for
applications in the area of homeland security as they are both selective and
fast, but also inexpensive. The device takes the novel approach of integrating
the excitation light source with the sensing component itself. This is expected
to enhance detection sensitivity. While this new type of sensor is expected to
have an immediate impact on homeland security it is also expected to lead to
applications in medicine and environmental monitoring. A number of graduate
students will participate in this highly interdisciplinary project and will be
drawn from a variety of disciplines including physics, engineering, biophysics,
molecular biology and chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported
jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat
Terrorism Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences
supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the
potential to contribute to national security.&lt;br/&gt;
