This planning grant for departmental level reform will develop curricular
changes to the undergraduate program in the Civil and Environmental Engineering
Department at Wayne State University. An innovative strategy for enhanced
learning, recruitment and retention in our undergraduate program will be
designed and evaluated as part of the proposed effort. A major component of this
strategy will be the use of a "real-life" civil engineering project as
the&lt;br/&gt;background/foundation to weave together the numerous, often
seemingly disconnected course requirements in our undergraduate curriculum,
starting from the freshman level Introduction to Design course through to the
senior level Capstone Design course. Study of emerging technologies, which are
currently available primarily in the graduate curriculum, will be added to the
undergraduate curriculum during the planning stages of this project. Specific
courses will be developed in response to this planning grant, as well as
revision of the method of teaching existing courses. The objective is to design
a curriculum that best meets the emerging workforce and educational needs of US
industry, with a particular emphasis on the civil engineering needs of the urban
environment.&lt;br/&gt;
