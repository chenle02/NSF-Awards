An important goal in software engineering is to describe complex software
systems at an architectural level of abstraction. While architectural design has
always been a major factor in determining the success of a software system,
architectural descriptions are typically understood only in informal, idiomatic
ways. Because of this informality architectural designs are typically not well-
integrated into the software development environments, but appear (if at all) as
corroborative high-level documentation for a system. This research places
architectural design on a more solid footing in two complementary ways. First,
it provides a formal basis for describing and reasoning about architectural
designs. This leads to rules for checking whether architectural designs are
well-formed in a way that is analogous to type checking for existing
implementation languages. Second, it provides tools for developing style-
specific architectural design environments. These tools provide cost-effective
ways to generate new environments tailored to the architectural design of
specific application families. This grant includes support under the Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program.
