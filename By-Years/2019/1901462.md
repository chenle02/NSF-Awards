The project concerns the anomalous spectral and diffusive properties of
quasiperiodic and other deterministic and random structures. This is research on
the fundamental properties of disordered systems that serve as models of systems
with impurities. Quasiperiodic operators provide central or important models for
integer quantum Hall effect, experimental quasicrystals and the quantum chaos
theory. The development of the rigorous theory is expected to contribute to the
understanding of all the above phenomena, and in particular, may lead to finding
new materials with desired physical properties. Disordered systems are also used
in modeling many other micro and macro effects: from quantum localization to
earthquakes. The proposed topics include studying properties of both highly and
weakly disordered systems of Quantum Mechanics that demonstrate certain
anomalous behavior. An integral part of the project concerns educating graduate
students and other young researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists
of several parts. One is to prove the extended states for multidimensional
quasiperiodic operators. Another is to study the effects of interaction in
tight-binding quasi-periodic models. One more is to develop a new,
determinantal, approach to multidimensional Anderson localization. Other
important objectives are the study of issues related to certain models of
quantum chaos. The project involves the continuing development of non-
perturbative methods for the proofs of localization type effects both in
Schrodinger operators and in quantum spin systems, percolation and contact
processes in disordered environments, as well as for the study of absolutely
continuous spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
