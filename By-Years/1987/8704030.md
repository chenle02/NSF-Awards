Sterol Control of Phospholipid Biosynthetic Reactions: Dr. Bloch, a senior
scientist and Nobel laureate, will review, analyze and coordinate data from his
and other laboratories bearing on sterol functional relationships to
phospholipid biosynthesis and effects on eukaryotic membranes. Dr. Bloch with
his profound knowledge of sterol biochemistry, his wide experience, and large
amount of available data is in a position to draw conclusions or suggest studies
that may permit us to have greater control of the regulation of membrane
phenomena.
