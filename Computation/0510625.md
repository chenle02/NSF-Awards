Research on this project involves applying the theory of rigid and non-rigid
frameworks and tensegrities to problems in discrete geometry. Examples involve
extending the principle investigator's results on the Kneser-Poulsen problem
concerning the volume of the union or intersection of spherical disks under
contractions of their centers, bellows problems involving the invariance of the
volume bounded by flexible surfaces, the opening of robot arms, the cataloguing
of certain stable highly symmetric tensegrity structures, and stability
questions involving packings of granular materials.

Consider granular materials, which are seen in avalanches, sand, rock piles,
piles of M&M's, pills, grain, seeds, powders, and the regolith on asteroids and
planets. A good example of an application of the theory above is when an
external force is applied to a granular material. Understanding the way that
force is transmitted throughout the material is important, and the mathematical
theory of rigid structures can be used to justify, elucidate, and simplify the
calculations of these forces.
