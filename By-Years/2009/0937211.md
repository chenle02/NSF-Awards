The national conference "First National Forum of Young Topologists" will take
place at Tulane University in New Orleans (most likely November 13 - 15, 2009).
The main aim of the conference is to bring together graduate students working in
various areas of topology. Prominent topologists will talk to the students about
the past and the future of topology of manifolds in higher and lower dimensions.
Some young topologists will share with students their experience of being
succesful in completing Ph.D thesis and securing a job in academics.

During the conference students will exchange ideas, and will talk about their
problems and worries that they face when working on their Ph.D degrees. They
will also have a chance to obtain more global and comprehensive views of several
active research areas of topology. It is hoped that this conference will
establish a network among graduate students in topology and will build a sense
of community.
