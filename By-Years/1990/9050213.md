We propose to develop curriculum materials for both students and teachers aimed
at helping students integrate concepts into problem solving in the domain of
classical mechanics. The materials will supplement traditional instruction by
providing homework and in-class exercises that would allow students to actively
engage in problem solving activities that highlight concept-based problem
solving, and by providing teachers with instructional strategies to reinforce
the approach. The materials will be designed in collaboration with high school
physics teachers and will be based on a rich body of cognitive research. The
proposed work is an attempt to complement students' proclivity to rely almost
exclusively on formulaic approaches to problem solving by encouraging conceptual
approaches.
