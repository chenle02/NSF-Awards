9408903 Ruskai Several problems in the mathematical analysis of multi-particle
systems will be studied. The main emphasis is on bound states of atomic and
molecular Hamiltonians, including those for systems in magnetic fields. The use
of radial wavelets for multi-scale analysis of the Coulumb singularity will also
be considered. Finally, some related problems in operatorinequalities are
proposed. Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is aproduct of the
twentieth century. It is founded firmly in the last century's attempt to address
the microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the concepts of action-
at-a distance, electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical
foundations for these developments, collectively called mathematical physics,
ranges from the detailed analysis of Schroedinger operators, which governs the
dynamics of particles, to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four
known forces into a single theory. ***
