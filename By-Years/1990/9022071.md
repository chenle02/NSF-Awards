This research will examine the feasibility of combining vacuum microelectronics
and microelectromechanical devices together on the same silicon chip.
Specifically, it will examine the feasibility of using vacuum microelectronics
to drive a silicon micromotor. The technologies that could be developed under
this grant could also apply to combination of electronics and micro-sensors
capable of withstanding harsh environments-high temperature, high nuclear
irradiation flux--together on a single chip. The major objectives of this
research are to compare technology options available for both vacuum
microelectronics and microelectromechanical devices, to select a compatible set,
to design a silicon micromotor compatible with vacuum microelectronic drive
circuits, and to begin fabrication of the design.
