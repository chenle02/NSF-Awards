9351390 Sirvatka This project is involving students with methods of data
assimilation and presentation early in their study of meteorology. A Local Area
Network (LAN) is being established to facilitate optimum acquisition of data,
and to allow for student access to the LAN and all its data. A RISC Workstation,
three PCs and a laptop PC are providing the core of the LAN, while a laser
printer and a video projection system are allowing for effective presentation.
The proposed equipment is enabling majors and nonmajors to immerse themselves in
laboratory experiences that are supplementing classroom instruction in every
course in the meteorology curriculum. Practical operation with emphasis on
forecasting and investigation of current research findings is heightening
students' critical thinking ability and instilling the process of scientific
thinking into the educational experience. Students also are having the
opportunity to apply the skills learned in laboratory in cooperation with
forecasting done by the Northeast Illinois Severe Weather Spotter Network. ***
