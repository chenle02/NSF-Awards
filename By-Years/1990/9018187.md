The PIs propose to establish an embedded systems laboratory to be used to
support two new courses in the area of real-time systems and applications.
Project funds will be used to purchase equipment and software to permit students
hands-on-experience in designing and solving real time problems. Tangible
outputs of this project will include two new text books, instructional manuals,
software and tools. Support will be provided to transfer the real-time systems
environment to other institutions.
