Measurements will be made of the rheological properties of suspensions of fibers
in Newtonian fluids. Two techniques, falling ball rheometry and rotational
viscometry, will be used and the results compared.The influence of fiber volume
fraction, fiber aspect ratio, and fiber orientation will be studied.
Complimentary studies for suspensions of spheres are being carried out by the
principal investigator with industrial and national laboratory collaboration. If
time permits, joint work with a theoretician will model the falling ball
experiments. The research should assist in understanding the flow of fluids with
complex microstructure such as are used in preparing fiber reinforced structures
and possibly in influencing the structure of the final product. There is a
possibility that the experimental results would stimulate theoreticians to
develop very different approaches to the modelling of suspension rheology.
