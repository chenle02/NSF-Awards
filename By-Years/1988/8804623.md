The atmospheric boundary layer over flat terrain has been extensively studied,
and many of the results can be applied in a local sense to less idealized
conditions. But undulating terrain introduces unique effects which generate
internal waves in the overlaying fluid, which will be reabsorbed at levels where
the wind reverses. Thus, the wind experiences wave-induced drag, turbulence, and
horizontal eddying. Current middle-atmosphere studies address such problems, and
it should prove advantageous to both fields to address the boundary layer in a
similar fashion. This research also investigates a new type of atmospheric wave
mode which requires a "lid" to prevent the wave energy from leaking off into the
upper atmosphere. The lid for this new mode occurs at the height where its
intrinsic frequency matches the local inertial frequency. One consequence of
this is that the duct properties change with latitude; in the tropical
troposphere wave momentum can be funneled towards a destructive terminator in
the subtropics. Such wave-associated transports influence the distribution of
zonal angular momentum.
