In recent years, economic scholars in a wide variety of specializations have
become increasingly interested in questions of Political Economy. A central
objective of this movement has been to supplement our understanding of the
relationships between the political environment (including institutions) and the
economic policies that are adopted. Though much progress has been made,
virtually nothing is known about the strategic issues arising from the
possibility that a legislature might choose to reconsider some provision of a
law after its passage but prior to its implementation. Legislative
reconsideration is a common occurrence in practice. Moreover, it gives rise to
complex strategic issues. The adoption of a policy provision for some future
period changes the political landscape. Further discussion of the issues prior
to the law's implementation takes place against a different backdrop. Though the
provision can be changed, repealed, or replaced before it becomes effective, its
adoption alters the terms of the ensuing debate. The purpose of this project is
to explore the effects of legislative reconsideration on economic policy
selection. The analysis identifies and explores a tendency for reconsideration
to create high concentration of political power (irrespective of whether
policies are actually changed after adoption and prior to implementation). Using
the tools of game theory, the project undertakes comparative institutional
analysis, examining the role of reconsideration under a variety of alternative
rules and procedures within the context of particular economic problems. It
seeks to understand the mechanisms by which particular institutions control (or
fail to control) the tendency toward high concentration of power, and to
elucidate the implications for economic policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
findings of this research are relevant to a wide range of practical issues.
Collective choice problems are pervasive not only in public policy making, but
also in cooperative research, education, partnerships, networks, and many other
forms of social activity. These problems are resolved through a wide variety of
formal and informal procedures. By improving our understanding of the
relationships between procedures and outcomes, the study of collective choice
will provide constructive guidance concerning the choice of procedures and the
design of institutions. Insights concerning the effects of various rules on the
influence of underrepresented groups may prove particularly useful.&lt;br/&gt;
