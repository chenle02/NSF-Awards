Using experiments and materials from an existing web-based laboratory and a
collection of donated experiments and hard-to-produce stimulus materials (e.g.,
sound files, graphics, and movies), this project is assembling a digital library
that consists of (1) highly interactive, web-deliverable psychology experiments
and demonstrations, (2) a cumulative data archive from which students can
retrieve datasets for analysis, and (3) user-controlled data extraction and
analysis tools designed for the diverse needs of end users. The project is led
by the American Psychological Association (APA) and also involves the University
of Mississippi and Northern Iowa University. An advisory board is providing site
management to assure the quality, coherence, and pedagogical value of all
library materials, as well as the comprehensiveness of the
collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once constructed, the Online Psychology Library
(OPL) will be an active learning resource open to every student with access to
an Internet-connected computer. The Library's experiment delivery, data
downloads, and one-click analysis tools will permit the easy integration of
teaching and research at institutions that do not currently offer support for
student research and even by teachers who are not adept in experimental design
and data analysis. Psychology students will be able to collect data, analyze
data, and report their findings for class assignments or individual projects.
Further, because psychology is allied to many disciplines--biology, sociology,
and political science among them--OPL will contribute to the set of experiments
available to students who wish to study psychologically-based issues in related
scientific disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
