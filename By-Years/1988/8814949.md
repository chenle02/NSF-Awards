This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the general area of organometallic chemistry and deals specifically with
the chemistry of metalloporphyrin compounds. The research is intended to produce
a set of new and unusual substances whose physical and chemical properties will
add to the fundamental understanding of the structural chemistry of heavy metal
compounds, and which may also be useful as catalysts or as magnetic polymers.
The project encompasses synthetic and physical studies of 4d and 5d
metalloporphyrin complexes in the following five areas: multiple metal-metal
bonded dimers, organometallic chemistry, electrically conducting and
ferromagnetic polymers, electrode catalysts for multielectron reduction of
dioxygen and dinitrogen, and dioxygen binding by complexes of ruthenium, osmium
and rhodium "picnic basket" porphyrins. Among the different methodologies to be
employed are inorganic and organic synthesis, structure determination,
electrochemistry, NMR spectroscopy, measurements of magnetism, polymer chemistry
and conductivity measurements.
