9320192 Neuts This award is for the acquisition of two SparcStation 10 Model 30
workstations for the Laboratory of Algorithmic Research in the Department of
Systems and Industrial Engineering at the University of Arizona. The
workstations would significantly upgrade present equipment in the Laboratory.
The research involved deals with point processes, queues and other probability
models primarily related to communications engineering. It requires major
implementations of numerical and symbolic algorithms as well as extensive
computer experimentation. Methods for the analysis of queueing models involve
computer-intensive matrix-iterative methods. One line of research is to develop
methods suitable for large matrices. Such investigation will require more
advanced workstations than those presently in the Laboratory. Another line of
current work deals with data-analytic methods for very large sets of counting
data. In addition to processing speed and excellent graphics the investigation
requires a workstation with a large memory. Equipment in the Laboratory of
Algorithmic Research is also used by others for research. One group deals with
modeling the spread of epidemics and with methodology for automated computer
learning and optimization. Another is for investigating Markov decision problems
and a variety of their applications. In addition, these researchers are
developing mathematical software for the solution of Markov decision problems.
The Laboratory also attracts many visiting researchers and postdoctoral fellows.
The equipment in the laboratory further supports the computational needs of
these in dividuals. *** h X .. X SYSTEM X SETUP EXE @ j p SETUP HLP @ j SETUP
