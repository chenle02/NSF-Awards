Computer-based data acquisition and processing instruments are being
incorporated into several experiments in the undergraduate meteorological
instrumentatin course, primarily for use with wind tunnel anemometer and vane
calibration experiments and solar radiation spatial measurements. A remote
meteorological measurement system is being acquired for classrom lecture
demonstrations, use in laboratory courses and for field measurements in
connection with senior thesis research projects. The faculty is working with
selected seniors to develop new pedagogical tools based on the new
instrumentation and computer data processing systems. The university will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
