With funding from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, a team at
Roosevelt University (RU), partnering with Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the
Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), and Oakton Community College (OCC), will
recruit and prepare science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
majors and STEM professionals for careers in teaching secondary mathematics and
science. RU and OCC will work closely to ensure the communication of clear
advising and financial aid information to OCC STEM students and to organize
recruitment activities with the goal of providing compelling invitations to
careers in teaching mathematics and science in high-need schools. Furthermore,
the Field Museum for Natural History will be a key collaborator on the design
and implementation of internship activities. At RU, there are two pathways to
teacher licensure: a traditional four-year undergraduate track and a traditional
graduate degree option for career changers and recent college graduates. Over
its five-year duration, the project will recruit 5-6 new undergraduate Scholars
and 5 new post-baccalaureate Scholars per year, for a total of 42 new
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a theoretical underpinning, this project will
intentionally examine and support the development of STEM teacher identities to
enhance their confidence and competence in STEM content knowledge and
pedagogical knowledge as well as their translation of such knowledge into
teaching practices. Thus, in addition to recruiting Scholars and preparing them
for K-12 STEM teaching careers, project goals include: (1) strengthen RU's
course-based approach to the development of STEM identities and (2) strengthen
pre-student teaching curricular experiences. The project will also be an example
of a partnership between a four-year institution of higher education (IHE) and a
two-year IHE as well as a partnership between a four-year IHE and a museum.
