This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Indiana University at Bloomington upgrade of its the
x-ray diffraction laboratory. Among the areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the upgrade are the following: 1) 3d metal carboxylate chemistry,
with concentration of effort on Mn and Fe, 2) early transition metal/sulfur
chemistry, primarily of V, 3) the study of paramagnetic hydride compounds, 4)
the compositional and structural characterization of plastic and disordered
solids, 5) dinuclear transition metal chemistry, 6) small molecule activation by
alkoxide supported metal clusters, 7) molecular precursors in solid-state
synthesis, and 8) metallorganic polymers and liquid crystals. Single crystal
x-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for structure
determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and
organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool
to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the knowledge
of the molecular composition and structure helps to develop new reactions of
potentially general interest in catalysis or synthesis.
