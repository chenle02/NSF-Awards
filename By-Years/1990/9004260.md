This award is for support of a research program to use nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in conjunction with other analytical techniques to
investigate four important issues of mineralogical and geochemical interest.
These issues are: 1) the behavior of important, rock-forming minerals undergoing
structural phase transitions, 2) the structural environments of hydrogen-
containing species in aluminosilicate glasses and the mechanisms of diffusion of
these species in these glasses, 3) cation order/disorder in some phases stable
at high pressure that may be important minerals in the earth's mantle, and 4)
the structural environments and dynamic behavior of cations adsorbed on clay
minerals. The work will be carried out by the P.I. and his associated at the
University of Illinois.
