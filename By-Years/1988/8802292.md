Partial support is requested to help defray room and board expenses for
graduate students attending the Southeastern Regional Developmental Biology
Conference to be held at Duke University on May 6-8, 1988. The session topics
will be: I. Molecular Approaches to Early Development II. Developmental Biology
of Plants III. Development of Synapse: Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms IV.
Response to Injury and Regeneration of CNS Neurons V. Regulation of Globin Genes
during Development and Differentiation VI. Posters The purpose of the regional
meetings is to bring together scientists working in the south east in an
informal atmosphere. These meetings provide an opportunity for graduate
students, post doctoral fellows and senior researchers to meet and exchange
information in a small manageable group. The meetings therefore provide a
valuable training function for the junior members.
