This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
James S. Nowick at the University of California Irvine. A new strategy will be
developed for controlling peptide secondary structure by linking multiple amino
acid chains to a stiff oligomeric backbone that serves as a molecular scaffold.
The molecular scaffold will be based upon an oligourea that will be synthesized
in an iterative fashion. This strategy will be used to create beta-sheets and to
develop molecular receptors for small peptides. %%% The three dimensional
structure of a peptide will be controlled by linking the peptide chain to a
rigid molecular backbone. The backbone will be designed to hold several peptides
in parallel and antiparallel fashions. This represents a fundamentally new
approach to the control of protein structure. The design of the backbone is
ideally suited for the development of receptors for small peptides.
