There is a large literature investigating the notion that in markets where
knowledge is dispersed across different agents, prices serve not only to
allocate resources but to transmit information. Agents expectations are assumed
to be rational in the sense that they are aware of the information revealed by
prices. Almost all work so far has concerned competitive markets or monopolies.
A major emphasis has been on the amount of information that one can expect to be
transmitted in such markets under rational expectations. The contribution of
this project comes from investigating the nature of rational expectations
equilibrium when some of the agents have sufficient market power to be able to
affect prices but there is no monopoly. This is a very difficult problem because
the amount of information transmitted becomes a matter of strategic choice. The
project elucidates the nature of rational expectations equilibrium in such a
framework of imperfect competition and compares the degree of information
revelation with that in a competitive model.
