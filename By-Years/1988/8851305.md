The project is allowing students to experience one of the most powerful, modern
techniques of chemical mixture analysis. The ability of the University to
analyze organic substances is being greatly enhanced by the purchase of a
benchtop Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) System. Methods for
analysis of air-borne and water-transported organic components from the many
petroleum, petrochemical, and agricultural industries in South Texas are being
developed in Environmental Chemistry. In Instrumental Analysis, applications of
this modern technique are being presented for student instruction. With the
GC/MS, experiments exploring reaction mechanisms through product distributions
and the use of isotope tracers are being developed for the Advanced Synthesis
Laboratory. All of the above activities can apply to problems in Undergraduate
Research. The GC/MS is reducing the separation and analysis time needed for many
projects to the point where undergraduates can realistically consider completing
some quality research during their short tenure. The significance of the project
is great for the education of the population of South Texas. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
