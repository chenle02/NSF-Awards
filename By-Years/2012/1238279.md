Multidisciplinary (99) &lt;br/&gt;This project is built around a workshop for
faculty and professional society representatives from 10 disciplines in order to
develop, integrate, and disseminate instructional resources to community college
faculty and professional societies. This set of activities builds on the
extensive experience of the three PIs in conducting workshops in their
discipline (economics, social sciences, and geosciences). The project is
leveraging the expertise and capacity of the Science Education Resource Center
(SERC) at Carleton College. SERC is a resource that provides expert technical
support for web-based instructional materials and improved undergraduate STEM
education.
