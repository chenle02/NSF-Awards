This study examines the processes surrounding investigative interviewing and
interrogation, by testing approaches founded in research on strategies of truth
telling and deceiving. Participants in this experiment will be asked to watch
videotapes of former criminal defendants in interrogations or pre-interrogation
interviews conducted by actual police detectives denying involvement in crimes
which they either have or have not committed or confessing to crimes which they
have or have not committed. The participants will then be asked to make
determinations of the suspects' credibility and veracity during the respective
phases of the interrogation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study differed
from previous research in that it investigates the possibility that psychopathic
personality moderates a suspect's ability to evade detection while being
mendacious. Videotapes will also be coded to determine whether psychopaths
differ from nonpsychopaths in their verbal and nonverbal cues while being
deceptive. In line with the extant literature, it is hypothesized that a)
psychopathic individuals will display verbal and nonverbal cues while lying
which differ from nonpsychopathic individuals, b) psychopathy will have a
moderating effect on a participant's veracity judgments such that psychopathic
individuals will more often be judged as truthful when denying involvement in
the crimes they committed, and c) psychopathy will moderate participants'
veracity judgments such that the false confessions provided by psychopathic
individuals will be seen as more believable than false confessions provided by
nonpsychopathic individuals. It is believed that the results of this study will
enhance the theoretical understanding of deceptive presentations as well as
provide important information to investigative practitioners.
