This award provides research support under the Foundation's Presidential Young
Investigator Awards (PYIA) program. Current and recently completed research
includes a study of surface cracks in concrete slabs as a function of
environmental conditions and surface finishing techniques. Work is also in
progress on corrision of reinforcing steel and alkali-aggregate reaction. Plans
for the immediate future include expansion of these projects, plus evaluation of
the porosity of concrete as a function of construction procedures. Experimental
work will be coupled with the development of an "Expert System" as a means of
packaging advanced concrete technology in a manner accessible to the jobsite.
