Airborne gravity gradiometry is a technology that has only recently been
developed, but which has enormous potential. It is capable of making absolute
gravity gradient measurements of great precision very rapidly over almost any
kind of terrain, and at a relatively modest cost. It could well revolutionize
measurements involving gravity for various types of studies focused on the
shallow crust, and because the instrument determines absolute values, for time
lapse studies as well. The former could include, for example, studies involving
the detection of blind faults, determination of the thickness of sedimentary
fill or of basalt flows and lithologic contacts in densely vegetated areas as
well as environmental and mineral exploration related problems. The latter could
help trace fluid flow in the shallow crust or magma movement in volcanoes, as
well as other movements of material within the shallow crust on the human time
scale.

Only two airborne gradiometers are actually operational today. Both are based on
Lockheed Martin's GGI gradiometer and have been adapted for airborne work
jointly by Lockheed Martin and BHP. It is clear that this technology is in its
infancy and some preliminary experimentation is necessary in order to test its
suitability for crustal work. This project involves an aerial gradiometer survey
of the proposed drill site for the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth
(SAFOD), a component of EAR's Earthscope Initiative. SAFOD will involve drilling
a 4 km deep hole which will intersect the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield, CA.
In addition to helping determine the deep structure at the proposed drill site,
the fact that the gradiometer makes absolute measurements can be put to another
use. It is quite possible that in a time lapse experiment, that is by making two
measuremenbts over the identical space separated in time, changes in the
subsurface can be monitored. These changes could be the motion of fluids or
changes associated with an earthquake. For the latter experiment, it is
obviously important to establish a base line measurement before the earthquake.
If a number of measurements are made it may be also possible to see if fluid
motions in the shallow subsurface are reliable precursors to earthquakes. ***
