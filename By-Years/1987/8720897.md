This is a collaborative project between Clement (Texas A&amp;M) and Martinson
(Columbia). Preliminary results of paleomagnetic studies of sediments from ODP
Sites 646 and 647 in the northwest Atlantic indicate that these high
sedimentation rate sections contain detailed records of the Cobb Mountain
Subchronozone. Continuous sampling by Clement of the sediment from DSDP Hole
609B has already yielded a very detailed record of this short, normal polarity
interval. The PIs will sample the sediment from Holes 646 and 647 in more detail
and conduct a thorough paleomagnetic and rock magnetic study of these samples in
an attempt to replicate the record obtained from Hole 609B. They will
quantitatively correlate the resultant vector time series components from each
site to one another using the objective, nonlinear method of Martinson. This
will establish a statistical foundation from which to evaluate the degree to
which similarities exist in the records. This information will be used to
examine the fidelity of deep-sea sediments as high resolution field recorders
and the extent to which the differences in the records may be explained as site
dependent field behavior.
