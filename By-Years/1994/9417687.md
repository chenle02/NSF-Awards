Ripley 9417687 This pilot project will study processes involved in the
development of hydrothermal flow systems associated with continental rift-
related magmatism. The project will emphasize stable and radiogenic isotopic
studies of volcanics and related hypabyssal rocks associated with the Duluth
Complex in northeastern Minnesota. Results will contribute to an understanding
of possible origins of platinum group element mineralization in the Duluth
complex, and will lead to a better understanding of crust-magma interaction in
rifting environments.
