The basic research topic is the formation of ordered micellar solutions. The
proposed research is a natural extension of past research. Micellar systems with
a Landau point in the isotropic nematic transition line offer a unique
opportunity to study critical phenomena which they intend to explore fully. In
other experiments curvature elastic and flow properties of the ionic
conductivity of micellar nematics will be measured with aim of investigating the
effects of co-surfactants over concentration ranges that extend from hexagonal
phases to lamellar smectic phases. New additives of special interest are
polymeric surfactants. They will affect the dynamics of micellization and
influence flow properties. In theoretical research, they will investigate
ribbon-like micelles and relate their properties to the formation of different
types of nematic phases. A second theoretical effort is directed toward a model
for a new type of a cholesteric modification detected in biaxial cholesterics.
