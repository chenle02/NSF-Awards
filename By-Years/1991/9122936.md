Phylogenetic analysis is critical to an evolutionary understanding of any
character distribution, including that of sexuality, and yet there has been no
concerted effort to apply phylogenetic methods to studying the evolution of sex.
This study will examine the phylogenies of two related groups of South American
weevils that consist primarily of parthenogenetic species. Morphological
evidence indicates that each group includes a speciose clade that is primitively
parthenogenetic. The study will rely primarily on mitochondrial DNA sequences
for phylogenetic analysis. Flow cytometry and allozyme data will be used to
confirm the distribution of parthenogenesis and to provide additional data on
relationships among clones. The ages of parthenogenetic clades and their
origination and extinction rates will be estimated using DNA sequence data. This
study will lay the groundwork for testing theories of sex using parthenogenetic
weevils; it aims to serve as a model for a much-needed program of phylogenetic
research into the evolutionary biology of sex.
