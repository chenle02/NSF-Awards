9316465 Bennett This project seeks to quantify the mass transport properties of
fracture skins and to sue these properties in simulations of mass transport in
flowing ground water. The project builds on preliminary studies on fracture-skin
properties conducted at the University of Texas at Austin. These studies
investigated both welded tuffs and Paleozoic sandstones and documented
fundamental changes in rock porosity, permeability, and mineralogy in the skins
when compared to the unaltered rock. This project will expand this effort and
will, for the first time to our knowledge, estimate the diffusion coefficients
and sorptivities of fracture skins through closely controlled laboratory
experiments. Two experimental apparatuses will be constructed to estimate these
properties. One design will examine sorption by fractures skins in an artificial
fracture-column under conditions of forced ground-water flow. The second design
will utilize wafers or disks, designed for use in The University of Texas
electronic minipermeameter, to measure diffusion coefficients and sorption for
samples of fracture skins and unaltered rock matrices. These data will be
utilized in analytical and/or numerical models to estimate how fracture skins
alter the rates of mass transport. The results may be significant in problems of
siting radioactive (and other) waste disposal facilities, extraction of
petroleum from fractured reservoirs, and a variety of fundamental geological
problems, such as diagenesis, formation of mineral deposits, and calculation of
ground-water recharge. ***
