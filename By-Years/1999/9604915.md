9604915 Wu This award supports cooperation between Yue Wu and Daxing Han,
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Kong Guanglin, Institute of
Semiconductors, Chinese Academy od Sciences, Beijing, on the role of hydrogen in
the metastability of hydrogenated amorphous silicon. The research problem is an
important one that has not been satisfactorily addressed despite much research
over the years. The investigators propose a joint study of infrared absorption
and nuclear magnetic resonance to explore the metastable photostructural effects
associated with extended illumination. The Chinese group has recently published
results that are somewhat controversial; cooperation in further research in this
area will allow the US team to advance current understanding by attempting to
replicate results on other samples of amorphous silicon produced by other growth
techniques. Advances in this research could contribute to improved technology in
both photovoltaics and flat-panel displays. This project is jointly supported by
NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Natural Science
Foundation of China.
