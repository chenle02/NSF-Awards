The EarthScope science program supports geoscientific exploration of the North
American continent to better understand what it is made of, how it was put
together, how it works, and why processes like volcanoes and earthquakes take
place. Understanding the processes shaping the Earth is important for
understanding potential hazards that may take place, as well as for
characterizing what natural resources may exist. The EarthScope National Office
at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks serves a broad community of stakeholders,
including researchers, teachers, students, decision makers, and the general
public in facilitating and coordinating activities related to synthesizing and
disseminating the scientific discoveries made through EarthScope.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EarthScope science program has had a long
history of supporting research on the structure and dynamics of the North
American continent. The EarthScope National Office at the University of Alaska,
Fairbanks will serve as the nexus for the EarthScope community through the next
phase of the EarthScope program. A major focus of this EarthScope National
Office will be to help coordinate and facilitate synthesis of major outcomes
from EarthScope research and education and outreach. In addition to supporting
community-derived synthesis activities, the Office will convene a series of
synthesis workshops based on topics proposed by the community, and the outcomes
of these workshops will be published on the website, as well as provide the
foundation for review papers and special journal issues. The EarthScope National
Office will also serve the community through leadership and coordination of a
variety of core functions. The Office will continue to coordinate EarthScope-
related activities with GAGE, SAGE, and SAFOD core repository personnel,
including providing leadership of the EarthScope Steering Committee. Another
major focus of this EarthScope National Office will be outreach to both the
EarthScope scientific community as well as to the broader public through an
increased science writing portfolio and a more frequently updated EarthScope
website. Other EarthScope Education and Outreach activities that the Office will
continue to support include the EarthScope Speaker Series, Newsletter, and
biannual National Meeting.
