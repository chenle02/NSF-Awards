The rare gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon) are important
geochemical tracers. Their elemental abundances are useful in understanding the
physical and chemical processes responsible for the formation of rocks,
meteorites, seawater, groundwater, and the atmosphere. Their radiogenic isotopes
(e.g., helium-4, argon-40, xenon-129) provide important time constraints on
geological events. The high-precision analysis required for geological
interpretations based on extremely small abundances of these rare gases require
state-of-the-art mass spectrometric techniques. This award will provide 50% of
the funds required to purchase a modern mass spectrometer system for noble
gases. The instrument will be installed and maintained in the Division of
Geological and Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of Technology. The
Institute is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
acquisition. Specific research projects that will make use of the facility
include work on mantle chemical evolution, crustal fluids, surface-exposure
dating, and solar system evolution.
