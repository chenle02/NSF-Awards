9706199 Schlische Considerable interest exists in extrapolating fault behavior
and attributes of small, easily studied faults to large, typically more
difficult to study, major faults. The scaling relations in fault populations of
interest include the size distribution of faults, the relationship between
displacement and length, the spatial distribution of faults, and the strain
accommodated. This study will utilize exposures of rocks where faults of various
sizes have been identified. The work will be directed towards testing several
hypotheses concerning how faults are spatially distributed in relation to major
faults and on how various fault parameters change as the faults become larger.
Result will be of use in fault modeling and in a variety of practical issues.
