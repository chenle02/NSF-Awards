This proposal is to support an International Conference on the Foundations and
Applications of Utility, Risk and Decision Theory. The conference will provide a
forum for economists, psychologists, philosophers, decision theorists, and
others to share research ideas. The quality of participants who have already
agreed to attend is very high. Moreover, the conference will include attendees
from both North American and Europe, and will provide specific opportunities for
young investigators to be involved. The conference will contribute to advancing
fundamental research on economic utility theory, risk analysis, and behavioral
decision theory. It will encourage cross-disciplinary interaction and cross-
fertilization between diverse approaches. Abridged versions of conference papers
will be published in a proceedings volume, with selected papers to be published
in special issues of two leading journals. In all, the conference will have
considerable impact on future research and applications of utility, risk, and
decision theory.
