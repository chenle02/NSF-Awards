Dr. Creager is examining the development of biochemistry and molecular biology
as culturally authoritative and institutionally powerful disciplines after World
War II. Her focus is on the scientific and rhetorical uses of tobacco mosaic
virus, a plant virus studied in laboratories of biochemist Wendell Stanley, who
received the 1946 Nobel Prize for its crystallization. The major part of this
study concerns the changes in scientific research and disciplinary power which
occurred in the postwar period. Stanley's laboratory and departments in Berkeley
serve as a case study in the institutional building of biochemistry and
molecular biology after the war. Her analysis focuses on the uses of viruses as
key medical and agricultural agents in gaining public support for molecular
virology as well as on attempts to center disciplines of biochemistry and
molecular biology around viruses as laboratory materials. This project aims to
integrate historical developments in molecular biology and biochemistry with
other cultural and political changes in twentieth-century America.
