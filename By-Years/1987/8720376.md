Three Dimensional Geometry of Late Pleistocene Mixing Zone Dolomite,
Southeastern Barbados, West Indies. Early near-surface dolomite often has no
obvious relationship to evaporitic or hypersaline diagenetic environments.
Dilute mixtures of meteoric and marine water are capable of both calcium
carbonate dissolution and the precipitation of dolomite. The best studied
examples of mixed zone dolomite is in the Caribbean, but little is known of
their geometries. In Barbados the geometry seems to be controlled by the paleo-
hydrologic setting, relating to pre-Pleistocene paleotopography. The study will
conduct a core-drilling project. The drilled cores will be used to study the
lithology, stable isotopes, and trace elements of the mixed zone.
