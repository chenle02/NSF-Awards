UNESCO and the Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals in Oman are co-sponsoring a
symposium on ophiolites in Muscat, Oman from January 1 5-18, 1990. Eight days of
field trips to numerous sites throughout the classic ophiolite belt in northern
Oman will precede the conference, and are an important component to the
objectives of the symposium. Dr. Henry Dick has been awarded funds to distribute
among US applicants needing travel support to attend this symposium. Drs. Robert
Detrick, Ellen Kappel and Robert Coleman will join Dr. Dick in the process of
choosing recipients from a pool of applicants. Selection will be based on the
applicant's status, the relevancy of this experience to his/her research
interests, and available funds. Substantial support will be provided for up to
10 graduate students and post-docs; funds for established scientists will go as
far as possible with the money that remains. The administration of these funds
will be handled through the WHOI Geodynamics Program.
