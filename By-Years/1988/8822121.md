This project focuses on implementing arrays of photodetectors and associated
first-level sensory neural networks in monolithic integrated circuit format for
purposes of applying the field of vision to engineering applications of advanced
photodetectors and for producing a physical model that can be used in the study
of multiplicative lateral inhibition in visual systems. The photodetectors and
electronic circuitry are fabricated using gallium-arsenide technology to allow
for upward compatibility with integrated optoelectronic systems and to allow the
constructed detector assemblies to function in harsher operating environments.
Additionally, the monolithic integration of an array of photodetectors with a
first level neural network offers advantages in size, reliability, cost, and
hence commercial applicability. Biological visual systems perform many demanding
tasks that are far from the present capabilities of electronic hardware. The
success of many biological systems can mostly be attributed to a large degree of
pre-processing of the visual image at the most peripheral level of the sensory
system. This pre-processing has been described by many models, one of which is
multiplicative lateral inhibition, which has the advantage of simple
implementation in electronic circuitry and is studied in this project. Since
recognition is studied in a fully parallel context, advanced photonic sensors
based upon this developing technology have the potential to approach the spatial
recognition performance of biological retinas and to greatly surpass them in
temporal performance of feature acquisition.
