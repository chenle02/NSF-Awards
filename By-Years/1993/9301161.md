This award supports the research of Professor Cox to work in algebraic
geometry. One of the problems that Professor Cox will address will be the issue
of assigning a coordinate ring to a toric variety in a natural way. This ring
should be a polynomial ring and should depend only on the toric variety and not
on a particular projective embedding. Professor Cox has a suggested construction
which seems to have many of the needed properties. This research uses the
techniques of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In
its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the
simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods
not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
