Research in mathematical physics will attempt to incorporate a new mathematical
technique known as "quantum groups" into elementary particle physics. Quantum
groups will be formulated and computed, and non-quantum-group descriptions of
certain phenomena will be modeled as appropriate limits of the quantum-group
descriptions. The project is important because, if it succeeds, it will
represent an advance in our quantum mechanical description of microscopic
phenomena.
