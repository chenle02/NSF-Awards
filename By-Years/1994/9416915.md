9416915 Arnold This project is on research which would continue to develop
polymers with high affinities for either proteins or low molecular weight
pharmaceutical compounds, for the purpose of selective separation and
purification. The selectivity of these materials for proteins comes from
flexible arrays of metal ions that bind complementary arrays of functional
groups on the target molecule. For small molecule separations, the selectivity
arises from shape-selective and functional cavities around a metal complex of a
monomer and the desired chiral template. The specific goals of this research are
to: (1) improve the selectivity of templated polymers by using kinetically inert
metals; (2) adapt this template polymerization technique to the preparation of
chiral ligand-exchange adsorbents; (3) develop a new template-crosslinking
approach to prepare protein-specific adsorbents; and (4) characterize protein
interactions with randomly-derivatized and patterned metal-containing surfaces.
This project has the potential to produce important advances in separation
technology for both large and small molecules. ***
