This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is in the general
area of organic chemistry. Dr. Banita White Brown of the Chemistry Department of
the University of North Carolina at Charlotte will attempt to prepare several
one-armed and two-armed peptide-derived lariat esters. Circular dichroism (CD)
measurements will be made on at least two systems in order to test the
feasibility of CD in determining binding constants for sodium, potassium, and
calcium cations. The lariat esters are expected to behave as ionophores and
exhibit selectivity for particular cations. If promising results are obtained, a
proposal for sustained study in this area may be developed, perhaps focussing on
competition between sidearm and ring sites for complexation or the roles of
conformation and donor group polarity in cation selectivity.
