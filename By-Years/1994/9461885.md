The recent emergence of high performance massively parallel processing (MPP)
computers has theoretically reduced the computer time required for the design
and analysis of systems involving fluid flow using Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD). However, in practice, algorithms used in MPP today were developed for
sequential computers and therefore do not harness the full power of massively
parallel processing. Also, MPP computers have not simplified the structured grid
generation process, which may take weeks for complex configurations. Amtec
proposes to develop a new algorithm for computational fluid dynamics to harness
the power of MPP. The research will focus on techniques for solving the Navier-
Stokes equations on MPP computers using hybrid structured/unstructured finite-
volume meshes. The structured grids will be used to resolve boundary layers near
walls and unstructured grids will be used to discretize the remainder of the
flow field. During phase I, a recently developed implicit procedure for 2D
hybrid grids will be improved and parallelized using a novel domain
decomposition technique. The new solution procedure will simplify the grid
generation process by using hybrid grids, and reduce the computer time required
by efficiently using MPP computers.
