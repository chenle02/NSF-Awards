Dr. Chad A. Mirkin has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Mirkin's doctoral degree was from the University of Pennsylvania
under the supervision of Professor Gregory Geoffroy. Dr. Mirkin intends to
continue research at MIT under the sponsorship of Professor Mark Wrighton. Dr.
Mirkin's area of postdoctoral training and research will be the development of
microelectrode devices capable of effecting electrocatalysis. Initially he will
develop a microelectrode which will use macrocycles to detect Lithium. This
training will provide him with the background to design other catalytic
electrodes which may be used for oxygen atom transfer reactions. The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
