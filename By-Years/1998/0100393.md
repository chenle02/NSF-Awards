The Hawaii Department of Education, in partnership with the University of Hawaii
at Manoa, will conduct an Implementation phase RSI project for teachers and
administrators in rural, disadvantaged schools on the islands. The project will
rely heavily on leadership development opportunities and implementation of
curricular standards, to achieve better learning opportunities for the targeted
students. Much of the networking and inservice training will be conducted
through distance learning technology.&lt;br/&gt;
