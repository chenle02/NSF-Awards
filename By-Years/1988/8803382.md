The structural and electronic factors which determine magnetic behavior in
insulating solids are to be investigated. The emphasis will be on those factors
which influence the magnetic anisotropy in these materials. The use of electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as well as magnetization and magnetic
susceptibility studies to probe magnetic anisotropies in copper (II) halides
will be stressed. The delineation of magneto- structural correlations will be
used as basis to obtain a wide variety of low dimensional systems. included will
be S=1 chains to test the Haldane conjecture, ferromagnetic chains with
potential as non-conducting magnets, and layer-perovskite systems. In addition,
a set a mixed valence chains with potential as one dimensional conductors will
be investigated.
