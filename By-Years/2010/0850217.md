The Scholarships to Enhance Physical Sciences (STEPS) program recruits
academically talented students from local high schools and community colleges to
pursue baccalaureate degrees in physical sciences disciplines by providing 7-10
new scholarships each year. In addition to financial support, the program
provides STEPS scholars with coordinated resources and activities to foster
academic success and effective transition to college, including: 1) student-
student, faculty-student, and industry-student mentoring programs and workshops;
2) academic enrichment through research projects, internships, and tutoring; 3)
interactive sessions on professional and career development; and 4) a first year
learning community that includes student enrollment in a triad or tetrad of
common courses. The function of STEPS is to 1) provide strategies for early
intervention, mentoring, and financial support that translate into greater
success for talented, but financially challenged students; 2) increase the
participation of talented Hispanics, leading to more Hispanic alumni entering
the workforce or pursuing advanced degrees; and 3) develop successful program
elements that can be used to promote best practices for early intervention in
STEM education.
