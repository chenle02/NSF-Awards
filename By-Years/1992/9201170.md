This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at Vanderbilt University in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported
scientists. The group proposes to study electron-positron interactions with the
CLEO II detector at the Cornell electron-positron colliding beam accelerator,
CESR. These studies are the most productive studies in the world on the
properties of bottom quarks. The properties of the third family of quarks in the
Standard Model of quarks and leptons are almost entirely determined by the work
of the CLEO group at Cornell.
