The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
mesoscale meteorology between Vesna Jurcec of Zagreb's Hydrometeorological
Institute, F. Mesinger of Belgrade's Institute of Meteorology and Ronald B.
Smith of Yale University is to continue their study of Bora wind storms using
observational, numerical and theoretical approaches. The Bora phenomenon is a
severe, downslope wind storm occuring along Yugoslavia's mountainous Adriatic
Coast. Bora-like winds also occur in Utah, the Cascade Mountains of Washington,
and along the Alaskan coast. Thus, research on the Yugoslav Bora can be applied
to similar regions in the U.S. The investigators plan to continue to apply
Smith's hydraulic model to severe bora cases in the southern Adriatic. Bora
simulations are planned using Dr. Mesinger's computer model on mountain airflow.
The Bora simulations, in turn, will be used to validate Dr. Mesinger's model.
The joint work with Smith will contribute to better understanding of the
particular Bora wind storm and extend our abilities to predict other severe
storms and weather phenomena connected to mountainous regions. This project was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
award, except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav
institution. NSF's goal to advance scientific knowledge is promoted through the
joint efforts and complementary expertise of the Yugoslav and U.S.
investigators.
