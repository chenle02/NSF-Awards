This grant is in support of an NSF workshop on Future Directions in
Electromagnetics Research to be held at MIT on July 27, 1989, immediately
following the 1989 Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium (PIERS). This
workshop provides an excellent opportunity to bring together distinguished
panelists, both nationally and internationally known, to address the state-of-
the art and future directions in electromagnetics research and developments. The
planned grouping of topics for the one-day panel discussion covers the areas of:
scattering; radiation and sources; guidance and resonance; propagation and
diffraction; computational approaches; and time- domain electromagnetics.
Panelists will provide position papers prior to the workshop discussions to
serve as the basis for a workshop report.
