This project addresses three areas of research in information- based
complexity:Theory, Applications, Software. THEORY: A major theme is the study of
the computational complexity of multivariate problems in a large number of
variables. In particular, the computational complexity of path integrals, that
is, integrals in an infinite number of variables, will be studied. Often high
dimensional multivariate problems are intractable in the worst case
deterministic setting. The research emphasis will be on conditions which yield
tractability and strong tractability in various settings. A second research area
is to explain why low-discrepancy sequences are excellent for computing the high
dimensional integrals (often, the dimensionality is in the hundreds) of
mathematical finance. This belief is based on extensive software testing but
there is no satisfactory theoretical explanation. The goal is to characterize
very high dimensional integrals for which low-discrepancy sequences are superior
to Monte Carlo. A third area is to continue research on the computational
complexity of implementation testing for continuous problems. APPLICATIONS: The
theory will be applied to a number of application areas, including computational
complexity and new algorithms for combinatorial circuit verification. SOFTWARE:
The FINDER software library contains modifications of low-discrepancy sequences.
FINDER has been made available to researchers in various disciplines. Further
improvements, tests, and dissemination of FINDER are planned.
