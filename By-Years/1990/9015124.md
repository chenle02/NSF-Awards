Working with Dr. David Blair at the University of Western Australia and Dr. Rolf
Koch, from the Curtin University of Technology, both in Perth, Western
Australia, Drs. Carl Pennypacker and Richard Muller, along with two graduate
students, all of the University of California at Berkeley, will implement a
search for supernovae in the Southern Hemisphere from the Perth Observatory.
Software developed for the Berkeley "Automated Supernova Search," a highly
successful NSF-funded project, will be transferred to the Perth Observatory so
that a similar program can be established there. The search will utilize Perth's
24" telescope, a CCD system currently under development, and a computer system
similar to the one in Berkeley. When the Perth system starts to function, there
will be some overlap in the galaxies searched, such that when Berkeley discovers
a new supernova, Perth can confirm, and vice versa. Similarly, when inclement
weather prevents observations at one observatory, the other can take over. As
confidence is gained in the new system at Perth, it can begin searches in
galaxies visible only from the Southern Hemisphere, and discoveries can be
shared and studied jointly.
