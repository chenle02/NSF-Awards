It is proposed to study high intensity laser atom interactions, both
theoretically and experimentally, using the table top terawatt laser at the
Laboratory for Laser Energetics. Two related topics have been chosen for
experimental study. the first is the effect of pulse width and bandwidth on
multiphoton ionization rates. The second is high order harmonic generation in
noble gases. In tandem with these projects it is planned to increase the laser
intensity through use of an off.axis parabolic mirror. It is also proposed to
continue theoretical investigations into high intensity laser.atom interactions,
concentrating on the calculation and use of ab initio wave functions of model
atoms.
