There is ample anecdotal evidence that IT investments are quite risky. Studies
have shown that as much as 70% of IT projects are either cancelled, or completed
late or over-budget. Yet, IT risk is virtually absent in the burgeoning
literature on the returns on IT investment. This omission of IT risk
considerations might explain in part the unusually high estimates of returns on
IT investment, in recent research. At the same time, the debate in the IT
returns literature is shifting from the "productivity paradox" to the "new
productivity paradox," wherein what is puzzling is not the lack of evidence of
returns on IT investment, but inexplicably high estimates of the same. This new
puzzle provides the theoretical motivation for this project, which will broadly
examine the impact of IT risk on the cost of IT capital, and on the productivity
and market value of firms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this
project are: (1) to incorporate IT risk into existing empirical frameworks for
characterizing IT returns, (2) to generate empirical metrics of IT risk at the
firm and industry levels, and (3) to assess the risk-adjusted return on IT
investment. The analysis of these issues will be conducted using a comprehensive
set of research methods, including production function analysis, market value
analysis, event study methodology, and field study research. The impact of IT
risk will be analyzed at two levels of analysis or aggregation, IT capital and
IT projects, echoing the existing research literature on the returns on IT
investment. This will yield empirical estimates of the impact of IT risk on the
cost of IT capital, and on the market value of firms. The findings are expected
to be of interest to multiple disciplines including information systems and
accounting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The intellectual contributions
of this research will impact both industry practice and policy formulation. The
results of this study will provide a scientific platform for an informed
discussion of IT risk management, an increasingly critical concern in the
industry and society of the digital age. Accordingly, the findings from this
study will be disseminated in practitioner and policy-oriented outlets as well
as in inter-disciplinary academic journals. Practical issues surrounding IT risk
management will constitute the focus of the field studies, which will involve
undergraduate students in the research; this involvement will advance knowledge
discovery while promoting teaching and learning.
