This project will continue work on interstellar graphite and SiC grains with
extreme isotopic anomalies in acid residues of carbonaceous meteorites. Isotopic
measurements will be made of other minor elements and the PIs will also search
for new types of interstellar material. An attempt will be made to obtain noble
gas isotopic data on individual grains, and to correlate them with ion probe
isotopic measurements.
