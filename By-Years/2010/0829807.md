This award provides partial support for the Gordon Research
Conference&lt;br/&gt;on Correlated Electron Systems. This biennial meeting
focuses on the&lt;br/&gt;novel properties of materials and artificial structures
which result&lt;br/&gt;from strong interactions between electrons. The topics
cover some of&lt;br/&gt;the most intellectually vibrant areas of condensed
matter physics&lt;br/&gt;research, as well as those which hold the most promise
for&lt;br/&gt;revolutionary rather than incremental technological applications.
The&lt;br/&gt;meeting brings together speakers, who are world-leading experts
in&lt;br/&gt;their areas, with a diverse group of other attendees containing
a&lt;br/&gt;large number of graduate students and postdoctoral
scientists,&lt;br/&gt;representing the future of the field. The Gordon Research
Conference&lt;br/&gt;format provides an extremely interactive venue in which
young&lt;br/&gt;researcher and experts can discuss extensively, forge contacts
and&lt;br/&gt;research relationships, and initiate new projects and
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;The NSF funds will be used predominantly to support US
students,&lt;br/&gt;postdocs and junior faculty who would not otherwise be able
to attend&lt;br/&gt;the conference.
