The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to create a platform where content creators can
upload digital content and retailers can easily integrate and get curated
product content. Moreover, such a platform should give the opportunity to brick-
and-mortar stores to create on the fly e-stores (buy-online, pick-up in store).
Such a platform will bring a new supply side capability to e-commerce that will
serve to enhance competition. The proposed innovation provides data robustness
and relevance to the retail industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I
project proposes to create a decentralized e-commerce infrastructure allowing
retailers to access and deliver trusted, rich product data content across all
digital channels. This project will advance a decentralized Dynamic Product
Experience Protocol and Marketplace (DPXM) to create a comprehensive digital
product data catalog, to be validated through a Proof-of-Quality (PoQ) consensus
algorithm. This projectâ€™s goal is the optimization of the PoQ algorithm to
generate random graphs and temporal random networks to accommodate for a
continuously expanding network, to prevent copyright and IP infringements, the
clustering of hostile agents to impose specific content that benefits them and
to ensure the fairness of agent selection and payment. The algorithm will adjust
the parameters needed to compute the trustworthiness scores of the participating
agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
