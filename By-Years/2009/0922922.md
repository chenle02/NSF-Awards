This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Biology Department at Middle
Tennessee State University has been awarded a grant to purchase an ABI 3130xl
automated genetic analyzer with DNA sequencing and genotyping capabilities. The
long term goal of the Biology Department at MTSU is to maintain faculty who
conduct contemporary research, obtain competitive external funding to maintain
their research programs and engage graduate and undergraduate students in
dynamic research and instruction. This instrument will expand possible avenues
of research and enhancing existing research activities for current faculty.
Additionally, this instrument will support instruction for students in DNA
sequencing and DNA fragment analysis. Many of the faculty in the Biology
Department at MTSU are engaged in research that span the breadth of sequencing
and genotyping applications and the use of this equipment will allow them and
their faculty mentors to answer questions related to basic molecular genetics,
diagnostics, and determination of inter- and intra-species relationships. Data
collected with this genetic analyzer will be available through public databases
such as GenBank, Moorea Biocode Database, and Tree of Life. Analysis of data and
full descriptions of projects will be published in peer reviewed journals such
as Cladistics, Molecular Ecology, Proceedings of the Royal Society, American
Journal of Botany, Systematic Entomology, and Evolution, among others.
