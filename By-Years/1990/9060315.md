The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of using an
electrochemical device for the paired synthesis of ozone and hydrogen peroxide
from water and oxygen in a cell containing fluorinated sulfonic acid proton
exchange membranes. Specific objectives of this project are to evaluate
electrocatalysts for reduction of oxygen, fabrication of a single cell
electrolyzer for paired peroxide and ozone synthesis, and determination of the
efficiencies of this process. Current inefficiencies of producing ozone limit
the broader use of this powerful oxidant and disinfectant. This is a Phase I
award made in accord with Program Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR). The project deals with an innovative concept for
increasing the efficiency of producing ozone, a potential oxidizing agent for
water contaminants and potentially more widely used disinfectant for water and
wastewater.
