This Phase I SBIR project is for the development of an "atom chip" technology
that advances state-of-the art miniature ultracold atom systems. Ultracold
matter is an emerging arena of science and technology involving macroscopic
quantum states of matter achieved using laser cooling and other purely
electromagnetic cooling techniques. The proposed new technology will provide
unprecedented capability for controlling and manipulating ultracold atoms that
will enable development of ultracold atom applications such as navigation,
frequency standards and clocks, and quantum simulation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science of ultracold matter is among the most active
and rapidly growing sub-disciplines of physics. Ultracold matter is recognized
has considerable applications potential in sensing applications but also in
applications of quantum science such as quantum simulation, computing, and
communication. The proposed ultracold matter products lower the barrier to
research and development and provide a pathway for non-experts to develop real
world applications. This project will enable further research and development
efforts within industry as well as academic and government research
institutions.
