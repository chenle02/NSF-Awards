9422220 DORN Considerable debate has occurred in recent years regarding the
dynamics of climatic change. Prevailing models have held that climates change
gradually over periods of centuries. A growing body of evidence accumulated by
Hartmut Heinrich and others indicates that changes may have been much more
abrupt at various times during the last 70,000 years. Four so-called "Heinrich
events" were characterized by the release of large numbers of icebergs into the
North Atlantic from the Laurentide Ice Sheet covering northeastern North
America. Fine debris carried by these icebergs have been found in cores of
sediments from the bottom of the ocean. Correlative evidence of sudden climatic
changes in other parts of the world has been found in terrestrial pollen
accumulations, in glacial deposits, in lake fluctuations, and in marine corals
and sediments. This research project will involve U.S. and Mexican scientists in
an examination of glacial deposits on the slopes of Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the
volcanoes of central Mexico. Both of these highlands near the Tropic of Cancer
are known to have been glaciated during the period when Heinrich events
occurred. Glacial deposits will be dated using a variety of high-precision
dating techniques, including isotope analyses of 14-Carbon, 36- Chlorine,
3-Helium, and 21-Neon. This project will provide a detailed glacial chronology
for these tropical highlands, and it will assist in reconstruction of
transformations of soils, geomorphic systems, and biogeographic systems in
nearby lowland areas. These data will advance consideration of the hypothesis
that Heinrich events were global in character by assessing whether these rapid
changes affected tropical highlands. The accumulation of evidence gathered
through studies like this will contribute considerably to understandings of the
dynamics, timing, and speed of global change.
