The project focuses on cluster algebras recently discovered by the investigator
in collaboration with S.Fomin. Cluster algebras are integral domains of a
special kind designed to provide an algebraic framework for the study of total
positivity and canonical bases in semisimple groups and their representations.
The investigator studies structural properties of cluster algebras and their
quantum deformations. This study uncovers unexpected connections with such
diverse subjects as the structural theory of Kac-Moody algebras, thermodynamic
Bethe ansatz, quiver representations, and integrable systems. One of the main
instruments of the study is polyhedral combinatorics, more specifically, an
interplay between piecewise-linear and subtraction-free birational
transformations based on the tropical calculus.

The main motivation for this project comes from two classical areas of
mathematics: representation theory and the theory of total positivity.
Representation theory is a mathematical approach to studying symmetry; more
specifically, it encodes the symmetry properties of various physical and
biological systems that occur in nature. Total positivity is a remarkable
property of matrices (arrays of numbers) that generalizes the familiar notion of
positive numbers. Both theories find numerous applications in physics, chemistry
and other sciences, as well as in other mathematical disciplines. In fact,
representation theory serves as the mathematical foundation of quantum
mechanics, while total positivity is a major tool for explaining oscillations in
mechanical systems. During the last decade, deep connections were found between
the two fields, and the scope of their applications was greatly extended. This
project explores the modern framework of representation theory and total
positivity, with the goal of making its formalism much more explicit and
understandable.
