Abstract CMS 97-29780 "Urban Approaches Open Forum" Dr. Bernard Ross, American
University This award is made to the Department of Public Administration at
American University to develop, implement and manage an "Urban Initiative -
Urban Approaches (UA) Open Forum." The Open Forum will convene both researchers
and a wider spectrum of urban partners - those who educate, implement, manage,
regulate, and support the people and systems which contribute to the quality of
urban life. The invitees will include representatives from federal, state and
municipal agencies, public and private sector service providers, professional
organizations and research institutes, and political and community leaders. The
Open Forum will focus on current and planned approaches to urban system's
management,, identification of opportunities for research connections, knowledge
mining from existing data resources, development of a set of research needs,
which will evolve into a long-term UA vision for the 21st century. The goal of
the Open Forum is to achieve a different form of integration - a vertical
integration among the interests of researchers and the needs of those who look
to the researchers for answers to their problems. It is anticipated that the
Open Forum will include a dialogue with concentration on current and planned
approaches for integrated research and education on the urban environment and
providing vision and recommendations for future research. Thus, the Open Forum
will enhance the design of efforts to build upon, support, and complement the
efforts of UA stakeholders. Among UA-related research topics scheduled for
discussion are urban sprawl and sustainability; urban brownfields; urban
infrastructure; regional governance and urban politics; "urban" as a spatial
unit of analysis; urban education and public-private partnerships. The challenge
of the Open Forum is to provide an open environment in which researchers and
practitioners feel at ease discussing research needs which transcend disciplines
and sectors. The emphasis will be on how the practitioners can inform the
research process, and how some of the nation's best scholars can respond to a
cogent statement of perceived needs as identified by a cross-section of
practitioners. ***
