This award provides support to Dr. Dawn Iacobucci under the National Science
Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers Program. The
objectives of this program are to recognize the nation's most outstanding and
promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers in research and
teaching, to retain them in academia, and to facilitate the further development
of their careers. This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research
spanning the areas of statistical modeling and the use of such models to social
network applications in marketing. She will extend her modeling work by applying
it to comparisons between pairs of people or between groups. For example, she
plans to develop a means of identifying a firm's competitors in the marketplace
using data and models of social network ties between organizations. She also
plans to investigate the effects of differing amounts of information on the
actions of an intermediary agent in a negotiation, such as a real estate agent
assisting a home buyer and seller. She will also investigate the use of computer
simulations and human laboratory experiments in conjunction to better understand
two-person interaction processes.
