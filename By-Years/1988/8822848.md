This proposal is in support of the 1989 Picosecond Electronics and
Optoelectronics Topical Meeting, to be held at Salt Lake City, Utah, March 6-8,
1989, under the co-sponsorship of the Optical Society of America and the IEEE
Lasers and Electro-Optics Society. This meeting, which is held every second
year, will bring together researchers in the areas of electronics and
optoelectronics to discuss the physics and technology of picosecond solid state
devices and their applications to ultrafast measurement techniques. The selected
topic areas include ultrafast optoelectronic devices, semiconductor device
physics, ultra-wideband electronic devices, superconducting- and
cryoelectronics, device characterization and fabrication technology, and
highspeed circuits and signal processing. This is an important area of current
technology, and there will be a strong contingent of outstanding U.S. and
international researchers present at the meeting.
