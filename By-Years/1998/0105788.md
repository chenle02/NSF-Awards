The Investigator studies intersection theory on and the&lt;br/&gt;cohomological
field theory arising from the moduli of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;spin curves and
stable spin maps. Especially important in this&lt;br/&gt;study is the
exploration of the plethora of similarities between&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten
theory and cohomological field arising from higher&lt;br/&gt;spin curves and
spin maps. Also important in this research is the&lt;br/&gt;study of the many
relations between these cohomological field&lt;br/&gt;theories and integrable
hierarchies, including significant recent&lt;br/&gt;progress toward proving some
remarkable conjectures like the&lt;br/&gt;W-algebra conjecture and Generalized
Witten Conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this project is
concerned with connections between&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry and physics, and
it has implications for both&lt;br/&gt;subjects. Algebraic geometry, which is
the study of solutions to&lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations, and especially the
sub-discipline of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic curves, which is one of the main foci of
this research,&lt;br/&gt;have many applications. The most notable of these
applications&lt;br/&gt;are in secure electronic communications (cryptography and
error&lt;br/&gt;correcting codes). Recent research has shown that
algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry also has significant ties to high-energy physics
and&lt;br/&gt;plays an important role in helping us understand the
fundamental&lt;br/&gt;nature of the universe. Conversely, physics has helped us
better&lt;br/&gt;understand some important aspects of algebraic geometry and
its&lt;br/&gt;applications. This research is focused on studying and
further&lt;br/&gt;developing some of these important links.
