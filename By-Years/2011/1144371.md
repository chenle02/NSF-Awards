The purpose of this project is to promote student participation in the long-
running EDBT/ICDT conference series, to be held in March 2012 in Berlin,
Germany. This will be the 15th EDBT and 15th ICDT, and will be the 4th year
continuously that the two conferences are run as a joint one. These two
conferences are internationally leading database systems and theory conferences,
and have been well attended by the leading researchers in the area from all over
the world. Being in Europe, the joint conference tends to attract more European
researchers than other database conferences do. This student travel grant will
encourage the interaction of the US students with their counterparts and senior
researchers from Europe and elsewhere, increasing the international awareness of
the participating US students. Students participation of international
scientific discussion forums is always an important part of their education and
a great way to build a mature work force in scientific research. The project
will also emphasize on recruiting under-represented groups of students in this
effort.
