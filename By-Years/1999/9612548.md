9612548 Gill This grant provides $20,000 as one-half support of the costs of
upgrading their present VG Sector 54 thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS)
with a wide aperture retarding potential (WARP) lens and third generation VG
Faraday cups to replace their eight existing cups. The WARP lens will greatly
increase the abundance sensitivity of this instrument (by two orders of
magnitude) allowing measurement of thorium (Th) isotope ratios for petrogenic
studies of mid ocean ridge basalts (MORB) without the frequent downtime required
for baking the TIMS and greater precision analyses of uranium (U), strontium
(Sr), lead (Pb) and Hafnium (Hf) isotopes for improved U/Pb geochronology and
isotopic tracer studies of magma genesis. The third generation faraday cups
minimize secondary electron loss due to design improvements including increased
depth and improved internal coatings and thus provide improved precision and
minimal gain drift relative to their existing cups. These improvements will
enhance the capabilities of this lab for a wide range of studies including,
U-series isotopic studies of oceanic and continental volcanics as petrogenic
tracers, Lu/Hf isotopic analyses of deep crustal xenoliths for dating melt
extraction events as young as 25 Ma, Sr isotopic analyses of bone and tooth
apatite as indicators of the paleodiet and migration behavior of fossil
invertebrates, high resolution (100ka) Sr isotope stratigraphy and studies of
the biogeochemistry of lead. ***
