The project has three objectives: 1) to gather information on the status of
existing state- supported competitive research grant programs. 2) to bring
program administrators together to share their experiences in running a
competitive grant program, to allow those states with operating programs to
discuss problems and recommended solutions, and to allow states considering the
establishment of a program to benefit from those that have experience in
designing and implementing programs. 3) to provide information on how federal
merit-based programs are run and to provide information to state officials on
the resources available from the National Science Foundation and other federal
agencies to assist them in establihsing and operating their programs.
