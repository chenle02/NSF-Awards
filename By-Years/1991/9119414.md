Parasites may have subtle effects in the distributions of their hosts,
including altering thermal preferences. The immature stage of a heat-sensitive
acanthocephalan thorny-headed worm inhabits several cockroach hosts before
reaching maturity in the rat when eaten. Insects such as the cockroaches can
induce fever behaviorally by choosing warm microhabitats. The study will assess
whether infected and uninfected cockroaches respond differently to a temperature
gradient, how cockroach temperature choice affects parasite level and whether
temperature influences the effects of infection on cockroach reproduction and
longevity. By using several cockroach species this study examines the effects of
diverse cockroach attributes on expression of fever. This is the first study to
1) examine fever in a worm-insect association, and to assess its effects on
survival and reproduction of several host 2) test the alternate hypothesis that
altered behavior in parasitized animals may benefit the host (fever) as well as
the parasite (increased transmission to predators) and 3) place insect febrile
responses in a comparative, phylogenetic context. The study species are
important elements of urban ecological systems .
