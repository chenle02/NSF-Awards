9315680 Luco This research project is in response to a critical need to
validate the mathematical models and computer codes that are used to calculate
the dynamic response of important structures for those cases in which
significant interaction occurs between the structure and the surrounding soil:
In this case through the "blind" prediction of the dynamic response of the
Hualien, Taiwan, large-scale model nuclear reactor power plant containment
structure during forced vibration tests. (A blind prediction is one in which the
prediction is made without knowing in advance what the result should be.) These
tests are being conducted by a consortium of organizations, including the
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and
institutions from Taiwan, Japan, Korea and France. The three tasks are: (1)
Comparisons of observed data with earlier predictions for the response of the
containment model, prior to backfill of the soil surrounding the foundation, are
used to test the computer programs employed, and to improve the mathematical
models for the structure and the soil. (2) Blind predictions are made for the
response of the structure during forced vibration tests, after backfill of the
soil surrounding the foundation. (3) The prediction are compared with
observations (which are to be released by EPRI only after the blind predictions
have been properly recorded) for an overall assessment of the current capability
to model the dynamic response of structures partially embedded in medium
strength soils and subjected to external forces. Funding for this project is a
collaboration between the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the National Science
Foundation. ***
