IBN-9723783 PI: Hempleman Specialized chemosensory cells in the walls of blood
vessels leading to the head of terrestrial vertebrates form receptor organs
called the carotid bodies. These nerve cells respond when the oxygen content of
the blood is too low, the condition called hypoxia. Birds and mammals with high
metabolic rates depend on successful reflexes to maintain high blood
oxygenation, and these reflexes are particularly needed when adapting to high
altitudes with low oxygen availability. In mammals it is known that the cellular
responses to hypoxia depend on a membrane channel for potassium ions. In birds
we know very little, although some high-flying birds function at altitudes where
most vertebrates would be unconscious. This project uses cellular
electrophysiological techniques and calcium-sensitive dyes to investigate the
chemotransduction mechanisms for blood oxygen in birds. Results will provide the
first analysis of oxygen transduction mechanisms in non-mammalian carotid
bodies, and will have an impact beyond sensory systems to evolutionary and
comparative physiology, and to understanding environmental adaptations.
