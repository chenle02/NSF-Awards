The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) operates a Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Materials Science and
Engineering Laboratory. Students are recruited from across the country for a
twelve-week summer research experience, with an emphasis on recruitment of
members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. Students
participate in a wide range of research in the areas of ceramics, solid state
chemistry, metallurgy, polymers, neutron condensed matter science, and materials
reliability. In addition, students attend a weekly seminar series and
participate in various social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students
have access to exceptional instrumentation and facilities at NIST. The
experience also includes an early and valuable exposure to the interdisciplinary
research environment of a national laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;
