This award provides funds for student and postdoc participation in the 2003
Gordon Research Conference on Quantum Control of Light and Matter. The field of
Coherent Control has grown beyond the initial objectives of the control of uni-
molecular processes to providing attractive strategies to solving scientific
problems as well as paving the way for new applications in a broad range of
disciplines. The objective of the conference is to bring together
internationally leading scientists as well as young researchers and students
active or specially interested in the field of quantum control. The conference
shall be a forum to present the newest research results and trends in this
rapidly expanding field. The interdisciplinary character of the field will be
emphasized.
