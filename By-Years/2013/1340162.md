This grant provides travel support for selected students attending the 8th
SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium. AAAI (Association for the Advancement of
Artificial Intelligence) is the major professional association for AI. At the
Doctoral Consortium (DC), PhD students who are pursuing work on AI-related
topics present their proposed research and receive feedback from a panel of
established researchers, as well as from other student participants. This
provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their
work at a critical time in their research, and also enables them to explore
their career objectives.
