Improving the infrastructure for conducting statistical studies of education,
especially mathematics an science education, is imperative if policy decisions
are to be informed by a reliable and extensive knowledge base. based on
experience from its current grant (Enhancement of Education statistics,
Mathematics and Science Education, and the Educational Research Infrastructure,
RED-9255347). AERA proposes a program of research and training designed to
achieve two primary objectives: (a) to enhance the capability of the research

informs education policy and practice, and (b) to increase scholars'
understanding of national policy and practice issues through communication with
