The principal investigator has used a laser microprobe, linked with a highly
sensitive mass spectrometer, to do unique chemical analyses on fluid inclusions.
He will expand the scope of his studies to include noble gases and halogens in
studying fluid inclusions in mineralized porphyry copper deposits and in high-
grade metamorphic rocks. He will also investigate nucleogenic noble gas isotopes
in unirradiated splits of the same samples. This work will be especially
important in the development of new analytical techniques which may eventually
be applied to many other geologic studies.
