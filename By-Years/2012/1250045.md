Dr. John Shaw has been granted an NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship to
determine the effect of backwater flow on the depositional environment of river
deltas. This research and education plan will take place at the University of
Wyoming. The investigation will include laboratory-scale experiments which
facilitate detailed measurement of delta properties, and outcrop study of
ancient delta deposits exposed in Wyoming and Utah. By forcing experimental
deltas to build under a rigid lid rather than a free surface, experiments will
more closely resemble the low-slope deltas found at the mouth of the Mississippi
River, as opposed than steeper-slope commonly realized in delta experiments. Dr.
Shaw and interested undergraduate and graduate students will take morphologic
and stratigraphic relationships drawn from the experimental analysis and apply
them to rock outcrops of river deltas, with the goal of quantifying the size and
shape of ancient delta systems. As part of the educational component of the
plan, Dr. Shaw will create an river delta exhibit for the University of Wyoming
Geological Museum, using ancient delta formations found in Wyoming and
specifically in nearby Native American Reservations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;River
deltas support large human populations that benefit from productive ecosystems
and transportation corridors, but are at risk from the hazards of storms and
land loss associated with relative sea level rise. By investigating the effect
of important variables (channel depth and slope) on delta morphology and
stratigraphy, we will gain further knowledge regarding the depositional
architecture of deltas, and better insight into how they will change in the
future.
