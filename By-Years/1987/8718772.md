This grant is for support of a program of research in theory and phenomenology
of nuclear structure physics. The theoretical research is focussed on developing
the most realistic possible shell-model wave functions for nuclear states and on
applying the results of these calculations to the analysis of a wide variety of
experimental data. The phenomenological studies are directed towards medium-
energy reactions with electrons, pions and protons which give new and unique
insights into nuclear structure Essentially all regions of the periodic table
susceptible to the shell-model approach are encompassed in the program. Topics
of special interest include the distributions and sums of Gamow- Teller and
magnetic dipole strength, the form factors of magnetic and electric electron
scattering, properties of nuclei far from stability, and systematic effects in
the properties of the operators for weak and electromagnetic transitions.
