The objectives of this research are: (1) the investigation of the physics of
downbursts, particularly the structure and evolution of water substance in
convective clouds and the resulting formation and development of downdrafts, (2)
the wind and thermal structure of the turbulent convective boundary layer as
observed by doppler radar, (3) the theory and practice of computing air motions
using doppler radars and (4) conducting a field experiment (near Champaign,
Illinois) using a doppler radar, the Flatland radar, and additional surface and
radiosonde stations to investigate the structure and evolution of winter
fronts.>>//
