Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory at Columbia University will acquire a 35
mm film scanning device that will be made available to investigators throughout
the Northeast. The scanner digitizes black & white and color film with very high
resolution. The digital data can then be cataloged and stored on a variety of
computer devices. It will be used for processing films of the seafloor and will
be especially useful for stereo pairs from which bottom roughness spectra can be
computed. Other research applications include the assembly of geological cross-
sections of submarine escarp- ments, relative age dating of lava flows, and
color profiling of sediment cores. It will also provide a capability to
digitally archive large collections of seafloor photographs obtained by towed
camera vehicles and manned submersibles.
