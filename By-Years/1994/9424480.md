Abstract CTS-9424480 Glumac This proposal is for funds for the purchase of a
pulsed Nd/Yag Laser System (including a dye laser and Frequency Doubler). The
equipment will be used to develop laser optical diagnostic measurement
capabilities in the low pressure combustion/combustion diagnostic facility
currently under construction in the Mechanical and Aerospace Departments of
Rutgers University. The equipment will be used to make gas phase temperature and
species concentration measurements (in particular radical species) in connection
with programs on catalytic combustion, acetylene oxidation, and oxidation of CVD
diamond.
