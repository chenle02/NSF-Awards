The principal investigator proposes to study the binary fluid absorption in wavy
falling films and droplets. Analytical and experimental techniques will be used
to account for the effects of countercurrent vapor shear, capillary pressure
differences due to film curvature variations and surface tension gradients, and
instability driven droplet-mode absorption between tubes. Image processing of
film thickness video and film thickness probe data will be used to develop time-
dependent traces of smooth and wavy films, including wave amplitude, frequency,
and celerity. Droplet formation sites, size distributions and velocities, and
the effect of vapor shear on thickness, wave structure, and droplet entrainment
will be determined from momentum balances validated by direct measurements.

The work will provide a consistent analytical, numerical and experiment
treatment of the hydrodynamics and heat and mass transfer in absorption. The
understanding gained from the research will be used to develop a miniaturization
technology for heat and mass exchangers and will result in compact, modular
designs to help mitigate ozone-depletion.
