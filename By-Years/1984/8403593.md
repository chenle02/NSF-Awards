Low oxygen sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen contents are often required to produce
the new generation of quality steels. New ladle metallurgical processes for
removal of oxygen and sulfur often add hydrogen and nitrogen, which are harmful
to mechanical properties and cause porosity. The objective of this research is
to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of the relevant gas-slag and slag-metal
reactions with particular emphasis on the behavior of hydrogen and nitrogen
contents.
