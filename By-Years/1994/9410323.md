9410323 DeVreis This project examines the trophic cascade hypothesis in lower-
latitude US reservoirs, where the dominant paradigm of top-down or bottom-up
trophic controls may not hold. Specifically, gizzard shad appear to neither be
controlled by fish predators nor by their zooplankton prey. The investigators
hypothesize that the shad themselves regulate community composition. This
research will test this idea by examining larval shad-bluegill interactions in
eight reservoirs in Ohio and Alabama. The investigators will also conduct
experiments on zooplankton and larval shad productivity, and develop models of
these trophic interactions. This research will extend the current understanding
of ecosystem control and community structure, yielding a more general
understanding of the dynamics of food webs. The results of this research have
applications in the management of fish stocks, reservoir management, and
conservation biology.
