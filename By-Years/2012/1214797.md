This small Business Innovation Research Phase Â² project proposes the research of
advanced Bio-cathode Microbial Fuel Cell (BcMFC). Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC)
generates power from renewable energy sources. However, the performance of MFC
is mainly limited by cathode. ElectroChem has isolated a novel microorganism,
which provides the highest current density on cathode than the other reported
microorganisms so far. ElectroChem proposes to develop a BcMFC to drastically
reduce cathode limitation and enhance overall performance. The approaches will
be to 1) Reduce total free energy of the system for better sorption of the
bacteria cells to the electrode. 2) Provide more available bacteria sorption
sites, which govern microbial migration and sorption on the electrode surface
but remain compatible with the flow of air and water to and from the cathode.
And 3) Adjust the dissolved oxygen concentration on bacteria-electrode interface
for faster bacteria metabolic rate and electron transfer rate. With enhanced
performance of the BcMFC system, the on site energy supply can be enhanced10
times or more, which will make it feasible for powering many underwater devices.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes more than
16,000 municipal wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs), whose total cost of
electricity bill is about 4 billion dollars per year. This can be largely
reduced if apply our advanced Bio-Cathode MFC (BcMFC) technique. ElectroChem
propose to overcome cathode limitation. The BcMFC, Electrochem proposed, is an
ideal technology to generate renewable bio-energy while remove Biochemical
Oxygen Demand (BOD) for wastewater treatment plant. For the $1.5 billion marine
underwater power supply market, there is a need to have more sustainable and
less toxic power supply solution. BcMFC can be fed with seawater and
continuously generate energy in long term without causing toxicity issues to the
marine environment. It will benefit underwater government agencies or companies
to better fulfill their assignments. BcMFC will generate tremendous revenue for
multiple industries, solve certain energy supply problems for governments and
business companies, benefit environment with less toxicity and reduced CO2
emissions etc. Other than many potential applications, research on BcMFC will
improve the knowledge and understanding of the bacteria electrode surface
interaction, therefore to be able to explain many important phenomena.
