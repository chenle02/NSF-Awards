This award will support activities of a research network of mathematicians
working in computability theory. This project will facilitate collaborative work
of faculty and graduate students from the U.S., Russia, Kazakhstan and Bulgaria.
The research is in quickly developing areas of computability, and this project
has two broad goals: the first goal is more rapid scientific progress resulting
from a network of collaborators, from all four countries, enabling them to pool
their ideas to solve fundamental problems. The second goal is to provide
opportunities for students and young researchers to participate actively in the
world community of scientists.

Computability as a research area has blossomed in recent years, with many
exciting new results that involve combining techniques from pure computability
with sophisticated algebra, model theory, set theory, and/or probability. There
are also stronger ties with computer science. The proposal named 20 senior
participants, and students and postdocs will also participate in the activities
supported by the grant. The proposed work includes a variety of problems. There
are problems on the difficulty in building a copy of a structure (degree
spectra), and on the relative computing power of structures (Muchnik
reducibility). There are problems on the internal complexity of structures
(Scott rank) and on the difficulty of describing a structure, measured by the
complexity of a ``Scott sentence''. In particular, there are problems on Scott
sentences for groups. Some problems concern uncountable structures such as the
ordered field of reals. There are problems on ``jumps'' of structures and a
strong notion of ``jump inversion''. There are problems on complexity of
isomorphisms, and on automorphisms, in particular, for vector spaces. There are
problems on degree structures (enumeration degrees, and ``continuous'' degrees).
There are problems on ``numberings''. At least two problems, one on the ``Hanf
number'' for Scott sentences of computable structures, and one on the relative
computing power of the ordered field of reals and an expansion by an arbitrary
continuous function, have been solved since the proposal was submitted.
