This is a proposal to employ ideas from fast dynamo theory that deal in
particular with the advection and diffusion of a magnetic field in a conducting
fluid of small resistivity to the study of fluids of small viscosity. One of the
goals of the present research is to analyze the evolution of vorticity from
smooth initial conditions by a combined analytical and numerical solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations in the limit of vanishing viscosity. Another goal is to
understand the structure of small- scale turbulence with the aid of vortex
models. Many physical phenomena involve the flow of slightly viscous liquids at
very large speeds. These are usually very complicated problems to study in a
straightforward way, even with the help of today's powerful computers. In this
proposal the principal investigator will use methods from dynamo theory
(essentially the theory of spinning magnets) to study flows of liquids. This may
seem odd, but it turns out that the streamlines of a flowing liquid behave very
much like the magnetic lines of force of a moving magnet under certain
circumstances, and this similarity can be used to great advantage.
