The goal of this project is to investigate microbial interactions within ticks
and how those interactions affect the prevalence of human pathogens. Ticks are
the primary source of infectious disease transmitted by arthropod vectors in the
United States, including Lyme Disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and many
other newly-recognized and emerging human diseases. Ticks also carry a variety
of non-pathogenic symbiotic bacteria. Most of this microbial diversity has only
become apparent with the advent of powerful molecular tools. Preliminary
evidence suggests that these symbionts can exclude pathogens, reducing human
disease risk. Using molecular genetic methods, the microbial communities of
medically-important tick species will be quantified and statistical tests will
be applied to test the strength and direction of microbial interactions. In
addition, microbial interactions will be incorporated into epidemiological
models to determine conditions where microorganisms within ticks interfere with
or amplify one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will
contribute to a general understanding of how microbial interactions affect
pathogen prevalence, disease epidemiology, and human disease risk. This research
will also explore new techniques for quantifying pathogen populations and
microbial communities, and contribute significantly to scientific education at
the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels. Microbial interactions
within other arthropod vectors (e.g., mosquitoes, fleas, lice, bugs) are likely
to be common, including vectors of an ever-growing list of emerging human
diseases and pathogens identified as bioterrorism threats.&lt;br/&gt;
