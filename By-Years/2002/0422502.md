This project builds on the success of prior NSF support by supporting 60
students in STEM fields over a four-year period in their last two years of
undergraduate study. The CSEMS Program enables students to enter the high
technology workforce or pursue a graduate degree after completing a
baccalaureate degree in computer science, mathematics, or engineering. The
project expands opportunities and support for women, minorities, and persons
with disabilities, and exposes students to interdisciplinary cooperation in STEM
areas through regular dialogue and interaction between students, faculty and
industry professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
project lies in giving students a better knowledge and understanding within
their own fields and across other STEM fields through a seminar that is team-
taught by faculty and industry professionals. Student participation at
professional meetings and conferences with faculty is also encouraged and
supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include
participation of women, minorities, people with disabilities, and first
generation college students. The project coordinates both NSF and other support
for promising students and promotes faculty and peer mentoring. Student support
activities--targeted recruitment of scholars, faculty and peer mentoring, and
financial support--will enhance student learning, confidence, performance,
retention to graduation, and career or graduate school placement.
