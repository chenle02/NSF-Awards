Improvement Of Undergraduate Laboratories In Plant Physiology and Ecophysiology
This project will provide for the modernization and restructuring of the
laboratory course in Plant Physiology. The course itself is the major plant
science course in the departmental core curriculum, and will permit
undergraduates to employ modern techniques that are currently used in research.
The equipment is also being used in two additional courses on physiological
plant adaptations, in which undergraduates design their own experiments. The
project is also expected to impact other courses in independent undergraduate
research.
