This proposal requests support from NSF for six Graduate Research Traineeships
in the area of Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing (ECM). Penn State will
provide 20% matching funds. The proposed program is unique in the following
aspects: (i) The focal point of the Trainees' experiences will be the modern
manufacturing facilities availabe at the ARPA/Industrial consortium-funded
Manufacturing Engineering Education Partnership (MEEP) program; (ii) Six
specific projects in interdisciplinary areas under the supervision of ten
faculty members in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Management and Systems
Engineering departments have been identified for potential Trainees; and, (iii)
academic leadership, organization, and managerial training. Three Trainees will
be from the women, underrepresented minorities, and the disabled students group.
Facilites and infrastructure at Penn State are available and appropriately
suited for the proposed program.
