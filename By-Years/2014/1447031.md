Systems engineering addresses the way the design and development of complex
products like aircraft, automobiles, rockets or ships are technically
coordinated. Better systems engineering will improve these products and allow
them to be developed faster and for less money. To improve systems engineering,
it needs to be built onto a scientific foundation. This project will conduct a
workshop bringing together the leading minds in systems engineering theory from
academics and from government and plan future research that can put a scientific
foundation under systems engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will
bring together approximately 35 researchers from universities around the US and
beyond to assess where the next steps will lie in developing theoretical
underpinnings for the practice of systems engineering. The workshop will address
four areas: System Architecting and Conceptual Design; Guidance; Models; and
Measurements. Current practice in systems engineering will be discussed,
existing theoretical foundations will be noted, and the group of participants
will assess needs and opportunities for deeper understanding and more rigorous
practice. Results of the workshop will be disseminated through a web site,
conference presentation, and archival publication.
