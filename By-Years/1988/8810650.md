The formation of precipitation is of great scientific as well as practical
significance. It is known that atmospheric ice plays a crucial role in the
development of precipitation, but not all the mechanisms by which ice forms in
clouds are well understood. One of the most fundamental problems facing cloud
physicists is explaining the enhancement of the number of ice particles in
clouds beyond what would be expected from the number of ice nucleating particles
that are available in the atmosphere. Under previously sponsored NSF research,
the Principal Investigators have been involved in research on ice formation in
clouds. Major findings include that, in certain types of clouds, ice formation
occurs and appears to be enhanced near cloud top. These observations imply a
fundamentally different mechanism for ice enhancement than the currently
accepted process. This proposed research will continue field studies of ice in
clouds. Primary goals are to determine the origins and mechanisms of formation
of ice particles with particular emphasis on ice at cloud tops. These goals will
be pursued through the acquisition of data sets in cumulus and altocumulus
clouds. The data sets will include information from new airborne instruments
which will provided improved capabilities in detecting ice, determining fine
scale structure of streamers of ice within clouds and in measuring humidity.
