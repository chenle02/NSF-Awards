The principal investigator will study the melting behavior of primitive
meteorites at high pressures and temperatures. The experiments will be designed
to simulate conditions which may have existed at depth in a growing proto-Earth
as it reached maximum radius. The results of this study will help scientists
understand how the Earth developed during its earliest stages as a planet.
