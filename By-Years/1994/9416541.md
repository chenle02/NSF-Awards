The proposed research requests funds to investigate methods for improving the
performance of thermoelectric refrigeration elements by reducing the thermal
conductivity of bismuth telluride based alloys. The research proposes to
significantly reduce the thermal conductivity of bismuth-telluride elements
through enhanced powder processing techniques. The proposal was submitted as a
Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) as a result of conservations between
the PI and the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program Director. The
qualifications of the PI and his ability to perform fundamental work in this
area are excellent. The relevance of the proposal, the fact that subject area is
one of increasing importance, and the uncertainty of the outcome make this
particular proposal an excellent candidate for the SGER program.
