8900285 Meeks The principal investigator will study a variety of problems in
differential geometry and differential topology. The main goal of the research
is to develop a deeper understanding of global topological and geometrical
properties of surfaces in 3-space that satisfy some nice geometrical or
variational principle. Particular emphasis will be placed upon: 1. The global
geometry and topology of properly embedded minimal surfaces: existence theorems,
topological obstructions, total curvature theorems, conformal structure,
topological uniqueness, computation of the index of examples, extension of
isometries, uniqueness of minimal graphs of sublinear growth over domains with
noncompact boundary. 2. Global geometry of constant mean curvature surfaces in
3-space and hyperbolic 3-space.3. Computation relevant to problems in the
subject. 4. Geometry of isotopy surfaces in 3-space.
