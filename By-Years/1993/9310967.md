9310967 Drumheller This proposal is a request to continue studies of the
properties of magnetism in less than three dimensions and to pursue unusual but
important aspects of superconductivity. Magnetic systems in low- dimensions are
realized in nature by special arrangement of the magnetic ions that make up the
materials into planes or chains and have wide industrial application as well as
fundamental application to other studies such as high-temperature
superconductivity. The work focuses on the seldom studied critical properties of
these systems in the temperature range at which the materials transform from
non-magnetic compounds into low-dimensional magnetic systems. Critical
properties of high-temperature superconductors as well as new fullerene-type
molecules will also be studied. ***
