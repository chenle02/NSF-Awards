This is an award to provide support for planning a research project to study
biological processes for treatment of surfactant solutions that have been used
to flush contaminants from soil. The specific contaminant she plans to study is
creosote and the biological process is planned to be conducted in a sequencing
batch bench- scale reactor. Creosote, the soil contaminant the investigator
plans to study, has been used as a wood preservative for many years and has
contaminated much soil in the vicinity of installations conducting wood
preservation. Results of this project are expected to include preliminary data
on conditions under which this contaminant can be biologically degraded and a
full research proposal that will be submitted to NSF in accord with conditions
listed in NSF 90-121, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards for
Women Scientists and Engineers.
