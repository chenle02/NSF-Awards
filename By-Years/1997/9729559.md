This researach is concerned with the development of 'collective' models of
household behavior, where household is represented as a group of several
individuals, each of whom is characterized by a specific utility function, and
who make Pareto efficient agreements. Such representations aim at understanding,
in particular, how the members respective 'power' or bargaining positions affect
intrahousehold allocation of consumption and welfare, as well as household
behavior as a whole. This has important implications for the design of optimal
policies; for instance, should benefits be given to specific members, under a
specific form (say, education to women), and others. A first goal is to deepen
the theoretical foundations of these models, and to solve some of the questions
that are still open. A second part of the research will be devoted to empirical
applications, especially in the case of labor supply. Finally, the model will be
extended to include uncertainty and dynamics.
