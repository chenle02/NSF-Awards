A Technovate robotics instructional workcell will be installed in the multi-
disciplinary center for computer-integrated manufacturing. It will enhance and
broaden the scope of undergraduate instruction in robotics and enable new
experiments in system integration and campus network interfacing. The workcell
is particularly adaptable to electronics manufacturing applications and has the
capability for off-line programming. The workcell includes an IBM 7535
industrial robot with Z- 80 microprocessor, an IBM PC with AML/E robotics
software for off line programming, and safety interlocks. The open systems
architecture will allow experimentation linking the cell with an existing Zilog
development system.
