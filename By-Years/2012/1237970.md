The unobtrusive monitoring of individuals with in-home sensors offers enormous
potential for detecting early health problems-before they become big problems--
so timely interventions can be provided to improve the health trajectory. The
result is continued high functional ability, independence, and better health
outcomes. Early detection of health changes is the key to this approach. This
project leverages ongoing work at the University of Missouri in Health Alert
Systems with sensor technology. A scaled-up version of the Health Alert System
is being tested in senior housing in Cedar Falls, Iowa, using in-home sensors
and remote video conferencing for nurse care coordination. Fiber networking
provides the bandwidth and latency essential for the project. The Health Alert
System includes motion sensors for activity monitoring and Kinect depth images
for gait analysis, and integrates a new hydraulic bed sensor that captures
quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness. Pattern recognition
algorithms are used to look for changes in the sensor data patterns and generate
health alerts to clinicians, who provide further diagnosis and determine
appropriate interventions. The usability and effectiveness of the remote Health
Alert System will be evaluated for managing chronic health conditions. Testing
the Health Alert System at a remote site from the healthcare providers will
provide important information about how the approach scales up into other
settings with high speed video conferencing and transfer of sensor data. This
will provide an important next step towards moving the approach into independent
housing where seniors want to be and offers potential healthcare cost savings.
