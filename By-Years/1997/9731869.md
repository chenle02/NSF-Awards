*** 9731869 Jaecks This research focuses on the study of the partitioning of
excess energy and/or angular momentum in coulombic many-body quantum systems.
Two projects will be undertaken. In one the dissociation of H3+ will be studied
through a triple coincidence measurement of the laboratory energies and angles
for the three emerging particles. In the second the energy and angular momentum
sharing and redistribution among electrons in argon will be measured when the
atom absorbs a linearly or circularly polarized photon resulting in the removal
of one electron and the excitation of another. ***
