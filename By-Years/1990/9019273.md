Kamchatka arc provides a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that adakites
are derived from the melting of subducted oceanic crust and/or lower continental
crust. The southern section of the Kamchatka arc consists of active and inactive
volcanoes with mantle derived magmas. The northern section (north of the Bering
F.Z.) volcanism includes both normal and adakite geochemistries. The adakites
are associated only with the subduction of the young crust in the Komandorsky
basin. The first objective will be to compare and contrast "normal" arc
volcanism in the southern section of the arc with the adakite volcanism found in
the northern section. There are several xenoliths found among the adakites
including granulites, cortlandites, amphibolites, hornblendites, pyroxenites,
and gabbros. The large range of xenoliths in the samples may enable the PIs to
document the source of the adakites. They will use a microprobe and and an ion
microprobe to document the geochemical signatures and P-T conditions of the
xenoliths which should make it possible to choose between the lower crust or
subducted slab as the source of the adakites.
