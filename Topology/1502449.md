This award supports participation in three meetings in a series of annual
conferences held at Cornell University and next convening May 8-10, 2015. The
conference series subject area is algebraic, differential, and geometric
topology and allied subjects. The conference series provides a significant arena
for the development and dissemination of a wide array of research results and
has been a force in the mathematical life of topologists and geometers in the
northeastern United States and beyond since 1963. It has a broad,
interdisciplinary flavor and collaboration-friendly format. The meetings begin
with an introductory day aimed at graduate students and non-specialists. The
training effects are extended by dissemination of lecture notes and summaries of
panel discussions.

Approximately ten speakers are invited each year, from a variety of subject
areas in and around topology. Each year an area of emphasis is chosen from which
about a third of the speakers are drawn; this allows deeper focus on fields
undergoing rapid change and is responsive to the trends in topology toward
specialization and cross-disciplinary activity. For the 2015 meeting, the area
of emphasis will be "groups acting on negatively curved spaces." The broader
impacts of the conference series include (a) a more broadly-trained community of
topologists, able to transcend the boundaries of sub-specialties; (b) a more
diverse mathematical workforce; (c) a more rapid integration of younger
topologists into areas of current research; and (d) the enhancement of
collaboration among researchers in different areas of topology. The conference
