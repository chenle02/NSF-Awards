Bringing Engineers into STEM Teaching (BEST) Project is a collaboration of the
School of Education and the College of Engineering at Boston University and six
schools or districts in the Boston area. This project is focusing on bringing
the mathematical, technological, and design expertise of engineers into
secondary classrooms. It is providing scholarships to 37 students and
engineering professionals to enroll in a one-year program that leads to a
master's degree and licensure to teach secondary mathematics. The project
provides 8 scholarships per year in years 1-4 and 5 in the fifth year. It is
facilitating the participation of undergraduate engineering students in a newly
launched 4 + 1 program at BU in which students receive a BS degree in
engineering and a master's degree in education in five years. Summer internships
and academic year programs for undergraduate engineers to work with middle
school students on design projects (Innovations in a Box) are being used to
motivate and develop interest in education. The project is also recruiting
practicing engineers. During the induction years, teachers will be supported
through summer and academic-year workshops, seminars and mentoring. The BEST
program is providing an exemplar for an experience-rich and inquiry-based
teacher preparation program that addresses the recommendations from the
Mathematics Education of Teachers (MET II) Report and makes it possible for
engineers to become teachers. This project is supplying high-need districts with
teachers who are knowledgeable about state mathematics standards and
Massachusetts engineering education standards and as a consequence, is
positively affecting thousands of secondary school students. The project is
testing a model for recruiting, training and retaining highly qualified
engineers in teaching.
