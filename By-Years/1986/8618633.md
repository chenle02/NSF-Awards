One of the biggest challenges facing earth scientists is to decipher the nature
and evolution of Archean crust, the greatest crustal-forming episode involving
questions of crustal thickness, composition, horizontal vs. vertical tectonic
regimes and evolution; i.e., underplating, and crustal accretion. COCORP
(Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling data from Minnesota and its
reanalysis have provided new information on the nature of the Archean and raised
critical questions. Reinterpretation of the COCORP) data indicates a moderately
dipping suture between early and late Archean marked by a 2- km-thick mylonite
zone, a thrust faulted Animikie basin, and an ancient gneiss terrain that is
complexly folded on subhorizontal axial planes. The subhorizontal folds continue
to a depth of almost 30 km and pass into a horizontal discontinuous structural
regime in the lowermost crust above a non-reflective Moho that may represent a
phase change. The principal investigator proposes a comprehensive series of
seismic reflection recording experiments using 216 channels in two sets of
instruments simultaneously at near and wide-angel offsets. Both the shallow and
lowermost crust will be imaged at offsets long enough to determine velocities.
Crossing profiles will be recorded across the ancient gneiss terrain, the
Archean suture (GLTZ) and the Animikie basin, and the lower crust and Moho will
be a prime target. Explosives as well as vibrators will be used for wide-angle
recording. Research will be carried out in cooperation with the Minnesota
Geological Survey who plan to drill shallow (100m) test holes to sample basement
along the seismic lines. Results will provide decisive new information on nature
and genesis of Archean crust.
