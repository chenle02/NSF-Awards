This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at the
University of Texas at Arlington in the summer of 2012 on the topic of
mathematical methods of computed tomography. The principal speaker will be
Professor Peter Kuchment from Texas A&M University. This award will support 30
participants at different stages of their careers. Computed tomography
techniques used for medical imaging aim to recover the internal distribution of
various important tissue parameters such as density, water content, oxygenation,
hemoglobin content, electrical conductivity, optical properties, and mechanical
properties. These are parameters are used by medical practitioners for diagnosis
of many types of conditions.

The conference will survey mathematical techniques, results, and open problems
in the actively developing and important field of computed tomography, aiming to
encourage both established and more junior mathematicians to begin research in
this field. The speaker will address both classical tomographic modalities, such
as x-ray computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography,
positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, electrical impedance
tomography, ultrasound tomography, and optical tomography, and novel hybrid
methods currently being developed, such as thermoacoustic and photoacoustic
tomography, magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography, acousto-electric
tomography, acousto-optical tomography, and magnetic resonance elastography.
