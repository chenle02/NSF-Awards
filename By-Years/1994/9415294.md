We have recently demonstrated that a new form of near field scanning optical
microscopy based on a small (e.g. 35 nm diameter)Ag sphere, excited at its
plasmon resonant frequency, can achieve sub-wavelength magnetic Kerr imaging. We
propose to develop a suitably modified microscope based on these Ag plasmon
resonators, but specifically optimized for high resolution fluorescence imaging.
We believe that the detection of individual fluorophores with near molecular
resolution may be possible. Example are given of exciting new opportunities in
bio-medical research that will become practicable when our new microscope is
operative.
