The significant use of social media has transformed the lives of students. The
project investigates the effectiveness of social media strategies in the
construction of messages and platforms using best practices from business and
research in service of the recruitment of students into advanced technological
fields in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The project
draws on established partnerships and the results from prior NSF-funded
projects. Specifically, the project builds on a robust partnership between the
Education Development Center (EDC) and National Convergence Technology Center
(CTC) to develop and test a model and materials that will enable a selected set
of ATE centers and projects to construct and implement social media strategies
based on best practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analytic and qualitative
study addresses the need for ATE centers and projects to use to the full
potential of social media, associated technologies, and strategies to recruit
students into advanced technological fields in STEM fields. A set of well
defined and vetted social media strategies provide the backbone of this effort.
A pre/post research design tests the effectiveness of messages and the different
social media platforms using a set of data analytics and tools that measure
traffic, use, time spent, and audience engagement.
