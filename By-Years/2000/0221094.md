This dissertation investigates how communal riots in Ahmedabad, India, have
created homogeneous ethnic neighborhoods where mixed neighborhoods previously
existed. The research will use geographical information systems to track the
city's major religious processions and riots. Archival records (e.g., government
inquiries, newspapers) will be examined to analyze the state's changing position
on riots and processions. Finally, semi-structured interviews with local leaders
and residents living near the major procession route will be used to analyze the
mechanisms that link the processions and communal violence with the creation of
ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods.
