9311593 Dietz This is a project designed to develop an improved model for
studying the environmental impacts associated with trends in population,
affluence, and technology. Each portion of the simple equation often used to
assess environmental impacts (I=PAT) will be reformulated to reflect added
complexity, and then time series, cross- sectional, and pooled time series
cross-sectional data from a variety of nations will be used to estimate new
models incorporating these changes. This project has the potential to make
important contributions not only to our theoretical understanding of the sources
of environmental problems, but also to environmental policy. Previous work using
the I=PAT model has been hindered by the oversimplified and unrealistic nature
of the variables used and the relationships assumed to exist among them, thus
making it impossible to use this model to accurately study and forecast
environmental trends. To the extent that this project is successful, it will
overcome these difficulties. ***
