9616267 Lott The development, field testing, and evaluation of SIMMS (Systemic
Initiative for Montana Mathematics and Science), a four-year secondary school
mathematics curriculum, is being completed. This curriculum integrates topics
within mathematics, emphasizes the relation between mathematics and other
disciplines, and makes extensive use of technology in laboratory based
activities. The emphasis for this phase of the development is on field testing,
evaluation, and revisions, with special attention to testing the materials in
urban settings.
