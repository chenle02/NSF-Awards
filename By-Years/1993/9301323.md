A series of process oriented modeling studies of the dynamics of the Gulf
Stream/Deep Western Boundary Current crossover will be conducted in order to
understand how the crossover interact with the basin-scale thermohaline
circulation through the exchange of heat, mass and chemical tracers between the
boundary and the interior.
