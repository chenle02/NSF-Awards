9508297 Deppa The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Winona State
University will purchase workstations with supporting software and compilers
which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences.
The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: development of a control chart for tool wear situations with
independent and correlated observations, the non-regular polygonal central
configurations of the 1 + n body problem in celestial mechanics, partial
residual plots for finding the correct functional form for a predictor in the
Cox proportional hazards model, optimal designs for smoothing, and numerical
partial differential equations for groundwater flow models.
