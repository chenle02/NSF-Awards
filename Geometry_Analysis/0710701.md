The main goal of the project is the construction of new examples of complete
embedded self-similar surfaces under the mean curvature flow, which is the
gradient flow of the surface area. The strategy for the construction is to
desingularize the intersection of two known examples by adapting the method N.
Kapouleas used to construct embedded minimal surfaces; the Principal
Investigator will use a Scherk's singly periodic minimal surface to get an
approximate solution which is then perturbed to obtain a complete self-similar
surface. The project is very geometric in nature, but it involves many
techniques from nonlinear partial differential equations.

Self-similar surfaces model the behavior of the mean curvature flow near
singularities under certain conditions; therefore, the availability of examples
of such surfaces is important to the understanding of the flow near its
singularities and its continuation past the singularities. Unfortunately, there
are currently only four know examples of complete self-similar surfaces in
dimension two embedded in the Euclidean space. A general classification is
hopeless; therefore, it is essential to find successful methods to construct new
examples. The broader goal of this project is to obtain a better understanding
of the formation of singularities for the mean curvature flow.
