9527751 Mortensen This research uses techniques developed under a prior NSF
grant to study microplasticity near inclusions embedded in an elastoplastic
material subjected to a uniform far-field stresses. The program employs silver
chloride (AgCl) as a model material for the study of metals containing
reinforcements or inclusions larger than a micrometer in size. AgCl is an ionic
solid which deforms by dislocation slip and its similarity with a metal from
that standpoint is well established. Unlike a metal, AgCl is transparent, stress
birefringent, and allows for the observation of dislocations at low densities by
ambient-temperature decoration with metallic silver. Data are quantitatively
compared with two existing models for the deformation behavior of two-phase
materials, the Eshelby equivalent inclusion method and finite element
techniques. The differences, if any, between the empirical results and the
predictions of the models help guide efforts to incorporate microstructural
features and dislocation mechanics into future models. %%% This study provides
experimental micromechanical data, sampled within a well-established metal
analog, at a microscopic scale and within bulk material. Results from this work
are relevant to a wide array of engineering structural materials, including two-
phase alloys and metal- matrix composites. ***
