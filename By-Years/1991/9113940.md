This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic environment and its
role in global change which is promoted by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.
It is a three year project to understand the dynamics of the thermohaline
circulation associated with surface salinity fluxes by applying a numerical
model in a sequence of process-oriented studies. Surface cooling and brine
rejection during ice formation lead to large surface salinity fluxes in many
areas of the Arctic Ocean, particularly over the continental shelves. This
negative buoyancy input increases the water density to such an extent that it
may sink to the bottom and induce thermohaline circulation patterns with may
generate dense-water bottom currents in the form of plumes. Such dense-water
plumes may transport shelf water across the shelf and deposit it into the deep
Arctic basins, thus contributing to the large-scale Arctic circulation.
