Interdisciplinary (99) This project is adapting a CAVE-based virtual reality
system to a number of courses in different STEM disciplines. Undergraduate
students enrolled in computer science courses in visualization are helping to
develop content-based materials to be used in courses in chemistry, mechanical
and electrical engineering, mathematics, physics and nursing. Through these
activities computer science students are also be engaging in the development of
new research areas of visualization. Outreach to local high schools is planned
through visits to the virtual reality laboratory.
