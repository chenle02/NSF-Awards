This project, supported under the "Small Grants for Exploratory Research"
program, is a prelude to a detailed accurate investigation of single quantum
annihilation of positrons. A preliminary experiment is planned using the
accelerated positron beam of the Brookhaven National Laboratory Dynamitron
facility. A principal objective is to test a coincidence technique in the
detection of the annihilation quanta, in an effort to reduce laboratory
background count rates. On the basis of these trial runs the feasibility of an
expanded experimental program can be assessed.
