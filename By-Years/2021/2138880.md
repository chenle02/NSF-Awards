Biomass is a critical source of alternative fuels and chemicals. Increasing the
conversion of biomass to useful products will improve the carbon balance in the
environment. Multi-activity proteins (MAPs) have the potential to be increase
biomass conversion. In this project, 85 MAPs will be produced and tested to
identify improved deconstruction of biomass. Research opportunities for graduate
and undergraduate students will be provided. In addition, a series of lectures
will inform the general public about enzymology and protein
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the production,
purification, and characterization of MAPs. The engineered DNA sequences of 85
new multi-activity proteins (MAPs), with two catalytic domains, have been
synthesized and cloned in the pET151 for heterologous production. A TEV-cleavage
site was introduced between the two catalytic domains. The biochemical
characterization of purified MAPs will focus on the synergy among the catalytic
domains by taking advantage of the TEV-cleavage site. The synergistic
interaction between the combined domains will be highlighted by the comparison
of kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) for the complete MAP and for the equimolar
mixture of the corresponding individual catalytic domains generated by TEV-
digestion. Through proximity effects, and depending on the linked domains, MAPs
are expected to display increased activity on complex substrates and reduced
inhibition by the product. In addition to identifying new catalysts for improved
carbohydrate deconstruction, this project should provide a mechanistic
understanding of the interaction between the combined domains in MAPs and help
guide the engineering of new proteins for custom
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
