The tectonic evolution of West Antarctica and its relationship to East
Antarctica is the most fundamental tectonic problem of the Antarctic continent.
It bears on global plate interaction, paleocirculation in the Southern Ocean,
paleoenvironment, and paleobiogeography as well as being critical to the
development of the continent itself. The joint United States-United Kingdom West
Antarctic Tectonics Project (1983-88) has shed considerable light in the
tectonic evolution of the Weddell Sea region. This award supports a new
tripartite United States-New Zealand- United Kingdom program of the study in
Marie Byrd Land for the years 1990-93 to complete our understanding of the
tectonic evolution of the southern rim of the Pacific Ocean basin. It will
involve field and laboratory investigations designed to elucidate the structure
and evolution of Marie Byrd Land crustal block and its relationship to other
West Antarctic crustal block, the East Antarctic craton, New Zealand and the
Pacific Ocean basin. This study is the major U.S. contribution to the program
and involves structural, paleomagnetic, petrologic, and geochronologic
investigations bearing particularly on the pre-Cenozoic development of Marie
Byrd Land.
