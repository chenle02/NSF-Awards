This action funds Ellery Ames of University of Oregon to conduct a research
project, entitled "Mathematical methods for understanding gravity near big-bang
type events," during the summer of 2012 at University of Otago in Dunedin, NZ.
The host scientist is Florian Beyer.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investigate long-standing
questions in gravitational theory regarding the early universe and to develop
mathematical techniques to aid in these investigations.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
