The project will use atomic absorption spectroscopy to enhance the chemistry
curriculum, via relevant issues in chemistry, environmental science, and other
areas. Both science and non-science majors will be introduced to the use of the
instrument. The instrument will be used for hands-on student laboratory
exercises in the introductory, general, and analytical chemistry courses. The
project will make some use of standard protocols for student exercises, but will
also be committed to developing lab exercises for lower-division undergraduate
courses. Anticipated exercises include water analysis, environmental analysis,
food and forensic analyses, and data handling exercises. For introductory
chemistry, as a followup to electronic spectra, application of AA will be
brought into a laboratory exercise, for example by analyzing water samples for
sodium or paint samples for lead. In general chemistry, AA is to be used in a
more rigorous way, including at least one AA exercise each semester. The first
semester will compare metal analysis results from AA and home water test kits,
or a comparable exercise. In the second semester, the AA will be used for
environmental applications, by incorporating a mini-site assessment in the
laboratory. Exercises in field sampling and sample preparation will be
incorporated. In quantitative analysis, the AA instrument will be used to
educate students in the rigorous standards routinely required to meet regulatory
agency standards for metals analysis in water, soil and other analytes, using
both flame and graphite furnace methods in suitable "real-world" analysis
situations. The instrument will also be used for student independent study
projects, to examine aspects of local water quality and soil pollution. The
project intends also to develop short exercises that can be used by the
administration of justice and biotechnology programs at Contra Costa College.
