This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will illustrate the
relative and absolute importance of materials and process hardening on the
superconducting performance and microstructure of Bi-2223 composite tape using a
fundamental approach and a simple conceptual framework. Commercially viable
high-temperature superconductor (HTS) wire must have high Jc performance and low
cost. This project will develop a novel deformation processing scheme. If
successful, this firm will produce an innovative deformation process that
provides the benefits of pressing while maintaining the cost advantages of
rolling. Successful completion of this project will have broad impact on all HTS
conductor applications, and especially those that require long and continuous
lengths with high Jc performance. HTS applications have a multi-billion dollar
market potential in products integral to electric power generation,
distribution, transportation, machinery, energy storage and other uses for both
military and commercial systems. Specific HTS systems and components include
power transmission cables, motors, generators, fault current limiters, and
transformers.
