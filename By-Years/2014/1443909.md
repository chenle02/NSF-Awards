This project will enable more efficient use of a scarce resource, the radio
spectrum. This project will have broad impact on the public by enabling
increased efficiency in communications between citizens, while simultaneously
shared use of the same frequency range for radar applications. The techniques
developed will potentially reduce the impact by both accidental and intentional
(jamming) interference. Students, who will carry out part of the research, will
be better trained to join the US work force. Furthermore, their use of the
research in the classroom presentations will lead to a keener appreciation of
the use and issues faced by permitting widespread use of cognitive radio
devices, devices that can change its wireless channel at will.

This proposal explores the potential for Synthetic Aperture Radars to operate
with other users of the spectrum. In particular it aims to explore the capacity
for a Radar system to operate efficiently by recognizing and discarding false
positive signals; in effect by using a variety schemes to identify and ignore
interference. Their approach is unique in that it attempts to integrate the
spectrum sharing into the fundamental operation of the radar.
