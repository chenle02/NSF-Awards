Mutation plays a fundamental role in the generation of genetic variation within
populations, adaptation to novel environments, and the evolution of sexual
reproduction and mating systems. Using predictions based on theoretical models,
this project investigates how changing levels of mutational input affect the
transition between different forms of sexual reproduction and adaptation to
novel temperatures in the well-studied nematode model system, Caenorhabditis
elegans. These predictions will be tested experimentally using direct genetic
manipulation of mutation rate and an individual's propensity to produce male
offspring.

This research should further our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for
generating the tremendous variation in mating systems in both plants and
animals, as well as illuminating the contrast between the creative and
constraining roles of mutation in natural populations. The processes studied
here are fundamental to describing variation and change in agricultural and
natural systems, especially in endangered species of plants and animals.
Nematodes themselves are one of the most numerous, yet understudied, groups of
organisms on earth and are important human, animal, and plant pathogens.
