This award is for support for a project to develop a data base from which
regional metamorphic, deformation, and age relations of high-grade basement
metamorphic rocks in the Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica can be better
understood. The rocks to be examined come from the Nimrod Group in the central
Transantarctic Mountains and the Lanterman Metamorphic Complex in northern
Victoria Land. Improved documentation of their petrogenesis, age, and tectonic
evolution are important for a thorough understanding of how the paelo-Antarctc
craton evolved and how the supercontinent Gondwana formed. This study will
involve detailed field geologic mapping and sampling, structural,
microstructural, kinematic and fabric analysis, metamorphic petrology and
quantitative geothermobaro-metry, and Uranium-Lead geochronometry.
