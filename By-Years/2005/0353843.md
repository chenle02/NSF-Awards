AST 0353843 Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Program at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO)
will provide an opportunity for U. S. undergraduate students to participate in
current astronomical research in an international environment. The students will
be chosen from a mixture of backgrounds, with an emphasis on those who would not
otherwise have access to large telescopes. While in Chile, they will themselves
operate one or more of the telescopes at CTIO; complete individual research
projects under the mentorship of CTIO and associated staff astronomers; gain an
understanding of the breadth of work being done at CTIO by attending seminars
given by staff; and perform all this alongside astronomers and students from
several other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the program are:
To provide undergraduates with a concrete research experience with scientists
who are working at the forefront of contemporary astrophysics; To introduce
undergraduates who are exploring a career in science to the range of
opportunities in astronomy today and; To expose undergraduates to the diversity
of scientists and support staff involved in astronomical research. The major
themes of the CTIO REU Program are the conduct of publishable research, within a
framework of rigorous intellectual merit and; exposure to the international
nature of astronomy, both in people and places. The program is conducted over
ten weeks during the southern summer, January through March, both to allow
interaction with Chilean students and as an alternative to traditional northern-
summer student programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
