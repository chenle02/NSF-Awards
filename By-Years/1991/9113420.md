Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) is establishing a connection to NSFNET
via a 56,000 bits per second line through the WISCNET state network. The
connection enhances collaborations of campus scientists with colleagues at other
institutions in the fields of physics, image processing, biomedical simulation,
and mechanical engineering, and allows access to libraries and other remote
facilities throughout the internet. In addition, some of the faculty are working
toward their Ph.D>s, and a network connection enables them to continue their
research without having to relocate. This award funds part of the costs for two
years.***//
