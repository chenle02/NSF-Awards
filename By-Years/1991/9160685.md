This project implements a time-resolved photoluminescence technique and the
related analysis method to study the carrier recombination decay process in
heterojunction materials in a non- destructive and contactless fashion. The
corresponding "surface velocity" parameter describing the surface and/or
interface quality as well as the interface electric field will be determined
quantitatively. A quantitative description of the interface quality to determine
the interface electric field and to establish the relationship between these
material properties and device performance is central to the characterization
requirements of compound semiconductor heterojunction materials.
