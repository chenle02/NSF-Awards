The University of Wisconsin, River Falls GREAT (Graduate, Retain, Engage,
Advise, Team learning) Falcon Project is designed to increase the number of
graduates in Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Environmental Science, Physics, and
Mathematics. The project targets students in their first two years, using proven
strategies to increase student success and support to increase the retention of
STEM students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The GREAT Falcon Project takes a three-fold
approach to improve STEM retention, progression, and graduation rates. First,
faculty are implementing student-centered pedagogies such as research-based
laboratories, Studio Physics, and Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning to
increase student engagement and success in gateway STEM courses. Several of
these teaching strategies are making extensive use of a new high-technology
Active Learning Classroom. Second, Peer-Led Team Learning is utilized in key
bottleneck courses in Chemistry and Mathematics to teach students the problem-
solving skills needed in STEM. Finally, a hybrid advising system helps STEM
students with academic, social, and/or financial issues. Students showing risk
factors for continued retention are contacted by a retention specialist/mentor,
with appropriate interventions scheduled as needed. Students who leave STEM
majors and/or the university are interviewed to assess why they are leaving. The
GREAT Falcon Project directly impacts 900 students per year in STEM majors and
is designed to increase the number of STEM graduates by 40 per year (from the
current 130 to 170 students per year) by the end of the grant period.
