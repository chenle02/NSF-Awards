The dynamics of photochemical and electrochemical processes for molecules
adsorbed on roughened silver and gold electrodes will be examined using surface-
enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) to monitor the kinetics and chemistry of the
reactions. SERS will be used in a time-resolved mode using pump-probe techniques
to follow concentration-time profiles and structural changes of reactants,
intermediates and products in the nanosecond time domain. The studies will be
directed towards (1) photochemical and electrochemical bond cleavage reactions
of carbon-halide bonds in various halide-substituted ring compounds of
piperidines, pyridines and quinolines and (2) the mechanisms of photoglavanic
(solar energy conversion) processes for flavin molecules and other dye
sensitizers adsorbed on roughened electrodes. The study promises to detect the
excited state redox species near the electrode surface. %%% The research, in the
general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on the use of surface-
enhanced Raman Scattering to examine molecules on gold and silver electrode
surfaces. The work promises to lead to a better understanding of the kinetics
and chemistry of reactions that occur on these electrode surfaces, including
processes that are important in solar energy conversion.
