The principal investigators will continue work in problems in dynamical systems
and differential geometry. Professor Burns will study geodesic flows on
Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature and the problem of constructing
metrics whose geodesic flow is ergodic. Professor Franks will focus on the
dynamics of homeomorphisms of surfaces and in particular, area preserving
homeomorphisms. Professor Robinson will focus on the stability conjecture for
flows in higher dimensions. He will also continue his study of the bifurcations
in the formation of the "Smale horseshoe". This award will support research in
the general area of dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy
to understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear, and difficult
to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study of this local to global
relationship. Many physical systems can best be modeled using this area of
mathematics including fluid flow and turbulence, complex biological systems,
mechanical systems, and chemical reactions.
