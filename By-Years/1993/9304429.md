9304429 Riggs This award provides approximately one-half the funding required to
equip a rock-crushing and mineral separation laboratory to be housed in the
Department of Geology at the Northern Arizona University. The University is
committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the equipment. The
Principal Investigator and colleagues at Northern Arizona University are engaged
in a number of research projects requiring the separation of small amounts of
dateable minerals (for example, zircons for uranium-lead dating) from their rock
matrix. The facilities will also be used by scientists at the U.S. Geological
Survey located at Flagstaff. ***
