9317100 Whitney This research planning grant seeks to document the metamorphic
history of two massifs (Kirsehir, Nigde) within the Central Anatolian Massif in
Turkey. These metamorphic massifs have been interpreted as continental fragments
rifted from Afro-Arabia, and currently they occupy a key tectonic position
surrounded by suture zones in the Tethyan domain. Preliminary research will
focus on (1) describing mineral assemblages in progressive metamorphic facies,
(2) documenting mineral paragenesis and PTt paths using compositional
information and reaction textures, (3) evaluating the physical conditions of
metamorphism and emplacement of the massifs, and (4) determining how further
study of these rocks might contribute to ongoing discussions of the role of
metamorphic fluids in amphibolite-to- granulite transitions and
ultrametamorphism. Planning activities will include both field and analytical
work (mineral, whole-rock analysis, isotopic dating).
