The Department of Biology graduates an average of 75 students per year, 11 of
whom are typically preservice teachers and 24 of whom are seeking careers in
environmental biology. Additionally, several inservice teachers enroll in summer
field courses and environmental biology workshops. The number of students in the
environmental biology program has increased dramatically over the past several
years, and the department is now deficient with respect to the number and
variety of environmental courses offered and the equipment supporting these
courses. This project modernizes the environmental and ecological curriculum
with a major infusion of investigative field and laboratory research into the
course activities. The major objective of the project is to equip the field
station (TLES) with modern ecological and environmental biology equipment for
undergraduate student use. The TLES is a teaching and research facility,
established with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and located 3.2 km from the
main campus. The new equipment allows students to use a variety of modern
ecological research techniques as they ask and answer important ecological
questions. Additionally, with an equipped field station so close to the main
campus, the department can provide invaluable field experience for environmental
biology students and preservice teachers as part of the regular curriculum.
Ultimately, the university produces better trained individuals for today's very
competitive field of environmental biology and produces preservice teachers with
better field training who may eventually transpire into more field activities in
the high school biology curricula within the Inland Northwest. Additionally,
students gain more experience designing and conducting studies and analyzing and
presenting their own data, which has similar beneficial impacts. *
