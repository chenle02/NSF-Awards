New oceanic crust forms along the mid-ocean ridge axis by a complex interplay
of magmatic, tectonic, and hydrothermal processes. These processes are known to
vary significantly along the axis, as manifested by division of the ridge into
segments bounded by transform faults and overlapping spreading centers.
Hydrothermal venting along the mid-ocean ridge is a first-order process that is
responsible for much of the heat loss from the ridge axis. This project will
determine the distribution, relative intensity, and first-order chemical
characteristics of hydrothermal venting along the morphologically,
geophysically, and pertologically well-known segments of the East Pacific Rise
between 9 03N and 10N by surveying the water column for hydrothermal plumes.
This section of the ridge was chosen because it is well-studied, and because it
encompasses portions of mid-ocean ridge with high magma supply as well as
portions that are magmatically starved.
