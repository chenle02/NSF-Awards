This award provides support for graduate students and postdocs while they learn
mentoring skills and subsequently supports their participation in the Conference
Experience for Undergraduates (CEU) that is part of the annual Division of
Nuclear Physics (DNP) meeting. As near-peer participants in the CEU, they will
enhance the experience of the undergraduate students through individual and
group meetings, physics discussions, and psychosocial support. In addition, the
funding will enable participants to attend the conference and present their own
research, discuss their work with members of the community, and further their
own careers. Institutionalizing a trained near-peer network at the DNP will
continue to aid undergraduate students in developing a scientific identity that
is essential for them to see themselves as future physicists.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
