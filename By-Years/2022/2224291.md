The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of digital health technologies (e.g., wearable devices and
personalized medicine) that can be used to address sexual health problems. There
are nearly 10 million new cases of sexually transmitted disease (STD) each year
in the U.S. Treatments for STDs are estimated to cost $16 billion annually. The
proposed technologies seek to improve education and communication and, in doing
so, may provide positive health outcomes for both individuals and their
families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development
improved parent-child communications and the reduction of healthcare costs
associated sexually-transmitted diseases among adolescents. This innovation
stems from the combination of several elements including building motivation for
communication by shifting parental mindsets, providing skill-building exercises,
and providing a new platform for parent-child communication. This combination of
features is not currently available in any other book, website, or product on
the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
