This research concerns estimation in high dimensional models. In the first part
the use of high dimensional models for incomplete data is addressed. Suppose the
pattern of incompleteness is related to an high dimensional vector of
observations. Then the dimensionality of the vector precludes straightforward
maximum likelihood estimation. The research addresses two modifications of
maximum likelihood. In the first modification, the dimension of the vector is
reduced by a balancing score and in the second modification, a weighted
likelihood is used. The second part of this research focuses on maximum
likelihood estimation for the transformation model, a high dimensional
generalization of the linear regression model. This model stipulates that an
unknown transformation of the response follows a linear regression. In special
cases, such as the proportional hazards model, the estimators found by maximum
likelihood are well understood. Yet in general, estimators of parameters in this
model, although extremely popular, are rather difficult to analyze. This
research investigates the use of new techniques, such as empirical processes and
empirical likelihood in order to understand the estimators.

Models in which there are many unknowns or unknown functions (called parameters
here) appear throughout the sciences. Often these models are formulated to
address inadequacies of the classical linear regression model. For example,
social scientists use high dimensional models in event history analysis of the
causes of variability in the timing of life events such as premarital births,
initiation of drug abuse, timing of retirement and duration of poverty spells.
High dimensional models attempt to allow the data to speak for itself and to
minimize the addition of spurious information caused by imposing a low-
dimensional model on the data. This research advances the understanding of these
high dimensional models. Often high dimensional models are applied without any
theoretical understanding of when they may or may not produce quality
estimators. In particular, this research investigates the bias and variability
of of estimators found by the use of a common estimation method, maximum
likelihood estimation. This is important as understanding the causes of
variability in the timing of life events is crucial to designing appropriate
social policies and intervention/prevention programs.
