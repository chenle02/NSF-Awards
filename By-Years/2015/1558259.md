Emissions, transport and transformations of aerosols and trace gases from Asia
increasingly impact local, regional and even global environments. The chemical
and physical mechanisms by which atmospheric processes change the properties and
concentrations of trace gases and aerosols remain challenging questions in
tropospheric chemistry research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through partnerships with
Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and the Hebei provincial weather
service, this collaborative study, Air Chemistry Research In Asia (ARIAs) will
facilitate concurrent aircraft and ground measurements, aerosol optical
properties and trace gas composition over the North China Plain (NCP).
Ultimately, the results from this project will improve theory and predictive
capability of environmental models, used to develop mitigation strategies for
air pollution from the Asian continent and to better understand the fate of
short-lived climate forcers such as ozone and aerosols in these high population,
high emission environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also serve to
further educate a research associate, and graduate and undergraduate students
and, through its outreach component, K-12 students. The project will also renew
collaborations with leading Chinese research groups.
