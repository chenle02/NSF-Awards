The objective of this proposed research is to develop a CAD-Based expert system
for the design of structural repairs and for the detailed design of structural
members. The system will couple variational geometry, automated finite element
mesh generation and design sensitivity analysis into a tool capable of providing
feedback on the effects of "what if" changes and of also determining, via a
gradient descent search strategy, the optimum shape for the repair concept under
consideration.
