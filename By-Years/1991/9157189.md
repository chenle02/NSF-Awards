The general focus of this research is on the development of numeric methods for
engineering simulation and design. Emphasis is placed on the analysis of ill-
posed inverse and design problems arising in solidification processing and non-
destructive testing of materials, optimum metal forming processes, and
thermomechanical modeling of solidifying bodies. Successful algorithmic
development will result in quantum improvements in engineering design
computations.
