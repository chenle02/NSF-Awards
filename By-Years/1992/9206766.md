The purpose of this project is to complete the collection of a large body of
archival data on wages in the United States from 1820 to 1860. The data will be
used to construct annual time- series of nominal and real wages for different
occupations and regions. These new wage series will improve upon earlier wage
estimates, and will provide important new insights into many fundamental aspects
of nineteenth century American economic development such as the changes over
time in living standards; the spatial integration of labor markets within the
United States and in an international context; the relationship between economic
growth and inequality; the role of economic factors in the coming of the Civil
War; and macroeconomic performances in an era of little or no government
intervention in economic affairs. This research is important because it will
generate a useful new data set along with a more complete analysis of the
evolution of the US labor market in the early 19th century.
