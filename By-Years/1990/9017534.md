This is a proposal to develop improvements in confocal microscopy in three
areas: 1) Solid-state photon detectors to increase system quantum efficiency
(compared to the photomultiplier tube), especially in the red and near-infrared.
2) The incorporation of an additional, full-time, operationally-transparent,
detector chain for light backscattered by the specimen. 3) The development of a
practical system of automatic optimal beam shaping so that the size of the
focussed spot is always appropriate for the size of the voxels sampled (referred
to the specimen). To insure that these developments are made available to
general user groups as soon as possible, it is proposed that this prototype
research take the form of a cooperative effort between the PI and Bio-Rad Inc.,
a major American manufacturer of confocal equipment which has distinguished
itself by its responsiveness to input from interested and competent users.
Specifically, the support is sought to pay for partial salary, travel and
laboratory expenses for research to be carried out at the University of
Cambridge and the Bio-Rad development laboratory in England by the PI while on
sabbatical from the Integrated Microscopical Resource. Some funds will also be
used during the six months preceding the sabbatical for acquiring necessary
equipment in the US.
