An instrumented twin screw extruder will be purchased for polymer processing
studies. The purpose of this work is to couple theoretical work (improved
descriptions of the transport and thermodynamic coefficients) with the
experimental work on a commercial equipment. This will enable the development of
a mechanistic model for the process. The research program associated with the
equipment will be conducted in collaboration with industry.
