The University of South Carolina - Aiken will initiate a six-week, commuter,
Young Scholars multidisciplinary project in microbiology, chemistry, chemical
engineering, archeology, forestry, ecology, environmental science, mechanical
engineering, and computer science for 18 students entering the 12th grade. In
this summer program participants will conduct six weeks of research under the
supervision of local scientists/engineers. Weekly group meetings will focus on
ethics, careers and public speaking. During the academic year students make
three additional presentations; at their school, at the CSRA Science Forum, and
at the South Carolina Junior Academy of Science and/or the Georgia Science and
Humanities Symposiums.
