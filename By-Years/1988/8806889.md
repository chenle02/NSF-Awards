Morphological differentiation in plant species is correlated in general with
reproductive isolation and genetic differences. Very different-looking species
are usually also reproductively incompatible (hybrids cannot be made, or if
obtained, are sterile). Nevertheless, some plant species which are closely
related in the genetic sense that they are completely interfertile may look very
different morphologically. This situation has compelled plant evolutionists to
hypothesize that these exceptional plant species must have undergone rapid
morphological evolution. They have changed greatly in appearance in a period of
time that was too short to allow them to evolve mechanisms of reproductive
isolation. Cultivated maize is one such exceptional species, compared to its
wild progenitors, the teosinte corns of Mexico. The genetic basis of such rapid
morphological change may depend upon two contrasting modes: changes at a very
small number (one to four) of genes with major effects, or numerous changes of
many genes, each with small effects. Dr. John Doebley is beginning to test these
two hypotheses in his study of genetic effects on morphological changes in the
ear of corn, Zea mays subspecies mays. The ear of corn is remarkably different
from that of its ancestor, Mexican teosinte, despite the fact that corn and
teosinte are completely interfertile and are thought to have diverged only
10,000 years ago under Indian domestication. Tests will be conducted on progeny
between corn and teosinte races, analyzing associations between molecular
markers on the chromosomes and genes controlling morphological features in corn
and teosinte ears. By these means it should be possible to determine the minimum
number of genes controlling key morphological differences between corn and
teosinte, the chromosomal location of these genes, the mode of action (dominant
or recessive), and the percentage of phenotypic variation for which each gene
accounts. The data will allow discrimination between two competing theories on
the morphological steps involved in the recent origin of the corn ear.
