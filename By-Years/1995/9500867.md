PI: Deift DMS-9500867 Deift will continue his investigations into forced
lattice vibrations, semi-classical limit for the focusing NLS equation, random
matrix theory, integrable models, and rotating black holes. Riemann-Hilbert
techniques will be used to evaluate the asymptotics of probability distributions
that arise in random matrix theory, to investigate asymptotic questions that
arise in the theory of integrable quantum field theories and statistical
mechanical models, and to study the force of interaction between two rotating
black holes in equilibrium as the separation of the holes goes to infinity.
Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the
physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the
equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the
solutions. This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness
and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of
solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.
