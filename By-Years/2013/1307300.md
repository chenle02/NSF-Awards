Multipacting is a resonance phenomenon that involves electron emission and
dynamics in high electric fields at the vacuum chamber or cavity walls in
acceleration systems. In this award, the physics giving rise to the electron
emission and dynamics will be studied. Experiments will be conducted with
superconducting undulators (SCU) at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced
Photon Source (the APS) and the data analyzed. A combination of analytical and
numerical computation will be used to analyze the physics, and the results will
be compared with the experimental data where available.

The broader impacts of the work are significant as the development of SCU has
considerable benefits in enhancing the capabilities of synchrotron light
sources, particularly for hard-x-ray sources. Multipacting is also an important
challenge for other machines, for example electron-positron and proton proton
colliders. Carrying out the research on site at the APS will provide direct
training of a student in accelerator science and operation, an opportunity that
is not readily accessible outside of an operating synchrotron facility.
