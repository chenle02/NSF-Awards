Stochastic network models are mathematical descriptions of interconnected
systems with randomly varying properties. These models provide a critical bridge
between the powerful tools of mathematical network theory and the unpredictable
real world. Stochastic networks have been used to model manufacturing systems,
call centers, health care systems, and a wide variety of electronic
communication systems, including the Internet, wireless and wireline networks,
and sensor networks.

This workshop will bring together mathematicians and applied researchers who
share an interest in stochastic network models, and will highlight areas of
greatest current activity, providing intellectual guidance to young researchers
and to the larger community of applied probabilists. In particular, this
workshop will connect mathematicians developing powerful abstract tools with the
applications communities that can translate these tools into major improvements
in real network performance. The supported activity will allow the organizers to
broaden participation in the workshop by partially defraying travel costs.
