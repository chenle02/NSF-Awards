The Principal Investigator will study asymptotics of the heat equation, eta
invariants for operators of odd dimensional manifolds, multiplicative K-theory,
and disk bundles. The work to be carried out relates sound and shape. In a broad
sense the work seeks to understand what can be learned about the shape of an
object from the sound it may emit. M. Kac once asked an innocent sounding
question, "Can you hear the shape of a drum". This question has led to the
understanding of related questions in many dimensions. Many useful applications
have resulted.
