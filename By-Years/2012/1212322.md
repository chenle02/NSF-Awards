This award will partially support a one-day, three-part professional development
series for early career geoscientists during the 2011 Fall American Geophysical
Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco, CA. The Fall AGU meeting, one of the
largest meetings for geoscientists, is an excellent opportunity to engage early
career scientists, such as senior graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, new
faculty and research scientists. The goal is to provide a venue for the
development of professional skills that will contribute to the continued success
of these early career scientists. The three workshops include: 1) how to
navigate the National Science Foundation, 2) shaping the future of postdoctoral
fellowship programs, and 3) networking as a professional skill. For early career
researchers in particular it is important to learn how to ask the right
questions and to learn what programs are appropriate for their research ideas to
get funded. This workshop will be open to all AGU Fall Meeting attendees, but
will be particularly helpful to early-career to mid-career participants.
