This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Houston-Clear
Lake for the repair and renovation of the Bayou Building which houses biological
research and research training activities. This building was constructed in 1975
and has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant of $125,000 and
$155,146 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these
research and research training facilities and will permit the clustering of
faculty members who are now dispersed or who currently have no assigned
laboratory space. This project will address the need to improve the current
research infrastructure by providing more usable space, adequate ventilation and
lighting, and growth chambers for all laboratories which are to be modernized.
The greater interactions among faculty and students that accrue from this
renovation can be expected to enhance collaborations and the quality of ongoing
research. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing
an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the training of
quality students in a department with a particular commitment to educating
nontraditional students and to preparing students for advanced education in the
sciences.
