The physics of radio jets is still not well understood, and this research adopts
a three pronged approach to the study of the effects of atmospheric gradients
and magnetic fields on jet dynamics and radio source morphology. It will
comprise an analytical study of the time independent magnetohydrodynamic fluid
equations, a linearized time dependent stability analysis of those equations,
and a comparison of the results of these analyses with numerical simulations.
Dr. Hardee is one of the most thorough and productive workers in this field, and
has developed a strong foundation of computational background for this program.
