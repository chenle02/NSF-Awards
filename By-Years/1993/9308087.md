9308087 Plonus The extended Huygens-Fresnel principle is used to investigate
superresolution effects in weak turbulence. Fundamental, analytical expressions
for the average image spectrum of an extended object under monochromatic, unit
amplitude plane wave illumination have been developed, and are the basis of this
proposal. These expressions show that under certain conditions the
superresolution effect can be observed. The criterion and physical model of
superresolution effect will be established. The relationship between various
parameters, such as: wavelength, strength of turbulence, the diameter of
aperture lens, etc. will be investigated. The more general problem of
superresolution effect in imaging through weak turbulence while the object is
illuminated by a spatially partially coherent source will be explored. The
effect of the degree of illuminating source coherence on superresolution will be
investigated. The superresolution effect associated with look-up and look-down
imaging system will be analyzed. The superresolution recovery techniques and
procedures will be derived to extract the additional information contained in
the image spectrum. Through this development, a clear picture of the
superresolution effect caused by turbulent inhomogeneities will be established,
which would lead to an introduction in the object image of some new features.
