This award supports Professor Haas to organize a series of workshops in
combinatorics and graph theory. These meetings will mainly be used as a forum
for faculty and graduate students in New England to meet and exchange ideas.
Meetings of this type have been held before and they have proven to be
successful. In particular, they have the potential to have great impact in
promoting the careers of the participants. Since these meetings have attracted a
good number of women mathematicians, this represents a unique opportunity to
increase the number of successful female mathematicians. The research is in the
general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods
to study how discrete collections can be organized. The behavior of discrete
systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design
of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in
computer science all deal with discrete objects, and this makes use of
combinatorial research.
