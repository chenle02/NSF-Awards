The preferred approaches to accelerated coastal erosion have been structural in
nature like shoreline hardening, e.g., breakwaters and seawalls. Non-structural
measures include regulations, planting on dunes, removal of phreatophytes among
others. One measure, relocation of existing structures landward, is technically
feasible but seldom a utilized form of adjustment to coastal accelerated
erosion. This technique may be an important alternative in the near future,
particularly in light of possible sea level rise. The present work looks at the
national inventory on relocation experience; economic and legal
incentives/obstacles to relocation; evaluation of relocation as a hazard
mitigation technique; evaluation of relocation for achieving multiple public
goals; and the formulation of recommendations for policy and for further
research if needed.
