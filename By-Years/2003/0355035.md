The project involves theoretical study of two complementary processes. The first
is strong-field photoionization, in which electrons are detached from atoms in
intense laser light. Studies in this area involve extensive computer modeling
and focus primarily on understanding the dynamics of double ionization. The
complementary area of study is photorecombination, in which electrons reattach
to atoms and emit light. Studies in this latter area combine the development of
a mathematical formalism with computer application for examining
photorecombination processes that can occur in high-temperature plasmas.
