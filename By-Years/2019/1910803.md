Machine learning (ML) will have a huge economic and scientific impact over the
upcoming decades. But despite the growing importance of ML, there has been
relatively little work focused on asking what systems to support machine
learning should look like. The result is that it is difficult to apply ML to
non-standard cases: Big Data, large or complex models that take a long time to
train or require more RAM than is available on a graphics processing unit (GPU),
or learning problems with hard training time constraints, to name a few. The
proposed project aims to address such deficiencies by applying ideas from
relational database systems to the design and implementation of systems for ML.
Building an ML system on top of a relational-style engine will enable the design
of ML systems that are able to automatically generate compute plans for specific
ML tasks with little programmer effort. Those plans will be optimized and
executed to match the data size, layout, and the compute hardware. The code to
implement an ML algorithm will be the same no matter whether the computation is
run on a local machine, or in a distributed environment. If successful, the
project will radically expand the ease-of-use and applicability of
ML.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of technical questions that need to
be answered for ML computations to be run on top of a relational system, and
answering such questions will be at the heart of the project. For example: How
can ML primitives (convolutions, recurrent modules, etc.) be mapped onto
relational primitives? How can large objects (matrices/tensors) be chucked into
records so relational implementations run efficiently? And since a developer of
ML algorithms is unlikely to accept SQL as a programming language: How to
translate Karas-like Python programs into relational
algebra?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
