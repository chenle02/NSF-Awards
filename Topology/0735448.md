The proposal envisions supporting travel to an international conference on
algebraic topology to be held in Djerba, Tunisia, October 19-24, 2007. The
principal focus of the conference will be on recent advances in homotopy theory
connected with the study of classifying spaces, mapping spaces, p-compact
groups, p-local finite groups, and unstable modules over the Steenrod algebra.
Several of the areas of interest transcend research boundaries: the study of
p-compact groups touches on geometry, the study of p-local finite groups
involves finite group theory and modular representation theory, while the study
of unstable modules over the Steenrod algebra impinges on invariant theory. The
purpose of the conference is to consolidate these recent advances, facilitate
communication between researchers in these areas, set directions for future
research, and strengthen the connections with other fields.

Two of the main themes in mathematics are geometry and algebra. Geometry, and
its variants, such as topology, involve the study of higher dimensional shapes
and their frequently subtle distinguishing qualities. Algebra, on the other
hand, deals with ordinary numbers and their generalizations. Algebraic topology
is a hybrid area which essentially looks for ways to extract interesting
numerical information from shapes. Recently there have been major advances in
the part of algebraic topology that is concerned with studying geometrical
symmetries. The purpose of this proposal is to provide support for travel by
researchers to an international conference devoted to presenting and discussing
these advances. The conference will also contribute to establishing and
reinforcing contacts between US, European, and North African mathematicians.
