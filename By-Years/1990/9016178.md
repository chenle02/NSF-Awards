This project takes advantage of new developments in photography and image
analysis software to advance filed studies in environmental science. The
dynamics of ecological processes as well as impacts from disturbance often are
measured by changes in vegetation. Traditional methods of vegetation analysis
are labor intensive, slow, and as a result, they often are confined to small-
scale measurement. Many current research topics (i.e. climate change) require
analysis over large areas, and although remote sensing from space is providing
unprecedented information, validation of satellite imagery with large-scale
vegetation analysis is lacking. A new, ground-based methodology has been
developed by an interdisciplinary group at the University of New Mexico that is
significantly increasing the ability of scientists to study environmental
dynamics across a range of scales and allow integration with reflectance
measurements from satellite instruments. The resulting system will provide a
method of easily performing detailed analysis of near ground level images on a
computer workstation.//
