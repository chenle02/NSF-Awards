9452075 Ralston This project involves a behavioral analysis laboratory (BAL),
that supports general experimental psychology and other classes. Experimental
psychology is an introductory class with a large enrollment of psychology majors
and non majors. In addition, the BAL is available to other undergraduate
psychology students and classes to conduct independent study and research. More
specifically, one portion of the BAL supports general computing, simulations of
physiological and psychological processes, and studies of human subjects.
Another aspect of the BAL provides instrumentation for exercises with animals to
demonstrate principles of operant conditioning. The development of the BAL has
also greatly improved the quality of instruction within the institution.
