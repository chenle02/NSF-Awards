Reactions of muonic hydrogen with hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium will be
studied as a function of energy at the TRIUMF laboratory. These reactions are of
relevance to muon catalyzed fusion. This experiment will isolate, for the first
time, the formation of muonic molecules from the more complex processes present
in the full fusion cycle. Cross sections and reaction rates will be obtained
using Monte Carlo techniques, with specific responsibilities for developing the
Monte Carlo computer codes resting with the present Gustavus Adolphus group.
