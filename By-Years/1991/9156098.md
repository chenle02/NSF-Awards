A curriculum based in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) is being
developed which allows students to pursue "liberal engineering" options or to
complete a more traditional ECE curriculum. The primary liberal engineering
option is a new major within the ECE department which involves only 40 credit
hours similar to those of physics, math, or chemistry majors. The new major,
"Electrical and Information Sciences," is offered in parallel with the more
traditional programs in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. The
heart of this program is a set of sophomore courses patterned on the "Just in
Time" concept. Prototype versions of these courses are being taught as a pilot
program. If successful, these courses will replace existing sophomore-level
courses for all ECE undergraduates.
