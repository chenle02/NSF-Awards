Geometric measure theory, harmonic analysis, and calculus of variations

Abstract This proposal is focused on three problems in three somewhat
overlapping areas, namely geometric measure theory, harmonic analysis, and the
calculus of variations. The first problem is Besicovitch's 1/2- conjecture
regarding the sharpest bound for the (a.e.) lower spherical density for purely
unrectifiable 1-sets in Euclidean space (or more general spaces as well). The
second is the Harmonic Lip_1-Capacity problem (Mattila's conjecture and the
related David-Semmes problem), regarding the characterization (in terms of
rectifiability) of sets of co-dimension one which allow a Lipschitz harmonic
function defined off the set to be extended to all of Euclidean space. This is
precisely the higher dimensional analogue of the analytic capacity problem. The
third problem is regarding the question of regularity of minimizers of the
relaxed energy functional (introduced by Bethuel, Brezis, and Coron) which is
basically the usual Dirichlet energy plus a cost function on singularities. On
all three problems the PI has done a good deal of work (the third problem is
joint with R. Hardt) advancing the state of knowledge. Our program on the first
problem has met significant progress in the recent months exceeding the PI's
expectations and appears close to completion. Our work on the other two appears
to also be heading in direction of further progress as well.

The first problem addresses one of the most fundamental questions regarding the
geometrical properties of purely unrectifiable sets going back to Besicovitch's
two classic papers which established the foundation of the subject (1928, 1938).
These sets are fractal-like, appearing in several contexts in the physical world
and hence the sciences (e.g. dynamical systems, number theory etc.). Our work on
the problem has required finding new algorithms dealing with very general closed
sets, and we expect it to have an impact on the understanding of other related
geometrical questions of densities and rectifiability not to mention our
understanding of the properties of these natural sets.. Our second problem
combines geometry and harmonic analysis in a natural way, having impact on
several areas of analysis and also to Physics, where harmonic functions have a
special role (e.g. in electrostatics). Our third problem overlaps geometry,
topology, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory. It
addresses deep questions in its area. It is of special importance in the theory
of liquid crystals since the quantities being minimized are similar to the
energies of such physical systems
