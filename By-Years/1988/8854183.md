A workshop will be held at MIT during the summer of l988 to introduce faculty
from other institutions to the possibilities of enhancing the teaching of
undergraduate fluid mechanics with workstation based software. Twenty
participants will be introduced to this new media using software developed over
the past four years at MIT. The participants will be encouraged to think of new
uses and new approaches for the software, asked to develop problem sets, and
required to critique the workshop. The activity will expand to a national level
a collaboration of teachers which has started at MIT. In addition to the NSF
award, participants' institutions will contribute about 15% in travel funds
toward the cost of the project.
