The investigators continue work to develop numerical methods for solving
problems of flows in porous media and to develop and analyze fast algorithms for
partial differential equations, for computational fluid dynamics, and for
several linear algebra problems. Specifically, they (a) develop fast parallel
numerical methods for the solution of the Boltzmann equation used to model the
transport of neutral and charged particles in 1 and 3 spatial dimensions; (b)
develop multilevel zonal techniques for large scale computational fluid dynamics
applications on parallel computers; (c) study discretization and solution
techniques for fluid flows in porous media that involve complex geometry with
heterogeneous material properties; (d) develop a new methodology for the
solution of systems of partial differential equations by introducing new
dependent variables and forming a least-squares functional. In each case, they
exploit and extend multi-level computational techniques. These projects are
focused on important applications, such as calculating radiation doses for
cancer treatment, ion implantation for semiconductor development, global weather
modeling, fluid flow over airfoils and through rocket nozzles, oil recovery and
contaminant transport in subsurface water supplies. They reflect the growing
recognition that effective numerical modeling of physical phenomena involves
several stages - formulation of the mathematical model, transforming the model
into a discrete problem, and developing algorithms for the numerical solution of
the discrete problem on advanced computers - none of which should be attempted
without consideration for the others. Each project examines all components of
the process, reformulating the model and discretization when necessary to yield
discrete problems that can be efficiently solved numerically on parallel
computers.
