The 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International
Conference on Communications (ICC) is an IEEE Communications Society flagship
conference widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field.
Attending conferences such as ICC is beneficial for the professional development
of graduate and undergraduate students in the area of communications
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for students in the
United States to attend this conference. Since the conference will be virtual,
support to help pay for registration fees will be provided. It will help the
students be exposed to recent development in the field, and network with
professionals. This will in turn help build the next generation workforce in
communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
