This grant will support experimental research on the effect of compressibility
on mixing between co-flowing streams. Convective Mach numbers in the mixing
layers will vary from low to as high as 3. The geometrical features and their
evolution and interactions will be studied, with optical diagnostics including
planar Rayleigh scattering and planar laser-induced flurescence. Mixing between
two streams is known to be degraded at high relative flow velocites, but the
reason is not yet understood. Understanding and control of high speed mixing
layers is of crucial importance in combustion and propulsion systems.//
