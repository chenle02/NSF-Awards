This action provides funds for a feasibility project to the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Particulate Materials at the Pennsylvania State
University. Researchers in the center will collaborate with researchers in the
Queen's University , Belfast Northern Ireland to evaluate the phase development
and colloidal and interfacial chemistry of inorganic particles in ionic liquids.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that fundamentally new surface charge
models will be required to understand the solid-solution interface in inorganic
solid-ionic liquid systems. This will also underpin planned future research on
the colloidal stability and processing of bulk materials from particles prepared
in ionic liquids. &lt;br/&gt;
