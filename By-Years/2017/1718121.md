Research advances have enabled innovations in collaborative work information
systems that can keep track of employees and contractors in domains such as ride
sharing. For instance, after drivers login to begin a work session, riding
sharing computers keep track of cars, customers, and ride locations. Such
systems enable accurate payments to drivers and create work histories that are
shared among managers, drivers, and clients. In many other work domains, such as
home care, delivery, farm work, and child care, transparent collaborative
information systems do not exist, leaving work environments open to inaccurate
compensation, conflict over work requirements or behavior, or even exploitation.
This project will examine the needs of workers, employers, and managers for
collaborative and shared reporting, and opportunities for innovative technology
to create such systems. The project will lead to fundamental understanding of
collaboration in work information for traditional and new forms of work that
currently lack accurate and transparent measures of the work hours, effort, or
performance on which compensation is based. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
requires fundamental research and application development in three potential key
intervention areas: (1) technologies to enable worker education concerning
worker and employer rights and responsibilities; (2) systems that could collect
shared work data for workers, employers, and managers while protecting
individual privacy and confidentiality, and (3) empirical evaluations to assess
effectiveness as well as understand potential risks or undesirable indirect
consequences of work-related data collection. Researchers will prototype and
test these systems mainly in work environments, such as farm work, custodial
work, and restaurants services. The project will lead to a better understanding
of the potential for technology to help create better jobs for workers, and aid
managers and employers to create responsive, transparent, and equitable business
and work environments.
