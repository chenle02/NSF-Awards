Paleozoic metamorphism and deformation in the southern and central New England
Appalachians was complex and polyphaze, and attempts to separate and accurately
date tectonic episodes has been difficult. Recent determinations of diffision
rates of cations in several common minerals allow a mineral dating method to
resolve between protracted slow cooling and discrete later tectonic events in
this structurally complex region. The study will obtain Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic
data on coexisting minerals in high grade metaigneous gneisses and amphibolites
in order to determine the time of last recrystallization or initiation of
cooling following high temperature metamorphism. Detailed analyses employing
internal and external comparisons and mass balance considerations will permit
stringent evaluation of the technique, which is quite general and potentially
applicable to many other orogenic terranes. The results of this study will allow
features of middle Paleozoic and late Paleozoic orgination to be separated,
yielding a clearer understanding of major culminating events in the tectonic
development of the northern Appalachians and a improved information base for the
constructure of thermal models.
