This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop formulations of natural fatty and organic acids as alternatives to
traditional fungicides for the control of diseases in fruits such as grapes,
blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. In the course of this project, the
efficacy of these formulations as pre-harvest and post-harvest treatments for
disease control in a number of fruits will be determined. Replicated trials will
be conducted in the laboratory and on commercial and university farms. The
follow on Phase II project will incorporate more extensive field testing to
determine efficacy against a wider range of pathogens under various climatic
conditions.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of agriculture.
