This research concerns main areas of algorithms and complexity. In graph
isomorphism testing, a search for unifying sequential and parallel algorithms
solving efficiently several of the known tractable cases, in particular the
classes of graphs with bounded valence or eigenvalue multiplicity, will be
unitiated. In communication complexity, specific problems in the deterministic
and probabilistic models will be investigated. Besides the standard application
of communication complexity to the AT2 complexity in VLSI, this project will
also consider applications to lower bound problems. In learnabiliy theory, the
kearning of language classes for a variety of learning protocols will be
investigated. Possible extensions and their limitations of algorithms for
learning finite automata, Marcov chains, as well as deteministic one counter
automata will be considered.
