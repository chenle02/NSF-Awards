9413003 Parise The objective of this work is to make novel microporous thio and
thio-oxide frameworks using chemical strategies based on organic templates and
by varying the reaction conditions. The proposal will explore the role of cation
exchanges as a framework modifier designed to produce materials capable of
trapping and controlling the release of gases from sieves. %%% The synthesis and
characterization of open crystalline structures possessing regularly spaced
pores and channels are of high relevance to industry in strategic areas as
varied as chemical separations, catalysis, ion exchange, and ion conductivity.
Selected members of this class of materials find applications in areas such as
environmental pollution, oil refining, and biosensors for the health sciences.
