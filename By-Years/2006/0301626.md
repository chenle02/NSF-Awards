This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Iron and nitrogren metabolism in a
coastal diatom." These studies use the pubically-available genome sequence for
the coastal diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to explore the cellular and
molecular basis for the relationship between iron and nitrogen metabolism in
this organism and in the plankton community in coastal upwelling regions.
Patterns of gene expression under various iron and nitrogen growth conditions
are being determined using DNA microarrays.
