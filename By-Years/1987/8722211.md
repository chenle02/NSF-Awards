This project will evaluate the use of supercomputers to solve large
mathematical programming (MP) problems. Specifically, experimental codes will be
written to implement and evaluate in practice the vector/parallel techniques
identified as promising in the Phase I report. These codes will be written for
the Cray X-MP and the IBM 3090 Vector facility and will evaluate techniques
usable in either or both of the simplex and interior point (barrier) methods.
The research aims for an understanding of the capabilities and requirements of
large-scale vector processors, in efficiently carrying out the extensive vector
and (especially sparse) matrix calculations associated with real MP models.
