The solar wind plasma within 20 Ro will be studied using a variety of radio
propagation techniques. This will permit estimation of the spatial spectrum of
density fluctuations, the mean flow velocity, its random component and the
orientation of the magnetic field. These measurements will be compared with
optical data, such as white light coronograph, magnetograph, and emission line
observations. The basic objectives will be to learn more about the mechanism of
coronal heating and the flow of energy near the critical point, and to study the
coronal origin of large scale structures such as fast streams. Within 20 Ro
earlier observations have shown a rapid increase in random velocity, excess
power in density fluctuations on scales of 10 to 300 km, and density
fluctuations which become highly isotropic. This study will measure the
acceleration of the particles through the sonic point using multiple antenna
intensity scintillations. The spatial anisotropy as a function of spatial scale
will be measured by comparing angular scattering (measured at the VLA) with
phase scintillation (measured with the VLBA). The intensity scintillations will
be analyzed to learn the origin of the random velocity component. Finally,
observations within 20 Ro can be compared with surface measurements more
accurately than those further from the sun because the mapping distance is small
and stream-stream interactions are much less important. A study will be made to
determine the difference in the flow field between regions of different magnetic
geometry.
