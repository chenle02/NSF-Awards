Permafrost temperatures are an extremely sensitive indicator of climatic change.
Changes too small to be detected by continuous measurements of the surface
energy budget occur as clear and robust changes in permafrost temperature
profiles. This award supports research to allow rational utilization of
permafrost temperature data and to improve current interpretations of permafrost
temperature profiles. These tasks require a better understanding of the
influence of the active layer and snow cover on the thermal regime of
permafrost. The research program consists of field and laboratory measurements,
interpretation, and modeling the thermal response of permafrost to changes in
climate. This research will be conducted at four established sites along the
Haul Road between the Brooks Range and Prudhoe Bay. Measurements will include
daily temperatures at eleven levels from the air 1/2m or more into the
permafrost, annual permafrost temperatures to depths of 80m, in situ and
laboratory measurements of thermal and other properties of the numerical model
for predicting temperatures at all levels. This continuing research effort is
necessary to develop an understanding of climatic change that has occurred and
may be occurring in the permafrost areas of Alaska and the north polar region.
