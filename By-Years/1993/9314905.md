The objective of this project is to develop a unified framework for modeling,
expressing and efficiently supporting semantic concepts and constraints required
for building the next generation of intelligent information systems. The
proposed unification will include non-determinism in deductive rules and active
rules for databases, non monotonic logic and common-sense reasoning. The project
goals will achieved through the collaborative of leading research teams who are
currently active in these areas in the U.S. and Europe. Dissemination of the
research results will be through scholarly publications and a major
international workshop organized in the second year of the project. Specific
research tasks will address.
