This is a project to evaluate the incidence and patterning of mechanical and
nutritional stress as a consequence of European contact in Native American
populations from the Great Lakes region. Samples will be drawn from
archaeologically-derived human skeletal and dental material from Michigan and
western New York State, representing precontact (Late Prehistoric) and
postcontact (Early Historic) time periods. Using non-invasive computerized
tomography, variation in bone mineral density will be assessed. In addition,
incidence of dental caries, attrition, and enamel hypoplasia will be examined as
measures of nutritional quality. These data will be used to determine whether
changes in dietary quality as a result of European contact led to nutritional
and/or mechanical stress as reflected in the teeth and skeleton.
