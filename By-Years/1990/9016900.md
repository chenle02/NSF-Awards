For the last two decades the emphasis in magnetospheric physics has been to
understand what role the interplanetary magnetic field plays in determining the
energy transfer from the solar wind. This emphasis has been justified because of
the magnitude of the effect. However, as a result, many of the factors governing
geomagnetic activity have been overlooked., This grant will look at several of
these important factors including 1) the effects of solar wind dynamic pressure
variations upon the magnetosphere, 2) the effects of solar wind electric and
magnetic fields upon the magnetosphere, and 3) predicting solar wind parameters
from ground observations.
