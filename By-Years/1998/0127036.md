Engineering - Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is modeled on
successful existing implementations of undergraduate robotics efforts at MIT and
Swarthmore, but with a specific emphasis on the freshman and sophomore
experience. The investigators are purchasing equipment to develop and implement
the Laboratory for Undergraduate Robotics Education (LURE), permitting them to
develop new, technologically advanced laboratory space for undergraduate
education. The laboratory allows them to change to a mode of teaching that
provides analysis, design, and manufacturing skills in a robotics setting. The
equipment requested also permits them to inject engineering content with a
hands-on laboratory component into the curriculum at an early stage (freshman
year). This provides some perspective and motivation to beginning students, who
currently receive the impression that engineering consists only of theoretical
physics and mathematics. In the evaluation study, they are investigating how the
differences in background preparation and training of incoming students affect
development for high-tech courses related to robotics. They are developing and
disseminating robotic-related curricular materials for use both in
interdisciplinary college-level education, as well as K-12 outreach
programs.&lt;br/&gt;
