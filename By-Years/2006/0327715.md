Diverse data sets will be compared and contrasted in order to investigate how
solar Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) evolve in transit between the sun and the
earth. Preliminary results have found a possible relationship between flare-
associated CMEs and observed enhanced abundances of different charge states of
oxygen ions in the solar wind plasma. This finding will be extended through a
statistical study comparing rates of occurrence of related heliospheric and
solar phenomena. These objectives will be accomplished by taking observations of
individual CMEs as they originate at the sun, and, by using velocity
measurements, determining if ejected material is present at spacecraft at the
expected arrival time. Events of this nature will be compared on a one-on-one
basis to determine how individual features of CMEs in the solar corona and in
the heliosphere are interrelated.
