Professor Keating will work on the Igusa tower that arise in the theory of
modular curves, the action of the automorphism group of certain formal groups
defined on the moduli space of deformations and finally to characterize the
fields arising from formal groups obtained by deformations. This project falls
into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the
oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has
proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
