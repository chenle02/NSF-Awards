This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is developing an
innovative flexible photovoltaic technology based on n-copper indium diselenide
(n-CIS). Phase I research devised a new approach to synthesize large-grained
films, and a new device configuration with only 3 layers on a metal foil. The
research also devised a simple 4-step fabrication method for the n-CIS
photovoltaic cell. This process uses high throughput, high yield roll-to-roll
electrodeposition on a continuous metal foil. The n-CIS photovoltaic technology
will evolve into a stable and efficient flexible prototype device in Phase II,
with pilot line production in Phase III.

The research will lead to an affordable, non-polluting, renewable n-CIS PV
technology to meet the growing demand in the global energy market. Its
applications include: remote industrial and recreational power, off-grid and
grid-tied residential and commercial power, generation systems, central power
plants, spacecraft and satellites. Technology commercialization will make a
tangible contribution to the nation's energy supply, the environment and the
welfare of the society.
