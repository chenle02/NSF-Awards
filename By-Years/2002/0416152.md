Why do some places have more species than others? What causes one place to have
a different set of species to another? These questions have fascinated
biologists for decades and it seems that both current interactions and
evolutionary history play a role. This project combines evidence on paleo-
ecology, genetic and community diversity to examine the effects of Pleistocene
climate change on the frogs and lizards species of the tropical rainforests of
north-eastern Australia. Previous research has shown that these rainforests
contracted under cold, dry periods of the late Pleistocene and that the
rainforest-dependent vertebrates underwent range changes and extinctions at
varying scales. It is predicted that species most restricted to montane
rainforests and with the narrowest current climatic range have been the most
sensitive to rainforest fluctuations. This hypothesis will be tested using a
combination of molecular evidence, species' distribution data and ecological
modeling and with particular attention to three guilds - stream-breeding frogs,
terrestrial-breeding microhylid frogs and forest-floor skinks. By showing how
individual species responded to past climate change, the project will shed light
on why rainforest communities have so many species and vary so much from place
to place. By increasing our understanding of how history and current ecology
interact, the results will improve prediction of biodiversity in other diverse,
but less well known tropical biotas. As these and other montane species are
expected to be threatened by global warming, knowing which taxa were sensitive
to past climate change and why will help to form plans for conservation.
