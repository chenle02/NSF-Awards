This award supports the Fourth Annual Graduate Student Conference in Algebra,
Geometry, and Topology, to be held on June 2-3, 2018 at Temple University. The
conference will bring together around 100 graduate students at all levels and
from a variety of backgrounds and universities, along with four distinguished
plenary speakers that work at the interface of algebra, geometry, and topology.
The conference provides a rare opportunity for a large number of early career
mathematicians with similar research interests to come together and develop
mathematical relationships. In addition, this conference strongly supports
interactions between graduate students from different schools, different
backgrounds, and different research areas. This gives graduate students the
chance to make connections with mathematicians outside of their respective
universities and fields of study.

Graduate students will be able to establish these relationships by presenting
their work, discussing ideas and asking questions after talks and during social
events, and interacting with the plenary speakers. The majority of the talks
will be given by graduate students, supplying them with opportunities to
practice presenting their research ideas and interests to fellow students. The
conference will strive to include a wide range of topics and a variety of
speakers, including under-represented minorities in the field, both as
participants and speakers. In addition, talks by distinguished plenary speakers
will provide insights into how different parts of algebra, geometry, and
topology are connected, open research questions of interest, and recent
techniques used in groundbreaking work in these fields. Moreover, the organizing
committee is driven by the participation of Temple graduate students with
faculty support and guidance, providing the students with several professional
development opportunities.
