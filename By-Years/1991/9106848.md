The Principal Investigator will study possible mechanisms involved in the
formation and spatial distribution of tooth primordia. The preliminary model
will be closely based on experimental evidence from alligators Alligator
mississippiensis and the known properties of cells. The case for the alligator
as a model for research in craniofacial development is convincingly made by
Ferguson (1981). In particular the PI's aim to reproduce a specific pattern,
namely the positions and initiation sequence of the first seven teeth in the
right half lower jaw of the alligator. The model will be a quantitative
realization of a caricature of the descriptive model for tooth formation in
Alligator mississippiensis described by Westergaard and Ferguson (1987). The
mathematical model will involve a system of nonlinear coupled partial
differential equations describing both the mechanical properties of the
epithelial and mesenchymal cells as well as the reaction and diffusion of
various chemicals. Thus, the model will include elements of both the reaction-
diffusion and the mechanochemical approaches to pattern formation, and will
incorporate tissue interaction processes. In the modelling the emphasis will be
on the greatest possible biological realism at the expense of mathematical
simplicity.
