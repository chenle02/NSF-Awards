8900410 Kelly This project concerns the design, analysis and implementation of
Newton-like methods for nonlinear equations and optimization problems in
function spaces. Examples of such problems include differential and integral
equations and optimal control problems. Particular emphasis is placed upon
extensions of the method of sequential quadratic programming to parameter
identification problems, the harmonic balance method in circuit simulation, mesh
independent globally convergent methods, and design of algorithms specifically
for advanced computer architectures.
