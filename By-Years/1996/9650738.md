Using the emerging technologies of the multimedia and World Wide Web, faculty
in the Department of Sociology are enhancing instruction in four important
areas: (1) ethnographic research and interpretation; (2) impact of digital
technology on social interactions; (3) sociological data analysis and
visualization; and (4) geodemographic trends and analyses. All faculty involved
with this project are experienced in the specialized areas they intend to pursue
through this project. This project focuses on creating a shared multimedia
laboratory that enables faculty members to further upgrade integration of these
technologies into college-level instruction while building on one another's
expertise. To date, the department has already initiated courses that use video
cameras and lap top computers to enhance ethnographic research and instruction;
analyze the impact of technology on human and machine interactions; and use
computer mapping systems to link demographic trends to specific geographic
neighborhoods. Some multimedia instructional materials are already in use at the
college, including multimedia ethnographic accounts, statistical analysis
software, electronic library research data resources, and demographic maps. Some
of these are already available on the World Wide Web, and others are being
prepared for distribution on the Web and CD-ROM. This project enables five
sociology faculty to fully implement their plans to integrate this technology
into their courses and to disseminate more interactive and multimedia sociology
on the Web and on CD-ROM. Working together, faculty can create a sequence of
courses that makes use of this technology, enhances instruction, and empowers
students in the social sciences.
