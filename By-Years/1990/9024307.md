Dr. Chandler is investigating the control of gene expression in different cell
types and at different developmental stages, by studying the regulated
expression of the genes required for anthocyanin biosynthesis in maize. The long
term goals are to understand how the regulatory gene, B coordinately regulates
the pathway in a tissue-and developmental-specific manner and to determine the
molecular mechanisms of B paramutation. This proposal fulfills the FAW
objectives which are 1) to recognize outstanding and promising women scientists
and engineers in academic careers of research and teaching and 2) to facilitate
the further development of their careers.***//
