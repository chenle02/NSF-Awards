A local area network (LAN) of computer workstations serves the undergraduate
programs in Natural Science and Engineering by allowing a new approach to
education that focuses on the technology of the future. The LAN facililty
enables: 1) 'Hands-on' interactive methods, 2) tutorials or guidance for
enrichment or acceleration, 3) extensive undergraduate experience in state-of-
the-art hardware and software, 4) individual student project applications. The
grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF
award.
