This proposal seeks funding for an advanced network connection in order to
facilitate research and education in the areas of real-time surfzone wave,
current and morphology observations, impacts of mesoscale processes on
biogeochemical fluxes in the North Atlantic, topics in the role of the Arctic
Ocean, organic geochemistry of subsurface gas flow, and subsurface sensing and
imaging systems. In addition, this award will enable new projects in the areas
of a 10 Gigabit per second network on the seafloor around the Juan de Fuca plate
(offshore Oregon and Washington), a Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory, and
the temporal and spatial dependence of broadband ambient seismic noise.
