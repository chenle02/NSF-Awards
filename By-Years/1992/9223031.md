This conference, "This Transcription Machine: Structures and Functions" will be
held in Austin, TX from April 2-4, 1993 meeting will cover areas such as how
DNA-Protein and protein-protein interactions lead to assembly of functional
transcription complexes, how long-range interactions permit recognition between
various transcription factors, and the genetic and developmental consequences of
transcriptional control. NSF funds will be used to support travel of young and
minority scientists to attend the meeting. %%% This conference covers an
important and rapidly developing field. The format and setting of the conference
provides a good environment for interaction of young scientists with established
investigators in the field.
