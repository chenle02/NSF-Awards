This project will establish an optimized imaging system that can achieve three
dimensional imaging at 1-nm spatial resolution and will allow a comprehensive
investigation of photophysical properties of DNA. This advance will allow the
achievement of nanoscopic DNA imaging in living cells without extrinsic labeling
under natural conditions. &lt;br/&gt;The PIs are actively involved in several
excellent outreach programs, including the Boys and Girls Club of Chicago, the
Young Leadership Charter School, and the Poster Fair to promote local high
school students to STEM programs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting new
technology, spectroscopic photon localization microscopy (SPLM), was recently
discovered by the PI and Co-PI where native DNA fluoresces and blinks under low
level visible light excitation. This technology overcomes the limitations in
traditional super-resolution microscopy technologies and opens new opportunities
for studying biological macromolecules (such as proteins and DNA) without the
need for labeling in a live cell environment. The potential for scientific
discovery is significant and the impact broad.
