ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;01 February 2013&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1333564&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;PI: C.
Reimers&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: D. Bailey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests
funding for design and construction of NSF?s Regional Class Research Vessel
(RCRV) with Oregon State University as the Lead Institution for up to a three-
ship construction effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The science
tool kit has evolved dramatically since the last Regional Class ships were
delivered in the early 1980's. The interdisciplinary oceanography community now
routinely employs a wide range of sophisticated instrumentation (acoustics,
optical sensors, video, high speed data links, specialized nets and corers)
deployed in a variety of ways (ship-mounted, lowering on ropes and cables,
Remotely Operated Vehicle and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) and geared toward
multiple scales of interest. The new class of Regional vessels will include
state-of-the-art design features and equipment for enhanced investigation of the
present and emerging coastal science themes. These capabilities are simply not
available on the older Regional vessels due to their age and physical
configuration. &lt;br/&gt;Along with the R/V Sikuliaq, the RCRV project
represents NSF?s inter-agency commitment to Academic Fleet modernization.
