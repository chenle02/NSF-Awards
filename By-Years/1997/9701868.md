This proposal will develop quanitative global maps of the distribution of high
latitude field-aligned currents parameterized by IMF orientation and strength,
and by season. This will be the first investigation to revisit this issue since
the original maps were produced from TRIAD data over 20 years ago. Much has been
learned since that time and the data will be treated more correctly in terms of
binning. In addition, a new analysis technique will be utilized which consideres
both horizontal components of the magnetic perturbation observed at the
satellite, This will allow a relaxation of the assumption of the "infinite
current sheet" model for the interpretation of the data.
