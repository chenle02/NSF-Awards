EIA -0215531&lt;br/&gt;Krim, Hamid&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Workshop Proposal: Genomic Signal
Processing and Statistics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for a Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing ands Statistics (GENSIPS).
The workshop is being held October 12 and 13, 2002, near the North Carolina
State University campus. The goals of the workshop are 1) to identify potential
areas of research collaboration between the biological, statistical and signal
processing communities and 2) to explore potential new avenues of research in
genetics by exploiting synergies in research between signal processing,
statistics, and genonomics. The workshop brings together a diverse set of
outstanding researchers from each of these areas to address the challenges of
the multidisciplinary area of genomics. Twelve internationally known researchers
are presenting plenary and invited talks and the workshop also features poster
sessions and round-table discussions of the key topics.&lt;br/&gt;
