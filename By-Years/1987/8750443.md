The Physics Department at SUNY College at Buffalo will develop a videotape-
computer assisted laboratory in mechanics and wave motion for students in
introductory physics. This novel laboratory experience (which involves
videotaping physics laboratory experiments and "real world" experiments that
cannot be directly performed in the classroom) will allow the student to gather
data and to learn at his or her own rate in an interactive mode. The equipment
consists of Macintosh computers, video cameras, and recorders. Students will
make detailed measurements on successive video frames using the computer and
analyse the motion which has been recorded. It is expected that this project
will enable students to better appreciate and learn physics.
