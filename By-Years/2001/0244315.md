The dynamical behavior of the outer solar heliosphere and the termination shock
will be studied in the context of unsteady magnetohydrodynamic theory and
supplemented by a nearly continuous record of plasma measurements from the
Voyager spacecraft. The specific problems to be addressed are, (i) the radial
evolution and interaction of very large high-speed solar wind streams near the
maximum phase of Solar Cycle 23, and (ii) the effects of latitudinal variations
and interactions of the variable solar wind on the position of the termination
shock. The formalism treats the interstellar pickup protons and solar wind
protons as two distinct fluid species, and it employs the appropriate Rankine-
Hugoniot relations to calculate the jump conditions across the shock
discontinuities. In this manner, one may accurately calculate the expansion of
the solar wind, the interaction between neighboring fluid elements through wave
processes, and the interaction of shocks with other shocks and stream
structures.
