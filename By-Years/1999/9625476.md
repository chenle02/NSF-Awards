DMS 9625476 McCulloch The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) generalizes the
standard linear model in three ways: accommodation of non-normally distributed
responses, specification of a possibly nonlinear link between the mean of a
response and the predictors, and allowance for some forms of correlation in the
data. Unfortunately, standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation are
computationally difficult for GLMMs and hence a number of alternate approaches
have been proposed. This research will develop two approaches to inference for
GLMMs: 1) computationally-intensive simulation-based methods for maximum
likelihood estimation, and 2) methods based on "joint-maximization" ideas. The
joint maximization methods will be viewed as a set of generalized estimating
equations for the purpose of theoretical evaluation and improvement. The new
approaches will be evaluated and compared to extant methods. Generalized linear
mixed models are an important and broadly applicable set of statistical models
for the analysis of data. For example, they can be used to model repeated counts
of animals through time at fixed sampling locations for the purpose of
environmental assessment. They are applicable to data which are gathered in a
wide variety of formats and are capable of modelling data exhibiting
associations. Association in the above example would arise because repeated data
values at a single location would be similar. Failure to incorporate such
associations can lead to incorrect conclusions from the analysis of data.
Unfortunately, the use of generalized linear mixed models has been limited due
to computational difficulties and the lack of availability of well-tested
parameter estimation methods which have known performance characteristics. This
research will develop two approaches to the analysis of such data and evaluate
their performance, both in absolute terms and in relation to extant methods.
