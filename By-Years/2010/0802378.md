Interdisciplinary (99)

This project is developing a rubric to assess criminal investigation skills
across content specialties (such as law enforcement and Homeland Security), a
curriculum that expands related degree programs -- including two criminal
investigation-related certifications, and a career ladder that builds 2+2+2
articulation agreements.

The criminal investigation rubric assesses understanding of science and
technology as it relates to: investigation, interview and interrogation,
forensic biology, forensic imaging, crime and incident mapping, homeland
defense, computer forensics, hazardous materials, geo-spatial, private security,
and homicide analysis. Curriculum materials being developed incorporate topics
in technology-intensive subjects in investigations, interoperability, and
intelligence. They include the preparation of three online courses: Forensic
Psychology I, Introduction to Intelligence, and Crime Prevention Through
Environmental Design. The two certifications being prepared are "Crime Mapping
and Analysis" and "Intelligence Analysis".

This project serves diverse and underserved segments of the population,
particularly in rural areas and in tribal communities and regions in Minnesota
and North and South Dakota.
