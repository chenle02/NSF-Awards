Sexual differentiation of the brain and behavior results from internal and
environmental cues influencing the expression of genes. Through studies in a
variety of systems, it is becoming clear that different mechanisms can affect
this differentiation and often lead to similar patterns of behavioral
expression. The mechanisms by which reproductive hormones influence the sexual
differentiation of brain and behavior are well researched, but those by which
environmental cues exert their influence are less well understood. &lt;br/&gt;
Bluehead wrasses, found in coral reefs, change their sex from females to males
on becoming the dominant members of their social groups. Male behavior develops
immediately, and functional testes develop within ten days. Importantly, the
behavioral parts of this sex change can even occur in females whose ovaries have
been removed. The goal of this project is to better characterize behavioral and
gene expression changes induced by social interactions and steroid hormones
during sex change. The first study will compare the expression of estrogen
receptors and a key estrogen-producing enzyme across the sexes and sex change.
The second study will contrast patterns of gene expression in the brain across
the sexes and sex change using genomic tools (microarrays). Finally, gonadal and
social influences on gene expression will be experimentally separated during sex
change to assess their separate and combined effects. &lt;br/&gt; This project
should identify key gene expression influences of social interactions on the
nervous system and mechanisms underlying sexual and aggressive behavior.
Aggressive behavior has enormous societal costs and a better understanding of
social influences on the neural substrates of aggression is needed. Also, the
increasing importance of aquaculture in the United States makes a better
understanding of the control of sexual behavior and reproduction in fishes
critical. Finally, this project will provide valuable training for graduate and
undergraduate students in the integrated study of behavior, neuroendocrinology,
and genomic biology.&lt;br/&gt;
