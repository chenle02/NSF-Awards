This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use RNA
interference (RNAi) to limit damage to corn from the plant parasite lesion
nematode by silencing genes in the parasite. Phase I demonstrated in culture
that expression of specific double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) from lesion genes
limited nematode reproduction and increased root mass. In Phase II, validated
constructs will be progressed to whole plant transformation. Transgenic plants
with expression of the dsRNAs will be tested in greenhouse assays for control of
lesion nematode. In parallel, the validated laboratory assays validated will be
used to select next-generation constructs. Success in Phase II research will
justify a field trial program.

The broader impact of this research is to increase corn yields by
commercializing a biotechnology trait for control of lesion nematode.
Agriculture is under tremendous pressure to achieve improved yields and ensure
the availability of crops. A major limitation on crop are parasites that damage
root systems causing annual yield losses valued at $8 billion in the U.S.
Currently available nematicides are toxic. In corn, there are no genetic sources
of nematode resistance. Using RNAi, we aim to create biotechnology traits that
provide season-long resistance to lesion nematode. Benefits to this approach for
the grower include increased yield, increased tolerance to drought and stress,
decreased input cost and preservation of soil microenvironment. Benefits for
consumers include increased availability of corn and enhanced food and
environmental safety.
