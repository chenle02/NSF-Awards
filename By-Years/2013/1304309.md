To improve our understanding of historical and modern extreme temperatures,
researchers at Harvard University will analyze instrumental and temperature-
sensitive proxies of past climate using new statistical approaches.
Specifically, the researchers will explore the relationships between
instrumental and proxy indicators of extremes, reconstruct temperature extremes
in space and time, and provide a better understanding of how changes in mean
climate relate to the occurrences of extreme events. The analysis strategy is to
extend an existing Bayesian methodology for inferring past climate to more
directly target extremes. Definition of "extremes" will meet the standards set
forth by the National Research Council in 2006 for accurate quantification of
the probability that quantities such as maxima, minima, or rates-of-change are
truly exceptional.

Extremes are by definition rare, making the need for records longer than are
afforded by instruments alone perhaps even more acute than for evaluation of
mean climate. Successful completion of this project will provide insight into
the co-variability between background climate and extremes over a time period
long enough to establish baseline conditions. The work will also provide
important context in which to interpret and assess modern changes. Given that
disparate mechanisms are responsible for warming and cooling over the last 600
hundred years, this research will also indicate the extent to which past
relationships between mean climate and extremes can be used as analogues for
future changes.

In addition to the societal relevance of better understanding extreme events,
other broader impacts include training of a graduate student and support of an
early career researcher with no prior NSF support. All software tools developed
during this research will be made freely and publicly available to the
paleoclimate community, as will any compilations of publicly available data
sets.
