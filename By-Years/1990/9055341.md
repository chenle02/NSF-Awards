This four-week summer workshop sponsored by Texas A&M University will provide
an intensive course in psychology for 32 teachers who will be offering the new
AP psychology program. The course will cover all areas typically included in a
college introductory psychology course, with particular emphasis on research
methods, in neuropsychology, cognition, and sensation/perception. Additional
coverage will include demonstrations, experiments, simulations, and other
activities that can be used to illustrate the principles and phenomena of
psychology; the development and utilization of a microcomputer laboratory as an
adjunct to or as a significant part of the high school course; making the
psychology of gender and ethnicity a significant part of the introductory
course; the format and content of the AP exam; and information on planning in-
service activities, including production of a model in-service program for
honors psychology. Staff for the summer workshop consists of high school and
college psychology teachers selected for their content expertise, their
excellence in teaching, and their skills in in-service training. Matchinig funds
from the schools and Texas A&M University are 14% of the NSF grant.
