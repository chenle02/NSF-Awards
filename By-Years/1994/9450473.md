This research includes a study of two enzymes, the redoxyendonuclease and
formamidopyrimidine/8-oxyguanine-DNA glycosylase, which initiate the repair of
oxidative base damages in the DNA. The levels of both enzymes will be quantified
by biochemical assays in extracts of rat kidney tissue subjected to
physiological oxidant stress as compared to the undamaged kidney tissue from the
same animal as well as untreated controls. The results of these studies will
lead to a better understanding of the induction of DNA repair activities in
response to oxidative DNA damage and provide a basis for future studies on the
fundamental mechanisms underlying free radical-mediated damage in animal
tissues. Interactive activities include: teaching a revised graduate level
pharmacology course with emphasis on molecular biology principles and
techniques; organizing a panel discussion focusing on the differences in which
men and women conduct science; and offering a recombinant DNA technology short
course to undergraduate and graduate students as well as interested faculty.
