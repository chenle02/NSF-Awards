Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0438714&lt;br/&gt;Zena M. Ariola&lt;br/&gt;University of
Oregon &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to organize a summer school on Software
Security: Theory and Practice. The aim of the&lt;br/&gt;school is to prepare
graduate students, academic and industrial people to conduct research on this
topic,&lt;br/&gt;which is very important since more and more of our economy,
defense, government and social life is online.&lt;br/&gt;The curriculum will
include basic foundational material for all attendees; advanced material for
those&lt;br/&gt;interested in new research directions; and presentation of
applications . In more detail, we will present three&lt;br/&gt;types of
material:&lt;br/&gt;1. Security Principles and Foundational Theory This will
provide an introduction to the essential&lt;br/&gt;concepts and
methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;2. Advanced Techniques for Software Security This
material will consists of more recent results in&lt;br/&gt;the area of language-
based security.&lt;br/&gt;3. Theory, in Practice This will demonstrate how
theoretical results can be used by practitioners in&lt;br/&gt;dealing with
security problems.
