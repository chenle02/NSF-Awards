Narrative: Mammalian cell-culture products have led the way to new approaches in
medical therapeutics and diagnostics. The major stumbling block to the wide-
scale use of this methodology is the cost of producing the products. This
proposal intends to attack the economic problems in this infant field, via
applied mathematics. Phase I of this project initiated efforts toward developing
a quantitative model of mammalian cell that hopefully will provide a rational
and cost-effective basis for reactor design, operation, control and scale-up for
mammalian cell-culture processes. The proposed work intends to further develop
the present model and experimentally validate it to enhance the capability for
prediction of performance of novel bioreactor design and operation strategies.
