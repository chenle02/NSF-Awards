Workshop: Issues in Teaching Computational Linguistics,at the ACL:HLT 2008
Conference The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary
international organization in the field of natural language processing and
language engineering. The ACL's annual conference is the major international
meeting in the field.

NSF support subsidizes travel,conference, and housing expenses of researchers
selected to participate in The Third Workshop on Issues in Teaching
Computational Linguistics, held during the joint ACL on 19th to 20th June 2008
in Columbus, Ohio.

Intellectual merit

The primary challenge addressed in this workshop is that of working out what is
necessary in order for computational linguists to communicate and collaborate
effectively across disciplinary boundaries, and then to articulate principles
for the design of curricular materials and pedagogical strategies for fostering
this collaboration in the classroom. Participants will discuss these issues at
the workshop, and carry the results back to their home instititutions for
practical validation.

Broader impacts

The workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a community of
scholarship about teaching in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Processing. The panel sessions and paper presentations are designed, in part, to
disseminate experiences about the strategy and tactics of teaching to the
audience that will be most able to use them, in part, to elicit suggestions from
industrial, government and academic employers about the unmet needs they
perceive for training and education.
