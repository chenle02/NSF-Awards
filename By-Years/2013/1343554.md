The goal of the project is to further develop a commercialization a nonlinear
estimation platform technology for applications involving target state
estimation. Nonlinear estimation is a widely pervasive enabling technology. Some
current algorithms either require specific mathematical characteristics of the
underlying model or suffer from robustness issues. In applications involving
target state estimation (target tracking), these approaches can lead to poor
terminal accuracy and sub-optimal tracking performance. The innovation of the
proposed project lies in an algorithm for nonlinear estimation that may provide
more accurate results with less computational overhead. In target state
estimation applications, existing solutions have difficulty tracking targets
that exhibit nonlinear and uncertain motion. These algorithms are successfully
able to address these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing accuracy and
speed for nonlinear estimation at lower computational cost could benefit many
applications and industries. The National Defense would benefit from increased
radar, laser, and satellite tracking accuracy. Financial firms could make better
derivatives models and trading decisions. Applied to robotic vision, autonomous
vehicles could navigate more accurately and assembly robots could spot more
defects. Software tools based on these algorithms have a potential to impact a
number of application areas both in military and civilian domain: Application
areas of interest in the military domain include Air Moving Target Indicator
(AMTI) and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) systems deployed in
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) operations. Civilian
applications include air traffic surveillance, weather surveillance, ground
mapping, geophysical surveys, remote sensing, autonomous navigation and
robotics.
