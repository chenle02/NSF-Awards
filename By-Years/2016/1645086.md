As a means to provide centralized services for students in undergraduate
mathematics courses, many institutions of higher education house units sometimes
known as "mathematics support centers". Examples of the valuable services
provided by such centers include tutoring, advising, and peer mentoring. To
provide a forum for directors of such centers to share best practices and ideas
for maximally effective impact, this project will host two annual working
meetings for 20-30 directors of such centers and facilitate continued
discussions during the year in between the meetings. Participants in the
meetings will identify challenges faced by the centers and solutions implemented
successfully. This project will provide the foundation for these professionals
to engage in a continuous improvement model, learning from the structures and
services determined through practice and assessment to be highly
effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The working meetings will adapt a workshop model
used successfully by the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM), adopting the
AIM goal of "organize groups of people to set in motion activity that will lead
to large-scale advances in the subject". The overall goal of this project's
working meetings is to lay the foundation for collaborations between directors
of mathematics support centers and researchers in mathematics education. To this
end, the workshops will result in an annotated list of priority topic areas and
a possible education research agenda.
