Microscopic algae growing on stones provide the food base for most of the
animals living in streams. Because these algae cannot move out of the way, they
are exposed to grazing by aquatic insects and snails, and dislodgement during
floods. Such loss of algae can limit the food supply in streams but, luckily,
algal re-growth is rapid, in part because of outgrowth from algae protected in
the crevices of streambed stones. Using a series of field and greenhouse
experiments, this research examines how algae protected in crevices augment the
food supply of the stream ecosystem and speed the re-growth of algae after
floods. The prevalence of crevice-dwelling algae will be assessed in a field
survey measuring the abundance of algae in crevice refuges in Western US
streams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will expand our ecological
understanding of how protected algae subsidize stream ecosystems, and help
explain the high production and fast recovery of streams. These ideas and others
will be incorporated into an expanding outreach program, in which graduate and
undergraduate students present in hands-on biology programs for elementary
students, both in the classroom and in after-school programs. These programs
contribute to science literacy in children and teach advanced students how to
effectively communicate science.&lt;br/&gt;
