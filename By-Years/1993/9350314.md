9350314 Aelion This is an award to support research the objective of which is to
study the decontamination of groundwater by enhancement of microbial activities
in aquifers undergoing decontamination procedures. The investigator plans on
assessing microbial contributions to contaminant removal at field sites being
subjected to different types of bioremediation procedures and comparing the
results obtained from different contaminated sites. This is the initial
increment of an award to provide support for this project. The investigator has
been designated as a Presidential Faculty Fellow. The nomination for this award
was made in accord with criteria contained in the FY 1993 Presidential Faculty
