The Connecticut College NSF Math and Computer Science Scholarship Program has
three primary objectives: to enhance both the quantity and quality of students
entering our existing math and computer science program, especially those from
underrepresented minorities such as women and students of color; to increase
retention of students who are enrolled in the math and computer science programs
through extensive support services and through programs which increase the
knowledge and skills of the students; and to expand the number of high school
students considering math and computer science as career options by encouraging
the scholarship students to become leaders and role models.

The scholarship program specifically targets high school students, especially
women and ethnic and racial minorities, with an interest in or an aptitude for
math and computer science. Students in this program are mentored by faculty
advisors in their field and by alumni or others in the local community with
related careers. The students obtain applied skills through participation in
internships, independent studies, and math practicums. In addition, they present
results of their work at conferences, open houses, and to others outside the
department. They learn leadership and teaching skills through work-study
appointments in the Math and Computer Science Help Centers or in Information
Services, as well as from the experience of mentoring incoming students.
Finally, students in this program are guided toward appropriate job placement or
graduate school by career counselors.
