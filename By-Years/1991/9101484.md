This project is concerned with several aspects of the representation theory of
semisimple algebraic groups over fields of prime characteristic, with
applications to finite groups of Lie type. Recent ideas of Lusztig relating
quantum groups and modular representations will be explored, with emphasis on
injective modules. Representations arising from the cohomology of line bundles
on flag varieties will be another central issue; a major question here concerns
the relationship with Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the affine Weyl group. The
study of algebraic groups should provide further insight into representations of
associated finite simple groups; here a number of open questions and conjectures
about injective modules and decomposition behavior mod p of ordinary characters
will be studied. This research is in the general area of algebraic groups. The
proposed research falls under two broad headings: cohomology of line bundles on
flag varieties, and injective modules. Advances along these lines would both
shed light on Lusztig's conjecture, as well as point the way beyond it.
