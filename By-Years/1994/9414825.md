This award will provide funding for the renovation of biology research and
research training laboratories on the campus of La Sierra University. The
Department of Biology is housed in Palmer Hall, a 41 year old structure that has
never been renovated. Current research facilities are inadequate to support
research and research training activities conducted by faculty and students.
Poor environmental control in rooms often jeopardizes the integrity of
experiments, and the lack of ample electrical service overloads circuits.
Because the building has never been remodeled, much of the facility does not
meet electrical and plumbing codes. The plumbing system does not have backflow
protection and many of the research laboratories are not equipped for the
delivery of distilled water. Installation of fixed equipment such as fume hoods
and reinforced cabinets, provide for the capability of storing hazardous
chemicals, mandated for a safe working atmosphere. Improvements to air quality
and climate control will enhance the ability to do research in a controlled
environment and will eliminate much loss of time and experiments due to
contamination. In addition to providing a better and safer area for faculty to
pursue their research, upgrading of these facilities will increase the number of
students, giving them more access to research training.
