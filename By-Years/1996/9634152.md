This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
focusses on characterizing semiconductor/liquid interfaces created at silicon
surfaces by covalently attaching moieties directly to silicon without an
intervening oxide bridge. Professor Nathan S. Lewis and his students of the
Department of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology will employ
voltammetric, microwave conductivity, and differential capacitance methods to
characterize the electron transfer and photochemical properties of these
interfaces that are not complicated by the presence of an oxide bridge. This
project aims to understand the fundamentals of how electron transfer can be
controlled at these modified silicon semiconductor/liquid interfaces. Silicon is
the fundamental building block for constructing semiconductor devices. Despite
its common use for such applications its electron transfer properties remain
poorly understood. This research group, led by Professor Nathan S. Lewis at the
California Institute of Technology, is making seminal contributions to the
understanding of the properties of semiconductor/liquid interfaces such as the
dependence of electron transfer rate on distance. This project uses unique
chemistry to assess such properties of the semiconductor/liquid interface. The
utility of this project lies in its potential for many practical applications in
solar energy conversion.
