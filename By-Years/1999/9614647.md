This collaborative study is aimed at understanding the evolution of the
lithosphere of the Rocky Mountain transect in the North American southwest. This
transect is located at the juncture of two globally-unique tectonic regimes,
each of fundamental importance for understanding continental tectonics and
together representing an outstanding field laboratory for studies of continental
lithosphere. First, a 1000 km wide juvenile Proterozoic orogenic belt records
rapid accretion of continental materials from mantle sources and their assembly
to southern Laurentia along NE-trending boundaries between 1.8 and 1.6 Ga.
Second, the present high elevation of the SW in general and the Rocky Mountains
in particular is the manifestation of Laramide, Tertiary, and still ongoing
modification of Proterozoic Lithosphere that has resulted in a wide NW-trending
mantle boundary zone between old, cold, high velocity mantle in the western U.S.
By examining the present-day lithospheric structure across ancient boundaries,
the PIs hope to better understand the interplay between "active" and "passive"
processes during lithospheric evolution.

Their principal hypothesis is that lithospheric structures produced during
assembly of the southwestern U.S. have profoundly influenced physical and
chemical modification of the continental lithosphere during all subsequent
magmatic and tectonic events, including those related to the ongoing
reorganization of small-scale asthenosphere. To test this hypothesis, they
propose an integrated set of multi-scale experiments using state of the art
geophysical, geological and geochemical techniques that, together, are designed
to decipher lithosphere structure and evolution, and processes of lithosphere
formation and deformation. ***
