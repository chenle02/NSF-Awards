ISSAC is the premier annual conference of the computer algebra community.
Developing a symbolic computation system raises many interesting theoretical
issues in both computer science and mathematics, and the ISSAC conferences have
traditionally been a meeting ground for implementors and theoreticians.
Furthermore, as symbolic computation systems have become more sophisticated,
their users have responded by employing them in more complex ways. The ISSAC
meetings have provided a scientific forum for beneficial interaction between the
designers of symbolic systems and the users of them. So not only are the
theoretical computer scientists and systems implementors present, but so are
very mathematically sophisticated physicists, engineers, astrophysicists,
geophysicists, and other mathematical scientists. This grant is to support the
travel of American students and researchers to participate in this conference.
