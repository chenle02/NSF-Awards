Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0414433&lt;br/&gt;Peter Chang&lt;br/&gt;Univ
Maryland/College Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international conference
emphasizing on the state of the arts research of earthquake engineering and its
transformation to technology-dependent research and center and network based
research is organized in Nanjing, China in October 2004. This travel grant will
support approximately 15 US researchers, including student, young and under-
represented group members and US-PRC Earthquake Protocol Program grantees to
attend the conference. The conference is expected to lead to collaborative
research between US and PRC researchers in the areas of earthquake engineering,
structural health monitoring, sensors technology, and structural control.
Technology transfer through test-beds, exchange of research data and training of
students and researchers across the borders is also likely.&lt;br/&gt;
