This is a collaborative project between the University of Oklahoma and Colby
College. The award funds conferences that will be held in Oklahoma and Maine.
The goal of the conferences is to develop new research collaborations for US
scholars, including international collaborations. The conferences will focus on
auction economics and network economics. The conferences will stimulate new
ideas in these areas of economics. Speakers who adopt different methodological
approaches will be invited. The conference organizers will target researchers
from other EPSCoR states for participation, including researchers from
institutions in Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Hampshire, and Vermont.
Students will also participate and present their research in student-focused
sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific topics include (i) Structural
econometrics of auctions and networks; (2) The use of lab and field experiments
in the study of auctions and bargaining; (3) Applications of auctions to a range
of settings, including government procurement, charity auctions, environmental
auctions, and multi-unit auctions; modeling discrete strategic actions,
especially entry behavior in auctions; (5) Public policy issues in auction
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
