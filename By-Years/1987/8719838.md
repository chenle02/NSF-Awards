"Mesoscale Cloud Systems and Their Effects on Larger Scales of Motion" Many of
the factors that are critical for understanding and predicting weather that is
disruptive to human activity occur on what meteorologists term the mesoscale.
Mesoscale phenomena are not well sampled by the operational weather network;
therefore, progress is made through episodic field experiments specifically
designed to study mesoscale processes. The principal investigator will study a
broad range of mesoscale problems using data collected during NSF sponsored
research programs. Numerical models of the convective and stratiform regions of
mesoscale convective systems will be applied to and tested on analyzed data sets
collected during the Global Atmospheric Research Program's Atlantic Tropical
Experiment (GATE) and the Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional Experiment for
STORM-Central (PRE-STORM: STORM stands for Stormscale Operational and Research
Meteorology). Multiple Doppler derived wind fields of mesoscale convective
systems observed during the PRE-STORM and of Hurricane Norbert will be
constructed and used for quantitative diagnostic studies of the budgets of
water, heat, momentum and wind circulation. The vertical distribution of
momentum, wind circulation and large-scale environmental heating associated with
these storm systems will be estimated from this data. Such calculations are of
great importance to mesoscale research since the effect of these mesoscale
systems on the larger scale circulation is an unknown energy transfer mechanism
which is of great importance in controlling the weather.
