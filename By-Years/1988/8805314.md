Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Chemistry Department of
the University of California, Irvine to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.
The areas of research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1)
Transition metal organometallic chemistry 2) Structural chemistry of
oligosaccharides 3) Total synthesis of steroids, alkaloids, neurotoxins,
antibiotics, and marine natural products 4) Fundamental studies of ion-solvent
interactions 5) Organolanthanide and organoyttrium chemistry 6) Chemistry of
oligomellasilsequioxanes
