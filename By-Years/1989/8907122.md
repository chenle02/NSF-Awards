This research will address several questions: 1. How can one determine that an
agent does or does not know a particular fact in a non-monotonic inference
system? 2. How does the scope of an agent's reasoning affect the conclusions
that can be reached? The work will build upon previous results on
autocircumscription in non-monotonic reasoning. Both issues (ignorance
assessment and scope/counter examples) will be further tested within a large
knowledge base.
