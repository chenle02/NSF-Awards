The research aims to develop a chip-package co-design methodology using System
on a Chip and System on a Package technologies. This is necessary to span
multiple domains both in technology and circuitry in integrated RF microsystems.
These systems include RF, analog and digital circuits and are sensitive to the
constraints imposed by each domain on the other domains and the package. Most
systems are currently being designed in CMOS technology and are driven by the
requirements of the digital domain. This research will be conducted in three
phases. In the first phase of this project, limits of RF circuit performance
will be investigated. The constraints of the digital physical design environment
on Rf circuit design will also be examined. In the second phase, emerging
technologies such as Copper metal layers and deposition of Ferrite material will
be studied for RF passive components, and compared with standard Al metal
technology. In the third phase, a co-design methodology will be developed for
the chip and the package, that includes component optimization, floor planning
and routing. The developed methodology will be used on a test bed that will be
fabricated and tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RIT collaboration with Georgia
Tech brings expertise in microsystems science and engineering together with
design, modeling and characterization of electronic packaging. Graduate students
and undergraduates will benefit from the breadth of the research collaboration
that includes the synthesis of chip design and packaging, and the advances in
integrated RF microsystems&lt;br/&gt;
