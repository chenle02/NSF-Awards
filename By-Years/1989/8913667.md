This research is on symbolic simulation as a basis for formally verifying
complex IC designs. Symbolic simulation differs from classical simulation in
that during simulator operation the user can set inputs not only to 0 or 1 but
also to Boolean variables. The research exploits existing simulation technology
by taking a behavioral approach to circuit verification. In this, the verifier
applies logic simulation to compute the circuit's response to a series of
stimuli chosen to detect all possible design errors. Research tasks include:
selecting a set of simulation patterns which can defeat a malicious adversary
attempting to foil the verifier; determining structures and algorithms, based on
binary decision diagrams, for manipulating Boolean formulas; and investigating
the use of the simulation system as an aid to debugging and design.
