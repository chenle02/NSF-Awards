The objective of this project is the study of states that lead to turbulence in
buoyancy-driven flows. The competition between dissipation (viscosity or
conduction) and forces caused by gradients of thermodynamic variables
(temperature or concentration) drives the system away from equilibrium and
creates spatial and temporal patterns (bifurcations). Attention is focused on
two classes of two-component systems: fluid-saturated packed beds and non-
reacting binary fluids. Driven dissipative two-component fluid systems are most
frequently encountered in nature or in modern technological applications of the
physical and chemical sciences and are associated with energy production and
transport. The investigation hinges on the assumption of two-dimensional models
of convection. Such models are not only simple, they are realistic as well. The
project consists of two tasks: (1) studying the fundamentals of fluid convection
in coarse packed beds by performing stability analysis (Problem interstitial
circulation on a parallel computer (Problem numerically investigating onset and
pattern formation during natural convection in thin annuli filled with mixtures
of binary fluids (Problem
