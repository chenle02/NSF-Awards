The primary objective of this research is to characterize the mRNA population of
aged pea epicotyls before and after wounding, as a prerequisite to understanding
the molecular basis by which plants respond to this pervasive stress. The
hypothesis to be tested suggests that wounding causes disruption of the plasma
membrane, thereby permitting a transient influx of calcium. Either directly or
indirectly calcium than activates some genes, including genes involved in
ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene turns on different genes, including perhaps
genes encoding polysaccaridases which cleave oligosaccharins (elicitors) from
cell walls, thereby activating yet another set of genes. Wounding constitutes
one of the most pervasive of the stresses to which plants are subjected and is
caused by physical factors such as wind and hail, and by biological agents such
as large herbivores, insects and fungi. Since wounding by pathogens is such a
widespread phenomenon, an understanding of plants' responses to this stress
would provide the baseline information common to all injurious pathogens, such
that the responses specific to pathogenicity could be more clearly identified.
Wounding is also performed, albeit unwittingly, in conventional research,
especially in attempts to facilitate uptake of exogenous compounds. Results
found here might determine how misleading such protocols are.
