Integration of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy into the chemistry
curriculum at Marian College provides students with an opportunity to put NMR
principles into practice through "hands-on" experience, in class projects and in
independent research. The use of NMR spectroscopy in Organic Chemistry, Organic
Qualitative Analysis, Physical Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis and Independent
Research complements student use of infrared and ultraviolet-visible
spectroscopy, chromatographic techniques and electrochemical applications.
