The goal of the NSF Young Scholars Pacific Region Program (PRP) is to increase
the knowledge of 25 high ability high school students in the careers, philosophy
and ethics, and problem solving methodologies in the mathematical, physical,
biological, engineering, and social sciences as they relate to agriculture.
Participants will consists of students entering grades 10, 11, or 12 in Hawaii,
American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas.
A special effort will be made to recruit students who are female, handicapped
and of Filipino, Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander ancestries; the goal is
75% ethnic minority participants. A curriculum which emphasizes experimental
learning and offers variety, independence, and guided discovery in knowledge
building will be provided to participants. The PRP will include both a 6-week
summer residential program and follow-up activities. The summer program will
consist of four inter-related learning experiences: case studies; group
experiences; field experiences; and independent projects. Students will be
housed in University of Hawaii dormitories. Follow up activities will take the
form of research projects under the guidance of a scientific advisor. These will
be presented at a PRP forum held during the academic year and show-cased in
science fairs, symposiums, publications, and other forums.
