Time of flight and single photon counting techniques are employed to
investigate energy pathways in noble gases excited with short bursts of alpha
particles generated from an Am 241 source. Of particular interest in this study
is the Kr.Xe system and the heteronuclear molecule that radiates at 5,000 A.o.
Spectroscopic studies will be made from the far ultra.violet into the near
infra.red region for all binary noble gas mixtures and the noble gas.monohalide
mixtures.
