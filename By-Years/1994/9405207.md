9405207 Maples In this renewal, PIs will continue and expand research on Chinese
echinoderm fossils, with a goal to understand echinoderm biogeography and
evolution in the aftermath of Late Devonian extinction event(s) leading to the
Carboniferous echinoderm diversification. Work will also contribute to
paleoclimatic and paleogeographic analyses, augmented by comparative studies of
related faunas from Europe.
