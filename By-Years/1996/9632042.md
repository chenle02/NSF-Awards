9632042 Kovacevic This GOALI/Graduate Student in Industry award will support two
graduate students as they explore gas turbine efficiency improvements made by
innovations in fine hole laser drilling. The amount of compressed air needed to
cool turbine blades can be reduced with precise and accurate control of size,
shape and orientation of the small film cooling holes on the turbine blade.
Pratt and Whitney and Control Vision are the industrial collaborators on this
award. The graduate students will be in residence at Pratt and Whitney for the
experimental work, using a newly developed industrial vision system provided by
Control Vision for sensing in the laser drilling process. They will investigate
H-infinity adaptive control methods and Mu-synthesis robust control designs for
the laser drilling process, using vision feedback of the hole size and shape.
This technical approach is a high pay-off opportunity. Predictions are that with
these improvements in precision hole making technology it may be possible to
improve gas turbine efficiency by 0.5% without changing the turbine design. This
precise control of fine hole making has many other manufacturing applications.
