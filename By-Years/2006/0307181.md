This proposal is concerned with the study of a class of &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear
differential equations arising in such diverse &lt;br/&gt;areas as fluid
dynamics, cosmology, topological quantum &lt;br/&gt;field theory as well as
theory of automorphic functions. &lt;br/&gt;These equations admit a large family
of solutions in terms &lt;br/&gt;of modular forms and exhibit novel singularites
in the &lt;br/&gt;form of movable natural boundaries in the complex domain.
&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to characterize the
&lt;br/&gt;complex dynamics of these nonlinear systems by analyzing
&lt;br/&gt;their general solutions, symmetries and singularity
structures&lt;br/&gt;in the complex plane. Various algebraic and geometric
methods&lt;br/&gt;akin to the theory of completely integrable systems will be
&lt;br/&gt;employed to carry out the proposed
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear differential equations are well known to
have &lt;br/&gt;important applications in the modeling of complex physical
&lt;br/&gt;phenomena arising in many areas of science and technology.
&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is aimed to investigate the general solutions
&lt;br/&gt;to a class of nonlinear differential equations, thereby shedding
&lt;br/&gt;more light on the properties of the underlying physical systems
&lt;br/&gt;described by these equations. The project will also explore
&lt;br/&gt;the connection between these nonlinear equations and the theory
&lt;br/&gt;of automorphic functions which traditionally arises in areas of
&lt;br/&gt;pure mathematics such as number theory. The proposed research
&lt;br/&gt;activities will be carried out in a primarily undergraduate
&lt;br/&gt;institution. It is strongly anticipated that the proposed research
&lt;br/&gt;will lead to undergraduate projects in several areas including
&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear waves, dynamical systems, special functions and conformal
&lt;br/&gt;mapping, all of which have wide ranging physical applications.
