This award to the Quality Education for Minorities will provide technical
assistance to junior science and engineering faculty at minority-serving
institutions and eligible underrepresented minority faculty to facilitate
successful participation in the NSF's Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)
Program, underscoring the NSF?s Career-Life Balance initiative. Under-
represented faculty in STEM have an essential role in the production of
baccalaureate degree recipients of under-represented groups in STEM disciplines
as well as in the disproportionate production of minority college graduates who
pursue graduate degrees. In addition, the project will assist in the promotion
of the NSF's Career-Life Balance Initiative in an effort to retain, advance and
support the early careers of women of color in the STEM workforce. Consequently
there will be the broadening of participation, and enhancing diversity within
the Foundation's programs as well as address key quality of life issues to aid
in the recruitment and retention of early career faculty.
