This proposal is to develop a new method of analysis for non-synchronous
automatic assembly systems. This method utilizes recent advances in queuing
theory and is based on a series of approximations developed in the theory of
queues. This advanced technique is very promising for the application proposed
in this research, however substantial modification will be required to produce a
practical engineering method. This proposal will develop these modifications
and,in particular, will develop the necessary methods to analyze circular
assembly systems. Extensive experiments using real industry data will be
conducted to verify the new approach. Methods will be system, to generate
thermal property data for use in the casting solidification simulation software,
to investigate high efficiency computational techniques, and to investigate heat
flux control during solidification by means of heat pipe devices. Analytical and
experimental methods will be employed. The results of the proposed research
should provide useful methodology and software for an important U.S. industry,
i.e. the foundry industry, and should contribute to improved efficiency and
quality in castings manufacturing. The work complements joint research to be
conducted at another university (University of Michigan).
