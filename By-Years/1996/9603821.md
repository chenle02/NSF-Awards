9603821 Meyerowitz Technical This research is directed toward revealing the
genetic and molecular mechanisms by which Arabidopsis flowers develop. The
experiments are divided into two areas. The first area is to understand the
regulation and function of the floral organ identity genes APETALA3 and
PISTILLATA. The genes code for MADS-box DNA-binding proteins, and the proteins
bind DNA as a heterodimer. The research is: to find the genes that specify the
initial expression pattern of the two genes, which will be done by mutagenesis
of transgenic lines that will give novel phenotypes if either MADS-box gene is
ectopically activated; and to find the downstream genes activated or repressed
by the AP3/PI heterodimer by use of differential display-RT-PCR methods. The
second area is to derive a general model for the control of pattern of cell
division in shoot and floral meristems. This will be done by the molecular
cloning of the CLAVATA1, CLAVATA3 and WIGGUM genes. Non-technical An unanswered
question in the genetic analysis of development is that of pattern formation:
How does a collection of equivalent cells such as a plant flower primordium or a
vertebrate limb bud become spatially organized, so that it develops into a
highly patterned collection of different cell types? At least two processes are
involved: patterned cellular differentiation, to give the final pattern of cell
types, and patterned cell division, to give the appropriate size and shape to
the mature structure. Flowers provide a particularly good example of these
aspects of pattern formation; flowers usually have a stereotyped pattern of
organ types: sepals, petals, stamens, and central carpels. Many flowers also
have defined numbers of each of these organ types. The flower of Arabidopsis
thaliana plants, for example, has four sepals spaced evenly around the floral
periphery, four petals interior to and alternate with the sepals, six stamens,
and a compound ovary of two carpels. The experiments described here will reveal
some of the cellular mechanisms by which cells are directed to divide in
appropriate patterns in developing flowers, and by which they are instructed to
differentiate into appropriate cell types for their positions. If they succeed,
the research will result in new genetic and molecular models for the spatial
control of organ identity, and for the spatial patterning of cell divisions in
plant pattern formation. These models will, in turn, reveal the genetic
principles of plant development, and will, in the future, enable experimental
control of plant development.
