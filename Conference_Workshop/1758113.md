The Texas/Oklahoma Research Undergraduate Symposium (TORUS) will be held on
February 10, 2018, at Midwestern State University. Subsequent symposia will be
held in February 2019 at Southern Nazarene University and February 2020 at
Cameron University. TORUS is an annual one-day conference that has been held
since 2005 at different universities in the Texas and Oklahoma Region. It
provides opportunities for undergraduates interested in the study of mathematics
to participate in scholarly and social activities in mathematics with other
colleges and universities with the goal of encouraging students to pursue
graduate study and careers in mathematics. TORUS also helps strengthen
connections between undergraduate-focused universities in the Texas/Oklahoma
region and encourage faculty at these universities to pursue research projects
with undergraduate students.

Each symposium includes two invited talks, student presentations, a panel
discussion, and Math Jeopardy. In addition, students will have the opportunity
to share the results of their research (for example, a paper or poster) with a
broader audience on the conference website. The conference website is
http://homepages.se.edu/torus/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
