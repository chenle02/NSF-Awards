This award will partially support a three-day workshop on Earth System Science
Education (ESSE) in November, 2009. The discussions will focus on four major
challenges that ESSE faces: poor perception of ESSE in K12 systems, inadequate
preparation of ESS teachers, outdated and incomplete of standards for ESSE, and
competition of ESS with different K12 curricula reform projects. The report
resulting from this workshop will include: (1) articulation of challenges of
ESSE; (2) identification initiatives, roles, and players needed to address the
different challenges; (3) naming of groups across organizations to work on
specific projects; (4) identification resources to carry out projects that
address the challenges; (5) plan for regular participation of the US in the
International Earth Science Olympiad. It is expected that the meeting will have
about 60 participants representing a wide range of organizations (e.g.
professional societies, federal agencies, universities, school districts, and
nonprofit organizations).
