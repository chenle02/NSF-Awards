This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Dr. Wenfang Sun of North Dakota State University to design
new optical materials based on transition metal acetylide complexes. The
synthetic component of the work includes d-8 transition metal terdentate
acetylide complexes, binuclear bis (terdentate) complexes, transition metal
dyads and triads assembled with expanded porphyrins, transition metal complex-
nanoparticle composites, and transition metal terdentate dendrimers. These
unique materials will be studied via photophysical studies, degenerate four-
phase mixing, Z-scan and non-linear optical techniques and theoretical modeling.
The overall goal of the work is to understand how the change in molecular
structure influences the photophysical parameters and the non-linear optical
properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the optical materials that will
be developed, this project also supports a range of activities that integrate
research and education, including the development of a new graduate course at
NDSU on optical materials and improved public understanding of photonic
technologies.
