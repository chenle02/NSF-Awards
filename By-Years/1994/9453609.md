Title: Production of Prototype Guidebooks for Designing Year-Long Integrative
System of Pedagogy Seminars and Non-Teaching CO-OP Experience as Components of
Teacher Education Programs Two guidebooks are being produced which lay out
principals for developing and implementing the following two components of a
teacher preparation program: (1) a system of year-long pedagogy seminars
commencing with the freshman year and held annually through the senior year for
interactively introducing students to the precollege teaching profession, and
(2) a non-teaching cooperative education experience for each student in a
industrial or other non-classroom site which is related to the area of
certification pursued. Drexel is planning, designing, and producing two
guidebooks entitled: (1) Guide for Year-long Integrative Pedagogy Seminars:
Early Introduction into the K-12 Teaching Profession, and (2) Guide for
Integrating a non-Teaching CO-OP Experience into Teacher Preparation. These
guidebooks are being disseminated to interested parties with follow-up
electronic feedback made available.
