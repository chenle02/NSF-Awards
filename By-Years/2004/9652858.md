In this project, we are gathering information about the workplace environments
where physics-educated individuals are employed. The study has two parts. First,
an "onsite" study based on journals kept by physicists in the workplace. Second,
a survey of a particular cohort of physicists in the workplace, namely, those
individuals five years after graduation. The results will be published and
disseminated.
