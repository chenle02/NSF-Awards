This grant is to purchase a Laser-Induced Fluorescence System (LIFS) which will
be used in Thermal Plasma Processing studies. The simultaneous detection of two
signals originating from two different excited states provides a knowledge of
the concentrations of a number of important chemical species in space and time.
This is vital to the identification of the reactions which control plasma
processes. The accurate knowledge of the thermal state of plasmas in arbitrary
design conditions does help in the search for optimal geometries or modes of
operation. A large number of industrial processes depend on high temperature
plasmas; they stand to be improved if the plasma processes are better known and
predictive methods become available.
