The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, with co-funding from the Molecular
and Cellular Biosciences Genes and Genome Systems Cluster, supports Prof.
Patrick Limbach at the University of Cincinnati for work targeting a mass
spectrometry-based approach to higher throughput sequencing of transfer
ribonucleic acids (tRNAs). Many types of RNAs are involved in key cellular
functions in all living cells. Among all known bio-organic molecules within
living cells, RNA molecules are the only ones that store genetic information and
act as catalysts. In the course of this research, Dr. Limbach and his group will
establish new methods to fractionate mixtures of tRNAs; will develop a strategy
for tRNA enrichment allowing rare tRNAs to be expressed and sequenced; will use
a combination of normal and limited RNase digestion for increasing tRNA
sequencing read length; and will enhance the RNA database of signature digestion
products. The project will provide researchers with additional tools that can
examine transcription and translation processes, complementing existing genomic
and proteomic strategies. These developments will provide enabling advances for
RNA researchers and can be translated to related areas of nucleic acid analysis
(e.g., xenobiotic modifications).

In addition to the technical impacts outlined above, the work offers broader
impacts by providing students with education and training in key areas of
biological mass spectrometry. Dr. Limbach strives to expand the number of
underrepresented minorities engaged in science in general, and mass spectrometry
in particular.
