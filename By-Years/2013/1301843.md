This award supports research on photonuclear reactions with polarized beams and
targets to investigate the properties of the nucleon and nucleon resonances with
Compton scattering and to study heavy nuclei through photofission. In addition,
we play a key role in the production of the HD targets used at Jefferson Lab
(JLab).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HIGS (High Intensity Gamma Source) facility at
Duke University is ideal for Compton scattering from both polarized and
unpolarized nucleon and nuclear targets. A comprehensive program of Compton
scattering is beginning in the fall of 2013 on the proton and neutron, which
will extract the electromagnetic polarizabilities with high accuracy. The
ongoing program of photofission studies with polarized photons exploits the
strong variation of the beam asymmetry in direct neutron production both with
beam energy and with target. The proposed measurements provide a database for
developing nuclear forensics and expand our understanding of this fundamental
nuclear reaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The frozen spin HD target (HDIce) will be
used in three "A" rated experiments at JLab after the facility upgrade. The high
purity gas used in all these targets will be purified at JMU. Commercial gas
that is 98% HD is distilled at low temperature to separate the remaining H2 and
D2 and produce gas for making targets with very long spin relaxation times.
Recent upgrades to the distillery permit the production of gas with H2 and D2
impurities much lower than previously obtained leading to higher quality targets
for the next round of experiments. Existing gas stores are sufficient to produce
the required gas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be involved
in all aspects of this research and will gain experience in nuclear experiments
and detectors, data analysis, and applications of nuclear physics.
