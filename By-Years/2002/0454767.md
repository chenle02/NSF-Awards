The North Dakota State University World Wide Web Instructional Committee (WWWIC)
is funded to develop two multiuser, interactive virtual environments (IVEs) --
the "Geology Explorer" (where students land on a foreign planet to identify
rocks and minerals, and build models of geologic structure), and "On-a-Slant" (a
virtual reconstruction of a Native American earth lodge village that students
explore while learning archeology and anthropology). The former has been used in
college level courses and will be adapted to secondary schools; the latter is a
new environment under development for the same level. IVEs have been rigorously
studied with college level students and the results indicate that IVE students
perform higher on various assessments than those exposed to a more traditional
instructional approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three explicit
goals. They are to alter or construct the IVEs to be age-appropriate for 6-12
grade level students by increasing scaffolding and intelligent software tutor
capabilities and providing embedded assessment tools; to design standards-based
curricula supplementing for both IVEs for middle school and high school
classrooms; and to develop a series of online workshops designed to train
secondary teachers on the IVE software, familiarize them with the curriculum
materials and provide a forum for the exchange of ideas for additional lesson
plans and/or software adaptations.&lt;br/&gt;
