This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of nonlinear spectroscopy. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Wright and his students will investigate the utility
of non-degenerate multi-wave mixing spectroscopies for new mode-selective and
component-selective analyses. Mode selection is achieved by using multiple
lasers to enhance spectroscopic transitions of molecules that are coupled to
fixed vibrational resonances. Spectral line narrowing and component selection
results from enhancing spectroscopic transitions of molecules that are coupled
to fixed electronic resonances. This research extends Professor Wright's
previous four-wave mixing investigations into the infrared, including the
fingerprint region, where selective spectral enhancement of specific conformers
will be explored. The feasibility of six-wave mixing techniques that have
potential for the selective enhancement of specific Raman transitions will also
be investigated. %%% This research lays the groundwork for the development of
new analytical spectroscopic probes for complex chemical and biological systems.
