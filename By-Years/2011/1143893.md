A group of three principal investigators will undertake a holistic study of
prospects of nano-photonic interconnects in the context of integration with
silicon technologies for improved computational speed, latency and lower power
dissipation. An unique aspect of the project is that the PIs come from different
backgrounds, namely photonic devices and computer architecture, and an
integrated design methodology that will exploit feedback from devices to
architectures will be central to this high-risk project with potential for large
payoff. Specifically, this project will examine thermal sensitivities of nano-
photonic devices and study its influence on computing architectures making use
of optical interconnects. Conversely, the requirements imposed by architectural
considerations on the device technology will be studied as well.

The potential broader impact of the project is largely technological. If
successful, t has the potential to revolutionize the interconnect technology,
which is one of the major bottlenecks in further progress of large scale
computer hardware design today. Nevertheless, the PIs also plan to disseminate
the results of their findings through workshops and class room efforts and to
include women and underrepresented groups in their activities, which should
enhance the broader impact of the project.
