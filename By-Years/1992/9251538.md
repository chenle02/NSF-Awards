This project will permit the acquisition of the equipment and software necessary
to implement the use of advanced Engineering Design Graphics tools throughout
the Civil Engineering curriculum. These second generation tools integrate design
drafting and analytical engineering. They are defined as modern Engineering
Design Graphics (EDG) tools. These tools allow designers to draw three-
dimensional models of their designs and then conduct complicated analyses on
those models using automated routines that are available within the Computer
Aided Engineering software package. Undergraduate engineering students use EDG
tools and employ the EDG tools as the focal point for collaborative learning
exercises throughout the four- year curriculum. Freshmen are taught the
mechanics of using the tools in a new course, Modern Computer Graphics. They
then apply their modeling skills in other classes throughout the balance of
their work at the school. Seven additional courses are enhanced with experiments
and demonstrations using the new equipment. In a senior-level systems design
course, the new tools serve as the focal point for a semester-long exercise in
collaborative learning.
