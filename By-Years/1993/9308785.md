The primary objective of this US-Czech Joint Fund research project between Dr.
Petr Carsky, Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry,
Czech Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Josef Michl, University of Colorado-Boulder,
is to study intensities in vibrational and electron energy loss spectroscopy
(EELS) of a variety of molecules. The US side will contribute experimental data
and computing facilities; the Czech side will provide expertise in fundamental
theory and ab initio program development. Results should yield important
insights into the electronic structures of molecules including diatomics and
such hydrocarbons as benzene. This research in theoretical chemistry fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the U.S. and Czech Republic to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Funds for
the project are awarded through the US-Czech Joint Fund, Prague, in accordance
with established guidelines.
