Tiospaye in Science is a scholarship program that aims to increase the number of
American Indian students graduating from the South Dakota School of Mines and
Technology (SDSMT) with bachelor's degrees in science. The targeted degree
programs are chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, and
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiospaye is a Lakota word meaning 'extended
family'; in this scholarship program, the extended family of science supports
American Indian students in their academic, professional, cultural, and social
activities. The financial support through the scholarships in combination with
the web of support facilitated through one-on-one and one-on-small group contact
with the science extended family serve as strong anchors to increase the
pathways to success for American Indian students in science. The science
extended family includes the scholarship recipients as well as the other
students, staff, faculty, administrators, alumni/alumnae, employers, the
community, student family members, tribal members, and tribal college partners -
most notably Oglala Lakota College. Tiospaye in Science also partners with
Tiospaye in Engineering, another scholarship program at
SDSMT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through Tiospaye in Science, fifteen scholarships
are being awarded to academically talented and financially needy students with a
special emphasis on recruiting Native Americans that are members of federally
recognized tribes, graduates of tribal high schools, or transfers from tribal
colleges or universities. To ensure success for scholarship recipients, the
program:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1. Recruits academically talented students with
financial need and a commitment to a science career. &lt;br/&gt; 2. Retains
these students in an environment that promotes academic and professional
success, while supporting the students socially and in their cultural
traditions.&lt;br/&gt; 3. Places these students in appropriate employment or
further education through programs emphasizing career planning and professional
options.
