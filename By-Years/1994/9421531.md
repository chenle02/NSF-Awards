9421531 Salzberg This award is to purchase equipment to be used for three
distinct research projects. The first project focuses on computational biology,
especially on distinguishing exons and introns in raw DNA sequence data using
statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. This project will also
study algorithms for searching protein sequence databases to find fundamental
building blocks called motifs. The second project is a continuation and
extension of previous work on analysis of very large databases of astronomical
images from the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes. The
development of automated classifiers to these databases is crucial for the
success of astronomical sky surveys, in which data on hundreds of millions of
celestial objects needs to be collected and classified in real time. In the
third project, the research group will develop distributed versions of their
corpus-based language learning algorithms, which will allow them to run many
more experiments and to make much more rapid progress in this research area. The
algorithms under development, which are computationally intensive, automatically
acquire linguistic information from large text corpora, instead of having people
manually input this information based upon their linguistic intuitions.
