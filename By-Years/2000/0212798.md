Understanding quantitatively how environmental changes cause selection and
evolution is a fundamental challenge for evolutionary biology. We are now in a
position to address a variety of fundamental questions about how changes in
weather and climate determine selection and evolution. Is selection in the field
primarily due to infrequent exposures to extreme (hot or cold) temperatures, or
is the frequency of average temperature conditions more important? How does
geographic variation in the thermal environment generate differences in
selection and evolutionary divergence in traits of organisms that depend on
temperature? Can we predict quantitatively how alterations in the thermal
environment, such as those due to climate warming, will alter selection and
evolutionary responses? To address these questions, the proposed studies will
use laboratory and field experiments to test predictions of a quantitative,
mathematical model describing selection and evolution. Our studies use
temperature effects on growth rate in Pieris rapae (Imported Cabbageworm)
caterpillars as a model system; this species has experienced a world-wide
expansion of its geographic range during the past 200 years, and is now an
important agricultural pest in some regions.
