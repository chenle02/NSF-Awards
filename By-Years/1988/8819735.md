Working in collaboration with local scholars, Dr. Tim White will conduct a
large-scale, on the ground survey of areas within the Rift Valley region of
Ethiopia. The goal of the project is to locate promising sites for
paleoanthropological and paleontological research. The survey approach is
stratified, employing satellite imagery, aerial photography, and light aircraft
reconnaissance to locate areas of potential significance. These will then be
explored in more detail through vehicle and foot survey and yield data on
geological, archaeological, and paleontological resources. A first year
reconnaissance has revealed several fossiliferous sites of Plio- Pleistocene
age. Ethiopia is one of the most promising areas in the world for research into
human origins. The small number of Ethiopian sites discovered to date have been
instrumental in providing material evidence for vertebrate evolution and human
origins. Deposits yet to be adequately explored contain sediments which document
the late Miocene period; others, yet undiscovered, likely exist. A variety of
evidence suggests that humans first appeared during this interval yet, because
of the rarity of fossil bearing deposits, almost no remains have been recovered.
This research will, hopefully, help to fill this gap. This research is important
for several reasons. In addition to the site inventory which Dr. White and his
colleagues will produce, it will assist in the training of African scientists.
It should also serve to strengthen paleoanthropological ties between the U.S.
and Ethiopia and help establish mechanisms which will facilitate American work
in this country.
