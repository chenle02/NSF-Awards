*** 96-61204 Keicher This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is an extension of current rapid prototyping technology. Rapid
prototyping systems allow manufacturers to reduce design cycle time by producing
prototype plastic parts directly from computer generated designs. A related
emerging technology, the Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) process, currently
being developed at Sandia National Laboratories, has produced near-net-shape
functional parts directly from computer generated designs. Commercial use of
this technology, beyond the military defense applications for which it was
developed, are thought to be possible. Phase will apply this technology to rapid
tooling for injection molds by designing a mold for a simple geometry, producing
the mold using the LENS process, and then using the mold to actually produce a
quantity of plastic parts for evaluation. This technology is thought to have
significant applications for commercial utilization within the tooling industry
due to its potential of saving time and cost in the preparation of tooling
hardware. ***
